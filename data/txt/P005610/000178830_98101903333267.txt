APPRAISAL OF FIRST POWER PROJECT
SOCIETE TUNISIENNE LE L'EI=CRICITE E. DU GAZ (STE
TUNISIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the first power project
for Societe Tunisienne de L'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG) consisting of
two 20 MW gas turbines, transmission and distribution system expansion,
and consulting services for future plant and institutional development
at a total cost of US$16.7 million. The Bank loan would finance the
foreign exchange cost of US$12.0 million or 72% of the Project cost.
ii.       This would be the second Bank loan to STEG. The earlier loan
for a gas pipeline (724-TUN US$7.5 million) was made in February 1971,
in conjunction with a US$2.5 million equivalent loan from the Kurmait
Fund for Arab Economic Development. Progress on the pipeline is satis-
factory.
iii.      The gas pipeline will bring natural gas from El Borna oil wells
where it is at present being flared, to Rhennouch where the Government is
building a new port and industrial center as part of its program to foster
the economic developg-exit of the southern part of the country. The pipeline
was designed to transport the full output of gas from the El Borma fields
and was justified on the assumption that about 95% of the gas would be
used to generate electricitys the remainder would be used by new industries
in Rhennouch.
iv.       STEG now has under construction the Rhenrinouch steam plant (60 MW),
financed by the French Government, and scheduled for completion towards the
end of 1972. The proposed two 20 NW gas turbines would also be located at
Rhennouch. The Project would be needed to meet forecast power demand in
1974; it is the least cost alternative to meet the projected load growth
and would use the remainder of the gas from the gas pipeline. The internal
financial rate of return is about 2h%.
V.        STEG, a government owned corporation, was created in 1962 upon
the nationalization of seven foreign utilities, to take over their assets
and be responsible for all public power and gas service in Tunisia.  SMEG
has successfully amalgamated the physical plant of the original companies
into an integrated power system and overcone the more sterious staffing
problems created by the exodus of expatriate staff. During the past three
years the very able management group, with the advice and assistance of
consultants, restructured and decentralized the organization, improved
the accounting system, billing and collections; introduced budgetary
controls and an internal audit, and has started to review the tariff
structure. Although considerable progress has already been made in over-
coming many of the institutional and organizational problems, STEG is still
a relatively young entity and the proposed loan would help it to continue
this work.



- ii -
vi.       Despite inadequate past records and accounts STEG has, with the
help of consultants and its auditors, achieved a meaningful balance sheet
for 1970, although reservations remain over the valuation of fixed assets.
It is expected, however, that both the 1971 balance sheet and income state-
ment will be fully audited and certified, and that these will record a
satisfactory financial position and year of operation.
vii.      STEG enjoya a favorable debtsequity ratio of 31X69 with its
equity free of interest or dividend requirements and with the bulk of its
debt on concessionary terma. Thia, coupled with a conservative deprecia-
tion policy and adequate tariffs, means that it can achieve a relatively
high cash generation. In the Project construction period STEG io expected
to self finance almost 50% of its capital program.
viii.     STEG's management agrees that its future financial viability will
require an adequate level of earnings and it does not intend to significantly
lower average tariffs. During negotiations STEG agreed to a tariff covenant
which will ensure that the adequate earnings and cash generation presently
foreseen are achieved.
ix.       The Project would be auitable for a loan of US$12.0 million equiva-
lent for a term of 20 years including a 3-yesar period of grace.

TUNISIA.
1. IMTRQ)UCT MN
1.01      The Government owned power entity Societe Tunisienne de
L'Electricite et du Gaz (9TEG) has requested a Bank loan of US$12.0
million equivalent to finance the foreign exchange component of the
next stage of its power system expansion.
1.02      This loan would be the second loan to STEG; the earlier loan
of US$7.5 million Was made in 1971 in conjunction with US$2.5 million
equivalent loan from the Kuwait Fund to finance the 294 km El Bonma -
Rhennouch gas pipeline which has sufficient capacity to transport the
full gas output from the El Borma oil wells. The pipeline was justified
on the assumption that the gas would be used at Rhennouch instead of oil
to fuel thermal electric power plants and two mall industries.
1.03      The present project would consist principally of two 20 W  gas
turbines and would be located near the Rhennouch steam station (60 )W)
now under construction by STEG and financed by the French Government.
The expansion of this generating facility is necessary to meet forecast
increases in power demand in 1974; the gas turbines would uBe the remain-
ing capacity of the gas pipeline referred to above.
1.04      This report is based on the information given in a feasibility
report submitted by STEG (see Annex 1) and the findings of an appraisal
mission composed of Messrs. R.V. Sear and A.J.D. Hutchins which visited
Tunisia in October 1971.

2. THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
General
2.01      Gross Domestic Product (GDP), at factor cost, which was TD111
per capita in 1970, increased between 7% and 8% in 1971 and the Tunisian
Government projects a similar increase in 1972. During this period, agri-
cultural output which represents 15.4% of the GDP is expected to grow by
as much as 13% to 16% per year. Manufacturing which represents 15% of
the GDP is next in importance, and :,roduction is rising by about 10%
yearly.
2.02      The principal foreign exchange source is tourism, which earned
TD29 million in 1970 and is expected to play an even greater role in the
future; oil exports might also rise above the present level of over 3
million metric tons per year if exploration now taking place uncovers
additional reserves. Other principal sources of foreign exchange are
agriculture and phosphate products, and emigrant remittances.
The Power Sector
2.03      The power sector is served principally by STEG which had in 1970
a total generating capacity of 196 NW and supplied 80% of all electric
energy consumed in the country. The only other power sources are about
28 MW of captive plants serving particular industrial or mining entities
which are expected to take an increasing share of their future power require-
ments from STEG.
2.o4      The principal users of electricity are the industrial, mining and
tourist sectors in which 1,250 consumers in 1970 consumed 399 GWh out of
total sales of 577 GWh. The remainder, 178 GWh, was sold to 283,000 domes-
tic and small irrigation customers who had a relatively low annual consump-
tion of 630 kWh per customer. Annexes 2, 3 and 4 give details of sales,
system demand and number of customers.

3. THE BORRMER
3.01      STEG, a government-owned corporation, is responsible for the
production, transmission and distribution of electricity and gas for
public consumption for the entire country. Its principal activity is
the sale of electricity while gas sales account for less than 6% of its
total revenues (see 6.07). STEG was created by decree law 62-8 in April
1962 to take over the operations of seven private utility companies upon
their nationalization.  During its early years, STEG's efforts were con-
centrated on physically integrating the seven separate systems and on
filling the gaps in supervisory and skilled manpower created when the
expatriate personnel of the original companies left Tunisia. During the
past three years STEG has been able to start on a systematic expansion of
the integrated system and turn its attention to matters of organization,
management and finance. The paragraphs which follow discuss these in
more detail.
Management and Organization
3.02      STEG is governed by a board of eight members headed by a
President Director General; all appointed by the President of the Republic.
The management consists of the President Director General, a Deputy Director
General, a Director of Economic Studies and Operations, and a Director of
Finances. Under the new decentralized organizational structure recently
introduced by management, the operations of the entity come under the
general supervision of nine divisions charged with production of electricity
and gas; transmission and distribution; enginieering; finance; commercial
relations; public relations; legal and personnel affairs; procurement;
general services. The country is divided into 13 Districts which operate
the local services. Owing to the relative newness of this structure there
are still improvements and adjustments to be made in its implementation.
STEG's management is aware of this and is continually studying the organ-
ization with the assistance of consultants to make changes when these are
warranted. (See paragraph 4.11 on Consultants.)
Staff
3.03      In its earlier years STEG established a comprehensive training
program to overcome the manpower problem referred to in paragraph 3.01.
Electricite de France (EIF) assisted materially in this program by second-
ing personnel to STEG and conducting training courses in France. This
program was very successful and is now a penmanent part of STEG's activity.
However, STEG presently has a larger total number of employees than it re-
quires and under Loan 724-TUN agreed not to exceed the present level of
3,200 employees through 1975, even though sales are expected to increase
by 5D% during that time.  The training program will aim to improve the
level of skill and efficiency so as to improve productivity of the exist-
ing staff.



- 4 -
3.04     STEG's present salary structure, which is subject to government
control, is characterized by a narrow scale and low salary levels for
skilled manpower, supervisory staff and managemeht. A proposal for a new,
productivity oriented structure has been made to government and is under
review, but this problem is not having any adverue effect on STEG's opera-
tions at the present time.
Accounts
3.05     In contrast to the progress made in the technical and training
fields, the lack of records and qualified manpower caused accounting to
lag significantly behind. One of the principal weaknesses is that the
assets taken over from the original companies are inadequately identified
and their values are uncertain. ElF has seconded a senior accountant to
help and advise STEG, and since 1969 Peat Marwick Mitchell (PMM) has been
engaged in a detailed review of STEG's balance sheets and accounting and
control procedures starting with fiscal year 1969. Accounts prior to
1969 are of little value for comparative purposes and have not been included
in this report. Even the 1969 accounts used for the appraisal of Loan
7214-TUN were materially amended in 1970 as a result of PMM's recommendations.
Neither 1969 nor 1970 accounts are certified by the auditor (PMM), but those
for 1970 substantially reflect STG's real financial position. As a result
of the high degree of cooperation between MTEG and P1K, it is likely that
the 1971 accounts will be audited and certified.
Budget
3.06     In 1970 STEG took steps to reduce operating costs, by improving
its purchasing procedures, by reducing staff through attrition and by
strictly controlling and reducing overtime. A further stage in this
process was achieved with the publication in 1971 of detailed and realistic
capital and operating budgets for 1972, which management intends to follow.
These budgets are also intended as a further step towards improving both
productivity and management control.
Billing and Collections
3.07     STEG's accounts receivable due from the private sector consumers
were slightly reduced during 1970 by the introduction of computerized
billing and control procedures, whereas those from government departments
and govermnent owned autonomous entities increased to an unacceptable
level. During negotiations the Borrower explained that in 1971 STEG had
taken energetic action to reduce these outstandings and, as a result most
of the Government and semigovernment accounts were now on a current basis,
although the problem of arrears prior to 1970 had not yet been settled.
During negotiations the Govermnent agreed (a) that government departments,
local authorities and goverrnment controlled entities would continue to
settle their electricity accounts in accordanoe with normal conunercial
practice and (b) that by mid 1973 arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
would have been reached for the settlement of any accounts then outstanding.



-5-
Tariffs
3.08      STEG has the authority to establish electricity and gas tariffs
but in practice these are subject to government approval. The original
tariff structure consisted of some 98 separate high voltage and low volt-
age tariffs. A preliminary study led to simplifications of this unwieldy
structure which was reduced in January 1970 to 18 tariffs of which two
main tariffs apply to most doaestic customers and the remainder are for
commercial, industrial and medium voltage customers. Because of the
difference in the average tariff for industrial users (US cents 2.36)
and domestic users (US cents 4.75) the gross annual revenue from the two
groups is about equal. The present average revenue per kWh produces sat-
isfactory cash generation but a more detailed tariff study is being made
with the assistance of consultants (ElF) with a view to introducing, early
in 1973, new tariff structures based upon a more equitable sharing of the
cost of producing and delivering power, and giving appropriate incentives
to desired categories of consumers and preferred loads so as to promote
more efficient use of power wherever possible. The study is being under-
taken in accordance with a provision in Loan 724-TUN. It is progressing
satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by mid-1972.
3.09      STEG's financial objective is to generate internally about 50%
of its expansion requirements. It therefore intends to ensure that the
proposed adjustments in the tariff structure will only have a minimal
impact on average revenues.
Existing Facilities
3.10      STEG's power system consists essentially of:
1.   150 MW of steam power plant located in Tunis;
2.   32 MW in 3 hydro plants in the northwest part of the country;
3.   a 15 M  gas turbine in Menzel Bourguiba;
4.   27 MW of diesel plant at 28 isolated locations;
5.   a 150 kV main transmission ring in the center of the country
with secondary branches at 90 kV.
These facilities are shown in the Map and detailed in Annex 5.
STEG's Expansion Program
3.11      The power system expansion program proposed by STEG for the
1971-76 period consists essentially of generating plant additions to
meet forecast system demand, and transmission and distribution line and
substation extensions and improvement to convey the power generated to
the ultimate consumer. STEG also plans to use consulting services to
assist in studies of and improvements to its organization, system planning
operations and rural electrification. The total cost of this six year
program, including the Project, would be TD65.45 million. It is detailed
in Annex 14.



3.12      The Rhennouch steam plant of two 30 MW units now under con-
struction and scheduled for service in October 1972, will be fueled by
the El Borma - Rhennouch gas pipeline. Progress on the construction of
the steam plant and gas pipeline is satisfactory and the completion
date is expected to be met.
3.13      In order to meet forecast system demand from 1974 to 1976,
STEG plans the installation of two gas turbines of about 20 MW each at
a site about 1 km from the Rhennouch steam plant. As en visaged when
the gas pipeline loan was made, the pipe has sufficient capacity to fuel
both the steam plant and the gas turbines. (See 4.02.)
3.14      System studies are being made to determine the alternatives of
generating plant additions after 1975. The final choice will depend to
a considerable extent upon the oil and gas availabilities proven during
the next two years. Considerable exploration is taking place and re-
serves of commercial quantity are expected at several locations both
offshore and inland.
3.15      The transmission system expansion program covers the period
through 1976 and consists of 150 kV and 90 kV line extensions and
associated substations to connect the new generating plants to the load
centers and to reinforce the 150 kV main transmission grid. The present
project would include the 1972-73 portion of this program while the
remainder is being reviewed by the Canadian Government for future financ-
ing. The program is necessary to meet forecast demand.
3.16      The distribution system is being expanded continuously to connect
new customers and meet increasing demand. It is satisfactorily engineered
and economically constructed by STEG a own work force.

4. THE PROJECT
Introduction
4.01      In 1966 oil production started in Tunisia at El Borma with
natural gas being produced in association with the oil. This gas is
being flared because it cannot be utilized commercially or in the oper-
ation of the oil wells. In 1969 STEG investigated the possibility of
utilizing this gas as a fuel for power production. Following a series
of studies it decided to go ahead with the construction of a gas pipe-
line from El Borma to Rhennouch, wnere the Government was planning to
construct a new port and industrial center as part of its plan to promote
the economic development of southern Tunisia. The gas pipeline was to
supply fuel to a chemical industry and a brick factory which were to be
built at the new port and to a steam power plant planned by STEG at the
same site. This power plant is now under construction and scheduled for
service in October 1972.
4.02      The gas pipeline being financed by the Bank (Loan 724-TUN) has
sufficient capacity to deliver the full output of gas from the El Borma
wells of about 300 million m3 per year. As visualized when the gas pipe-
line loan was made, about 5% of the gas would be used for the industrial
requirement at Rhennouch and 95% would be available to operate the two
30 Hi steam plants now under construction plus about 40 NW of new gas
turbine capacity included in the proposed Project. See Chapter 5 for
economic justification of this investment.
4.03      The Bank engaged Gibbs and Hill, U.S.A. as consultants to review
the use of gas turbines for base-load operation and they confirm that,
since the gas is free of elements which would be harmful to gas turbines,
it constitutes an ideal fuel. Similar experience in neighboring countries
has demonstrated that gas turbines can operate satisfactorily under these
conditions.
Description and Cost Estimate
h.o0      The Project would constitute 13.4% of STEG's 1971-76 power ex-
pansion program and would consist of the facilities to be constructed
during 1972-74. The description and estimated cost are as followss

4.05      The gas turbines would be installed near the Rhennouch steam plant.
The estimated cost of the gas turbines is based upon quotations obtained
from major suppliers. The cost of transmission and distribution equipment
is based upon recent costs to STEG for construction now in progress. Phys-
ical contingencies of about 9% have been added to the foreign costs of the
gas turbines, transmission lines and substations and about 2.5% to all the
local costs of the Project. Price escalation has been added of about 11%
of foreign costs excluding consulting fees and 4% of local costs0 These
provisions take into consideration the recent change in US dollar exchange
rates and are considered adequate since the Project is already well defined,
local wage rates are stable and no substantial price changes are expected
during the short construction period.
Disbursement
4.06      The amount of the proposed loan would be US$12.0 million which is
the foreign exchange component of the Project and would not include interest
during construction. It would consist of the CIF cost of imported material



-9-
and equipment, the foreign exchange cost for the erection of plant, and
the foreign exchange cost of consulting services. All local costs would
be borne by STEG out of its own resources. The estimated disbursement
schedule is given in Annex 7. If savings are made in the cost of the
Project, any excess loan funds would be subject to cancellation.
Engineering and Procurement
4.07      The engineering for the Project is being done by STEG's staff
which is competent and has undertaken similar work in the recent past.
STEG's consultants EDF will assist in making a review of the completed
designs and specifications and in advising on specific problems.
4.08      The power plant will be installed by the suppliers of equipnent
under a supply and erect contract. The transmission and distribution system
construction will be partly under supply and erect contracts and partly by
SrEG's own work force. (See 3.16.)
4.09      The procurement of goods financed from the proposed loan would
be by international competitive bidding. NIo payments are expected to be
made before the signing of the loan, but tenders were invited in Jan-
uary 1972 to place orders in time to meet the scheduled in-service date
for the gas turbines, about mid 1973.
Ecological Aspects
4.10      The site for the gas turbines is in the desert on the sea shore
at Rhennouch in southern Tunisia where noise will not be a problem. The
gas is sulphur free and provides an ideal fuel for the gas turbines. It
will not cause any atmospheric pollution. Annex 6 gives the chemical
composition of the gas. The gas turbines are relatively small and would
not creats any measurable thermal pollution of the atmosphere, hence no
ecological problems are anticipated.
Consultants
4.11      As already mentioned, EDF has been STEG's consultant for a number
of years on technical and operating matters; it is expected that EDF will
continue in this role, much of which is undertaken through French Govern-
ment aid under its Programme d'Assistance Technique. More recently SiEG
has also used the U.S. Executive Assistance Program, sponsored by US AID,
and is now considering engaging US consultants on distribution work under
the same program. The auditing firm of Peat, Marwick and Mitchell, Paris,
has been used during the past three years on accounting and auditing work.
STEG intends to continue engaging consultants satisfactory to the Bank to
undertake studies on (i) system analysis to improve system stability;
(ii) the investigation of potential power plant sites for future use;
(iii) organization and the improvement of management infonmation to further
STEG's programs in these areas; (iv) the accounting system; (v) the devel-
opment of a Rural Electrification program. STEG is already undertaking a
tariff study and is preparing an inventory of its physical assets, with the
assistance of consultants previously approved by the Bank. The foreign
currency element for all the above mentioned studies amounting to US$1.2
million has therefore been included in the Project. Details of these
studies are given in Anex 6.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF PRIOJECT
The Power Market
5.01      STEG's principal load center is the Tunis region in northern
Tunisia, where almost half of the total public power consumption takes
place. The next area of rapidly growing importance is along the coast
south of Tunis, in the region of Sousse, where hotel construction has
developed at a rapid rate in response to tourist demands. This activity
is spreading further south to the Djerba area. The Bank has under consid-
eration a Tourism infrastructure project which would serve to coordinate
and further stimulate development of these regionso
5.02      In making its forecast of sales through 1976 STEG has extrapolated
the demand for its low voltage customers on the basis of past trends which
showed an average annual growth rate of about 7.8% and known recent changes
to give a forecast average annual growth rate of about 8%. STEG then re-
viewed its industrial customers individually to ascertain their planned
expansion for the period and applied a factor to take care of delays and
projects which might not materialize. The result gave an average annual
industrial growth rate of about 10% for the period. Finally, in view of
the Tourism Project now under review by the Bank, the sales which would be
created by this activity were examined. The average of these forecasts
gave an annual average growth rate in total energy requirements of 8.8%
during the period through 1976 as shown in Annex 8. This forecast is
realistic and is considered a suitable basis upon which to plan system
expansion.
5.03      Total system losses including station serrices were reviewed
and found to average about 17% which is not excesaive for this type of
system. When the Rhennouch plant in the south comes into operation, some
reduction in losses can be expected because the transmission ring will then
receive power from two major sources and the transmission distances between
power sources and load centers will in effect be reduced. Distribution
system improvements now underway and planned for the future would further
reduce losses.
Capability of Meeting System Maximum Demand
5.04      Annex 9 shows the forecast of system maximum demand and the
system firm capacity after taking reserve requirements and plant de-rating
because of age into consideration.  In 1971 the generating plants in service
provided an aggregate of 196 MW of available capacity which would provide
151 MW of firm capacity after allowing a reserve requirenent of the largest
and the smallest unit on the system for normal maintenance and unscheduled
plant outage. This is more than sufficient to meet the system maximum
demand of 142 NW in 1971. When the two 30 MW Rhennouch steam units cone
into service about October 1972, along with the simltaneous retirement of
some obsolete plant, the firm  system capacity will increase to about 184 W



- 11 -
which would be sufficient to meet forecast demand through 1973. The
estimated peak in 1975 would be about 200 NW and the 410 N  of gas turbines
under the proposed project would provide somewhat more capacity than re-
quired to meet estimated system peak demand until early 1976. The reason
for considering comiissioning the gas turbines at the earliest possible
date (mid 1973) is to utilize the remaining available gas from El Borma
which is at present being flared.
Least Cost Solution
5.05      The gas pipeline from El Borma to Rhennouch was justified under
Loan 72h-TUN on the assumption that the then estimated total gas output
from the oil wells would have a well-head price of zero and would be used
at Rhennouch. It was also assumed that 95% of the gas would be used in
thermal electric generating plants.
5.o6      STEG's Rhennouch steam plant of two 30 SW units now under con-
struction is scheduled to come into service about October 1972 when the
pipeline is also scheduled to be completed. This plant will use about
half the gas available for the generation of electricity. The gas tur-
bines proposed in the Project would be installed about the middle of 1973
and would use the remainder of the gas.
5.07      There are three possible strategies of installing generating
plant of different types which can be considered to meet the forecasts of
load growth up to 1988; namely using industrial gas turbines only, using
conventional steam plant only, or a mixture of the two types of generating
plant. The gas turbines have the advantage that they can be installed in
about 18 months and would be available by mid 1973 to utilize the remainder
of the gas from the pipeline. If this gas is not used for electricity gen-
eration from mid 1973 through 1975 the power requirements for the system
would have to be generated in the existing oil fired plants in Tunis, as
is now taking place.  On the other hand by using the gas, the consumption
of imported fuel oil used in the Tunis plants would be correspondingly
reduced and a cost savings of about TD2,000,000 in the period mid 1973
through 1975 would accrue to STEG. Early in 1976, the growth in system
peak demand (kW) requires the installation of a further generating plant.
5.08      The three alternative plans for installing generating capacity
are shown in Annex 10. In scheme "A", the all gas turbine alternative,
the first two 20 MW units would be installed by mid-1973 followed by
another unit in 1976, two more in 1977 and one or more units as required
annually from 1979 onward. In scheme "B". the all steam alternative, the
earliest that the first unit could be installed would be toward the end
of 1975. 60 MW of steam capacity is assumed to be in operation in that
year followed by further 60 NW increments in 1977, 1979, 1982 and 1984.
The implementation of this alternative would entail, up to the end of
1975, a somewhat greater risk of failure at the time of system peak de-
mand, but this risk has not been quantified. In scheme 'IC"., the mixed
gas turbine and steam alternative, the first installation would again be



- 12 -
two 20 MW gas turbine units in mid-1973. This would be followed by 60 MW
of steam units in 1976, 1979, 1982 and 1984 respectively. The difference
in the total present values for all three alternatives, for test rates of
discount of 10% through 14%, are not sufficiently distinguishable to make
a clear choice between them considering the limits of.accuracy of the data
used. However, the marginal advantage appears to be with the mied gas
turbine and steam strategy. There is no reason why STEG's present plan to
install 40 MW of gas turbines as a first step should not be accepted.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
5.09      The internal financial rate of return for the Project was cal-
culated by obtaining the discount rate of costs and revenues attributable
to the Project over the life of the latter (see Annex 11). The internal
financial rate of return of the Project is in the range of 23% to 25%.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECS
Introduction
60ol      STEG' s finances are characterized by a high level of self-
financing of expansion. In 1970 about 31% of capital expenditure was
financed from cash generated after debt service. This self-financing
is expected to average about 50% for the forecast period 1971 through
1976 (see Annex 14), despite a low return averaging 6% on average net
assets employed.  This low return, however, is the result of the con-
servative depreciation policies followed; and is also of limited value
as an objective measure of performance because of the existing uncertain-
ties about the asset values on which it is based (see 6.03). Several
factors contribute to STEG's high net cash flow after debt service.
They are: (a) the high proportion of dividend free equity in its capital-
ization (69% in 1970), (b) the low interest cost (averaging 4.8% in 1970)
and long-term nature of its debt, both reflecting the high proportion of
borrowings on concessionary terms (see 6.02 (b)); and (c) the adequate
tariff level.  STEG's management expects this favorable borrowing situa-
tion to change gradually over the years as new debt is incurred, but
intends to offset this change through improved productivity and earnings
rather than by lowering its self-financing objectives.
Present Financial Position
6.02      STEG's balance sheet as of December 31, 1970 (Annex 12) shows
a generally satisfactory position. The debtsequity ratio is 31:69. Total
assets, net of current liabilities, are TD69 million (US$131 million),
financed by:
(a)   Equity of TD42 million (US$80 million) of which TD34 million is
the value of assets originally provided by the government, and
TD8 million is accrued earned surplus;
(b)   Debt of TD21 million (US$40 million) of which TD19 million was
from foreign aid sources at concessionary rates of interest of
4½% or less;
(c)   Non-refundable customers' contributions of TD6 million
(US$11 million).
This pattern of financing is expected to be maintained in the medium-term
future, although the debt:equity ratio is expected to increase temporarily
to 36:64 in 1972 and 1973, the peak of the Project construction period.
6.03      The accuracy of the valuation of pre-1969 assets is still some-
what uncertain despite the work of STEG and its auditors on physical verifica-
tion and valuation which is continuing (see 3.05). STEG's straight line
depreciation policy tends to be conservative with all major assets being de-
preciated over 20 years, starting with a full year's depreciation in the year
in which the asset first comes into service. In 1970, STEG's depreciation
charge was equivalent to 4.8% of its gross fixed assets.



- 14 -
6.04      Although current assets exceeded current liabilities by TD3.5
million, these were largely tied up in excessively high accounts receivable
from government and autonomous government entities. The situation is likely
to improve because of (a) plans to introduce cycle billing and to reduce the
time lag between meter reading and bill presentation, (b) the Presidential
decree setting up a procedure for prompt payment of current government bills
for utiility services, and (c) the arrangements being made with government inter
alia, to offset certain outstanding amounts due from STEG (see 3.07).
6.os      STEG's cash position has significantly improved over both the
poor 1969 position and the expectations at the time of the appraisal of
the gas pipeline loan made in 1971. This improvement was due to increased
earnings (see 6.06), helped by some profit on sales of inventories etc. and
by borrowings, which financed 49% of the 1970 cost of capital construction
(see Annex 14).
Past Earnings
6.o6      For reasons already stated only the most recent earnings, for 1969
and 1970, Annex 13 are relevant for judging performance and even they are
still uncertain in the absence of an audit of the income statement (expected
for the 1971 accounts) The 1970 revenue accounts, which also recorded
adjustments to the 1969 results as well as profits on certain capital and
non-current transactions (see Note 4 of Annex 13), may well also be amended
in the 1971 audited accounts. A net operating surplus of TD2.3 million and
a net surplus after interest of TD1,3 million were reported for 1970. Both
the operating surplus and net surplus after interest were significantly
better than in 1969 due in particular to a 4% increase in revenues and a
2% decrease in operating expenses reflecting improved controls over labor
and supplies. The operating surplus is equivalent to a return of only 4.5%,
on average net fixed assets in operation, but, as previously mentioned in
6.01, this return ratio tends to be understated.
6.07      Retail sales of gas, presently sold only in Tunis, showed a profit
of TD116,000 in 1970, and although gas operations are expected to continue
to show a small profit, this activity is an insignificant part of STEG's
operations accounting for less than 6% of the 1970 total revenues from sales.
Even including the planned sales of El Borma gas to the two factories in the
Rhennouch area, this share is expected to decline further.
Financing Plan
6.o0      STEG's financing plan during the Project construction period of
1972 through 1974 (see Annex 14) is satisfactory. Only 36% of the financing
would come from borrowing, which would comprise the proposed TD6.3 million
(US$12 million) Bank loan and the drawdown of various existing loans; 49%
would be provided from cash generated internally after meeting debt service,
and the balance from a net decrease in working capital (primarily because
of improved collection of bills) and from customers' contributions as shown
below:

Future Earnings and Cash Generation
6.og     Future earnings forecasts are based on generally conservative
assumptions listed in Annex 13 which take into consideration the uncertain-
ties in the data base from which they are projected.
lJ   The final TD25 thousand of the proposed loan is expected to be
disbursed in 1975.



- 16 -
6.10      The most significant assumptions include:
(a) an average increase of 8.8% in electricity sales with no
significant change in the average revenue per kWh sold;
(b) a cost of gas based only on the estimated transportation
costs from El Borma to Rhennouch. Depreciation and interest
on the pipeline are also included but are retained in their own
respective categories of expense;
(c) no increase in personnel, but a 5% annual increase in the wage
bill allowing for productivity and seniority increases;
(d) no tax liabilities in the period due to the combination of tax
holidays on certain investments and capital allowances on
others; and
(e) a continuation of the existing depreciation policy (see 6.03)
except that STEG has decided that the pipeline and the gas
turbines would both be depreciated over 15 years even though,
their useful lives would normally exceed 20 years. This
decision is acceptable to the Bank.
With the exception of sales, the most important parameters are within the
control of the management. Given continuation of STEG's present policies,
it is expected that the adequate earnings and high level of cash genera-
tion will in fact materialize.
6.11      Cash generation after debt service will cover about half of the
expansion requirements in the l972-1974 project construction period (see
6.08). During the forecast period through 1976, debt service will be
covered at least twice by internal cash generation with the expected
return on average net fixed assets rising to 6.5%.
6.12      During negotiations STEG agreed to maintain tariffs at such a
level that the ratio gf operating surplus to average value of gross fixed
assets in operation lifless average customers contributions would not fall
below 6i9 in any fiscal year. For this covenant the "operating surplus"
(the numerator) was defined as being the surplus before charging depreci-
ation or interest on long term debt. This definition was unchanged from
the equivalent covenant of Loan 724-TUN. The denominator, however, has
been changed from "Net fixed assets in operation" to "Gross fixed assets
in operation" to allow for possible adjustments in STEG's conservative
depreciation policy, so as to reduce temporary fluctuations in the ratio
caused by the commissioning of major assets and so as relate the ratio more
/ The "average value" was defined as the average of the original coat
(or of ary appropriate revaluation) of the gross fixed assets at the
beginning and at the end of the year in question.



- 17 -
directly to STEGts own investment.  On this new basis, STEG's operating
return was 8.5% in 1970 and is expected to be in the order of 9% through-
out the forecast period through 1976 (Annex 13, page 1). These forecasts
also show that STEG would similarly have achieved the requirements of the
former loan agreement during this period.
Forecast Balance Sheets
6.13      STEG's forecast balance sheets (Annex 12) reflect a continuing
conservative debt:equity ratio rising to 36:64 by 1972 and dropping to
30:70 by 1976. STEG's current ratio is also expected to continue to
improve satisfactorily (see 6.o4). Gross fixed assets in operation are
expected to.increase 60% by 1974 to TD129 million and 80% by 1976 to
TD145 million. STEG's cash is expected to increase to some TD2.1 million
by 1974, which is adequate for its working capital requirements.
Gas Pipeline ProJect - Covenants
6.14      Articles IV and V of the Loan Agreement 726-TUN and Section 2.03
of the Guarantee Agreement both dated February 25, 1971 include some cov-
enants specific to STEG. Loan Agreement covenants relate to improved
utilization of manpower (Sec. 4.01 (b)), the collection of statistical and
accounting information (Sec. 4.01 (c)), the creation of subsidiaries (Sec.
4.03), the maintenance of separate records for the capital and operating
costs of the pipeline (Sec. 5.02), the implementation of comprehensive cost
related electricity tariffs by 1973 (Sec, 5.04), an undertaking not to
lower tariffs (Sec. 5.05), a rate covenant (Sec. 5.06), and a debt limita-
tion covenant against raising the debt:equity ratio above 45s:55 (Sec. 5.07).
Under the Guarantee Agreement, the Government undertakes to provide STEG
with overdraft facilities up to TD1 million (Sec. 2.03). In view of the
tariff studies now being undertaken by STEG, it was agreed during negotia-
tions that Section 5.05 of Loan 724-TUN would be cancelled so as to provide
the flexibility necessary to enable changes to be made to individual rates
within the tariff structure. Section 5.06 relating to the rate covenant
was modified (see paragraph 6.12), but with the above two exceptions, all
the above covenants are adequate, are still valid and were repeated in the
proposed Loan Agreement.

7. AGREEMNTS REACHED AND REC1OENEDAMIONS
7.01     During loan negotiations:
a)   The covenants included under Articles IV and V of Loan Agreement
724-TUN and Section 2.03 of the Ouarantee Agreement were repeated
with the exception of Section 5.05 and 5.06 relating to tariffs
and to the rate covenant respectively which were cancelled
(paragraph 6.14).
b)   STEG undertook to maintain tariffs at a level which would give
a return before charging depreciation or interest of not less
than &is on average gross fixed assets (paragraph 6.12).
c)  STEG undertook to continue to engage consultants acceptable to
the Bank for assignments to be financed under the proposed loan
(paragraph 4.10).
d)  Adequate assurances were given by the Tunisian Government under
the Guarantee Agreement, that arrangements satisfactory to the
Bank would be made to settle the electricity bills of government
departments, local authorities, and government omned enterprises.
(Paragraph 3.07.)
7.02     With the indicated agreements, the Project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$12.0 million equivalent for a term of 20 years
including a 3-year grace period.

DETAIIS CF EXISTING POER PLANTS
STEG's system consists of the followings-
(1)      At Ia Goulette I power plant in Tmis, 4 steam generating units
ranging fromu 10 M  to 17.5 N  in sine and totalling 57.5 a of
nameplate capacity which were installed frao 1931 to 1954. Most
of this plant is no longer reliable and will be gradually retired
as new generating plant is built.
(2)      At La Goulette II power plant in Tunis, 4 steam generating units
of 27.5 NW each, totalling 110 NW of nameplate capacity; two of
which were installed in 1966 and two in 1968. All units are
operating satisfactorily and constitute STEG's principal power
source today.
(3)       3 small bydro plants located in the north-western part of the
country totalling about 32 NW nameplate capacity which are
available for peaking only and are associated with reservoirs
for potable water and irrigation.  Tunisia unfortunately does
not have any hydro power sites of significance.
(4)      A gas turbine (15 MW) at Menzel Bourguiba was installed in 1971
and is connected to the interconnected system,
(5)       3 principal diesel plants are located at Sfax (9.8 W); at
Sousse (5.5 W) and Djerba (4.5 NW) and more than 25 smaller
diesel units totalling about 7 W are located throughout the
country to serve isolated localities still not connected to the
interconnected system.

THE PROJECT
The Gas Turbine
Two units of about 20 MW each are proposed and would consist of
the turbine, generator and control equipment as a unit; the transfonmer
and switchgear to connect the alternator to the 1$0 kV transmission system.
The gas turbines would be heavy duty open cycle units in their
own housing so that they could in the future, if needed, be moved to some
other site.
The natural gas will be delivered dry at a pressure of 18 atmos-
pheres and will have a calorific value of about 10,5DO kcal/m3.  It has
the following chemical composition:-
Component                           Volume Percent
Nitrogen                                1.97

iJ There are two alternative routes for the line from Rhennouch to the main
transmission ring, i.e. via Maknassy or Sfax. The alternate routes are
about the same length consequently the cost estimate is substantially
the same. However, there are line loss and system stability differences
for preferring one alternative over the others STEG is atudying the
choice and their selection will be aubmitted for Bank approval by mid

ETNAL FINANCIAL RATE CP RETURN
The internal financial rate of return of the Project is the
discount rate which equalizes the costs and revenues attributable to the
Project over its economic life, -which has been taken as 15 years.
On a basically thermal system, such as the system being con-
sidered here, generating plants are installed within a least cost strategy
(see Annex 10) at a point in time to meet the maxixum system demand with
adequate provision for reserves (para. 5.04). Once new generating plant
is installed it will be operated to minimize the total system fuel costs,
consistent with meeting the consumers requirenents for electricity. If
the generating plant being installed has a lower fuel cost per unit of
electrical energy produced (kWh) than existing plant, then it will make a
savings in the total system fuel costs tn that existing plant will operate
fewer hours in the year. Thus, besides contributing towards meeting an
increase in the system requirements for meeting electrical energy, once a
new generating plant is installed, it will usually also enable existing
plant to be operated fewer hours in any year.
The calculation of the internal financial rate of return of a
Project must be done on a "with and without" (as distinct from a "before
and after") basis. In the case of the gas turbines, which form the basic
portion of the Project, the "with and without'" approach is estimated to
give savings in system fuel costs of TD 0.4 million in 1973, TD 0.8 million
in 1974 and TD 0.8 million in 1975; the gas turbines would also meet in-
creases in system requirements for electrical energy worth (at, the present
average price per kWh sold) in revenue TD 0.7 million in 1974 and TD 1.0
million in 1975.
In the "with and without" sense, the 1975 values of both the
savings in system fuel costs and the increases in system revenues made
possible by the gas turbines are best considered as pertaining through-
out their lives in that no major existing generating plant is expected
to be scrapped during that period and there is no certainty at present
as to what type of generating plant the nextb should be (para. 5.08).
Similarly it is also impossible at this stage to forecast whether the
gas to be used for the gas turbines in the Project (which gas has zero
cost) should be used for other generating plant instead in the future.
All the above factors will be taken into consideration when deciding on
the next generating plant to be installed and will form a large part in
its Justification. Meanwhile, for this exercise, the 1975 figures fo,,
both the savings in system fuel costs and the increases in system revenues
made possible by the gas turbines have been a6sumed to pertain throughout
their lives.
Using the above assumptions and the other relevant costs, tl 
costs and revenues attributable to the Project are shown below&

The figures in brackets are negative and the capital costs for the gas tur-
bines and transmission are shown as occurring in a single year instead of
over 18 months for simplicity.
The internal financial rate of return of the Project is about 24%.
Major inaccuracies in either the capital costs or the system fuel cost sav-
ings are considered improbable. However, if the attributable revenues were
to be 10% less in each year then the rate of return on the Project would
fall to about 23%, and if the attributable revenues were to be 10% greater
in each year then the rate of return on the Project would rise to about 25%.
