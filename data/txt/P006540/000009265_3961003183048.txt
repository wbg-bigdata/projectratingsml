MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIX iE DIRECTORS
FOR A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
STATE OF MINAS GERAIS WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL, FOR A
MINAS GERAIS WATER QUALITY AND POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendatian on a proposed
loan to the State of Minas Gerais, with the guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil, for the
equivalent of US$145 million, to help finance a project which addresses critical water pollution problems
in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais. The Loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of fifteen years including five years of grace.
Backrtmrnd
2.         Traditional mining activities along with explosive urban growth and industrialization over
the past decades have caused extensive environmental degradation in the Belo Horizonte metropolitan
area. One of the most critical environmental issues is the pollution of rivers and reservoirs close to the
expanding metropolitan area.
3.         Water pollution results from two basic, and interrelated causes:  (i) environmentally
uncontrolled industrialization; and (ii) inadequate urban and sanitation infrastructure, in favelas
(shantytowns) that have spread into hazardous areas. Typically the process starts with industries
disposing untreated wastes into the natural drainage system, and with shantytowns encroaching into hazard
prone lands, mostly river banks and steep slopes, where it is difficult to provide basic infrastructure.
Additionally, inadequate sectoral investments and unrealistc zoning measures have resulted in unmet
demand for environmental infrastructure, especially for controlling floods and collecting and treating
wastes. The main water pollution sources are: industrial and mining waste, municipal sewage, and storm
water run-off. The problem is compounded by an inadequate drainage system and high annual rainfall
resulting in extensive and frequent flooding.
4.         The inadequacy of environmental infrastructure is also a reflection of policy failure related
to investment priorities and selection of policy instruments to control environmental degradation. Brazil
began to formally address the need for sanitation infrastructure in the early seventies as part of a national
basic sanitation plan (PLANASA) covering water supply, sewerage, sewage treatment, and solid waswe
disposal. As a higher priority was given to urban water supply progress lagged in sewerage coverage-
presently only 42 percent of the urban population has access to sewerage and a mere 10 percent of the
collected sewage is treated. Even though some industrial pollution control programs were initiated to
reduce air and water pollution in selected urban areas, these measures were insufficient to accommodate
the pace of industrial growth and the resulting pollution increases. Only recently have the municipal
authorities become aware of land use planning as a means of protecting environmentally important river
basins. Many of the policies adopted in Brazil fai.ed to institute sound pricing practices for providing
environmental services and protecting natural resources, and thus contributed to poor performance in



-2 -
enviromental management and the provision of infrastructure. In general, pollution control has been
seriously constrained by inadequate levels of investment, lack of appropriate cost recovery, reliance on
limited means of pollution control (e.g., water quality criteria) rather than incentive-based instruments,
insufficient coordination between different levels of Government, inadequate capac' y to enforce control
measures, and the limited involvement of the users and NGOs.
5.   The strategy developed by the Federal Government to address water pollution problems under tb
Project takes into account four points: first, recognition that the critical water pollution problems in Braz;t
are related to the intense urbanization processes concentrated in the major metropolitan areas; second,
the need for the implementation of multi-sectoral investment programs as appropriate means of addressing
the pollution problem; third, the need to place project implementation responsibility with sub-national
entities with enhanced institutional capacity (rather than relying on the Federal Government whose
capabilities are presently limited); and fimally, the need for efficient cost recovery through both the use
of existing taxes and tariffs and new instruments that relate cost recovery (fees and taxes) to different
levels of natural resource consumption.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.         The Bank's assistance strategy in Brazil is to support policies and investments which will
encourage economic growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic stability. It
emphasizes efficient resource allocation, a more efficient public sector, and the appropriate targeting and
delivery of support systems to the poor.
7.         In the context of infrastructure projects, concern with environmentally sustainable
development ("optimal" resource and environmental management over time) requires maximizing the net
benefits of such projects, subject to maintaining the quality of environment and natural resources. This
implies an integrated approach to investment decision- making and institutional strengthening for cost-
effective pollution control, taking into account the multirmedia, cross-sectoral and cross-governmental
nature of the pollution problem. The Bank's objective is to help Brazil better manage its urban
environment by identifying and supporting: (i) essential investments; (i) required policy changes,
including increased reliance on market-based approaches and'the need to ensure cost recovery; and (iii)
institutional reforms, including the cooperation and effective coordination across municipalities aud
government levels. The Bank involvement will focus attention on adequate cost recovery by carefully
identifying the polluters as well as the beneficiaries of the project. The proposed project follows up on
similar Bank-financed projects in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana (Loans 3504-BR and 3505-BR,
respectively).
Lessons Learned from Past Bank Proiects
8.         Bank assistance to Brazil for developing environmental infrastructure has been mostly
channeled through its support for PLANASA. Since 1971, sixteen water and sanitation loans totalling
US$1.9 billion have been approved, largely to support PLANASA objectives. PLANASA was designed
to provide through appropriate charges to consumers, "on-site' environmental sanitation services such
as water supply and waste water collection. No incentives, however, were included in the tariff
legislation to facilitate the finmcing of off-site services such as sewage treatment and appropriate final
sewage disposal. Notwithstanding the shortcomings mentioned above, PLANASA developed a highly



decentrali;.ed and efficient system for delivering water and sanitation services, which has facilitated water
pollution control initiatives at the state level.
9.         In the late 1970s, the Bank approved two loans to assist Brazil in implementing water
pollution control projects in Sao Paulo's most populated areas, i.e., Loan 1525-BR to support Sao Paulo's
wastewater master plan; and Loan 1822-BR, to finance industrial sewage pretrea.ment prior to discharge
into the public system. The implementation of the project under Loan 1525-BR was disrupted by many
factors which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of a sizeable portion ($57.5 million) of the loan in
early 1985. An evaluation of the Sao Paulo project shows shortcomings in the following areas: (i)
inadequate integration of all required state and municipal institutions; (ii) a superficial analysis of
recovery instruments to assure the financial viability of the investment; and (iii) overestimated industrial
demand without considering prices. It is clear, in retrospect, that this project should have paid more
attention to the above factors.
10.        Past Bank experience with water pollution control in Brazil may be summarized as follows:
a) projects have utilized a limited selection of cost recovery instruments, relying almost entirely on tariffs;
b) industrial demand projected on the basis of pollution loads was overestimated; when high tariff levels
were introduced, consumer demand diminished considerably, and industries relied, instead, on less costly
solutions; c) pollution control projects should have taken a cross-sectoral perspective to accommodate a
variety of municipal, agricultural, and industrial sources of pollution; d) past project approaches to
pollution control have relied on political, administrative or managerial units, rather than dealing with the
water basin - the natural enviromnental unit. The Project is addressing the foregoing issues and will help
establish sound policies which will include carefully designed charges for services.
11.        Recently approved Bank water quality and pollution control projects in the states of Sao
Paulo and Parana (Loans 3504-BR and 3505-BR, respectively), have served as a benchmark to set the
standard for this operation. During preparation of the Sao Paulo and Parana operations, the Bank and
the Borrowers developed a methodology to ensure consistency in the financial and economic analyses of
sectoral investments. This methodology provides an integrated approach to generate information required
to conduct the financial and econimic cost-benefit analysis and to simultaneously identify the potential
sources and instruments of cost recovery to ensure the internalization of pollution costs by the polluters.
Additionally, the methodology systematically identifies the agents that need to be involved in the
institutional arrangements to ensure the sustainability of project objectives. These projects have attempted
to address water pollution control using water basin as a management unit instead of political or
administrative jurisdictions.
Project Objectives
12.        The principal objective of this project is to assist the State of Minas Gerais in developing
a cost-effective approach to control water pollution. The protect also proposes policy and institutional
reforms which minimize allocative distortions. The specific project objective is to recuperate the
environmentally deteriorated urban basins of the Arrudas and Onca rivers in the metropolitan area of Belo
Horizonte, the capital of the State of Minas Gerais and one of the most congested industrial areas in
Brazil. Beyond the metropolitan area, the project will protect the das Velhas river from the polluting and
noxious effluents discharged into the river. The project will help to (i) develop institutional capabilities
to manage these water basins in an environmentally sustainable manner through better land use, effective
cost recovery mechanisms, and an efficient legal and regulatory framework; and (ii) improve the quality
of life of approximately three million inhabitants of the two urban basins mentioned above, through t;e.



-4-
rehabilitation and expansion of basic sanitation infrastructure, i.e.. sewerage, solid waste collection and
disposal, and drainage in the municipalities of Belo Horizonte and Contagem.
Epjt Description
13.        The project consists of five main components: (i) flood control and urban drainage; (ii)
municipal and industrial sewage collection and  atment; (iii) municipal and industrial solid waste
collection and disposal; (iv) environmental protection; and, (v) water basin management. The flood
control and urban drainage component provides for mactodrainage of all rivers and creeks in the water
basin. The sewage collection and treatment comrfonent includes about 280 kms of interceptors and sewers
and two sewage treatment plants. The solid wastes component includes improvements in solid waste
collection and a sanitary landfill. The environmental protection component includes restoration of
vegetation, development of public areas, parks and resettlement of 1,600 families. The water basin and
environmental management component includes studies aimed at the control of industrial pollution in the
area, and the protection of "das Velhas" river, a public and government consultation process for
establishing the water basin authority, and training and institutional strengthening for the Minas Gerais
state environmental agency (FEAM).
Status of Project Preparation
14.        A project coordinating unit, created at the Minas Gerais Planning Secretariat (SEPLAN),
assisted by qualified consultants, conceived and designed the project. During the preparation period,
several meetings with all the participafting institutions and two workshops (one on procurement and the
other on resettlement) took place. In addition, there were hearings with concerned NGOs. A five-
volume project evaluation report is in the Project File. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
required by the Brazilian law (RIMA) has been completed and approved by the State authorities. A
summary of this EIA has been distributed to the Board. Some major sub-projects have advanced or
completed engineering designs. Terms of reference for most studies and technical assistance are
completed. Each project sub-component has been designed to rely on the existing institutional and
managerial capacity during project implementation, and on an efficient integrated management structure
under a water basin authority for its future operation. For the latter, the project contains extensive
studies, institutional development support, and technical assistance which will be carried out during the
project implementation period.
Project Implementation
15.        Because of the integrated character of the project and the water basin management approach
required for each sub-project, the State government and its sectoral agencies and municipalities have
decided to create a project execution and coordination unit at the state level, which will be the embryo
organization for the water basin authority, not only for the project area, but for the das Velhas River
water basin. The project unit will be located in the Banco de Desenvolvimento de Minas Gerais
(BDMG), and will be responsible for the principal project studies. The executing agencies will be the
State water utility, COPASA,the state enviromental agency, FEAM and the municipalities of Belo
Horizonte and Contagem. As the Loan agreement will be signed between the Bank and the State, each
subsidiary loan agreement between the State and each executing agency will include the provisions of the
schedule of the loan agreement which spells out rights and obligations of each party under the project



5-
16.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$307.6 million equivalent. The project will
be financed by a Bank loan of US$145.0 million, as well as by state and local resources. Retroactive
financing amounting to US$5 million equivalent is recommended for financing expenditures incurred after
July 1. 1992 for urgently needed consultants and selected works. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are show-n in Schedule B. A timetable of k1ey processing events and the status of
the Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff Appraisal
Repo.t (10805-BR) dated December 1, 1992, is being distributed separately.
Project Sustainability
17.        The project design systematically identifies the means and instruments to ensure a sustainable
project. The adoption of a water basin focus enables a strategic and comprehensive planning approach
which permits the coordination of all planning activities in the area, including urban, economic and
infrastructure planning which have important Implications for water quality management. As long-term
viability of water basin management is closely linked to administrative independence and financial
autonomy, both subjects were given special consideration in the project, by including studies for these
purposes. Furthermore, the project envisages the creation of an independent water basin authority and
the establishment of water use surcharges to finance its operations.
Environmental Aspects
18.        The project will improve environmental cotditions in the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area
particularly in a 40 km stretch of the das Velhas river receiving effluent discharges from the area. All
project components are designed to help upgrade the existing deteriorated conditions and to create the
foundations for sustain?'le environmental management in the future. The project will enhance water uses
in most of the area's water bodies and improve the quality of life in the surrounding areas, through flood
control and disposal of wastes (including toxics), the control of land use in hazardous areas and basic
sanitation services and recreational facilities benefitting mostly the low-income 'favela' population.
19.        The project has been designed to prevent or mitigate any negative impacts on the
environment which may result from the resettlement of approximately 1,600 families living infavelas or
in hazard-prone flood plains, and from the final disposal of wastes. The families to be resettled have
been identified and contacted to assess their needs. The land for the required housing projects has also
been identified, and the parcels to accommodate the first stream of families have already been
expropriated. The housing projects receiving the resettled population will all be located near their current
sites, thereby reducing the hardship from changing neighborhoods.
20.        The project has been classified as "A" under the O.D.4.01. The EA conducted by
consultants and submitted by the Government to the Bank on April 30, 1992, was reviewed and found
satisfactory. The EIAs for the project have been approved by the state authorities and are available in
the project file.
Agrd Acin
21.        To avoid delays in Project implementation, the State of Minas Gerais submitted at Loan
Negotiations: (i) final designs representing 20 percent of the project cost in aggregate value; (ii) terms
of reference for all studies to be carried out under the project; (iii) final draft documents for institutional



-6-
arrangements for the project; (iv) final draft standard procurement documents and standard letter of
Invitation for consultants; (v) project operational manual; (vi) a plan for the institutional strengthening
of FEAM; (vii) terms of reference for studies on industrial pollution control; (viii) final designs for
resettlement and terms of reference for an evaluation of anticipated improvements in living standards; (xi)
evidence of completion of legal actions for expropriations; and (x) timely funding for the required
compensations and related housing projects.
22.        Agreement was reached during Loan Negotiations on: (i) the formalization of all project
documents and the signing of the contract for the studies mentioned in para. 21 (viii) above before
effectiveness; (ii) the staffing of UGP and the formalization of Letters of Intent before committing
retroactive funding; (iii) the eligibility criteria for subprojects; (iv) the establishment of a water basin
management unit; (v) the establishment of a water use surcharge; (vi) monitoring indicators; (vii)
COPASA's management improvement plan; (viii) a plan of action for industrial pollution contcol and
strengthening of FEAM; and (ix) timely submission of satisfactory audits, progress reports, and the
project completion report (PCR). In addition, the approval of subprojectL related to the disposal of
hazardous solid wastes will be subject to the provision of satisfactory safeguards.
Project Benefits
23.        The project would directly benefit a substantial portion of the population of the metropolitan
area of Belo Horizonte, estimated at about three million people. The principal project benefits are the
restoration of water quality in the system of rivers and reservoirs, and the improvement of standard of
living in areas surrounding the water bodies. Water quality is associated with improved hygienic
conditions, preservation of biodiversity and enhanced water uses, as well as improvements in standards
of living. Project benefits include: the preservation of water supply sources, flood control, land
reclamation and urbanization, and extension of basic sanitation services and recreational facilities.
Finally, the project will promote the establishment of a conceptual and analytical framework to abate
water pollution and preserve the quality of scarce water resources in congested urban areas in the State
of Minas Gerais.
Project Risks
24.        The main project rl3k is associated with the Project's innovative character and the required
institutional integration at the state and municipal levels. This risk has been carefully evaluated early on
during project preparation and the institutions involved decided to create a project unit, (UGP) at the state
level in BDMG, which will be responsible for overall supervision and coordination with the executing
agencies. Moreover, the executing agencies have highly qualified staff, many with experience of Bank-
financed projects. Resettlement represents another risk beset by many social and political hazards.
Advanced preparation of detailed resettlement plans by the two municipalities for the first two years of
project execution, when it is still possible to make remedial changes, and extensive involvement of
population in preparation of these plans will help minimize risks. The project will help to introduce
modem policy instruments for water pollution control in Brazil. Finally, there is a risk associated with
the implementation of the needed policy changes and the political reaction toward these changes. Even
if implementation of needed policy changes is delayed, the project will be instrumental in helping
Brazilian authorities in developing appropriate technologies for the management and control of water
pollution.
