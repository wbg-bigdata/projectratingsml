Dear Mr. Tu,
Thank you for the electronic copy of the revised RAP Addendum (October 2001
version) for Ca Mau Terminal. I have reviewed the same and I am glad to
I       inform you that the revised RAP Addendum has incorporated all the comments
on the draft report that was submitted in July. The report in its present
form is therefore accepted.
Please submit three hard copies of the report for distribution as follows:
1 copy for the Resident Mission in Hanoi;
1 copy for Mr. Tsutsumi at the WB Head Quarters; and
1 copy for my record to be mailed to me.
Please note that there have been several versions of this RAP Addendum
submitted to the Bank. To avoid any confusion with the previous versions,
please ensure that all the reports previous to the October 2001 are
considered cancelled.
Thank you and warm regards,
Pramod Agrawal
