RAP Addendum
|                                     FOR TAC THU SHIPLOCK
I._  Brief'description._
Mau Tac Thu shiiplock locates in commune "Tac Thu" - district "Thoi Binh" - province of Ca
Mau and at chainage of Km 315 + 000 on waterway from Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) to Ca
| ~~Mau.
This structure construes one part of hydraulic complex which consists of three parts:
shiplock itself, three sluices and one earth dam. Each part of complex has its individual
funiction: the lock maintains continuity of navigation and water control sluices for discharging
flood water in rainy season and water control in dry season and earth dam for closing existing
Tac Thu river and preventing salt intrusion from downstream rivers (Ong Doc-Bay Hap-Ganh
Hao).
The whole construction site covers total land area of 16.25 ha in two hamlets of Xom So
I         and Ben Go.
Topographic relief:
3                   Construction site lies on low-flat area with short brush of palrn trees and small rice
field plots. Site elevation varies from 0.00 m to +0.8 m above mea sea level, so the site
is partly covered by high tide water.
-Geolov rand Soils:
Soil layers through boring had been generalized from ground surface as follows:
I                  -  Layer la: fill-blackish grey, yellowish grey clay with ruined/decomposed plant
roots and plants; very soft to soft. Thickish of this layer: 0.5 m to 1.5 m.
1                  -  Layer 1: blackish grey, blackish grey brown, organic clay; very soft to soft.
Thickness of this layer 15.1 m to 17.2 m.
3                   vFoundations of sluices and shiplock are on layer #1 of weak bearing capacity.
Soils at site are mostly saline and acid sulfate potential.
X                   Tide propagation to Tac Thu shiplock sources mainly from two tides: mixed tide
from GLulf Thailand and semi-diumal tide fr-om China sea. Tide difference at site varies
|              frolmi I in to 1.2 m.
B1(asic: dimensions of structures:
3               (i)   Shiplock (onze chamber):
Overall width 14.0 in x overall length 150.0 m x overall height 6.0 in
tupstream/downstream approach channels: waiting zone with upper width 35.0m
I                     x overall length 150.0 m and transition canal of 14.5 m (wide) x 100 m (long).
3                                                                                          2

I              (ii)   Sluices:
Three sluices of square section (10 n1 x 10 rn) and 20 m long sluice gates
3                     are of stainless steel and automatically operated in one way (seaward only).
(iii)   Eart-h dani:
|                          Elevation of crest: +2.00 m, Upper Width at crest: 10.0 m.
Slope: over "O" elevation: 1 (vertical) 1 5 (horizontal)
3                          Below "O" elevation: 1 (vertical) / 8 -10 (horizontal)
Earth dam will be built by selected materials and soils esecavated from
shiplock and sluices.
I        II._ Identification of impacts._
II.(i) Construction site._
The construction site has circular curve along Tac Thu river bank of 1,250 m long
from Km 314 + 550 Kin 315 + 800, width along earth dam alignment (maximum width)
of 362 m and circular sector of 1,050 m. The site includes second chamnber development
I             in response to growth of coming traffic flow upon 2010, area of construction site: 16.25
ha.
E       Jl.(ii) Description of impacts._
There are definitely two different types of impacts affected by the site in the long
termn and short term basic. Eyvironnzent impacts originate from changing of physical
I             conditions (water, soils) on the site, these impacts had been assessed and their
mitigations are incorporated in monitoring schedule. A separate report had been drafted
as an Addendum to Environment Monitoring Action Plan ( EMAP.) for such impacts.
Economic and social imnpacts will result in the loss of land holdings (agricultural, garden
and residential), structures, trees and other fixed assets; as well as due to the loss of
3             somC businesses that currently operate from affected structures. The project will affect
a total of 69 PAPs. Impacts on some affected people are likely to be severe and these
will need to be relocated. Inventory of affected assets has been prepared and these are
3             summzarized below.
III._ Detailed Description of Impacts
3             DMS work has been carried out from July to August 2000 upon two meetings with local
officials (Ca Mau People's Committee: CPC; Thoi Binh district PC and Ho Thi Ky commune
PC) and one public meeting with PAPs.
a- and loss:
Almost all the land holdings affected by the project have multiple usages such as
3              agriculture, garden and homesteads. The DMS identified the areas used for each of
the land use category for purposes of impacts and entitlements.
21 PAPs stand to lose their agricultural and garden land. Of these 5 PAPs are
affected marginially and the remaining 16 severely. One of the land holding belons to

fish and shirimp farms covering an average pond area of about 2000 mi2 per PAP (See
Table 2.7 (A)).
