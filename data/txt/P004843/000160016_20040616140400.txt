ASSESSE] ENT
The Vietnam Inland Waterways and ] ort Rehabilitation Project has set up an
Environmental Impact Ass ssment (EIA) R port, which has been approved by the
Ministry of Science, Tech] ology and Envi nnment (MOSTE) in March 1999. At
present, this project expanl s same additioni1 civil works and dredging. Following
the guidelines of Vietnamn and the World E and (WB), this EIA for the additional
works is prepared.
1.1   OBJECTIVES OF rHE ENVIRON          ENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
This environmental mpact assessmer (EIA) report is to clarify the issues as
follows.
- Brief description of the 4ditional works f the project.
- Brief description of th  existing envir nment of the additional sites of the
project and its surroundi gs.
- Identification, assessme it and predictio  of main impacts that the project may
cause to the environment in the phases of pre-construction, construction and
operation.
- Proposal of and Environ mental Manage  nt Plan (EMP) including measures for
mitigating the negative mpacts, and an nvironmental monitoring program for
the project.
- Recommendation of publ ic consultation f r the project.

Environmental Examination (IEE) and E    P. The World Bank's policy on
conducting EIA is to follo w Operational P licy 4.01: Environmental Assessment
(January, 1999). This desc ibes guidance o Bank's policies and procedures for
conducting environmental ar sessments of pro osed projects.

1.2.2 Vietnamese Policy and Administ ative Framework on Environmental
Assessment
* Vietnamese Policy Fr: mework
Vietnam's most relevant environmen al policies for environmental
assessment are as follows:
Law on Environme ntal Protection ( EP) was enacted in January 1994
The LEP:
- Identifies the responsi ilities of the st e centre, provinces, organisations and
individuals to prevent and remedy en ironmental deterioration and pollution
and carry out specified environmental p tection functions;
- Provides for the deve opment of envi nmental standards and submission of
environmental impact Essessment repo  on new and existing facilities;
- Provides for responsibl parties to pay c mpensation for environmental damage;
- Establishes the right of individuals and  ganisations to petition for enforcement
of environmental regul ltions;
- Calls for civil and crimi nal penalties for iolations; and
- Encourages intemation Il environmental o-operation.
Decree 175/CP was promulgated in 0 tober 18, 1994 by the Government to
guide implementation of 1he LEP and pr ides broad guidelines for division of
responsibility among Mi] istries; enviro  ental impact assessments; pollution
prevention and disaster co ntrol; sources of inance; and environmental inspections
and standards.
Circular No. 490 was promulgated in  pril 29 1998 by the MOSTE to provide
guidance on setting up and appraising envi nmental impact assessment reports for
investment projects. The C ircular identifies  e legal requirements according to the
stages of implementation o a project and it category; defines the content of project
subject to the EIA proc dures; and spe fies management of the EIA report
appraisal.
Law on Forest Prot ction (1992),  is law regulates forest management,
protection, development, and exploitation, revention of wood-cutting, and forest

destruction. It also encoura es individuals a d organisations to protect and develop
forests.
Decree 24/2000/ND- P specifies the i plementation on the Law on Foreign
Investment in Vietnam (Art cle 82) concerni g environmental protection as follows:
1) enterprises with foreign investment capi al and joint ventures are obligated to
observe regulations, satisfy standards in en ironment protection, and comply with
Vietnam legislation on en ironment protect on; 2) if investors apply international
advanced environmental tandards these tandards should be registered with
MOSTE.
Decree   52/1999/ND CP   was   apl ended  to  include  environmental
considerations for construclion management as follows: 1) for PFS, Provision 3 of
Article 23 stipulates that requirements fz - environment study relating to the
"selection of construction sites, estimation c land use area needed, in ways which
comply to the principle o minimizing la d use and environmental and social
impacts, and resettlement to the lowest po ible level". 2) Provisions 4 and 7 of
Article 24 stipulate that FS must propose "s ecific site options (or regions, routes)
which much match with co nstruction plans including documents on site selection,
together with proposed  olutions for rr inimizing environmental and social
impacts)", and "architectiiral alternatives construction solutions, preliminary
designs suggested  for selection, enviro ument management and protection
solutions". 3) For technical design: Section 3, Provision 1, Article 37 and Section
A, Provision 2, Article 3 8, contain regu tions on appraisal and approval: of
"techniques for the protec ion of environn ent and ecology; for prevention and
combating of explosion  nd fire and f- occupational safety and industrial
sanitation."
Decree 26/1996/CP p ovides regulatiol s on the punishment of administrative
violation of Environment I Protection La . Chapter 1 describes the general
provisions for punishment under the Env onment Protection Law. Chapter 2,
Article 6 details recommen led punishments for parties who violate environmental
pollution and prevention ac . These punish  nts include financial penalties for not
submitting an EIA report.
Vietnam Standards fr the Environi ent (TCVN) are national standards
published by MOSTE in 1 995, 2000 and 2 1 and applied to all government and
non-government agencies, organisations and companies. The Vietnamese
environmental standards inc lude acceptable imits of pollutants in ambient air, air
emission, surface water, grcund water, waste waters, soils, etc. In general the list of
physico-chemical parameters are broad nough such that most monitoring
programmes can employ the standards for o  valuation. There are some exceptions
- for example, sediment, biological, and vi ration standards do not yet exist. In
these cases, it is common practice for ODA projects to use standards from other
countries or international or anisations.

Environmental Impact Asse sment ofAdditione I Civil Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilit, ion Project
* Vietnamese Adminis rative Framewo k
The Government of V ietnam is in the p ocess of creating a new administrative
framework for environme ntal management For the Additional Works Project, the
framework's relevant inst tutes are as follo ls:
Ministry of Natura, Resources and Environment (MONRE). MONRE was
established by a Prime Ministerial Decis on on November 11, 2002. This new
ministry includes four vice-ministers, 16 departments, one newspaper, and one
magazine. MONRE merg ;es numerous dep rtments from several national agencies.
These are outlined in De cree 91/2002, N CP: Providing for the functions, duties,
powers and organisation 1 structure of thl Ministry of Natural Resources and the
Environment.
Environmental I    act Assessment and Appraisal Department. This
Department is under MONRE. Accor ling to Decree 91/2002/ND-CP, the
Department's function i ncludes: To app laise environmental impact assessment
reports of projects and  business and p oduction establishments. Environmental
Impact Assessment and Appraisal Del rtment is guided by the Vietnam's
established regulatory fra nework: i.e. LEP Circular 490, CP 175, etc.-
Provincial Depart ents of Natural esources and Environment (DONRE).
Each provincial DONRE houses an Envir nmental Management Division (EMD).
The EMD is responsible for ensuring envi onmental protection and management of
provincial matters in acc rdance with LEP Decree 175, and Circular 490. Hence, it
is DONRE - and in parti ular, its EMD - that will likely play a key regulatory role

Environmental Impact Assessment ofAdditiona Civil Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilita ion Project
* Matrix
Matrixes are set up for initial definitior of the impact level of activities of the
project on each environmental component.
* Rapid assessment
Methods of rapid assessment applica le to source of pollution in conjunction
with air, land and water, prepared by Ecor mopoulos, and issued by the WHO in
1993.
* Public consultation
Organizing public consultation for en- ironmental impact assessment. In this
process of public consultation procedure wa followed the WB guideline.
1.6 CLASSIFICATION OF IMPACTS
In this study, the anticipated negative e] vironmental impacts are classified into
five categories: "major", "moderate" "minm ", practically "not significant" or "no
impact" and "unknown impacts".
- A "major impact" can change an elemei of the environment or create a strong
environment modification. Such an imp t can strongly affect an environmental
component and/or on a large group of th population.
- A "moderate impact" can change a p   of the environmental component or
creates a moderate environmental   modification. Such an impact can
significantly affect an environmental co  onent or on a group of the population.
- A "minor impact" may slightly chang  value or use of an environmental
component. Such as impact can slightly ffect an environmental component or a
small group of the population.
- A "not signiflcation or no impact" may ot significantly chance value or use of
an environmental component. Environm -tal assessment will not be detailed but
some commentaries may be given for thi type of impacts.
- Some activities of the project may cause ome impacts but the magnitude of the
impacts can not be predicted. This typ of impacts is identified as "unkn&wn
impact".
CHAPTER ONE



Environmental Impact Assessment ofAdditiond Civil Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilita ion Project
In each type of impacts, there are "negat ve" and "positive" ones.
Beside the 5 categories, each imp, ct may be assessed as "mitigable",
"controllable" or "uncontrollable", "local , "temporary", "short-term" or "long-
term", depending on the intensity and scale f the impact.
Based on the impact classification in the Environmental Management Plan
different measures will be recommended to itigate different types of impacts.
- No impact or No significant impacts These impacts do no need to have
measures for mitigation.
- Minor and moderate impacts: For this tpe of impacts, the appropriate measures
for mitigation should be developed.
- Major impacts: it is necessary to   ave more detailed information and
quantification of impacts, and measures 'or mitigation have to be designed more
carefully during project preparation and onstruction.
-  Unknown impacts: it is necessary to ha e further study to know the nature and
scale of the impact.

3.2   CHARACTERISTICS OF THE         NVIRONMENTAL IN THE
MEKONG DELTA AND THE PF OJECT SITE
The Mekong Delta in Vietnam incli des 13 provinces and city, namely Long
An, Tien Giang, Ben Tre, An Giang, Dong Thap, Tra Vinh, Vinh Long, Hau Giang,
Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, Kien Giang and Can Tho city. Its total area is about
39,000kM2.
3.2.1 Topography
Topographic characteristics
Generated from Tibet, the Mekong River, 4.200 km in length, flows across
China, Myanrar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo ia and Vietnam then pour water to the
East Sea (South China Sea). Its basin is ab ut 783,000 kM2, of which 172,000 km2
is of the Upper and 611.000 km2 the Low  . The Lower part covers some 205,000
km2 in Laos, 184,000 km2 in Thailand, 15 ,000 km2 in Cambodia and 65,000 km2
in Vietnam. With the annual flow rate of 4 6 km3 the river ranks 10th in the world's
largest rivers in term.
The Delta of the Mekong River, inc sive of the region in Cambodia and the
Mekong Delta of Vietnam, is plain and low with 3.6 million ha lower than 2 m (< 2
m) over the sea level and 3.7 ha lower th  1 m (<1 m) over the sea level. As a
result of the low and plain topography and  e high flow rate of the Mekong (Tien)
and the Bassac (Hau) Rivers, drainage of witer in this Delta is very slow such that a:
large area is annually flooded. If the definition of wetlands, i.e. the regions
inundated temporarily or frequently, inclu ing land, forest, rice field or water of
rivers and lakes, applies, a major part of the Mekong Delta should be considered
wetlands.
* Topographic conditions for the buildin and dredging works
- Section of Ca Mau - Nam Can (F/Extens n)
This region is shallow and on averag 0.5 - 1.0 m under water with relatively
poor drainage. The influence by salt water n this region is heavy and long, more
than 9 months. Its salinity varies from low  medium. The end of the section (near
Nam Can) goes through a region of shallo acid sulfate soil under the mangrove
forest.
- Section of Kien Luong - Ha Tien (C/Exte sion)
The plain area adjacent to the estuar e does not suffer the direct influence
by the floods of the Mekong Delta. Neverth less it is inundated by tidal water from
rivers and canals if not protected by flood co trol dikes.

Environmental Impact Assessment ofAdditional (vil Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabili tion Project
The region of Ha Tien is a marsh a d tidal plain or shallow land. The alluvia
therein consist of humus or clay. The soil reviously deposited at marshes is heavy
clay. The deposit at the estuarine is poten al acid sulfate soil at the depth of 1.2 m
in marshes to above 2 m in alluvial grour s. This region is inundated 0.2 - 0.3 m
under the water for many weeks in every fM od.
- An Phuoc Landing Stage (Vinh Long Pi vince)
The river section at the position se ected for building the landing stage has
the average width of 600 m to 800 m. Th riverside is plain with many residential
blocks together with systems of small-sca  pottery kilns. On the Northeast bank is
Con Kien Islet belonging to Ben Tre prov ce which is mainly orchards on alluvial
grounds. The river bottom line presses aga st the bank on which the landing stages
will be built with the utmost depth of-14.5 m (Mui Nai hypsometric system.
- Binh Long Landing Stage (An Giang Pr vince)
The land subject to construction i a riverside low land, which is almost
abandoned. It is, however, rather plain ith the altitude from +3,Om to +3,5m
(National Hypsometric System). The regi  in front of the landing stage is deep.
The average depth is +l,Om near the bank, and -3.0 at the distance of 30m from the
bank. The watershed is stable with incon iderable sedimentation. In front of the
wharf is the Hau (Bassac) River, which can facilitate ships with tonnage up to 2,000
DWT.
- Giao Long Landing Stage (Ben Tre Prov ce)
This is a plain region of rice fields ntermixing with orchards and people's
houses. The bank of the river here is stra ht and the site is slightly hollow. The
average altitude along the river bank is on average 1 m higher than the flood tide
level. The river section at the landing st ges is about 1,000 in width with the
average bottom altitude of -10.Om, meanin that the site can facilitate cargo ships
and passenger ships and ferries of 500 T as well as sea/river going ships.
Nevertheless, on building the landing stag  the water adjacent to the bank should
be dredged for ships to easily turn and anchi.
- Long Duc landing stage (Tra Vinh provi, se)
The project site is a riverside stre h of orchards in a major part. It is
comparatively plain with the altitude of +1. m to + 2.Om (HN-72). Its site clearance
is complete. The water in front of the wha  is deep. The average depth is -1.0 m
near the bank, -5.0 m at the distance of 4 m. The bank is stable for many years
with inconsiderable sedimentation. In front f the landing stage is the flow of the

Co Chien River, which is under the mana ement of the River Control Branch 11. At
present, ships with tonnage up to 2,000 D 'VT can go by the passage from Vinh Thai
port through the port to Cung Hau Moutl Nevertheless, marine administration has
not covered the passage through Cung Haa estuary.
- Sa Dec Landing Stage (Dong Thap Pro ince)
The topography of the site is slopi g to the pier with the average altitude of
+2,20m/OMN at the existing warehous s, compared with the average altitude
+2,1 Om/OMN of the existing road (Nation 1 Road 80).
- Tac Cau Landing Stage (Kien Giang Pf vince)
The inland part has the natural alt tude of - 0.5m to +1.Om over Hon Dau
National Hypsometric System. The site is ollow with Nipa palms in water and fruit
trees on land. The inundated part upstrea n from Tac Cau Landing Stage is about
250 m, with the altitude of-0.5m to -2.0I near the bank, and -4.Om to-5.Om amid
the river.
3.2.2 Climate
* Tropical monsoon climate
The Mekong Delta is located in he zone of tropical monsoon climate.
Influenced by the Northeast (NE) and Sou hwest (SW) winds, air convection in this
plain causes in a year two distinct seasons ith a transition period.
The Southwest (SW) wind is domi ant in the rainy season, appearing in the
period when the atmospheric pressure of e continent is relatively low. The rainy
season in the Mekong Delta lasts from 1' to 190 days, from the late April to the
end of October. The rainy season appear e liest in the plain near Thailand gulf and
latest in the Northeast (My Tho-Go Cong . More than 85% of the annual rainfall
falls in the rainy season. However, during he rainy season there are two periods ol  
drought, each lasts about 10 - 15 days in  ay - June and August - September (Ba
Chan drought).
The season of Northeast (NE) wind s also called the dry season, lasting from
November to April with the dominant win from Northeast. The rainfall during the
dry season is accounting for only abo  15 percent of the total annual. The
evaporation and the sunny hours are very  gh then a large area of the Delta is dried
up. Because the flow of fresh water dec ases during the dry season, salinity of
water and soil increases, hampering agricul ure and water supply for domestic use.

. Rainfall
As a result of geographic factors, lie variation of rain distribution in the
Mekong Delta is dependent on not only t le season but also geographic position
from Southwest to Northeast.
The annual rainfalls have been recc rded by meteo hydrological stations in
the Delta since 1910. Data show the averag rainy days in a month, i.e. the day with
the rainfall of at least 1 mm. In details, it is 0-6 days in the dry season and 13 to 21
days in the rainy season. The annual rainfal of provinces in the Delta is of betweer.
1400 and 2400 mm.
September and October are the mor hs of highest rainfalls, about 200 mm,
sometimes over 300 mm. January and Febr iary are the months of poorest rain with
the average rainfall under 10 mm. Sometim s and as recorded by some stations, the
rainfall recorded in those months is even lo er than 1.0 mm.
In the Mekong Delta, the big diffi rence in rainfall is found not only in
months but also in years and regions as we11. The Southwest of the Delta has the
highest annual rainfall (more than 2.000 r nm/year). And going to the center, the
annual rainfall decreases to less than 1,5 0 mmn/year. And going further to the
Northeast, the rainfall again increases to m e than 1,750 mm (Table 3.1).

The relative moisture reaches a pe;k in the period of August to October,
varying in the range of 84 to 90%. The eva oration is lowest in February - March,
in the range of 65-80%.
Sunny hours and solar radiation als change seasonally. The highest values
of sunny hours and solar radiation reac  peaks in the end of the dry season
(February - March) (9 to 10 hours per da and 450,550Cal /m2, respectively). The
lowest values fall in September or Octobc , 5 - 7 hours/day and 360-400 Cal/M2,

3.2.3 Land resource
The interaction of numerous facto]  such as sedimentation, topography,
climate, hydrology and vegetation lead to t e formation of numerous kinds of soil
(Figur e 3.2). Considering the data collected land in the Delta can be classified into
8 classes as follows:
Sand soil
Accounting for 43,320 ha (1.1% oft te total), this kind of soil mainly exists
in the sand hillocks near estuaries in provinc s of Tra Vinh, Ben Tre and Soc Trang.
This soil has high capability of ionic exchan e, and very low organic decomposition
and fertility. Sometime its surface is slight  acidic yet the sub-stratum is always
neutral. The newly formed sand hillocks EXongside the coast are still salted, not
suitable for rice cultivation yet they can be v sed for developing some kinds of crops
adaptable to salty conditions.
* Saline soil
Saline soil is accounting for a large area of the coastal plain (744,550 ha),
from Long An till Ca Mau. Its organic co nposition is fairly high. Saline soil is
formed from marine sediment and the accum lation of acid in this soil is limited.
The medium and slightly saline soils 586,420 ha) is distributed in the places
where the altitude is of between 0.8-1.3 ml far from the coast and the density of
watercourses is low. Saline intrusion is main y because of the penetration of ground
water of high salinity.

Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilit; ion Project
The heavy saline soil covers 102, 00 ha, mainly in the places where the
altitude is lower (0.5-0.8 m), alongside the big rivers near the coast in provinces of
Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, Soc Trang, Long An an Ben Tre.
On the narrow coastal strip in prov ces of Ca Mau, Tra Vinh and Ben Tre
are many marshes covered by the mangrov forests. Saline-inundated marshes links
to various tide-leading canals and are usu lly inundated by sea water in the flood
tide. In the zone of saline soil, the salinity f soil is very high. In the dry season, the
surface layer contains about 0.5-0.7%  l. Under such conditions, only few
vegetation species can develop.
* Acid sulfate soil
Acid sulfate soil (ASS), accounts fIr 1,600,000 ha or 41% of the Delta, is
mainly found in the regions of Dong Thap Iuoi, Long Xuyen Quadrangle, Ca Mau
Peninsula and some spots in the region mid the Tien (Mekong) and the Hau
(Bassac) Rivers.
The soil containing alum-producing re (Pyrite -FeS2) is called potential acid
sulfate soil (PASS). The area of this soil i largest in Ca Mau peninsula. In the U
Minh forest, the PASS layer is as thick a 0.5-2.5 m. On this kind of soil, some
kinds of forests such as mangrove and mela uca can develop very well.
The contact between the PASS and xygen in the air as a result of dredging
and the like leads to oxidation of acidi  formulation materials and produces
sulfuric acid that in turn acidifies soil and Water. This case is the formation of actual
acid sulfate soil (AASS), which has low H, hampering cultivation of almost all
crops because only few species can suffer t e environment of pH as low as <4. The
AASS releases acid to surface water, damag ng aquaculture and crops.
* Alluvial soil
This soil class accounts for 1,184,8  (30.4% of the total area of the Delta),
distributing along the Tien and the Ha Rivers. Groups of alluvial soil are
formulated by the sedimentation in the N kong River. The soil has pH of 4.5 to
6.5, medium organic composition in the su ace layer and poor organic composition
at lower layers. It has medium organic ecomposition, low phosphate content,
medium ionic exchangeability. Alluvial soi is good for intensive cultivation and the
yield may be very high.
* Peat soil
This class of soils occupies some 24, 30 ha (0.6%), mostly in the West of Ca
Mau peninsula (U Minh forest) and smaller reas in Ha Tien and the Plain of Reeds.
Its thickness is 0.5 m -1.5 m. The upper yer is soft and the lower moisturized

layer is constituted of clay and a part of d composed organic matters. The lowest
layer is acid sulfate soil originated from aline-inundated marshes. It has poor
phosphate content but rich in (pyrite) (FeS2 On contacting with the air, the surface
layer can intoxicate crops. In the conditions f slight sulfate acid and salinity, some
trees such as mango, sugar cane, banana anl especially melaleuca can develop well
on peat lands.
* Grey soil
The grey soil on old alluvia terrace cc vers 134,650 ha, mainly in the North of
the Plain Reeds. It has poor contents of orga ic matters, nitrogen and phosphate. Its
acidity is however low (pH 3.5-5.0) and its ay content is high (30-40%). This kind
of soil is unsuitable for cultivation of ri  of high yield but it is suitable for
vegetable and other crops.
* Red-yellow soil
There are some 2,420 ha of this soi in the Northwest of the Long Xuyen
Quadrangle. Formed by the erosion of roc ;y mountains, the soil is very poor in
nutrition, organic matters, nitrogen and pho phate. Suitable trees include ecalyptus
and fruit trees such as mango and cashew.
* Hills and mountains
There area some 8.790 ha of hills ax mountains, mainly in An Giang and
Kien Giang. Soil there is mixed with pebble nd stone and highly eroded. This kind
of soil is exploited for production of constru ion materials.
3.2.4 Hydrology
* Overview of water resources of the Me ong Delta
The flow of the Mekong River is sig ficantly dependent upon the upstream
flows. The Tonle Sap is the river to link th Hau (Mekong) and the Tien (Bassac)
Rivers with the Great Lake of Cambodia.  e great lake has an important role to
play in regulation of the flow of branche in the Lower region. From May to
August, Tonle Sap receives water from the  ekong River via the Tonle Sap River.
In the other time, water is discharged frc m Tonle Sap to the Mekong River.
Therefore, Tonle Sap is also considered a nat ral regulator.
The average flow rate of the Mekong liver is 14,800m3/s. In the dry season,
it decreases to 2,000 m3/s (December). Sinc the Delta is plain, salining inundation
in the dry season occurs in almost all coastal lains. That is a hindrance to irrigation
and water supply in the region.

Hydrological characteristics of the sec on of Ca Mau - Nam Can
This is a region of interlacing canals bn a plain area with small slopes of the
basin as well as bottoms of canals.
It is however located amid two sea w ters of different marine systems. In the
West it is Gulf of Thailand with the un ven diurnal tidal regime and narrow
amplitude, and in the East it is the East  a with the uneven semi-diurnal tidai
regime and large amplitude.
* Hydrological characteristics of the sec on of Kien Luong - Ha Tien
The canal section of Kien Luong - F a Tien is influenced by factors such as
the current of the river, rain, tidal regimes  the Gulf of Thailand. A major part of
the section is under the influence by diurnal de, other places by semi-diurnal tide.
Those regimes influence on various egions at various times. However, in
general the hydrological regime in this re on is constituted of two seasons, the
flood season and the dry season.
The West Sea has the mixed tidal re me (inclining toward diurnal tide) and
the tidal amplitude of 0.8 . 1.Om with the ifference of 0.5 - 0.7m between twc
tidal peaks in a day yet an inconsiderable di erence between two bases.
The highest tidal amplitude in Rac Gia is 118 cm (on January) and the
lowest is 2 cm (on October). In this region, e flow regime is heavily influenced by
the tide of the West Sea and the flow of the Hau (Bassac) River, whereas the effect
of the in-field rain is inconsiderable. In the ry season, two flow regimes influences
at the same time on the region, yet the effe  of the West Sea (Gulf of Thailand) is
stronger then in the end of the dry seaso , saline intrusion goes further inland.
Nevertheless, since the water level average n the West of the Hau River is always
higher than that of Rach Gia, the current te s to flow from the Hau River to Rach
Gia gulf. Floods usually appear in late A ust or early September. In the flood
season, almost all the region is inundated ith the maximum inundation depth of
1.0 . 1.5m at the center, usually in late  ptember or early October. The flood
usually lasts for 2 to 4 months. On Nov mber, water begins to drain and the
drainage is almost complete by mid Decemb r.
An Phuoc Landing Stage
The whole region is influenced by u even semi-diurnal tide of the East Sea
(South China Sea) via two main rivers, th Tien (Mekong) and the Hau (Bassac),
which are cross-linked by the Mang Thit Ri er. The waver level and tidal amplitude
are very high, the intensity of tidal transfe is high, and the tidal amplitude is 70-

90cm in the flood season and 114-140cm in he dry season. In combination with the
interlacing canals, it is possible to conduct t e self-watering for the region. Besides,
good drainage at high land near the banks (if the Tien River (the region where the
landing stages is built) can be utilized.
* Binh Long Landing Stage
- The landing stage is located on the Hau Bassac) River then it is influenced by
the tidal regime of the river that is uneve semi-diurnal with two flood tides and
two ebb tides in a day. The tidal amplituc is of between 0.40m - 1.00m.
- Current: In general, the current is parallel with the banks, the current velocity is
V = 0.42m/s in flood tide and V = 0.90n Js in ebb tide, the maximum velocity is
Vmax = 1.15m/s.
- Wave regime: because the landing stage is located further in land, waves in the
water are small. Waves there are mostly caused by wind and ships; their height
is, according to statistic date, usually loA zr than 0.5m.
* Giao Long Landing Stage
The hydrological regime in Ben Tre  controlled by many factors such as the
water regime of the Mekong Delta, rain and the tidal regime of the East Sea.
Those factors influence on various egions in various times yet in general,
the hydrological regime in the site is divide i into two seasons, the flood season and
the ebb season. The tidal regime of the Eas Sea is semi-diurnal with the amplitude
of 2.5 - 3.0 m, with the difference of 0.3 . 0.5 m between two tidal peaks in a day
yet an inconsiderable difference between tw bases.
* Long Duc Landing Stage
- The landing stage is influenced by th hydrological regime of the Co Chien
River, which is complicated with the influences of the uneven semi-diurnal
regime of the East Sea and the upstrea  flood as well. The maximum of tidal
amplitude at Tra Vinh station is of betw en 3.3Gm - 3.50 m.
- Current: In general, the current is parall l with the banks, the current velocity is
V = 0.52m/s in flood tide and V = 1.56  s in ebb tide, the maximum velocity is
Vmax = 1.86 m/s, downstream.
- Wave regime: because the landing stag s is located further in land, waves in the
water are small. Waves caused by lo al wind are weak; the effective wave

height (H1/3) is usually lower than 0.3 n. During storms (very rare), wave can
reach the thresholds of 0.5 m.
* Sa Dec Landing Stage
The hydrological regime in Sa Dec is influenced by the uneven semi-diurnal
tide with the amplitude of between 2.5 - 3.0r .
* Tac Cau Landing Stage
The tidal regime in the Gulf of Thaila id is mainly uneven diurnal with small
amplitude (almost less than lm).
3.3 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
3.3.1 Aquatic ecosystem
* Overviews of the aquatic ecosystems in the Mekong Delta
In association with hydrology water uality (salinity and acidity level) three
aquatic ecosystems are determined in the M ;ong Delta, namely:
- Fresh water
- Brackish water
- Saline water
- Fresh water
The main characteristics of the fresh  ater ecosystem include:
- Neutral or slightly acidic pH (pH  .0-7.5) in both canals and rivers.
- Low salinity with EC < 2000 pLS/I in both seasons.
- Low suspended solids
- Large variation of DO concentr ion (2.5-4.0 mg/l in the significantly
polluted canals and 5.0-7.5 mg/l iI the rivers).
- Low concentrations of ammonium nitrate and phosphates.
- Low concentrations of some chem cal pesticides.
With the physical and chemical char ateristics as mentioned above, the fresh
water is mainly polluted by organic matters which may be harmful for various fish
and shrimp species.
According to The Mekong Delta Ma er Plan Project (1991-1993) conducted
by NEDECO, in the fresh water in the Mek ng Delta are 260 fish species, of which

57 have high economic values. The most p pular families include Cyprinidae (84
species), Gobiidae Schilbeidae (1 3 species), Ariidae (II species)... Besides, there
are some shrimp species, particularly green -.rayfish (Macrobrachium rosenbergii)
of high economic value.
-Acidic water
This ecosystem covers large areas in he Plain of Reeds (Dong Thap Muoi),
Long Xuyen Quadrangle and the Middle o Ca Mau peninsula. A characteristic of
water in this region is high acidity (pH 3.0-5 0), with high concentration of iron and
aluminum. In canals and fields with high acidity only some acid-tolerant fish
species can live (for instance Ophiocephalid e, Anabatidae, Claridae...).
- Brackish water and saline water
This is located in the coastal or estua ne areas where the salinity is medium
(5-7%o) or high (15-25%o). Its water has high contents of nutrients and solid matters.
In the brackish and saline water in th Mekong Delta 278 species of phyto-
plankton species with the density of 114, 00-3,103,300 individual /m3, and 36
zooplankton species and 152 fish species we e identified.
* Aquatic ecosystem in the project site
a. Section of Ca Mau - Nam Can (F Exten ion)
A feature of this section is high  linity (>5%o) and the present heavy
pollution due to organic matters and slight xollution of oil and bacteria. There are
various fish species of high economic value (anchovy, snapper, scads, etc...). Their
number is reduced due to overexploitatio and use of chemicals pesticides and
pollution due to waste matters.

All aquatic species indicate an envir ment rich of organic matters in acidic
water.
The composition and quantity of  uatic species in the section of Kien
Luong - Ha Tien are typical for a wate ourse of slightly brackish water and
strongly acidic water (pH < 5.5).
3.3.2 Terrestrial ecosystem
* Terrestrial ecosystems in the Mekong elta
In the Mekong Delta, the plain is se arated from the sea by wetland forests'
the original area of which is half a millio hectares. In 1998, the total area of the
forest shrunk to 180,000 ha and in 2003 it was only about 150,000ha. There are two
kinds of forests in the Delta, namely the mangrove forest in coastal saline marshes
and the melaleuca forest on inland wetland
- Mangrove eco-system
The mangrove forest in the Delta has 46 species saline and tolerate of
vegetation in which Rhizophora, Avicenn , Bruguiera, Nipa, and Sonneratia spp.
are dominant. In the past, the forest covered some 250,000 ha of the Delta. During
the Vietnam War, 124,000 ha were destro ed due to herbicides sprayed by the US
Army. After the Liberation (1975), the  ea and quality of the forest has been
damaged due to exploitation of wood as uel, reclaiming land for rice cultivation
and shrimp farming.
In Ca Mau peninsula, where the s dimentation of the Mekong Delta still
continues and expands the Western and S Lthem coasts by 30 - 50 m in a year, sea
waves are weak and the mangrove fore s are thick. The dominant species are
Avicenna a.officinalis, A.alba, Rhizopho a (R. apiculata), Luminitzera Ceriops,
which develop thickly over a large area al gside canals of brackish water.
Along the Ha Tien Plain, since the idal amplitude is low and the degree of
sedimentation is limited, the mangrove fo st has poorly developed and the density
of Avicenna and Sonneratia. Rhizophora low in this region.
- Melaleuca ecosystem
By 2003, the area of melaleuca fo st in the Delta was only 100,000 ha. In
the past, there were at least 200,000 ha o melaleuca forest on areas of acid sulfate
soil. Melaleuca is the sole wood tree dapted to soil of heavy acid sulfate.
Therefore, melaleuca usually develops in he seasonal (temporary) inundated land.
where the environment is not suitable for lItivation of rice, crops and vegetable.

Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilital on Project
- Roles of mangrove and melaleuca forest
The mangrove forest and melaleuca irest are the place for many fish species
to lay eggs and grow up. Those include s iwater fish in the early stage of growth
and shrimp species of high economic valu Deforestation of the wetland anywhere
can lead to the destruction of a larger harine biota, not only because of the
disappearance of food but also the habitat of young individuals. Besides, erosion
due to clearance of the mangrove forest is ausative of deposition and occlusion of
canals which have been used as passage.
Coastal erosion in the Mekong De a has appeared at a higher and higher
frequency due to deforestation of the wetl ad in the recent decades. The forest also
plays an important role in soil improvem t. Vegetation species in the mangrove
forest not only curb the alluvial erosion but also accumulate soil around their
respiratory roots. Since the roots cause de osition of alluvia and at the same time
decrease the tidal speed, the mangrove for t can reduce coastal erosion. As long as
the forest moves to the sea, the land beco es higher and drier and gradually turns
to be suitable for cultivation or developm nt of forests . Rhizopora and melaleuca
are furthermore important sources of fuel  d wood in the Delta.
In this project, activities in canal clcging, spoil disposal will not encroach
into the magrove and melaleuca forest ar , due to along some parts of the canal
sections there is only a thin belt of Nipa p m but not a real natural forests. Area of
Nipa palm to be cut off may be replanted a other sites along the canals.
- Estuarine ecosystem
An estuary is a place where fresh  ater from the river meets the sea. It is
strongly influenced by the tide and the mix ng of saline and fresh water, the volume
of fresh water is in turn dependent on th season and the flow rate of the river.
Estuaries hold important processes such s transport of nutrients and plankton:
migration of larvae, carcass of animals an vegetation and furthermore determine
the forms of coastal sediment. The estuari  ecosystem is one of the most abundant
and active ecosystem. However, it is easil influenced by environmental pollution
and changes in water regime (temperature salinity, and alluvia). Those factors can
even break down the ecosystem.
A major part of fish species in Ca  au is dependent on the estuary. Their
migration and reproduction are influence deeply by regimes of the river and tide.
The life cycle of shrimp species of high v ue in Ca Mau is dependent much on the
estuarine environment. They reproduce in he coastal water and the larvae migrate
to the brackish water by means of the tid flow. Young shrimps live some 2 to 4
months in the estuary, where they can find prey and also residence against
opponent species. Then they come back to he sea.

- Animal resources
Wild animals in the wetland of the /Iekong Delta are abundant. In the past,
there were 23 mammal species such as mc  ey, deer (Cervus unicolor), wild boar
(Sus scrofa), otter (Lutra lutra), leopard P?eofelis nebulosa) Macaca munata, wild
cat (Vivera chaus), wild cat (Felis riverrin ,... They were found mostly in U Minh
melaleuca forest and mangrove forests in N m Can. However, at present, only Lutra
lutra may be obseved.
The wetland in the Delta creates exc Ilent conditions for reptile species such
as snakes (Bulgarusfasciatus, Naja naja), ython (Python reticulatus, P. molurus),
gecko (Gekko gekko), varan (varanus spp.), turtle (Cuora amboinenesis, Malayemys
subtrijuga... )
The wetland is also the residence or numerous bird species, particularly
water birds including the endangered ones such as red-head crane (Grus antigone
sharpii), Ibis leucocephalus, Leptoptilos ja anicus, Leptotilos dubius, Threskiornis
melanocephalus, etc.
Human activities such as settleme t, war, agriculture, and hunting have
caused heavy damages to the wild life inc iding that of bird species. As reported:
the number of red-head crane in the Nati nal Park of Tram Chim was 20-30 in
1985, 114 in 1986 then quickly rose to 400 in 1987 and 1052 in 1988. However, in
1995 it fell to 861, then 500 in 1998 and ab( ut 350 in 2003.
In the mangrove forest of Nam C n, in 1989 it was found 6 amphibian
species, 18 reptile species, 41 bird species ind 15 mammal species including some
precious and endangered ones (as spec fied in Regulation 18 HDBT dated
17.01.1992) such as panther (Panthera tigr ), otter (Lutra lutra), leopard (Neofelis
nebulosa). Nevertheless, except otter, other pecies disappeared.
* The bird sanctuary in Ca Mau - Nam Can area
In Ca Mau province are 21 bird sa ctuaries, of which one is semi-natural,
three are abandoned (Dam Doi, Cha La, Ho Thi Ky) and 3 are not investigated yet.
Almost all of them are people-controlled.  addition to hunting and cutting trees,
deforestation for shrimp farning has cause 10 bird sanctuaries to disappear. Some
rare bird species, which had been observed  bird sanctuaries in the province, such
as  pink-leg  pelican  (Pelecanus  onoc otalus), grey  painted  stork  (Ibis
leucocephalus), and Leptoptilos dubius are no longer seen in the province.
Usually bird sanctuaries are natura hybrid forests with main vegetation
species such as Rhizophora, Bruguiera, vicenna, accounting for 70%. Other
species such as Phoenix paludosa account fir some 30%.

The Bird Sanctuary is about 25 km  om Ca Mau town, about 30 km to the
Southeast coast, distance from the Sanct ary to the Ca Mau - Nam Can canal
section is about 2.0km.
Cha La bird sanctuary is formed from a former mangrove forest. It is
surrounded by crop land. Its area is about 1 .7 ha and enlargeable (buffer zone is 50
ha). The predominant plant is Phoenix paludosa, Nypa fruticans, Aegiceras,
Bruguiera, Acrostichum,... Birds, especial y, immigrant birds live and breed here
with the great number (about 50,000 indivi uals) such as: little grebe (Tachybaptus
ruficollis), purple heron (Ardea purpurea, frigate bird, night heron, green-billed
malcoha, oriental darter (Anhinga melanog ster), minivet, ibis, asian open-bill stork
(Anastomus oscitans), spotted-neck dove (S reptopelia chinensis)...

- Ong Doc River: The canal to be dredg d is expanded and curved, land hem, is
mainly residential land and orchards.
- Luong The Tran canal: The section to b expanded on the right belongs to Tran
Van Thoi district and Ca Mau City. At present, land is used for 2-crop rice
cultivation from May to November. In 2003, the production met myriad
difficulties because of shortage of fresh water and the abandonment of land
returned. People aggregate near Luong he Tran bridge and the right bank along
the stone path of Cai Nuoc district, meai ing that other regions are not populated.
- Canal of Ganh Hao - Bay Hap: The zone alongside the canal is mangrove
forests with several shrimp ponds. L, d is used for forestation and 1-crop
shrimp-breeding from January to April. Since there is no road, the population of
this region is very small.
- Nam Can canal: The zone alongside th canal is mangrove forests and shrimp
ponds. Land is used for forestation and intensive 1-crop shrimp-breeding from
January to April. The population is very mall, except for Nam Can town.
3.4.2 Section of Rach Gia - Ha Tien
Through site study, it is possible to a sess the existing land along the canal of
Kien Luong - Ha Tien as follows:
- The canal section is expanded to the ight. Residential areas develop on the
banks within the distance of 50 m. L md is used for forestation and 1-crop
shrimp breeding from April to July. O  the right bank, the population is very
small since there is no road. People aggregate to the junction (Hoa Dien
commune). In opposite, as roads exist on the left bank, the population there is
dense.
- Ha Tien Marsh: the work here includes redging for deeper passage. Around the
marsh are forests and shrimp ponds in use from April to July. People mainly
aggregate in Ha Tien town.
3.5   EXISTING WATER QUALITY 0        THE PROJECT SITE
A purpose of the pre-construction e ivironmental monitoring is to set up a
basic environmental database for the sites of building and dredging. That is for
comparing the environmental changes ove phases: pre-construction, construction
and operation. The analyzing results of th water quality in the pre-construction

Comment:
Considering the tables 3.7, 3.8 a alyses, it is possible to give some
comments on the water quality of the sectio of Ca Mau - Nam Can as follows:
- Turbidity
Turbidity measured along the river  as 169-378 NTU. It was high at almost
all measuring points.
- Suspended solid (SS)
The total suspended solid measured n the river was in the range of 18 - 46
mg/l. As such, the concentration of sus nded solid in the river still met the
Vietnamese standard (TCVN 5942-1995 sti lulates it at 80 mg/l for Source Class B),
which is shown in Annex 2.

- Dissolved oxygen (DO)
The measured concentration of di olved oxygen 3.1-3.4 mg/l met the
Vietnamese standard (TCVN 5942-1995 sti ulates on Source Class B at > 2mg/1),
but not meet the standard for source class A  mg/I).
- Nitrite, nitrate and ammonia
The nitrate concentration (N03-) ve ed in the range of 0.34- 0.84 mg/I,

The concentrations measured at all 3 pc nts were lower than the Vietnamese
Environmental Standard (TCVN 5942-1995 on Source Class B is 0.05mg/I).
The concentration of NFH4 varied  the range of 0.69- 1.46 mg/I. The
concentration of ammonia at Km 332 wa higher than the Vietnamese standard
(TCVN 5942-1995, < 1 mg/1).
- Organic pollution
The COD concentration of the river et the Vietnamese standard for source
class B (TCVN 5942-1995: <35mg/i), but d fes not meet the Standard for A source.
The BOD    concentration measured in the river was lower than the
Vietnamese standard for source class B (1 CVN 5942 - 1995: < 25 mg/i), but it
exceeds the Standard for source class A (< mg/l).
- Total Coliform
All monitoring points showed hil h concentrations of coliforms. At 3
monitoring points the concentration were ligher than the Vietnamese Standard on
Source Class B (TCVN 5942-1995: 10.000 lPN/100ml).
- Pollution due to heavy metals
Measuring data showed that the conc ntrations of all heaNy meals in water of
the river were lower than the Vietnamese st ;mdard for source class A (TCVN 5942-
1995).

Following the suggestions of the Chief of the Department of Land
Management (in 1967) and base on saline p centage of soil, classification could be
made as presented in the Table 3.16: The  S, 504 - parameters and total dissolved
solids (TDS) are useful references for lan  use planning and also for looking of
improving measures.

* Section of Ca Mau - Nam Can
The main water way from Ca Mau t Nam Can has a distance about 55 km,
passing Dam Doi and Cai Nuoc districts and takes its end at Nam Can town.
Because of low land level almost area alor the way is covered by saline and acid
sulphate soils.
Despite of acid sulfate soil the pH vz |ue is rather high ranging in 5.33 - 7.92.
Because of strong saline water, salinity of river water at the present time is (25 - 27
g/l), the concentration of Cl - being in a ra ge (0.56 - 1.78 %) and correlative EC
index (5.3 - 7.8 mS/cm) are very high.
On the contrary, the pH (H202) valu rather low (0.96 - 2.68). It shows that
the soil is organic rich, and is the main cau e of potential pyrite origination (FeS2).
The S042- (%) percentage is correlatively h h (0.24 - 1.27); the Fe +concentration
is very high, being higher than > 200 (mg/10 g).
Combining the description of soil p file to diagnose acid soil layer and the
analyzed results some commends could be nade as follows:
- At the following points as CM-01, CM 02, CM-05, CM-07, CM-08 soil is in
strong potential acid sulfate category. A some points the acid layer is shallow,
and at the other it is at deep level.
- At the remaining points of section of Ca Mau - Nam Can: CM-03, CM-04, CM-
06 potential acid degree is insignificant.
* Section of Ha Tien - Kien Luong
The main waterway from Kien Luonj to Ha Tien has a distance about 18 km,
passing Thuan Yen and Hoa Dien comm es. Concerning with river water it is
clear that the salinity is gradually decr ses from Kien Luong to Ha Tien.
Specifically, the salinity at Ha Giang Ferry ,iearby Dong Ho lagoon) is of 25.2 g/l,
while it is of 5.5 g/l at Kien Luong town. Co cerning with topography the land level
is getting higher from Kien Luong to Ha T n. So as, in the area nearby soil is of
potential acid category (pyrite), and along the Kien Luong direction active acid
sulfate soil gradually occurs (Jarosit).
In general, pH value is at slight acid' (5.65 - 6.53). Except for two points
in Kien Luong KG-12 and KG-13, which h ve high acidity, low pH (3.37 - 4.07)
due to impact of actual acid sulfate sulfate s 1, but pH(H202) index remains in very
low level (0.66 - 2.08).

The concentration of S042- (0.5 - 1.3 %) and Fe2+ (160 - 254 mg/1OOg) are
rather high.
This area is strongly effected by salin water, therefore the percentage of Cl-
is varying in a range of (0.68 - 1.47 %) and concentration of EC is very high (4.7 -
6.9 ms/cm).
According to the analyzed in the areq along the Ha Tien - Kien Luong soil

ASSESSMENT OF ENVIR NMENTAL IMPACTS
4.1   ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVI ONMENTAL IMPACTS BY THE
PROJECT IN THE PRE-CONSTI UCTION PHASE
- In the pre-construction phase, beca se investigations and geological survey
drilling are being carried out, in the short me (1 to 2 months), at the sites of the
project, therefore, impacts on the natural en ironment are expected as minor.
- The most significant impacts in this phase is negative effect on local
production (agriculture, orchards aquacult Ire) and income of households having
land was cleared for enlarging canal.
These impacts are negative, modera e , long term but mitigable if the PMU
combines with local authorities to cary out a proper compensation and
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). This iml act is detaily assessed in a RAP report
prepared by PMU-w.
4.2   IMPACTS DURING THE CONS         UCTION PHASE
4.2.1 Impacts by additional dredging of wo extension waterways
The following impacts on the natura environment along the canal sections in
the construction phase are expected:
- Canal water will be acidified because f the leakage of acidic materials from
dredged sediment particulary at the secti n Kien Luong - Ha Tien.
- Increase in turbidity and heavy metals in canal water as a result of dredging and
enlarging the canals.
- Agriculture (rice, vegetable, orchards) a uaculture activities will be effected due
to disposal of dredged materials.
- Sligh change in canal hydrology.
* Impact on water quality
- The dredging by dredgers will cau  an increase in turbidity and suspended
solid (SS), particularly when the canals are redged with the mud-suction technique.

Environmental Impact Assessment of Additional Ci l Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitat on Project
The increase in turbidity, heavy me is and pesticides from canal sediment
during the dredging period can threaten t} e supply of water for aquaculture and
domestic uses.
Although the concentrations of toxi substances in the bottom mud of the
two canals are lower than the Dutch standar on bottom mud, scouring can cause an
increase in the concentration of heavy me als in the water of the canals that are
dredged.
- The increase in water pollution because f suspended solid and turbidity causes
damages to fish and shrimp. A major pa t of fish species cannot live in the water
that has the suspended solid concentrat on of over 2000 mg/I. Therefore, they
must migrate out of the water of high urbidity. High turbidity and suspended
solid concentration hinder oxygen from the air dissolving into water, limit the
ability of fish in preying upon and therety damage fish.
- It is a worldwide experience that dredgi ig with dredging buckets causes lighter
impacts than dredgers.
- However, from the monitoring results for this project at other canal section,
where had been dredged, it may indical d that during dredging, fixh or shrimp
death was not observed at the canals. T refore, this impact is assessed as minor
and short-term.
- Dredging will cause disorders and  amages to the habitats of biological
organisms on the banks and at the car al-bed. Only after a space of time big
benthic animals can return. The excal ation of two banks can decrease fish
habitats. Therefore, the constructors shc Id dredge only one bank at the narrow
sections in order to limit these negative i pacts.
- Enlarging the canal will also cause dam ge to Nipa palm belt along some part of
section Ca Mau-Nam Can. This impact is assessed as minor due to the area of
Nipa palm to be cut off may be replan ed at other area along the canals after
dredging and compensation for loss of Npa palm will be done (see RAP report).
- There are many species of aquatic anin als of saline and brackish waters in the
canal sections of Kien Luong - Ha Tier and Ca Mau - Nam Can. Nevertheless,
the dredging and enlarging of the cana s will not change the salinity of water.
Therefore, the change in the composi ion of aquatic species will not occur
during and after dredging.
- Increase in concentrations of heavy me ls in water is expected as negative, bui
minor and short-term at the both sectio s Ca Mau - Nam Can and moderate at
Kien Luong - Ha Tien section and short erm.

Environmental Impact Assessment ofAdditional C ' il Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilit ion Project
- Increase of acidity in water, particulary at the section Kien Luong - Ha Tien is
expected as significant but short-term.
The expansion and dredging of cana in regions of sulfate acid soils results in
the exposure of pyrite (FeS2) to the air and with the presence of water, the
oxidation of pyrite and formation of acid od cur with the mechanism as follows:
2FeS2 + 2H20 + 702     - 2 FeS l4 + 2H2S04 (strong acid)
2FeSO4 + 02 + 2H2S04   -+2 Fe2 S04 )3 + 2H20
FeSO4 + 6H2S04         - 2Fe(C tH)3 + 3H2S04
At a lower pH pyrite can be oxidizes with the presence of Fe3+ ions:
FeS2 + 14Fe3+ + 8H20 -* 15Fe2+ -l 2SO42- + 16H+
The conversion of ferrous sulfate tc ferric sulfate is very slow at a pH lower
than 4 but it very quick with micro-organic catalyst (soil-oxidizing microorganism).
The acidification of water is depend : nt on. the following factors:
- The dredged volume of acidic botto  mud and the acidity of bottom mud;
- Dimension of SRAs where acid sulf te soil and bottom mud are disposed;
- Run off of acidic water from SRAs 1 surroundings.
Assessment on environmental impacts duo to high water acidity (low pH)
Many studies show that in the Me iong Delta in the dry season, the acidic
water goes up by capillarity to the soil sur ace. The acid materials stagnate together
with aluminum and iron sulfates on those urfaces. In the first months of the rainy
season (May to July), the acids accumulated on the soil surface are washed away to
canals and fields to acidify water and soil. i cording to the previous observations, in
the Kien Luong - Ha Tien section, in begin iing of the rainy season, acidifying water
from Long Xuyen Quadrangle flow down causing acidification the whole canal,
result in the high water acidity.
Increase in the water acidity of car als and fields may lead to affect life of
fish and shrimp. The harm of acidity (thr ugh pH) of water to shrimp and fish is
outlined and shown in Table 4.1

The acidification and transfer of aci ic water that is generated by dredging
and digging canals crossing acid sulfate s il area will cause negative impacts on
water quality, aquatic biota, aquaculture, ater supply and irrigation inside and
around the dredging zone.
Due to location in actual acid sulph te soil area, water acidification in the
section of Kien Luong - Ha Tien will be hig er than that in the section of Ca Mau -
Nam Can. However, in the both canal se ions influence of salinity intrusion is
strong, pH of canal water is normally > 3.4 5.3 (at section Kien Luong - Ha Tien)
and 7.0-7.3 (at section Ca Mau - Nam C n). Therefore, mass death of fish and
shrimps during dredging may not occur.
Leakage of acidic water from SRAs
The acid in mud and soil is not in  diately transferred to the environment
yet it exists in the dredged soil for many ye irs. Pyrite in mud is oxidized gradually
in many years by oxygen penetrating in  soil. When pyrite is oxidized, the
diffusion of end products of the oxidation t the surface is also slow. In heavy clay
the transfer of products from the oxidatio of pyrite (namely HW. Fe2+. Al3+ and
SO42-) occurs mainly by capillarity. When t ose substances go up to the superficial
layer, they accumulate in the form of acidi salts that are dissolved and brought to
nearby fields and ponds, causing acidificatio therein.
Lesson learned from the dredging of ections D-F and B-C of this project in
2002-2003 show that water leak from spo 1 relocation area may increase water
acidity of the surrounding canals and fields. ee Environmental Monitoring Reports
conducted by EPC in 2002-2003).
* Increase the heavy metal in the canal ter
Although heavy metals in sediment o Ca Mau - Nam Can, Kien Luong - Ha
Tien canals is much lower than Dutch St ndard (Chapter Three), but dredging
activities will increase their content in the ater. Heavy metals in sediment along
the canal are showed in Table 3.11 and Table 3.13 and Dutch Standard is at
Appendix 3.

* Possible changes in salinity intrusion
- Section of Kien Luong - Ha Tien: mainl dredging 1-1.8m deeper, canal bottom
is 22m width, one side enlarging in the cope less than 6m. There is not heavily
change of flow of the channels. Theref re, there is not considerable change of
salinity intrusion.
- Section of Ca Mau - Nam Can: mainly mproving Luong The Tran canal to be
used for waterway transport with abov technical size will not increase salinity
intrusion and change hydrological regime.
- Because of the slight change of canalbe  not increase of seawater enter canal on
the spring-tide; the enlargement and dre ging of two waterways may not change
the salinity intrusion at the area.
- The impacts on salinity intrusion in th Mekong Delta is mainly caused by the
upstream activities in water intake. Th re are not data shown the impacts o;:
NT2, Chinese dams on the salinity, but t e Project of Mekong Delta Master Plan
(1991-1993) conducted by NEDECO has calculated that in case offresh water
intake will be increased 500m3/s more, the 4%o salinity contour in the Mekong
Delta will go to the inland about 2 )  more. This is an impact caused by
upstream development but not by this pr *ect.
* Disturbance of bottom sediment and i icrease in water turbidity
- The construction and dredging activiti  will move bottom mud to banks and
move soil at two banks. They may sigl ificantly increase in suspended solid as
well as pollutants from bottom mud and rom acid sulfate soil at the banks.
- The disturbance of bottom mud and aci sulfate soil will acidify and reduce pH
of the canal water, thereby increase in  ncentrations of metals (iron, aluminum
and heavy metals) in canal water. In sbme other sections, the suspended solid
contains pollutants such as heavy meta , pesticides, grease and oil and bacteria
accumulating in bottom sediment. Ther ore, dredging also pollutes canals.
- The disturbed water and the pollutants thereof badly influence aquatic animals
and many species may migrate. Fui hermore, pollutants in water can be
accumulated in shrimp, fish, shellfish and vegetation in the canals, causing
damages to human beings through the f( od chains.
However, from the monitoring results i 2003 at other sections of this project,
this impacts is assessed as minor, and n significant.

Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitat ion Project
* Increase in water pollution during dre lging
The Kien Luong - Ha Tien canal se tion crosses large areas of acid sulfate
soil. When exposing to the air and water, aci i soil may create acids.
- The acidification of water source inc eases the solubility of metals (iron,
aluminum) in the soil. The impact is cl arly seen at the section being dredged
and furthermore, it influences the surrc undings because of runoff water. The
reduction of pH and increment of met 1 contents can cause damage to both
aquatic and terrestrial systems as well as o quality of agricultural land.
- This impact can be more severe in the rainy season when rainwater runs off
from the SRAs to surroundings or adjace it waterway sections.
- The transport of dredged soil via pip ines of dredgers can cause extensive
impacts in case of leakage or spillage. T e leakage will lead to sharp increases in
turbidity and acidity near the dredging ite and the spillage can damage water
and agricultural land that surround the dr dging site.
From the monitoring reports for the cther sections of this project (in 2002-
2003 by EPC), this impact is assessed as mir or and mitigable.
* Impacts on biological environment
Generally, dredging activity causes iegative impacts on the biological
environment. It affects both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, especially to fish and
shrimp species:
- Enlarging canal banks 3-5m causes dar age to plants (mainly Nipa palm and
aquatic weeds) grown on the banks.
- Dredging canal bottom causes direct influence on planktons and benthic
animals. They are the basic componei ts of the habitat, feeding to fish and
other aquatic animals. The loss of the iving environment due to changes in
the existing banks will reduce the food source and the vegetation cover ther-
fish and other aquatic animals must r 'grate away. The reduction in food,
turbid water, reduced dissolved oxyg n and increased pollutants together
with the increase in acidity will force X ome mollusk and crustacean species,
shrimp and crabs to migrate or die. At t e dredging sites the concentrations of
pollutants will likely do not meet the wa er quality standards for aquaculture.
- To restoring the biological environmen- and species composition, it can take
several years or longer after the river bed and banks become stable.

- Other aquatic species such as water hyaci th and reed and the bottom vegetation
cover can also be damaged. Those specie have an important role to play in the
supply of oxygen, food and at the same time in stopping the waves that ship in
operation cause.
The above mentioned impacts may occur t 2 canal sections. However, dredging
capacity will not be high (almost 3.0 mil tot s of soil and seciment), these impacts
are expected as moderate and temporary.
* Impact on Chala Bird Sanctuary
Cha La Bird Sanctuary is formed f lom a former mangrove forest. It is
surrounded by crop land. Its area is about 1 .7 ha and enlargeable (buffer zone is
50 ha). The predominant plants are Phoeni; paludosa, Nypa fruticans, Aegiceras,
Brutguiera, Acrostichum,... Birds, especial,  grant birds live and breed here
with the great number (about 50,000 b rds in 2003) such as: little grebe
(Tachybaptus ruficollis), purple heron (Arde purpurea), frigate bird, night heron,
green-billed malcoha, oriental darter (Anhi a melanogaster), minivet, ibis, asian
open-bill stork (Anastomus oscitans), spottec I-neck dove (Streptopelia chinensis)...
Activities of construction, dredging, spoil disposal cause negative effect
on this ecosystem. However, the field surv y shows that Chala Bird Sanctuary is
further 2km from the canal section to be dr dged, so the noise from dredger will
not effect on the sanctuary.
Additionally, the spoil relocated areas will be about 2km from the
sanctuary, so the impact to the Bird Sar ctuary in the construction phase is
assessed as minor and mitigable.
* Impact on aquaculture
The construction phase will last sor e months at each section. This will
cause negative effect on local aquaculture, ( ue to the following reasons:
- Water intaken for shrimp culture wil be contaminated by turbidity and
acidity. Particularly, soil along section of Kien Luong - Ha Tien is heavy
acidified, therefore, the dredging activi ies may increase the water acidity,
caused damage for aquaculture in the are a.

- Wastewater leak from the SRAs may c use death of shrimp in the surrouding
shrimp ponds.
The incident of overflow of wasteA ter and embankment breakdown may
kill shrimp and fish in canals and ponds.
- Wastewater from construction sites a d dredgers discharged into the canal
may damage water quality that effec on aquacultural ponds where intake
canal water.
It is able to evaluate that the redging activities of two additional
waterways may cause significant effect o aquaculture at Ha Tien and Nam Can
areas, this negative impact is assessed as moderate, but controllable. Therefore,
Project Management Unit will co-operat with the consultants (SMEC) and the
constructor to choose the right area for SR As and implement a proper monitoring
program to prevent the predicted impact.
* Solid waste and wastewater
The increase in volume of efflu nt, lubricants oil, and garbage from
construction machines, dredgers and wo kers during the construction phase is
expected. That will pollute canal water and may damage aquatic animals and
aquaculture. This impact is assessed as ne ative but minor and controllable due to
dredging capacity will not be great and dre ing duration will be short.
* Impact on floating market
Along two canals, there is not any fl ating market as well as rural market site
on the canal. Therefore, it is possible to e pect that the construction activities will
not effect to trading activities of local peopl.
4.2.2 Impacts due to the construction o anding stages (LSs)
* Identification of impacts during build ng LSs.
Construction of LSs may cause s me negative potential impacts on the
environment and aquatic habitat as follows
- Air, noise, vibration pollution  ue to construction, material transport,
material loading and unloading.
- Water pollution due to increase in turbidity, and grease and oil from
pneumatic hammers.

- Damage to aquatic habitat due to  astes and grease and oil from dredgers
and other construction activities.
- Damages to the aquatic ecosystems due to changes in bottom habitats and
riverbeds.
The mentioned impacts are assessed i details as follows:
* Air, noise and vibration pollution
In the construction phase of the Land ng Stages air and noise pollution at the
construction site ill be a problem. The reasa of air and noise pollution is activities
of construction machines (trucks, excavat rs,...), material transport, loading and
unloading.
Detail assesment of air and noise pollution generated by construction
activities is given in Section 4.2.3.
Due to the construction duration is hort, construction scales is small and
there is not sensitive receptors (offices, schc Is, religious buildings) located nearby
the proposed LSs, this impact is expected as hinor, temporary and mitigable.
* Water pollution
- Increase in turbidity and suspended solids
At present the concentration of suspe ded solid (SS) at the place where the
LSs will be built is 20 - 50 mg/l. The SS concentration at the distance of 50 m to
the dredging site can be up to > 500 mg/l. uch an increase of SS may reduce the
concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). With high SS and turbidity and low DO,
fish, fish species are forced to migrate. TI  Vietnamese Standards on water for
aquaculture requires SS < 80 mg/l, and DO>  mg/l.
Experience from the monitoring pr  ams for the other sections of this
project indicated that the impacts by the inc ases in turbidity and SS are negative,
but minor, local (within an area of several hL dred meters around the dredging site)
and temporary (during the dredging only). 0  completion of construction activities.
the turbidity and SS of the river water will re ce to the ambient levels.
- Increase in oil pollution
During operation, dredgers may disc arge waste oil into the canals which
harms the quality of water for domestic use  d aquaculture. The standard on water
for aquaculture allows the oil concentration < 0.005 mg/l. Due to amount of oily

wastes will small and oily waste will be w 11 managed, this impact is expected as
negative, but minor, local, temporary and mi igable.
- "Water acidification"
At Tac Cau Landing Stage, where icid sulfate soil occur, dredging river
banks and bottom for building landing stag s, the pyrite layer can be disturbed and
moved up. Under the effect of the air and w ter, the process of acidification is likely
to occur, causing a decrease in pH of watt , and an increase in concentrations of
toxic matters such as dissolved iron and al minum. Nevertheless, this impact will
not be significant because the dredging vol me is small and the dredged materials
will be used for filling and leveling the site c i which they will be built.
At other LSs, water acidification will not occur during dredging.
* Impacts to river hydrology during con truction of landing stages (LSs.)
Dredging and constructions scales of the landing stages are of small.
Therefore, the construction of LSs. may r ot change the hydrological regime of
rivers and canals.
* Impacts on aquatic animals
The construction activities will distur I water, increases turbidity, etc. thereby
breaking up the habitats of aquatic anim, Is and killing some sensitive species
particularly benthic animals and forcing oth rs to migrate. This impact is expected
but it will be minor and temporary due to dre iging scale will be small.
4.2.3 Impacts by the construction of Luo I g The Tran Bridge
* Identification of the potential impacts
Bridge construction activities will cau ;e negative impacts as follows:
- Air, noise and vibration pollution at the construction site and along the
roads used for materials transport and at con ete mixing station;
- Water and soil pollution due to leakage of lubricants and oil from
construction machines;
- Water and soil pollution due to d mestic wastes from temporary worker
camps;
The identified impacts are more detail y assessed as follows.

Impact on air quality
During the construction phase, air ollutants from construction machines,
and excavators include dust (total suspende particles), toxic gases (SO2, NO,, CO,
volatile organic compounds and lead) will (iccur inside the bridge construction site
and surrounding area.
The major air pollutant in the const ction phase is dust, which is emitted
from digging, filling, embanking, etc.. W hin interval of about 200m from the
construction site, in the dry days, in the pea l periods of construction, the quality of
the air may be damaged and fail to meet the Vietnamese standards on ambient
atmosphere, (TCVN 5937- 1995) allowed dt t level, 0.3mg/m3.
* Noise pollution
Noise pollution is generated in the co struction phase by:
- Construction equipments;
- Concrete mixers;
- Piling for building the bridge;
- Transport of soil, stone and other co lstruction materials; and
- Generators.
The maximum noise level is 90 dBA at the concrete-mixing zone, 104 dBA
at piling machines, 98 dbA at drilling mac Iines and as for other machines such as
bulldozers, excavators, tractors, leveling rr achines and truck, each can cause the
noise up to 90 dBA at the distance of 15m. The data provided by the US Highway
Administration about the variation of noise class A by construction machines are
given in Table 4.4.
At the construction site heavily noise pollution will be significant.
Nevertheless this impact is assessed as l cal and temporary (only during the
operation of construction machinery). Noi e of high intensity is quickly reduced
over the distance from the construction site l the residential area nearby.

In order to more detaily determine the impact of the bridge construction, the
noise levels of construction activities are ass lssed as follows:
- Concrete-mixing zone
The maximum noise at the 15-m dis ance is 90 dBA and the noise at other
distances can be calculated by using the la-o that noise is reduced by 6 dBA after a
double distance. Thus, the noise is 84 dBAl t 30 m, 78 dBA at 60 m and 72 dBA at
120 m. The maximum tolerable limit of no se is 70 dBA for 24 hours. If concrete
mixers are operated all day through, this ZOI le should be located far from receptors
(such as residential areas) and can be calcula - ed as for other sensitive zones, i.e. 240
m being the minimum distance for reducing le noise to 68 dBA.
The noise calculated as mentioned aIove is the maximum according to the
documents. Should the construction unit be lble to measure at site or have practical
reference values, the distance may be sh )rter. For instance, a concrete mixer
meeting standards of GSA (US Geology A 3sociation) causes only 75 dBA at the
distance of 15 m. i.e. 63 dBA at the distance 1f 60 m.
- Pilingfor construction of bridge anc overpass
Noise can reach 105dbA if piling is londucted with a hammer machine 105
dBA (GSA requires it being lower than 9  dBA) at the distance of 15 m. It is
possible to take measures to reduce noise yet the construction is costlier.
- Transport of soil and stone
This employs some kinds of ma hinery such as excavators, leveling
machines and trucks. Each machine can p oduce the noise up to 90 dBA at the
distance of 15 m (GSA allows 75 - 80 dBA, Vietnamese Standard TCVN 5949-
1995 allows only 7OdBA). If those machine work at the same time, their resultant
noise may reach 97-98 dBA.
- Generators
The noise produced by a generator is usually lower than 82 dBA at 15 (GSA
requires it to be lower than 75 dBA, Vietn mese Standard requires 7OdBA). That
means the maximum noise at 60 m is approxi mately 70 dBA.

Environmental Impact Assessment of Additional Civ Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitat )n Project
At the construction site, this impact is expected as negative but local and
temporary because the construction durati n sill short and there is not sensitive
noise receptors (schools, offices, churchs) k cated in and distance of 200m from the
bridge construction site.
* Influence of vibration
One noteworthy impact during the 4 nstruction phase is the vibration that
piling machines produce. Below are typi al types of piling machines and the
impacts thereof on solid layers of clay and mnad.
- Bound sheet piles with the length o 7.5 to 5 m and a U-shape cross-section
are piled to necessary depth then formec a panel of steel bound together. A
hammering machine of 8 MT with an in ut energy of 48 kJ can produce the
vibration of 12.9 mm/s at the distance of 10 n.
- Piling a pile to a muddy soil lay r with an input energy of 30 kJ can
produce the vibration of 4.30 mm/s at the di ance of 10 m.
- A diesel-fueled hammering machin on a clay soil layer can give rise to the
vibration of 7 mm/s at the distance of 10 m.
For protection of religious and cultu l architectures, offices and houses, the
maximum vibration should be less than 2 nm/s. Because such buildings are not
present in the interval of 200m from the b idge construction site, it is possible to
assess that the impact minor.
* Environmental impacts due to worker ' team
The construction site will have ten to one hundred construction workers
during the construction phase. Their living ctivities can cause some environmental
impacts.
Environment pollution will be caus  by mainly waste from worker camps.
The average wastes created by 100 workers s calculated as follows:
- Daily domestic wastewater
- Volume: lomi3
- Daily solid waste
About 60-100 kg containing 60 - 7 % organic, 30 - 40% other component
(paper, glass, plastic...)

Environmental Impact Assessment of Additional Ci, *l Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitat on Project
In case of leak of waste man iement, domestic wastes created by
construction workers will pollute water a Id land. However, this impact will be
minor and mitigable because of wastes is s hall and it will be treated at the camping
site.
Diseases are also possible to sprea in the construction sites if effective
measures will not be taken. This impact is xpected as minor and controllable by a
proper waste management conducted by the Bridge Constructor.
- Conflict with local people
Conflicts among construction work s who come from elsewhere and local
people are very common in some countries. rhey can be generated by:
- Difference in habits and living st les
- Difference of incomes
- Construction workers' encroachl lent on cultural and traditional sites of
local people.
There is an experience of many con truction projects that the conflict hardly
occurs when workers have good education and discipline. Particularly in Vietnam,
the relationship between workers and fam ers is a good traditional one, and more
importantly, the people residing near the b idge support the project then a conflict
among construction workers and local peop e has no ground to be developed.
* Impact on road and waterway
Because Luong The Tran canal is justly an irrigation canal before
improvement and during the construction d iration the canal will be fully opened for
movement of boats, the construction of Lu ng The Tran bridge will not influence to
the local waterway traffic.
In a duration of the construction of ew bridge the old Luong The Tran will
not be demolished but it will be used for normal traffic, therefore, the construction
activity will not may a constraint for local rad traffic.
* Impacts on water quality and aquatic ecosystems
The negative impacts due to piling a .d building bridge will be:
- Disturbance of the habitats that leads to migration of aquatic animal;
- Water pollution because of increases in turbidity, suspended solid (SS), organic
matters from bottom mud;
- Water pollution due to heavy metals, gr ase and oil from dredged muds;

- Temporary changes in riverbed structu e, deterioration and changes in zoo
benthos composition.
This impact is negative but minc and local. Some years after the
construction, the quality of water, the riverb d structure and the aquatic ecosystem
will be recovered.
4.3   IMPACTS DURING THE OPERA IION PHASE OF THE PROJECT
4.3.1 Negative impacts during operation f the two extension waterways
Currently, boats increase in numbe and traveling speed which result in
erosion of the banks of rivers, canals and ater pollution as well. Particularly, oil
spill from boats will make pollution of water and severe damages to aquatic
biological resources, aquaculture and water s ipply at the areas along the waterway.
Scales of those impacts are not easy v predict precisely but the impacts can
be limited by appropriate managerial and te cnical measures.
* Pollution due to boat protection materialy
The increasing river fleets can lead  water pollution by of wooden hull-
protecting materials. The common materia , for this purpose in Vietnam include
bitumen, charcoal, and paints. The aromatic hydrocarbons from those materials car'
be dissolved partially in water. Nevertheles this impact is not significant because
of the amount of boat protection materi s is small, the materials are hardly
dissolved in water and the discharge of the ri er is large.
* Bank erosion
The increase in operation of boats c  cause erosion to banks of rivers and
canals. This impact has occurred in many p ces in the Mekong Delta. This impact
will be significant, long-term but miti able. Measures for mitigation are
recommended in Chapter Five.
* Oil spill
The upgrading of two extension wat rways, Ca Mau - Nam Can and Kien
Luong - Ha Tien, will to a significantly incr ese the waterway traffic. Therefore, the
risk of water pollution due to grease and other oily wastes may occur. Traffic
accident as a result of heavy traffic density , easier to occur and cause oil spill. In
such a case, the damages to aquatic, terrest ial ecosystem, agriculture, aquaculture
and water supply will be significant. In Vi tnam, there were various cases of oil
spill (mainly in the Dongnai-Saigon ri r) damage aquatic ecosystems and
aquaculture. They are lessons for manageme t of this waterway.

Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitat n Project
4.3.2 Impacts during operation of landin stages (LSs)
The operation of the LSs. will ca se environmental impacts, which are
assessed below:
* Dust pollution
The loading and unloading of cargo s at the LSs will emit dust to the air.
This may cause health problem for dockers.
* River pollution due to wastewater
The operation of the LSs. is consid red continuously in 300 days per year.
Each LS has few equipment and about 20 workers. The effluent from the LSs. may
pollute the river by means of main sources a follows:
- Wastewater from washing the wharve and warehouses. This contains high
concentrations of suspended solids and o s.
- Wastewater from washrooms inside th wharves with high concentrations of
organic matters, suspended solid, nutrien s and bacteria.
- Run off rainwater.
- Ballast water and sanitary wastewater frc the boats that anchor at the LSs.
* River pollution due to maintenance dr dging
For alluvia usually deposit in the egion of wharves and thereby hindef
waterway traffic, dredging for LSs mainte ance is essential. The dredging after a
time of operation causes some slight im cts on the water quality and aquatic
ecosystem. Mixing up the bottom mud can ead to water pollution due to increased
turbidity and concentrations of toxic substm ces (grease and oil, and heavy metals).
Nevertheless, this impact is minor and local at the zone of the dredging).
* River pollution due to oil and grease
Fuel spills to watercourses cause ne ative impact on the water environment
and aquatic ecosystem.
When oil or petroleum products fall into water, the mechanic, physical and
chemical processes occur and turn its st e in a very complicated manner. Oil
spillage increases the hydrocarbons (PAHs) n sediments. The ecological toxicity of

petroleum products are assessed as shown i Tables 4.5 and 4.6. In some cases of
oil spill in Vietnam concentrations of crude oil and FO were 1-10mg/l, which may
cause death for some aquatic animals.

* Pollution due to waste materials
The waste materials from a boat ui ally include: oily waste from ballast
water, sanitary wastewater and various type of solid wastes. They, if not collected
but discharged to water, may cause river and anal.
Due to scales of LSs will be small, a1 above predicted impacts are assessed
as minor and mitigable.
* Environmental incidents due to transp rt of materials on the river
Environmental incidents may occur i the following cases.
- Overloaded transport
- Boat operation not abiding navigation re ulations
- Failure of built-in lighting and signal sys m of boat in nighttime
- Navigation in bad weather
- Colliding with underwater obstacles suc as a sunken boat.
In case of oil spill caused by the inci ents the impacts on the environment is
expected as major, due to population, aquac ltural farns along the canals have high
density.
4.3.3 Impacts during operation phase of uong The Tran Bridge
The environmental impacts likely t occur during the operation phase of
Luong The Tran Bridge are:
- Increase in air pollution due to dust, S , NOx, CO, VOC and Lead because of
the increasing traffic in the region;
- Increase in noise, vibration pollution du  o the increased traffic in the region;
- Increase in traffic accidents.
Because the number of increased c us, buses, motobikes at this road will
not be high all above identified impacts are expected minor and mitigable.

4.4   GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF          "HE PROJECT IMPACT ON         THE
ENVIRONMENT
During the construction and operat on phases of the additional waterway
sections, bridge and LSs the following dire ct negative impacts happen at different
scales:
- Air, noise and vibration pollution. This i pact is minor and mitigable.
- Water pollution: this impact is minor; t Ie water quality will be recovered after
the construction complete. Only at the section Kien Luong - Ha Tien water
pollution by acidity may be at mo lerate scale but it is temporary and
controllable.
- Damage on aquaculture at Ha Tien and Nam Can: this impact in the construction
phase is moderate if the project does not have an appropriative measure of
environmental management.
- Riverside land: Plants along the canal w 1 be cut, increase erosion and landslide.
This impact is minor.
- Change in aquatic ecosystem: the aqua ic ecosystem structure will be changed
but it will be recovered in several years fter completion of canal dredged.
- Local living conditions: impact on loca conditions of households living closed
to the spoil relocated area during the dre lging period. This impact is minor if the
constructors will have good manageme t plan for SRAs, but it is major if the
spoil disposal management will be failur
In order to prevent and mitigate t e predicted impacts an Environmentai
Management Plan (EMP), including me sures for impact mitigation, project
monitoring and strengthening management capacity is suggested in Chapter Five
and Chapter Six.

5.1.2 Design of spoil relocation areas (S As)
In order to limit the negative impact of mud (produced by dredging) on the
environment as well as the water quali   of the canals, the mud should be
transported to the SRAs.
The bottom mud is pumped to SRAs to a containing area, then it overflow to
settlement pond, where the turbidity and le total suspended solid are decreased,
and then the liquid is returned to the canals. (Figure 5.1)
As for the regions of acid sulfate soi.. (Kien Luong - Ha Tien section), SRAs'
dikes should be covered wvith PVC sheets so as to prevent the leakage of acidic
water and the impacts thereof on the en% iroi ment as well.

Environmental Impact Assessment of Additional Cl il Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilita -ion Project
5.1.3 Limiting the disturbance of watel course
Improvement of this waterway incl ldes dredging and enlarging the canals.
The following measures should be taken o as to minimize the disturbance of the
watercourse and to prevent muddy water transferring to surroundings.
. In the zones where the concentratic s of heavy metals and pesticides in
sediments are higher than the Stan( ard, a monitoring program for heavy
metals and pesticide contamination in water and in fish tissue should be done.
* On laying dredging machines on a ba ge, constructors can use a proper mud-
stopping net for enclosing the dredgi lg site and keeping back mud on land,
not to let it goes back to the canal. H owever, a major part of the dredged is
clay with high adhesion then mud-s opping net is not compulsory. At the
sections where the canal expansion is more than 2 m, the dredged spoil
should be kept dry on the bank so as n t to drop and turbid water in the canal.
* After the bank part is dredged, a sucti )n dredger should be used to transfer all
the mud and soil in water to the SRA which is located within 2 km from the
bank. The length of dredging section should be limited less than 1 km and
the dredging should be done one by oi e.
* The dredging direction should be a ranged such that aquatic animals can
move to better places; meaning that flesh water fish can move to field while
estuarine fish can move out to the sea
* As for the sections where sulfate acic soil is determined like the project site,
the dredging should be carried out in the rainy season for having more fresh
water for diluting acidic water.
5.1.4 Measures to mitigate impacts due to widening of the canal
In order to reduce the volume of site clearance, compensation and
rehabilitation, the widening of the canal should be carried out on the one bank
where the density of houses and populatiou is low, where neither agriculture nor the
natural ecosystem is important. And after he canal is expanded, its bank should be
covered by proper trees as soon as possible

Plankton communities can recover t gether with the return to normal state of
turbidity and suspended solid in water ( neaning that water will get back the
transparency for light penetration) then oo benthos will recover after several
months.
5.1.5 Measure of selection of suitable tin e for construction
The work schedule and selection of E time suitable for construction with due
consideration into the season of aquacultt e and other productions in the region
effectively help to limit people's damages The work schedule is selected for the
two canal sections as follows:
- For the section of Kien Luong - Ha T en, the time for taking in seawater for
shrimp farming falls in the dry seas mn, i.e. April to July, therefore, the
dredging should be concentrated into the beginning of a year (January to
March) or in the flood season from Aug st to December.
- For the section of Ca Mau - Nam ("an, the time for taking seawater for
shrimp farming ends on March or Apr and in the rainy season, people also
breed freshwater shrimp in rice field . During this period, people use rain
water and fresh water retained since th flood season by means of embracing
dykes as such, the best time for dredgin is from August to December.
5.1.6 Public consultation
On preparing for dredging in sensi ive regions, the project management
unit should cooperate with construction ur its in communal information, which is
targeted at bringing out the matters as foll ws:
- Objectives and meanings of the investn ent in the project.
- Potential impacts due to dredging on fie water environment, shrimp farming
such that people could apply counterme sures to minimize damages, if any.
- Measures of mitigating the impacts on I cal aquaculture.
- Improvement of community's partici pation in environmental protection.
Addresses and telephone numbers of responsible units should be provided
then people can inform any environmei tal incident in due time (at the projec.

10%).
Guidelines and requirement in publi participation are detaily indicated in
Chapter Seven.
5.1.7 Selection of Spoil Relocation Are s (SRAs)
The right selection of location SRA will limit impacts on the environment
and people's livings and productions. A s ected SRA should meet the conditions
as follows:
- Land use
Public land, land for construction f rural roads, public works, privately
held land houses, etc. should be used, gin n people agrees on it. It should meet
local plans for land use.
- Size
A selected SRA should be large e ough or larger than the designed size
which has been approved.
- Location
A selected SRA should be at le t 1 km from any Bird Sanctuary or
protected sites, at least 500 m from public orks (schools, administrative offices,
markets), temples and churches, and at lea t 200 m from aquacultural farms.
5.1.8 Improvement of environmental monitoring and management
The environment should be monito d in the pre-construction, construction
and operation phases. PMU will consolid e the relationship with the provincial
Departments of Natural Resources and  nvironment and local authorities in
relation with the project for information disclosure, particularly to PAPs, and
assist the contractors to find out suitable S As and inspect the implementation of
mitigation measures during the constructior.

5.2   MEASURES TO MITIGATE IM] ACTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
OF LANDING STAGES
5.2.1 Mitigation of impacts during const -uction phase
- The increase in turbidity on dredging the LSs should be limited by using
proper dredging machines in ebb tide. Enclosing sheets should be deployed
around the dredging site so as to lim : the transfer of muddy water to the
surrounding.
- The trucks that transport raw material (soil, sand, and cement, etc.) to the
construction site should be covered to  event air pollution in the access route
to the project site. Waterway should be given priority for transport of heavy
structures and soil and sand to be used br preparing the site.
Erosion of the canal bank should be limited through geological and
hydrological investigation and study pri r to dredging, then by embankment.
- Soil pollution should be limited by usir the dredged spoils for preparing the
site of LSs.
- Absolutely not discharging engine oil and oily waste from the dredgers or
construction machines to the canal, they should be collected for treatment.
5.2.2 Mitigation of pollution during ope] ation phase
* Mitigation of noise and vibration poll tion
Some measures as follows can be t ken to limit noise and vibration from
the LSs:
- Regular checkup of machines for opei ation, lubrication and maintenance as
stipulated;

Environmental Irpact Assessment ofAdditional Civ Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitat n Project
- Installation of noise-reducers at heavily noisy machines
- Plantation of trees around the LSs an access routes for reducing noise and
dust. The area of trees should be at leas 10% of the total area of each LS.
* Mitigation of water pollution
- Treatment of oily
Almost all oily waste from boats ar collected and treated. At each LS one
place for oily wstes storage will be installe . Oily wastes will be recycled or bum
depending on their amount and practical c ditions of the LS.
- Preliminary treatment of sanitary wastewa er
Sanitary wastewater should be sepai lted from rain water then treated. The
technology that should be employed there  is biological treatment (septic tank).
This is suitable to the scale of a LS with 5 m of wastewater per day.
- Drainage of rain water
Rainwater running off the LS can e directly discharged via the common
drainage system after deposit of big was  matters. The drainage for rainwater
should be designed with close reference to t e data of yearly rainfall.
* Treatment of solid waste
- Sanitary garbage
Sanitary solid waste includes the gar age from the control office, washroom
and the like with the daily quantity of 5- 0kg. The garbage will be collected in
plastic bins and disposed at the local garbag disposal sites.
- Dredged mud
The dredged mud in the operation  ase is not much which is about 1,000
m'/year. However, the project should ana yze the contents of heavy metals and
pesticides in the bottom mud before using t s material for land raising.

5.3   MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE ENVIRONENTAL IMPACTS
DURING CONSTRUCTION OF T E BRIDGE
5.3.1 Organization for construction wor ers' accommodation
The requirements on workers' accol  odation are as follows:
- The constructors should arrange lamps with proper hygiene facilities;
- On enrolling and employing wo kers, the constructors should pay due
attention and provide regular education for workers to comply with
regulations on environmental pr tection. In general, workers should be
encouraged for a clean environrr nt.
- The plan for workers accommo lation should be a part of the bidding
contents.
5.3.2 Prevention of work accidents and abor protection
In addition to arranging sufficient c mps and hygiene means for workers
to control the spreading of pathogen, c nstruction companies should provide
workers with instruments against noise, vit ration and dust.
Those instruments should have ] igh quality and adequate quantity.
Construction companies will be requirec by the PMU for providing training
courses and guidance for work safety.
5.3.3 Protection of water quality
In the construction phase, the cons ructors should prohibit workers from
discharge of solid waste (construction wa te, sand, stone, etc.) and oily wastes
from construction machines to watercours s. All these waste matters should be
collected and disposed at the local garbag - disposal site. This dumping site will
be constructed by the Contructor.

5.3.4 Measures to mitigate impacts on a rquality
Air pollution will be one of th most noteworthy matters in both
construction and operation phases of the bridge. The following measures are
recommended for mitigating air pollution:
- The heavy trucks and constructiol machines that the project used should
be tested in terms of noise, vibrati n and emission such that they meet the
Vietnamese standard (TCVN 594 -1995). This requirement is to include
in bidding document.
- Construction sites should be wate red when serious dust pollution occur.
- All vehicles transporting constr ction materials (sand, clay, cement,
stone, etc.) should be covered to revent dust diffusion. Noise-reducers
should be equipped with vehicle
- Concrete and asphalt mixers s uld be located at least 200 m from
residential areas. If air pollutan s (dust, S02, N02, VOC) still exceeds
the Vietnamese Standard on air uality (TCVN 5937-1995), the mixers
should be move further.
- Emissions from machines (ca , trucks, bulldozers etc.) and from
concrete mixers should be mon ored by means of typical parameters
such as dust, SO2, NOR, CO. hyd] carbons and lead.
5.3.5 Mitigation of impacts due to noise nd vibration
The constructors should locate all noisy sources, for instance, concrete
mixers, piling machines and generator, a least 200 m from sensitive receptors
(pagodas, churches, culture houses, hosp als). In fact, at present there are not
any sensitive receptor located within 200m from the proposed bridge
construction site.
Furthermore the constructor shoul monitor and watch up the vibration
that piling machines produce.

5.3.6 Traffic safety
- Disciplinary measures and cove ge (fencing) should be assured at the
construction to prevent out-of-duly people come and go.
- The boundary of the constructi ln site should be clear with signs and
fences.
- All signs and signals should be ! et up in compliance with Vietnamese
standards and painted with lum nescent paints so as to be visible in
nighttime.
- Signs should be lighted at dan: erous road sectors in nighttime. The
construction site and its limits shl uld be lighted.
- The roads around the site and emporarily changed routes should be
clearly defined.
The systems of signs, signals and temporary routes are obliged and
they should be removed when d le.

Environmental Impact Assessment ofAdditional Ci I Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilita on Project
In order to determine the quality o water in the natural condition prior to
dredging, PMU had been already monitorin the water quality at 2 sections.
In the monitoring for each constru tion sector, the water quality will be
measured 3 times a week at 2 transects, on upstream and one downstream, about
1.5 km from the dredging site. The sampling sites for monitoring the environmental
quality during the construction phase are sh  n in Table 6.3.
Water quality will be evaluated at ea  site using 5 basic parameters (namely
pH, DO, suspended solid (SS), temperature  d Coli form), other parameters will be
analyzed at laboratories. The monitoring re Its should be compared with the data
collected at the same sites before constructi n so as to assess whether the dredging
causes water pollution or not.
- Monitoring the drainage of water fromt e SRAs
As for the SRA, all drainage water ill be driven to the drains thereof for
discharging back to the canal. All the S  s should be designed such that the
deposit volume therein is maximal.
As the dredged is in the state of mud soil particles are suspended for 24 to
48 hours. In the time of drainage and di harge, pH and the concentration of
suspended solids should be measured 3 times week at the discharge point.
- Monitoring of the intake for domestic w er supply
At the 2 extension canal sections ther are not intake sites for domestic water
supply. Therefore, monitoring of the inta  for domestic water supply is not
required.
- Monitoring the intake for aquaculture a agriculture
Water of the canals somewhere is t  n into aquaculture or agriculture. In
order to protect such uses, the monitoring pro am will be conducted at the start, the
middle and the end of the canal section with  basic parameters every week during
the dredging. The monitoring results will als be compared with the FAO Standard
on aquaculture and Vietnamese Standard on a iculture water for assessment.

In the first year after dredging on a v aterway section finished, the PMU-W
will carry out the monitoring of the water quality for evaluating the restoration
thereof.
Monitoring points after construction  ll be determined at the transects along
the canal where samples were taken into ch kup before construction (Table 6.1).
Samples will be taken in a day at each transec in March and November.
Samples will be analyzed with 17 para eters: pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity,
BOD, COD, nitrate, nitrite, suspended solid, ssolved solid, ammonia, temperature,
cadmium, lead, aluminum, zinc, mercury and . coli form. Some parameters will be
measured at site and samples will be transpo ed to labs for analyzing. The data to
be used for comparison is of water quality of he surroundings prior to construction
and the national environmental standard on  ality of surface water (TCVN 5942-
1995).

PUBLIC CONSULT ION IN EIA OF
ADDITIONAL CIVIL WO           S AND DREDGING
7.1.  POLICIES OF THE WORLD           ANK AND GOVERNMENT OF
VIETNAM ON PUBLIC CONSUL ATION IN ELA
7.I1.1. World Bank Policy
World Bank (the Bank) policy r arding community involvement is
provided in detail in the WB Environmen al Assessment Source Book, Vol. 1
(1991). It is summarized as follows.
Bank policy directs the borrower to ublicly solicit, hear and consider the.
concerns of the local community, other a  cted groups and local NGOs (non-
governmental organizations) and to full incorporate into the design and
implementation of the project and the E  ironmental Assessment (EA). The
rationale for consideration and incorporation f the concerns of the affected parties
is to assure community acceptance and enh  ce the viability of the project. The
Bank has found that where such views hay been successfully incorporated into
the design and plan of implementation,  e projects are more likely to be
successful. The Bank has not found commu ty participation to be an impediment
to project execution. On the contrary, project in which affected parties views have
been excluded are more likely to suffer fr  delay and quality issues resulting
from community resistance.
The Environmental Assessment Ope ational Directive (EAOD) clarifies
Bank policy, which for more than a      cade has encouraged community
participation in Bank-supported projects. So ological considerations were added-
to the Bank's operational manual statemen on project design and appraisal in
1995, specifying that effective project mplementation  requires the full
commitment of all beneficiaries and asso ated stakeholders and that to be
effective a project appraisal should verify th  affected parties were fully informed
and involved in project identification and prep ation.
The  operational directive  on  col boration  with  non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) also urges Bank sta "as a matter of Bank policy" to
develop contacts and operational collabora on with NGOs (OD 10.70). The
directive defines NGOs as "private organiza  n that pursues activities to relieve
suffering, promote the interests of the poor, p tect the environment, or undertake
community development".

Environmental Impact Assessment ofAddition I Civil Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilit tion Project
At identification of an EA category 'A" project, or as soon as the project is
classified as a category "A" project, any b rrower who does not consult with local
NGOs, or does not seek and consider the informed views of the affected parties
through the release and public comment c the relevant EA, are considered to be
out of compliance with this policy. It is t refore unlikely, in such cases, that the
Bank would continue to support that proje t. EA requirements should be reviewed
well in advance of the implementation o any project to ensure compliance with.
the principles outlined in the EA OD.
The EA OD's provision for public c nsultation reflects a larger social trend.
Forces are converging to convince both g  memnent and development agencies to
be more responsive to public concerns and articipation because popular support is
a key factor in project viability. In sorr  countries, this trend has helped to
motivate a popular shift towards democr cy. Experience with "people-centred"
development is growing and gaining accept nce and attention.
7.1.2. Policy of the Vietnamese Governm nt (GOV)
Vietnam is a socialist country. The tate is determined by the fundamental
principle "ofpeople, from people andfor p ople". The democratic approach to the
social management of GOV is expressed  the basic principle of "people kno-,
people discuss and people control" all acti ies of the Government.
At present, based on these basic rinciples, all policies, programs or
projects of the Government, private and/o foreign investors should be disclosed
and discussed with the people in the a fected areas so that the reasonable
comments and concerns of project affected eople (PAHs) are fully considered and
incorporated.
In the recent years, the rapid pace o industrialization and urbanization has
impacted environmental quality, causing verse impacts on public health, the
general ecology and associated economy  various regions in Vietnam. As a
result, inclusion of relevant environmental onsiderations in the socio-economic
development decision process have became m important issue, and compliance is
of concern by not only to the Government MOSTE, DOSTE, MPI, Ministry of
Industry, MOT) but also affected parties ass iated with the project.
To avoid negative impacts of the proj ct, Governmental Decree No. 175/CP
issued on 18th October, 1994 requires th  all projects in the development of
industry, energy, transport, water resourc agriculture, etc. should conduct a
compliant EIA study meeting the requireme ts of the environmental management
authorities and that the contents of EIA r ports include predicted impacts and
mitigation measures must be discussed with t e PAHs.

The PAP should submit their c    ents and concerns to the project
proponents through their authorized repr entatives, e.g Governmental agencies
(the People's Committee, People's Coun 1) and/or socio-political organizations
(Front Fatherland Committee, Farmers A  ociation, Women tJnion etc.) or non-
government organizations (e.g Vietnam  sociation for the Conservation of the
Nature and Environment, Biological Assoc tion, Economic Association, Foresters
Association etc.). These organizations sho ld collect all comments from the local
people and send them to the environment I management authorities (DONRE at
provincial level or MONRE at central  vel) or even to Provincial People's
Council or National Assembly. During  e environmental review process, all
comments and requirements of the PAP hould be discussed and conclusions
reported to the project proponents, so  at the project can develop proper
alternatives and implement measures for  *tigation of the negative impacts. The
project will receive an investment license, nly after appropriate modification of
location, design, capacity and/or technolo  of the project to meet the requirement
of environmental protection and resettlemen
Relating to compensation for the P  s who lost land, dwellings and/or
income as a result of the projects, the GO  issued Decree No. 22/1998/ND-CP
(24/4/1998).
This Decree is the legal base for  eparation, implementation of proper
resettlement action plan (RAP) which suppl s the PAHs in finding new jobs and
new settlement sites, maintain living stand d and avoid adverse impacts of the
project on the local socio-economy.
7.2.  THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION         OCESS
7.2.1. Guideline
The following items comprise the ful public consultation process required
by WB.
* Levels of public consultation
- Informed public participation in  e environmnental review  process
encompasses consultation with those arties both directly and indirectly
affected. In the first case are the grou  that would be directly impacted by
a proposed project, for example fisher ' folk downstream from a dam. It is
important to remember that the mo tcritical effects may occur some
distance from the project itself, that e informed views of all potentially:
affected communities should be taken nto account in the pre-design stages
of the project. and that these communit s should be involved in the EA.

Environmental Impact Assessment ofAddition l Civil Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilit ion Project
- The second group to be involved  public consultation consists of those
who, because of their particular concern or expertise, have relevant
information and specific input reg rding the nature or scope of potential
environmental impact. Obvious  amples are societies of consulting
engineers, experts on cultural prop  , environmental NGOs, or grassroots
organizations concerned with env onmental quality. Less obvious, but
frequently important because of th *r perspective, are educators or human
rights, anti-poverty or religious grou s.
- The distinction between these grou s cut across two criterions: one is the
degree to which a group will be aff cted by the proposed project; the other
is the kind of knowledge the group an bring to the EA. Local and external
groups at various points along each xis should be consulted during the EA
process. By far the most important p int is that such consultations must start
very early in the process if they are to be meaningful and influence
decisions made during the develor ent process, which will affect their
lives. The views and concerns of t e potentially affected people and the.
local NGOs should be solicited no la r than the process beginning.
It is advisable during the identificat n phase, to have preliminary contacts
with affected parties. Public participatio in the BA should start when the
preparation of the feasibility study begins. he EA is an integral component of the
feasibility study. Public participation is v ually fostered by the social scientist
members of the EA team, although the ful co-operation of the EA -physical and
biological disciplines is needed. Where s ial impacts have significant scale or
severity or where they are particularly co iplex, a social science team of local
residents may be required at several inM rvals during the process of project
feasibility and preparation studies. Where  w people are affected, a single social
scientist can often reside in the area for a fel months total time spread over a year,
so that the studies will encompass the entire mnual cycle.
Although the bulk of the work is di *ng preparation, there is still a great
deal of social input needed during con |ruction, less during operation and
thereafter. The affected people and local GOs and the public at large should
participate in monitoring during operation an assist in post hoc evaluation.
* Consultation at the Community Level
Communities may be large or small; hey are easily defined by recognized
geographical boundaries in either urban o rural areas, and may encompass a
number of villages over a large area. The people of an affected area may be
homogeneous and speak the same languag , be at roughly the same economic
level, share the same customs and values  d make their living in similar ways.
Conversely, they may be highly differentiate in language, culture, occupation and

income levels. If the community is dive Fe and the people heterogeneous, the
consultative process will be particularly der anding.
Public consultation is accepted as  essential part of the EA process in
industrial countries, but EA performed n industrial countries provide little
guidance for the inclusion of local co  unities in developing countries. The
premise of public consultation in most ind trial countries is: (a) if the citizens are
informed about a project and the opp -tunity to discuss its environmental
implications, those citizens most intereste will respond; (b) most citizens have
access to newspapers, radio and televisio and can read and understand notices;
and (c) citizens who participate are accus med to the frank dialogue associated
with democratic discussions, and are not e osed to any personal or political risk
in questioning proposed governmental actio .
In many developing countries, an E  team cannot operate on this premise
and often cannot function in the responsiv stance suitable to industrial countries,
but must take a proactive, initiatory approa to encourage and to promote citizen
participation. This means sharing whatever information is available about the
project so that informed views can be obtain d.
A primary objective of consultatio  with a community is to encourage
opening discussion of all issues and conc rns. To this end, the challenge is to.
provide means that are congruent with local cultures and customs and that provide
a safe and comfortable setting to voice the issues as they see them. If the
sociologists or anthropologists attached to a multi-disciplinary team are
expatriates, the team will need members from the country who are familiar with
the people, culture and language of the af cted area. In many cultures, women
specifically will be needed to talk with the w men involved.
Selecting team members in this w  , who speak the language and are
culturally acceptable to the communities is crucial to the project's success. Advice
on recruitment can be sought from local s ff of development agencies or from
NGOs with specific experience in the area. he recruits may be researchers from
colleges and universities, staff of local N Os, or social workers or extension
workers with ties both to government minist s and to the community.
Exploration at the community leve should not be rushed. The teamn
members should be involved at various stag , including the early stage when the
official and informal leadership of the co  unities - all the key figures in the
authority structure - are briefed on the p ject and invited to participate and
express their views. The sociological membe  of the EA team should reside in the
area while gathering information. Often, thi is the only way to achieve reliable
consultation.

Large meetings are sometimes inap opriate forums for public consultation
at the community level. Small meetings a  individual interviews are often more
useful. All communities have social group through which they normally organize
activities, such as work groups, savings so eties, schools or cooperatives, or small
enterprise groups. Groups that primarily  volve women should be sought out.
Religious groups also provide useful forun s. The structure of the small meetings
will vary according to country and cultu ; but in general, new organizational
forms with which people are unfamiliar (e g., committees) should be avoided in
preference for existing social groups within eople feel comfortable.
A major difficulty in consulting wi  people who may be affected is the
inability of many either to understand how  eir world can be different from what
it is, or to realistically understand what thei real needs might be when the project:
materializes. Where feasible, graphic illus ations should be used to clarify the
issues; scale models of the area showing  illages and the project are generally
better understood than speeches alone. Vid tape can be useful in presenting this
sort of information. Posters, illustrated  mphlets and cartoons have proved
effective in literate communities; they c  be displayed at schools, religious
buildings, shops, clinics, co-operatives and  her centres of community activity.
Involving affected people, especial  the poor, often requires additional
expenditures. The costs include travel and s bsistence for attendance at meetings,
translation and expert advice that the co  unity needs to help to formulate a
response to the proposal, etc. Such costs s uld be systematically budgeted. The
EA team must ensure that issues raised in af cted communities are communicated
to the other participants in the EA process, cluding various public agencies and
NGOs that may be involved in the larger pro( ss of public consultation.
As the EA proceeds, the people in the ffected area should be kept informned
routinely and systematically. Written mat rial must be translated into local
languages. Where many are unable to read, o 1 discussion and visual presentations
sessions (often, by the resident social pro  ters or facilitators) should be used.
Throughout the EA process, the project a ncy should continue seeking views
from and providing feedback to the affected  mmunity.
7.2.2. Organization of Public Consultation or the Project
In Vietnam, there is currently no det I guideline for Public Consultation.
Combining the policy of GOV and WB g delines the following organization

Mau provinces. Participants in the m etings were representatives of local
People's Committees, local socio-politic organization, DONRE and.
- Eight meetings with 441 PAHs have  en held in Kien Giang and Ca Mau
provinces to inform the potential imp ts on the environment and receive
comments from PAHs.
- Meetings with PAHs during environm  tal surveys. This type of unofficial
meeting is recommended during the dfid surveys for EIA study. The EIA
Study Team of EPC (VESDEC) conduc d various meetings with households
in the effected area. Comments and poin  of view of interviewed people were
used in this EIA study.
* Contents of Public Consultation meeti s
- In the previous meets, PMU, EPC have informed the participants about
the major technical and enviro  ental issues of the project and
mitigation measures for negative i pacts.

view the public consultation for the eff cted households in the project area
(Appendix 7). Comments from public con ltations are integrated as follows:
1. PAHs have to be informed the time to redge the canal in order that to pump
the water into the aquaculture area com portably.
2. There is the measure to assist compens don the loss of trees in the SRAs.
3. PAHs agree to build the road but the houses and tombs in the SRAs have to
compensate to relocate.
4. Avoid mud water overflow into garde s, rice fields, fish ponds and shrimps
cultures area.
5. Crops in the SRAs have to assist c mpensation because PAHs can not
continue to produce on the land that use to build the road.
6. PAHs agree to use the SRAs to build t  road but PAHs have to compensate
properly.
7. The SRAs is designed very good, PAHs ave not any idea.

Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitatioi Project
CONCLI SION
The project for rehabilitation of two S:)uthem waterways and Can Tho port has
important role in the socio-economic devel pment of the whole Mekong Delta and
Hochiminh city. Therefore, it is selected as o ie of the 6 priority projects in the Master
Plan for the Mekong Delta.
The EIA report on the project was approved by the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Environment (now the M\I inistry of Resources and Environment)
according to Decision 102 1/QD-BKHCNMT d ited 3 June 1999.
By 2004, the project is added with t Ee construction of 6 ports, 1 bridge and
dredging of two canal sections from Ca Mau city to Nam Can and Kien Luong town to
Ha Tien town. The EIA on the additional works and dredging is performed by the Project
Management Unit to meet the requirement of t e government and WB.
The construction and operation of the additional works and dredging sites will
cause the environmental impacts as follows.
- Water pollution due to dredging two cana sections and building landing stages and
bridges. This impact is assessed as negat e but minor and mitigable canal water
quality will be recovered shortly after comp etion of construction activities.
- Negative impacts on aquaculture in Ha I ien lagoon and Nam Cam. This will be
moderate if the project has no measures for environmental management.
- Loss of riverside vegetation cover and con equent increase in erosion of banks. This
impact is minor and controllable.
- Impacts on the structure of the aquatic hat tat in the project site. This will be minor
and short-term. The structure of the two car al sections will be recovered several years
after the project is finished.
- Impact on fishing sources during the constr iction and dredging of the two waterways.
This impact is expected as minor and tempo lary.
- Impact of the living conditions of people at l RAs during dredging.
In order to mitigate the negative impacts, te Project Management Unit has proposed
various feasible managerial and technical measi res. Those include:



Environmental ImpactAssessment ofAdditionalC vil Works and Dredging
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitatioi Project
- Measures to managing and treating the ef uent having high turbidity and suspended
solid;
- Measures to protecting local agriculture an aquaculture in the construction phase;
- Measures to minimizing the impacts on s nsitive zones such as shrimp ponds and
Bird Sanctuary;
- Measures to limiting the transfer of acidic  ater during construction and dredging;
- Measures to controlling pollution and en  onmental sanitation at the construction
sites;
- And a program for environmental monito  g in the pre-construction, construction,
and operation phases which has been appro d by the WB.
The Project Management Unit will be fully responsible for any environmenital
problems.
On the bases of the conclusions as men  ned above, the Project Management Unit
requests the Ministry of Natural Resources  d Environment as well as the WB to
approve the EIA report on additional construc ion and dredging of the Vietnam Inland
Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project.
