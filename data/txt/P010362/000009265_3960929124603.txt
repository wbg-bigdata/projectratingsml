MEMORANDUTM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TBE INTERNATONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTON AND DEVELOPMEN
AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTIORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN/REDIT TO INDIA
FOR THE AMM) PRADESH CYCONE EMEGENCY Bz=M1MMN RS
1.    rhe following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of US$ 40 million
equivalent and credit of SDR 126.1 million (US$ 170 million equivalent) to the Government of
India (GOI) is submitted for apprvaL The proposed loan would be for twenty years, including a
-        five year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. 'he proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, including a grace period of ten years. The
proposed loan/credit would help the May 1990 cyclone emergency reconstruction and mitigation
program in the coastal region in the State of Andhra Pradesh. In addition, it is also proposed that
the ongoing Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (Credit 1665-INLoan 2662-IN), which
currently supports inrigation development in Andhra Pradesh, be reformulated to allow the use of
US$ 55 million of its funds to finance part of the irrigation and drminage component of the
proposed project The proceeds of the above funds will be passed on by the GOI to the
Govment of Andhra Pradesh in accordance with its standard arrangements for development
assistance to the states, and the GOI will assume the foreign exchange risks.
2.    Backgmud, Andhra Pradesh is India's fifth largest state (274,000 sq.km) and the fourth
most populous (60 million). The State has a 1,030 km coastline on the Bay of Bengal, and two of
India's largest rivers (Godavai and Krishna) which have large irgated deltas at their convergence
ith the Bay. The coastal districts cover some of the most ferdle and densely populated areas of
the State. On May 9, 1990, an extremely strong cyclone hit Andhra Pradesh (AP), bringing winds
in excessof 200 kn/hr, a tidal wave rising to about fourmeters and moving up to 10 km inland in
some areas, and very heavy rains over a three days period (300- 500 mm) equal about half of the
average annual rainfaU in these areas. All of AP's nine coastal districts and one inland district,
including some 5,160 villages and about 8 million people to varying degrees were affeted.
Almost 1,000 people were killed, vwth heavy damage to infrastructure and producdvity in all
sectors, which in total was esdmated at US$ 1,250 million. Extensive damage was done to both
the major and minor irrigadon systems, caused by breaches in the tidal banks resulting in the
cusion of saline water, further aggravated by flooding arising from the heavy rains which
caused breaches in the embankents of rivers and upland streams. Many bridges were breached or
washed away, with about 13,000 km of state highways and major roads, in addition to many small
roads connecting villages, badly damaged. Electicity supply was affected, with damage to about
17,000 distrbution transformers and 48,000 km of distribution lines. In agriculture, some
harvested paddy and standing crops were destroyed, with the tidal incursion affecting some 50,000
ha, and the breached rivers depositing sand (sandcasting) at varying depths on about 16,000 ha of
cultivable lands. In animal husbandry, almost 130,000 cattle, sheep and goats and 4.3 million
*        poultry were lost and, in the fisheries sector, more than 10% of fishing craft and 60% of tackle
were lost or badly damaged. Also, about 1.6 million low cost houses were damaged to varying
degrees. In the "tribal agency" area of Vishakapatnam district, a hilly inland isolated area which is
home to some 300,000 tribals, heavy rains did considerable damage to the limited roads as well as
causing landslides, some of which caused damage to agrcultural lands.
3.    As a result of improved awareness and emergency measures, introduced after the 1977
cyclone which kalled about 10,000 people, many lives were saved. These measwes included
improvemenlt in the early warning system and evacuation procedures, raising the height of the tidal
bank, building cyclone shelters and inrducing vegetative coastal shelter belts. In all, about
650,000 people wer evacuatd from 546 villages and sheltered in 1,098 relief centes, which were
served by medical teams, for periods of 3 to 8 days. in addition, cyclone shelters accommodated
another 250,000 people. The government's relief efforts, with the help of many voluntary



2
organizations, performed well and food, water and milk packets were dropped to marooned and
inaccessible areas for a period of 10 days. As villages retuned to accessibility, 543 medical and
2,450 para-medical teams attended to diarrhea surveillance, chlorination of drinking water,
disinfection, medical aid, injuies, anti-cholera inoculations, and other anti-epidemic measures.
Since then, GOAP has spent and/or committd US$ 145 million on rescue and urgent relief
operations, including assistance for repair of houses, food and utensils, and assistance for the
rehabilitation of agricultural lands. Urgent reconstruction of the beaches in rivers and canals and
desilting operations have begun, also repairs of most urgent roadways where this is possible,
reconstruction of the electricity network, and temporary rehabilitation of public buildings, water
and sewerage. Due to resource constraints, this work is going at a slow pace and more important,
frequently lacks the engineering under pinning necessary to ensure good -,uality.
4.     Rationale for Bank Involvement1. The Bank's assistance strategy to India is to support
policies and investments that will encourage economic growth and poverty alleviation in a context
of macro economic stability. An increasingly important element of the strategy is to promote
sustainable progams, especially in agricultue, that will protect and e hance the natural resource
base. In the context of the recent cyclone disaster in AP, the Bank with its wide experience in the
sectors to be reconstructed, will provide the resources and technical support to ensure that the
necessary reconstructton investment is accelerated and implemented in the most efficient way, with
adequate attention to quality. The scale of the disaster, both on human life and productive assets
and its significant effect on the poor, is such to warrant special and urgent support by the Bank
The govemment and the relief orgaions have reacted and performed creditably, and have
conmitted significant resources for the current relief effort, including assistance for the repairing of
housing for the poorer sections. However, this wiU not be sufficient to make a significant impact
on the necessary reconstruction and rehabilitation to the damaged infratrucue and to restore the
necessary productivity within a reasonable period. Equally important, the government on its own
wiU not be able to take the steps necessary to mitigate the significant impact of future similar
disasters. The area affected in the Krishna and Godavari delta is among the richest agricultural
land of AP and production will benefit significantly from an improved ingation and drainage
system. There are two particularly poor groups, mainly in the fishing communites, who are in a
10-20 km coastal strip which bears the brunt of this and other cyclones and who would benefit
from the more permanent rehabilitation efforts envisioned under the project Also, the poor hill
tnbes would be particularly helped under the program from the improved quality of road and
embankment construction which would reduce landslides, from improved irgation and drainage,
and from the support of the program to move them away from the practice of shifting cultivation.
In light of the above, the Bank is justified to process quickly the proposal as an Emergency
Project, with implementation within a three year period.
5.    Project bJetives. The positive effects of the improved emergency and awareness
measues previously taken by the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) have been reflected in
the reduced number of deaths. With the Govemment and local groups having carried out the
immediate relief activities and emergency repairs, the Bank would now assist in (a) cyclone
reconstruction operations in the cyclone affected areas, including the restoration of assets and
productivity lost and/or damaged, and a program for the mitigation of future similar disasters; and
(b) strengthening institutional capabilities in cyclone preparedness and mitigation. The project
would also be the catalyst for a complete update of previous surveys and studies carried out on the
water management issues affecting the delta area, with the view to develop a "Delta Plan" for the
Modenization of the deltas, which would have enormous economic impact on the State.
1 Includes both the Bank and 1DA.

6.    Prje D     Vdon. The project consists of those most urgent reconstruction activities
that can be inplemented during a te year period, and including only the most urgent aspects of
mitigation. These actvides, which are summarized as a set of detailed Project Working Papers
(PWP), identify specific infastructures and services which would be reconstructed, repaired or
abilMed under the projew  The project is summatized below under the following eleven
components, against which is shown the related percentage of total base costs: (a) irrigation and
drainage (34%), relating to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage
systems in the delta areas, covering over 1 million hectares, and the apland portion of districts in
the affected areas. The works would reduce the effect of upland dmnage on the delta areas, clean,
restore and improve irrigation and drainage channels, tidal and flood protection    n t,
control fresh water levels in inportant Kollem Lake, relieve chronic flooding of urban areas, and
restore minor irrigation tanks; (b) roads and bridges (28%), relaing to the reconstruction and
repairs of the most urgent of about 13,000 km of state and 12,000 km of rural roads damaged by
the cyclone, about 100 km of road embankments, and related bridges and culverts damaged to
varying degrees, with particular attention for stabiizing slopes and repairing roads in hilly tribal
aeas; (c) cyclone shelters (2%), to construct additional shelters needed in the most vulnerable
areas; (d) electicity (12%), for repairing and strengtening over 1,000 km of 33 kv and 11 kv
electricity uansmission systems, which would ensure tha the electricit supply to major towns
would only be minimally affected during future disasters, particularly for important loads such as
hospitals, water supplies, telephone exchanges, and administrative centers; (e) agriculture
including fisheres (7%), to include the provision of credit to cyclone vicdms to assist in the
removal of sandcasting, the rehabilitation of horicultural crops including nurseries, facilites for
inland fisheries, the replacement and repair of fishing boats and tackle, the repair of damaged
ports, and to support the administration of the PMU. This credit would be a special progam of
GOAP, which would have no impact on the financial performance of the cooperative credit systerx
and an undrstanding was reached at negotiations that the State would absorb the credit risk, (f)
rural water supply (3%), to construct headworks outside the flood prone area for distribution to
those villages most vulnerable to flood induced contamination; (g) municipal services (3%), to
reconstruct municipal roads, drans and water supplies in selected municipalities; (h) public
buildings (2%), to reconstruct and repair high, elementary and primary schools, and medical
buildings; (1) coastal shelter belts (2%), to establish nurseries for the rehabilitaion of damaged
plantaions and to expand the belt over the most vulnerable areas; O) housing (3%), to assist
coastal dwellers in the repair of their damaged houses; and (k) technical assistance (4%), to
finance technical studies with the view to developing a plan to modernize water management in the
delta and upland river areas; provide consultant services, training and equipment for the disaster
awareness programn; and to introduce NGOs in support of tibal development initiatives and in the
fishing communities. Additional staff would be engaged for the purposes of carrying out the
Project, and such staff would be progressively absorbed into the GOAP system as the project nears
its end, to fill vacant positions arising from normal attrition, and would therefore not be surplus.
7.    Cost Estimates and Financing. Sumary cost estimates, showing project costs of
US$ 380 millon, and the financing plan are given in Schedule A attached. The proposed
Loan/Credit, with the proposed use of funds from the ongoing Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation
(AP II) Project, would together finance about 70% of project cost excluding taxes. The funds
from the reformulated AP R project would be limited to financing a part of the Irigation and
Drainage component After the project has been made effective, a Special Account would be
establshed in US dollars in the Reserve Bank of India with an initial deposit of US$ 20 million,
from which project expenditures would be reimbursed. GOI would throughout the life of the
Project, release about two months anticipated project expenditures in advance to GOAP. Prompdy
after each such release, GOAP would make similar advances, imited for project expenditures,



4
through the setting up of letters of credit, release of funds and government oes to the project
pardcipating departments and agencies, in accordance with its normal procedures for financing
state expenditures. Retroactive financing up to a total of US$ 20 million is proposed to cover
eligible project expenditure, incurred before signing but after June 16, 1990, the date of the
appraisal mission.
8.    IMkilntti n. The project would be implemented by the Project Management Unit
(PMU) which would be located in the Department of Finance and Planning in GOAP, and would
funcion under the umbrella of a Special Cabinet Committee headed by the Chief Minister. The
PMU would exise jurisdiction over specific project activities identified under each component,
wbich would be implemented by existing State departments and agencies and participating
municipalities. Given the small size of each package, civil works would be caried out by
contractors selected by LCB, except small and emergency works which could be done by "force
accout". Amounts and method of procurement are shown in Schedule B. Procedures for project
implementation and for sub-project appraisal would follow standards and operational procedures of
the participating departments and agencies, which are acceptable to the Bank. Amounts of
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are also shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
9.   Actions Ageed. GOAP has agreed to (a) caTry out such works under the project as shall
be acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with plans, technical, environmental design and standards
acceptable to the Bank; (b) by December 31,1993, increase the allocations for operations and
maintenance of the affected inigated areas by at least 80%o of the present allocation; (c) make
available to the beneficiaries the proceeds of the agricultural credit (para. 6e) in accordance vith the
Participating Agreements between the GOAP and the State's cooperative banks, incorporting the
arrangements for implementing this component; (d) manage, monitor and evaluate the progress of
the Project through the PMU; and (e) submit semi-annual progress report, beginning Januazy 1,
1991. In addition, GOI/GOAP has agreed to follow the anrangements for procurement,
accounting, auditing and reporting, acceptable to the Bank.
10.  Benefits and Risks. The project would have immediate economic and social benefits.
Economic benefits would derive from the reconstruction and rehabitation of infiasutue
necessary for the reestablishment of productive actvities which were either brought to a halt or
curtailed by reason of the diastus cyclone. This benefit would be more lasting than that of the
infrastructure it rplaced, as the proect would ensure that work implemented would be sufficiently
well designed, planned and executed to ensure the restoration of the assets at an improved
standard. This reconstruction, when added to the aspects of mitigation being introduced, would
significantly reduce the impact of future cyclones. Social benefits would also derive from the
reconstruction of infrastructure as roads and bridges are replaced and communication among
villages reinstated. Also, benefits would derive through replacing the livelihood of the poor
fishing cozmunities, tribal areas and the rehabilimtion of nrual and urban services.
11.  The major project risk is associated with its timely implementation. If it takes more than
three years to implement, one of the main rationale for it being an emergency project would
disappear. Steps have been taken to ensure that appropriate and streamined management and
opadonal procedures are put in place which would make the progam atainable, particularly in
counterpart financing and procurement Procedures introduced under the project provide: (a) for
an improved arrangement for channeling funds from GOI to the State, and downward to
participating departments and agencies; and (b) streamlined procurement procedures which are

expected to acceleme project implementation. Ihere axe no odter direct isks as the expectod
inestments are tied to tangible investments, as well as to known and proven tee&nologie
12.   Recnwndon I am satisfied that the proposed Loan/Credit would comply with the
Articles and Agreements of the Bank and the Assoaon and recommend that the Executve
Dits approve the proposed Loan/Credit

MIA
ANDHRA PRADESH CYCLONE EGMEGENCY RECONSTRUCIION PROJECr
A. BACKGROUND
1.    Andhra Pradesh (AP) is India's fifth largest state (274,000 sq. kIm), accounting for 8.4%
of the country's area. It is bounded to the north by Mahaashra, to the north-east by Orissa and
Madhya Pradesh, to the south by Tamil Nadu, to the west by Karnataka and to the east by the Bay
of Bengal. Administratively, it is divided into 23 districts and comprises 234 towns and 27,221
villages. The state comprises three main geographical regions; the Coastal Andhra region
coising the 9 districts included under this project - Srikfaklam, Vi2ianagram, Visahapanam,
East Godavan, West Godavan, Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore; Rayabaseema consisting
of 4 distncts; and Telan arawhich includes 10 districts including Hyderabad (the capital city). AP
is the fourth most populous state in India (about 60 million), with a population density of 195 per
sq. knm in 1981. The state has a 1,030 km coastline on the Bay of Bengal, and two of India's
largest rivers (Godavari and Krishna) with large irrigated deltas at their convergence with the Bay
of Bengal The coastal districts cover some of the most fertile and densely populated areas of the
state. This coastline has the dubious distinction of being the most cyclone prone zone in India and
since 1900 there have been 57 cyclones. Most occur in November, the recent May cyclone being
relatively unusual as there have been only 13 May cyclones durng this century to date. On May 9,
1990, the latest and one of the most destructive cyclones hit the AP coastline with winds reaching
up to 250 km per hour which were prolonged and extended over a period of about 20 hours,
ins-ad of the more usual 6 to 8 hour period. It was accompanied by a tidal wave rising to about 4
meters and enteing up to 10 kan inland in some areas. The occurrence of a tidal wave and serious
sea intrusion is infrequent, the last significant tidal wave being in 1977. In addition to high winds,
cyclonic storms are charactized by heavy rains which was abnormally heavy in this instance,
with rainfall ranging in different districts between 300 mm to 500 mm over 3 days. The normal
rainfaU in May in the coastal distdcts averages 53 mm compared with the average of 366 mm for
the same districts for the first 13 days of May 1990.
2.    Extent of Damage: The 1990 cyclone damaged 10 disticts, including all 9 coastal
districts, and affected 5,160 villages and about 8 million people. The loss of life was 967, with
heavy damages to infiastructure and productivity in aU sectors, which in total was estimated at
Rs 22 billion (US$ 1,250 M). Damage to the irrigation, drainage and water supply systems was
extensive. In the Krishna delta, heavy damage was caused by breaches in the tidal banks which
resulted in the incursion of saline water, which was further aggravated by flooding arising from the
heavy rains. These heavy rains, well beyond normal expectations, resulted in drains and some
reservoirs overflowing their banks and causing damage to the irrigation canal system. Also, the
minor irgation system was heavily damaged as all upland streams and rivers were flooded. As
the tidal wave advanced inwards, the saline water entered all the drinklng water tanks in the coastal
area causing contaminatior to the rural water supply system. Many roads and bridges were
breached or washed away, and with the heavy flood waters caused raffic to be intempted in some
key junctions and highways. About 75%o of the 17,000 km of state highways and major state roads
were badly affected. Also, many small rads connecting villages and interior areas were damaged.
This impeded the relief efforts for the supply of food, drinking water, and essential services. In
the hilly and tnbal areas there were landslides which breached roads, with embanknnts and cross
drains washed away or badly damaged. There was serious disruption to the elecricity supply
caused by the high winds and floods throughout the affected area, affectng almost 17,000



15
distribution transformers and 48,000 an of distribution lines. Suffering significantly were the
agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and fisheries sub-sectors. In addition to standing crops
which were destroyed, there was recently harvested paddy in the fields which was washed away or
inundated by the floods. Because of the tidal wave, seawater entered inland and affected about
50,000 ha in four districts (Krishna, Guntur, W. Godavari and Prakasam). As a result of the
floods, river banks were breached which resulted in sandcastng, taking out of immediate
production some 16,000 ha of cultivatable land. In horticulture, the coastal dstricts contribute
nearly 75% of the State's fuit production, which will be gready reduced for both the current year's
production and for longer periods. In animal husbandry, it was reported that about 24,000 cattle,
92,000 sheep and goats and 4.3 million poultry died from exposure, starvation or being washed
away. Coastal dwellers, pardcuarly the fishing communities, suffered badly. In addition to
houses being washed away or badly damaged, more than 10% of fishing craft were lost or badly
damaged, about 60% of tackle was lost and a large percentage of the remainder also damaged. In
addition, many fresh water fish ponds and brackish water prawn ponds were affected. For
housing in general, about 1.6 million dwelings were damaged to varying degrees, particularly in
the coastal villages. With government assistance, many of these were repaired, and for those with
income below Rs. 500 per month (US$ 30), some additional relief has been given through the
distribution of rice, clothing, and utensils.
3.    Pre-Cclone Actions and Subsequent Relief Measures: Because of the regularity with
which cyclones affect the coastal district, with varying degrees of severity, the official machinery
to deal with their impact has improved over the years with the greatest strides made after the 1977
cyclone, the last really severe cyclone, which killed about 10,000 people. As a result of that
cyclone, the height of the tidal bank was increased, cyclone shelters were built and the early
warning system and evacuation procedures improved. These contributed significantly to the
reduced loss of lives in the 1990 cyclone, which was actually worse than the 1977 cyclone in terms
of wind and water damage to infructure and productivity. As soon as the Indian meteorological
department announced that a severe cyclone was moving toward the AP coast, evacuation actions
were initiated from vulnerable coastal and low lying areas. In all, about 650,000 people were
evacuated from 546 villages and sheltered in 1,098 relief centers, which were served by medical
teams, for periods of 3 to 8 days. In addition, cyclone shelters accommodated another 250,000
people. In addition to the government machinery, the army, air force, navy and many voluntary
organizations contributed to the relief efforts and with the help of 11 helicopters, food, water and
milk packets were dropped to marooned and inaccessible areas for a period of 10 days. As villages
returned to accessibility, 543 medical and 2,450 para-medical teams attended to diarrhoea
surveillance, chlorination of drinking water, disinfeedon, medical aid, injuries, anti-cholera
inoculations, and other anti-epidemic measures. Also, over 30 water tankers were engaged to
supply drinking water to affected areas, where roads were passable. Drinking water was also
conveyed by boats where there were no passable roads.
4.    Status of State Finances: AP, like most other Indian states in recent years, suffers annual
revenue deficits and finances most of its capital expenditure through borrowings. As a result, the
devastating cyclone has a significant effect on its already bad financial situation. Expenditure of
Rs. 2,500 million (IJS$ 145 million) has already been made and/or committed on rescue and
urgent relief operations, of which Rs. 640 million (US$ 37 million) was received from the
Government of India (GOI) as a contribution from the Calamity Relief Fund. The remaining
Rs. 1,860 million, which is being financed from APs resources, is equivalent to about 12% of its
"PLAN" expenditure for the year 1990-91. "PLAN" expenditures are development expenditures
(whether capital or revenue) relating to (a) social services which include health, housing,
education, water, sanitation, urban and social welfare; and (b) economic services which include
agricultre, cooperation, irgation, flood control, power, industry, transport, and



16
communications. As agricultual production falls as a result of the cyclone, it is expected that state
revenues will correspondingly be reduced in 1990-91. However, the largest effect on state
finances will be the additional expenses associated with the program for the cyclone reconstruction
and those mitigation measures considered urgent, especially for improving the irrigation and
drainage sysm  and for reconstructing the roads and bridges damaged. In view of the above, it
would be very difficult for the Govenmment of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) to finance the above
program without the Bank or other outside assistance.
B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
5.    The Bank's response to the GOI/GOAP request for assistance has been to (a) assist the
GOAP to identify and prepare a cyclone emergency reconstruction and mitigation program,
ensuring that all items in the program are urgent and essential; (b) give priority to actions that
ensure a quick resumption of normal economic activity, (c) ensure that all components included are
cyclone related and can be implemented within the three-year project period, (d) give pnonty to
components which affect the greater number of peopIe, with particular reference to the weaker
sections of the population, such as the frequent disaster stricken fishing commnuities and the poor
hill tribes; (e) reduce the immediate vulnerability of the coastal districts to future cyclones and
floodings; and (f) strengthen the institutional capability of the participating departments and
agencies involved in disaster prevendon, preparedness, reconstruction and mitigation activities.
The Bank's involvement would provide resources and technical support to ensure that the
necessary reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure and the restoration of productivity is
accelerated and implemented in the most efficient manner, with attention to improved standards and
productivity wherever this is feasible. In addition, it is proposed that the ongoing Second Andhra
Jradesh Irigation (AP II) Project (Credit 1665-IN/Loan 2662-IN), which supports irrigadon
development in the state, be reformulated to allow the use of some of its funds to finance part of
the irrigation and drainage component of the proposed project
6.    GOAP has prepared a program of Rs. 28 billion (US$ 1,628 million) which would not
only address matters of urgency but would also include a long term program for mitigation, such
as the modenization of the deltas and a comprehensive water management program  At the same
dme, reconstruction and rehabilitation is also being undertaken by the higher-income population,
financed with their own-resources including private insurance claims. From GOAP's overall
program, the Bank has idendfied an Emergency Program (ERL) within the guidelines discussed in
pam 5 above. This program has been limited to the capabilities of the related institutions and basic
infrastucture of personnel and skills, available contactors, equipment and materials required to
imnplement it within the projectperiod of 3 years. The project components and costs. excluding
taxes and duties. are summazed below:

While the majority of the above costs are for reconstruction and rehabilitation, the emphasis on
improved stndards and quality will contribute to mitigation. It is only those expenses associated
with the coastal shelter belts and the technical studies included under the Technical Assistance
coponent that would be for mitigation only. Physical contingencies have been esdmated at 10%
obase costs. Price contingencies (foreign and local) have been estmated at 3% per annum, after
adjusting for expected vaniations in the rupee to the US dollar during the life of the project.

A, It is proposed that Credit 1665-IN, which finances the Second Andhra Pradesh irrigation
Project, would be amended to allow it to finance cyclone reconstruction in the areas of
irrigation and dainage.
The proposed Loan/Credit and the financial support expected from AP II lIrigation Project would
together finance 70% of the project costs, excluding taxes and duties (estimated at US$ 15
million). The proposed Bank financing would not include finance for the housing, public
buildings and coastal shelter components (US$ 23 million in total), and these components would



18
be financed fuly by GOAP as a part of their overall counterpart financing of the project The
proposed AP 1I funds of US$ 55 million would be restricted to financing a part of the lirigation
and Drainage component of this Project, on sinilar terms as the Loan/Credit. GOAP would
include the reqrements for counterpart funding in their annual "PLAN" budgets, and a
commitment has already been made for the requirements for the rmainder of the curent fiscal
year.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
8.    Consistent with the general approach adopted in an Emergency Projec, the project has been
limited to the most urgent reconstruction activities that can be implemented during a three year
period, and including only the most urgent aspects of mitigation. These activities, which are
sunmmrized as a set of detailed Project Working Papers (PWP), identify specific infrstructure and
services which would be reconstructed, repaired or rehabilitated under the project GOAP plans to
carry out the project in accordance with the guidelines sunmarized in the PWP, with any
significant deviation therefrom being subject to the concturence of the Bank. The project, as
summarized above, is discussed in the following paragraphs, showing the related base costs
excluding taxes.
9.   Irrigation and Drainage (US$111 million). This component would finance the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of the irxigation and drainage systems in the delta areas, covering
over 1 million ha, and the upland portion of districts in the affected areas. The guiding principles
for developing this program would be to (a) reduce the impact of upland drainage on the deltas; (b)
clean, restore and improve channels and embankments of major, medium and minor drains in the
deltas; (c) sore and improve tidal protecon and man-made river embankments bached or
highly eroded, (d) construct flood control  nkts and canal drainage structures to improve
drainage; (e) provide a regulatory structure just below the KoLeru Lake on the outfall drain to the
sea, to keep out salt water during low runoff periods, and to control fresh water levels m the Lake
on a seasonal basis; (f) relieve chronic flooding conditions affecting urban and municipal areas; (g)
construct and improve sea-face outfall drainage and salinity ingress control structus as needed
and (h) restore minor ingation tanks which are still considered efficient. This component would
be implemented by the Irrigation and Drainage and the Panchayat Raj (local goverment)
departments of GOAP. Over 80% of the costs would be for civil works, which would be widely
scattered and involve many fairly small contrwcts To ensure timely project implementation,
GOAP has prepared an action plan supported by bar-charts, and has already sanctioned the
additional staffing positions necessary for project implementation and supervision. In addition to
the Departments' own quality control staff, the project would be monitored by an independent four
man Technical Committee, which has aready been selected in consultation with the Bank, with
expertise in engineering appropriate with the program, to review on a quarterly basis through
discussions and on site visits, project progress with special attention to quality control. This
Technical Committee would assist in the definition and agreement of acceptable standards for
project implementation. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) allocation for the irrigated area was
recently increased from Rs. 50 per ha to Rs. 75 per ha, but this is stilI below the minimum of
Rs. 130 per ha (excluding establishment costs) considered reasonable by the engineers. GOAP,
however, gave an assurance that the O&M allocation would be increased to at least Rs. 130 per ha
within the project period. Also, included under the Technical Assistance component (para 19) is
US$ 5.6 million to finance two major integrated land and water management swveys and studies
(Delta Plan) for (i) the Krishna and Godavai deltas and (i) the seven coastal river basins in the
districts north of the Godavari delta. These surveys/studies would update and take into
consideration previous studies such as the well known Mitra report, and could well form the basis
for a future free standing project to address the needed modnization of the deltas. Ihe guidelines



19
for preparing the Terms of References have been included as a part of the PWP.
10.  Roads and Bidfes (US$ 93 million). This component provides for the reconstruction and
repairs of the most urgent of about 13,000 kIn of state and 12,000 km of rumral roads damaged by
the cyclone, about 100 km of road emnbadnments, and related bridges and culverts damaged to
varying degrees, which works are considered possible within the project penod. These works
would result in the restortion of communication with coastal villages wbich are still isolated
because of the cyclone damage, and the stalizing of slopes and repair of . - ads damaged by
landslides in the mountainous tribal areas. Those works left out, particularly bridges, relate mainly
to lighdy trafficked roads and while weakened, are serviceable for the time being. About 63% of
the works would be canied out under the Panchayat Raj Department, reflecting the relauvely small
size and scattered nature of the works, and the remainder of 37% carried out by the Roads and
Building Department. Roads and bridges together are expected to account for 80% of total works,
landslides and embankments 14% and equipment purchases 6%. Unless individual works are too
small or renote to preclude them, the majority of the works are expected to be executed by
contractors. Because the resources of the implementing departments would be fully stretched
preparing contact documents for the roads works, consultants would be engaged for the designing
and planning of bridges, at least to the contract stage.
11. Cyclone Shelters (US$ 5 million): In addition to about 800 cyclone shelters already
constructed, GOAP plans to introduce another 848 shelters to complete their program for having
shelters at all vulnerable points within a 20 km distance from the shore. Under the project, 187 of
these shelters would be built under the supervision of the Roads and Building Department, in the
most vulnerable 0-5 km zone along the coast These should be of the rectangular shape (there are
three existing designs), which has the advantage of better utilization as a normal non-emergency
village amenity, with a capacity for 200 people. It is expected that they would have a floor area of
about 1,100 sq. ft. on each level, witiin easy access to the public road. As an improvement on
most exisdng shelters, some special sanitary facilities such as dry Latines would be provided, and
also special arrangements for storing water, especially after cyclone wamings are broadcast, or for
collecting rain water from the rains. It is expected that some voluntary or other donor
organzations would construct some of the remaining shelters needed. In an effort to improve the
maintenance of these shelters, the Panchayat Raj would be involved in their management after
construction, and would be encouraged to utilize them on an ongoing basis, with the involvement
of NGOs whenever possible.
12.   Electricity (US$ 40 million'): This component would be implemented by the Andhra
Pradesh State Electncity Board (APSEB), which has the reputation of being one of the better
managed Electricity Boards in India, with its main generating center at Vijayawada being one of the
most efficient in the county. The project would repair and strengthen the 33 kv and 11 kv
systems, and also replace transformers and other equipment held for development but used to
repair the cyclone damage. In an attempt to ensure that electric supply to major load centers is not
lost for long periods, the project would rebuild about 25% of the 33 kv lines, in the cyclone prone
areas, which would firm up supply to towns and municipalities, thereby benefiting the largest
percentage of consumers. One part of this work would cover 325 km, using strutures and
conductors suitable to the existing 132 kv transmission system and which would have the
advantage that no new design work would be required and could therefore be carried out with
minimum delay. About 190 km of 33 kv lines would be rebuilt using pre-stressed spun concrete
poles to provide higher strengdL In addition, 5 new 132 kv injection points would be added where
132 kv lines already run close to suitable 33 kv circuits. While the strengthening of the 33 kv
system would ensure that the electric supply to major towns would not be lost, the normal
overhead distribution system would usually be disconnected during penods of disastous cyclones



20
to avoid death from fallen lines through electrocution. It is therefore proposed to introduce through
a combination of underground cables and overhead insulated cables an installation that would serve
at all times important loads such as hospitals, water supply, telephone exchanges, and
adiinistrative centers. As a result, 11 Ikv circuits would be introduced in the 3 major towns
(Vijayawada, Guntr and Visakhapatnam) in the coastal cyclone prone zone. As a follow up to the
reinforced 33 kv system to the towns, about 581 man of 11 kv lines (about 6% of 11 kv lines)
would be rebuilt using stronger poles, to serve the 26 towns and municipalities in the area. To
facilitate APs electdcity expansion program of about 12% annually (demand is well ahead of the
current ability to supply), APSEB usually maintains large quantities of line materials, poles,
insulators, conductors, and 11 kv transfomers. This large inventory level at this time was
convenient to facilitate the speedy rehabilitation of much of the system destroyed, but has at the
same time curtailed the expansion programm The project would replace these items to facilitate the
bringing back of the expansion program on schedule. Some needed tools and vehicles would also
be included. The time schedule for the above construction prgram has been evolved to coincide
with the procurement program and with the availability of skilled personnel to supervise this worlk
While most of the work would be carried out by contractors, special works like the erection of
power transformer and other equipment in the sub-stations would be carried out departmentally. A
special cell has been set up under the direction of the Board of Directors to monitor
implementation.
13.   Agiculture and Fisheries (US$ 24 millionj: This component comprises US$ 10 million for
agriculture and US$ 14 million for fisheries, of which a total of US$ 18 million would be by way
of credit (para 14), restricted to cyclone victms. Apart from credit for agriculture, the project
would finance at an estimated cost of about US$ 2 million the rehabilitation of 10 existing
nurseries, 3 new nurseries and a coconut seed garden to support the replacement of horticultural
crops damaged by the cyclone. This would in addition to aiding reconstruction, also contibute to
mitigation as emphasis would be placed on wind tolerant coconut and cashew plantings. These
nurseries would only be complementary to existing private nurseries, and seedlings would be sold
at a proximately cost to ensure fair competition and future self susmainability. For fisheries, about
US$4.0 million would be used to repair the damaged ports and harbours of Kakinada,
Machilipatnam and Nizampatnam, with that at Machilipatnam being by far the worst.
14.   Ct  Of the total credit of US$ 18 million, the project would provide US$ 8 mi}lior, for
agriculture and US$ 10 million for fisheries. From the allocation foragriculte, it would provide
US$ 3.0 million for sandcasting and US$ 5 million for horticultural tree crops. Credit given for
sandcasting would be for small and marginal farmers in the badly hit areas of Visakhapatnam and
Vanagram. At least 30% of the works financed by the credit component would be coordinated by
GOAP approved NGOs who would develop apprpriate programs for sand clearing. These NGOs
would, in the implementation of the works, ensure the employment of as many of the poor as
possible, of which they should try to ensure that at least 50% are women. (Sand clearing costs
using NGOs is estimated at Rs. 7,500 per ha compared to about Rs. 12,000 per ha otherwise).
Credit for horticulture would finance the first 3 years cost of a 6-7 year program to replant about
14,000 hectares of fruit trees (mainly coconut, cashew, mango and citrus), and would be eligible
for all farmers who suffered cyclone damage. The fisheries allocation of US$ 10 million for credit
would be to assist the artisanal fishermen and small scale fish farmers, who have suffered outright
loss or damage to their boats, fishing nets and fish ponds during the cyclone, to replace or repair
their property and thereby regain their means of livelihood. It would enable them to reconstruct
about 3,500 new and repair about 5,000 damaged ardsanal boats, replace up to 4,500 local type
catamarans, provide material to replace fishing gear, finance the rehabilitation and restocldng of
3,500 brackish water prawn tanks and 5,000 ha of fresh water carp ponds. This reconstruction
program will enable up to 30,000 active fishermen to resume their occupation., and a large number



21
of small scale fish farmers would also be assisted. This credit program proposes to incorporate the
services of the Andhra Pradesh Fishing Department (APFD) which has a traditionaUy close contact
with the fishing commudties. APFD officers werd assist the cooperative banks in the
identification and processing of credit beneficianes and in loan recovery. An effort would be made
to ensure that at least 60% of the number of loans would require the participation of women
(women in the family would become co-owner of the boat and co-signer of the credit). Group
formation would be encouraged for credit proessing and the involvement of NGOs would be
encouraged for organizing the reconstruction and repairs of the boats. All credit under the project
would be channelled hrough the two State cooperative banks for reimbursement from the PMU,
with onlending based on the current national credit arrangements for loan apprisal and interest
charged (10% intest per annum for smal and marginal farmers and 12 1/2% for others). In this
respect, the cooperative banking system would, for a 3 1/2 % commission, act as the
administrative agent of the GOAP. Tle above arrangements would be embodied in two
Participating Agreements between the two State participating cooperative banks and the GOAP,
and this special program would have no net effect on the financial performance of the cooperative
banking system. The State would bear the credit risk for non-recovery, after being satisfied that the
banks have taken reasonable steps for loan recovery.
15.   Rural Water Supply (JS$ 9 million): The project would finance the reconstruction of over
1,600 village water supply schemes, consisting mainly of wells and summer storage tanks which
were filled with saline water from the dal incursion, and in many of which the physical works and
pumps were damaged. Some of the most urgent repairs have akeady been canied out and the
remaining reconstrution is assessed to cost US$ 3 million. Even after the flooding recedes, most
of the affected areas remain submerged for a few days and the people retning to their homes find
it hard to obtain drinking water. Because of this, GOAP plans to introduce a mitigation scheme by
building the headworks for water supply (storage and treatment works), for about 1,300 villages
which are within a 20 km zone from the sea, beyond the reasonably anticipated reach of the tidal
wave and to distribute water therefom. Under the project, the most vulnerable 200 villages within
a 5 km zone from the sea would be tackled at an estimated cost of US$ 7 millon, taking into
consideration the Panchayat Raj's ability to implement this pordon of the scheme within the project
period. Included would be 12 comrehensive piped water supply schemes covering 182 villages
and serving about 200,000 people, and individual schemes for 18 villages serving about 60,000
People. The design criteria would conform to GOrs published guideines, with elevated reservoirs
able to withstand expected wind pressures, pipe materials would be'orrosion free, water quality
testing laboratories at the headworks would be included, and the beneficiary communities would be
involved in aspects of the installation such as the locating of public stand posts. The Panchayat Raj
depament would be responsible for project implementation and subsequent maintenance and
monitoring. There would be no cost recovery as water would be supplied through public stand
pipes, however, approved NGOs would be encouraged to become involved both as small
contractors and in organizing village groups for maintenance. A detailed action plan for the
implementation of these works was received and is considered satisfactory.
16.   Municipal Services (US$ 10 million): The project would support the reconstruction of
several roads and drains badly damaged during the cyclone in 26 municipalities with a combined
population of about 2.5 million people. The works would include about 200 km of asphalt and 185
kn of water bound macadam roads and about 120 km of drains. In addition, the project would
rehabilitate damaged water supply including infiltration wells, pump houses and equipment located
in river beds and banks serving these towns. To carry out these works, it was assessed that Rs. 80
million would be needed for roads, Rs. 70 million for drains and Rs. 44 million for water supply,
a total of Rs. 194 million (US$ 10 million). The above reconstruction would be caried out
trough local contractors supervsed by municipal engineers, who have the experience to carry out



22
such works. A detailed action plan for the inplementation of these works was prepared and is
considered satisfactory. As these works relate to existing infrastructure, no additional maintenance
costs would aise to these municipalities.
17.  Housing and Public Buildings (US$ 17 million): While these two components are included
under the project, they would be fully financed by GOAP. About 75% of the houses in the coastal
districts have roofs of grass, leaves, reeds, thatch or bamboo, and about 65% have walls of either
of the above materials or mud. All these houses are being reconstructed by their inhabitants
themselves with the aid of a GOAP contribution for materials, expected to cost a total of Rs. 460
million (US$ 24 million). Of this amount, US$ 10 million has been included under the project as
being the amount falling in the period that would have been eligible for retroactive financing, had
the Bank financed this component. Public Buildings at a total cost of US$ 7 million would
include the reconstuction of high, elementary and primary schools, other educational and medical
buildings damaged during the cyclone to varying degrees. Tle reconstmcfion would be
implemented by the Panchayat Raj (60%) and the Roads and Buileing (40%) Departments under
the normal procedures applicable to the project.
18.   Coastal Shelter Belts (US$6 million): This component would also be fully financed by
GOAP. Vegetative shelter belts reduce wind velocity, and also provide a shelter from the wind for
an area immediately behind the belt of trees, the extent of which varies depending on their height
and depdth. Shelter belts were introduced in AP after the disastrous 1977 cyclone and about half the
coastline is covered to some extent. GOAP's intention is to thicken and widen the existing belt and
to expand it to cover the entire coastline. The project would only include the expansion considered
reasonably possible durng the project period, and priority would be given to the re-establishment
of those plantations damaged during the cyclone, at a cost of about US$ 3 million. The next
priority would be for the establishment of the shelter in high risk areas, where the density of
human population is high and/or valuable crops are cultivated. It is estimated that about 12,000 ha
would be planted. These plantations would include suitable trees with commercial value to ensure
the future sustainability of the program, as there is a demand for timber for boat building and for an
adjacent paper mill. While the majority of the area would be govemment lands, seedlings would
be given to private farmers to encourage the expansion of the vegetadve belt on private lands,
which it is expected they would want to expand on their own once they experienced the economic
benefit of growing these trees. This component would be implemented by the Andhra Pradesh
Forestry Department (APFD) and about 30 ha of nurseies would be established. The main cost
would be the establishment of the plantations on GOAP lands, followed by the cost of seedlings to
farmers and APFD's incremental cost for the progra. As there is no real track record to show
how well APFD will manage the commercial part of this program and this aspect will require close
monitoring by the PMU and the Bank during implementation.
19.   Technical Assistance (US$ 13 million): Technical Assistance comprises (a) project support
for technical studies (US$ 6 million) including the irrigation and drainage studies discussed in
para 9; and (b) capacity building for organizational improvement and training (US$ 7 million).
Technical assistance for capacity building would provide: (i) US$ 2.5 million for consultancy by
approved NGOs including related equipment and vehicles to support development in tribal areas
and in the poor fishing communities. An analysis of the catastrophe in the tribal areas brings to the
surface the problem of increased deforestation in the hills area which is aggravated by the prctice
of shifting cultivation, "podu", prcticed by the tribals. The resulting erosion has led to a number
of landslides, disrupting communications and the irrigation system and badly damaging crops. As
a result, about 12% of the minor irrigation works and 10%lo of the roads and bridges components
would be for works in the tribal areas. The amount included for development in the trib areas
would be to support the work of NGOs with tribals, who are being encouraged to grow



23
horticultual crops such as coffee, cashew, and -1ango. The amount allocated would be used for
the establishment of nwseries, soil conservatiun imeasures, and vegetative bunding. Also, the
NGOs would seek to develop groups for community efforts, encouraging the women to play an
equal role to men, for liaising with the related govemnment departments and for organizing and
monitoring the suppoted activites, which would also be extended to the planned and controlled
harvesting of firewood. For the fishing comunities, NGOs would assist in the implementation of
the fishery reconstrucion, icluding the sourcing of the necessary timber needed for boat
construction, and the construction and repair of boat, an area where there is a skill shortage; (ii)
US$ 1.2 million for equipment, including radios, in support of the continWng development of the
early waming system and disaster management; and (iii) US$ 3.3 million in support of the PMU to
finance the cost of the technical consultants for the inigation and drainage, and other consultancy
necessaxy such as for roads and bridges, and for equipment, vehicles and training.
20. Incremental Staff Salaries (US$ 13 million): In the light of the emergency nature of the
project and the need to ensure reconstruction and repairs within as short a time as possible, GOAP
has found it necessay to engage engineers and other key staff for the project GOAP plans,
towards the projected completion time, to absorb progressively these additional staff into the
GOAP system to replace vacant positions arising from normal attrition, and they would therefore
not be surplus. In addition, GOAPplans to mininize the movement of project stff during
implemention to facilitate a smooth and efficient opeaton.
D- INSTIlUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
21.   Qrizaton: The project would be administwd by the Project Management Unit (PMU),
which would exercise overall jurisdiction over the specific activities included under the project (see
Project Description Paras. 8-20) and detailed in the PWP. The PMU would function under the
umbrella of a special Cabinet Committee headed by the Chief Ministr of GOAP, which has
assumed overall responsibility for project approvals for al components, and the overall monitoring
of project implementation against the agreed schedule of three years. The PMU would be located in
the Department of Finance and Planning and intially, headed by the Secretary of Finance, with an
officer at the level of Joint Secretary being assigned full-time to the unit It will include in its
complement, a ful-time senior finance officer to be in charge of controlling all financial
transactions, withdrawal applications and the project accounts and reporting, a senior officer
conversant with Bank procurement pracdtes, and other staffing considered necessay for a smooth
operation. It would also have an accounts monitoring official posted in the participating
departments/agencies offices. In addition, the PMU has engaged a team of technical consultants to
monitor the inigation and drainage component and a separate consultant to review the roads and
bridges component. The above teams would review and report to the PMU and the Bank on a
quarterly basis, implementation progress with particular attention to quality. Other consultants
would also be hZ-ed as necessary, including an environmental specialist, acceptable to the Bank,
who would monitor the environmental impact of actions being financed under the project. As
discussed under the Project Description, specific activities included under the project components
would be implemented by existing state departments and agencies responsible for their respective
activities, and will each appoint a senior officer responsible for project coordination and liaison
with the PMU. Tne capacity of all these departnents and agencies involved in the project was
evaluated during appraisal and their operatng procedures discussed and were found satisfactory
for the projec's implementation.
22.   Procurement: (a) Civil works are scattered and are of small size and as a result unlikely to
attract foreign bids. Therefore, procurement would be tbrough local procedures acceptable to the



24
Bank. Of this, smal and emergency works costing less than US$ 100,000 to a total of US$ 25
million can be canied out by force account, or by limited local bidding by inviting bids from not
less than three from a pre-selected list of qualified contcors. Also, cost-plus contcs would be
allowed, not exceeding US$ 50,000 each and up to an aggregate of US$ 3 million for urgent
reconstruction work to restore services. A list of these conrcs should be fumished to the Bank
for approval before being awarded The remainder would be procured under local competitive
bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Post qualifcation would be adopted for all LCB
contracts and minimum qualifying criteria fixed for each package (experience and past performance
on similar contracts, capabilities of personnel, availability of equipment and plant rd, and
adequate financial resources). (b) Contracts for equipment, materials and vehicles costng
US$ 200, 000 or more would be procured under interational competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures. Contracts below US$ 200, 000 would be procued under LCB procedures acceptable
to the Bank. Local or intemational shopping would be alowed, after asking for quotations from at
least three suppliers, for purchases of equipment, materials and vehicles costing less than
US$ 50,000 each up to an aggregate of US$ 2 million. (c) Prior review would apply to contracts
for works costing US$ 5 million or more and fo: equipment, materials and vehicles costing
US$ 0.5 million or more. To simplify for efficient procurement, works of similar nature would
be clustered in groups of up to US$ 120,000 equivalent, provided such groups of works do not
exceed 30% of total works under each component (40% of minor irrigation works allowed).
Credit under the agriculture and fisheries components (paras. 13-14) would be based on
investment plans as appraised by the cooperative banking system on behalf of the State. Goods
and services under this component will be purchased at a reasonable price, ensuring efficiency and
quality. Bank procurement guidelines and requirements were discussed with all the participating
departments and agencies, and the majority of officers have pnror experience with Bank
procurement procedures. In addition, the new procurement officer in the PMU would spend a few
days with the Bank's procurement department in Delhi to become fully conversant with Bank
procedures, to enable the efficient monitoring that would be carried out by the PMU. Plan of
actions, procument plans and coresponding bar-charts have already been prepared for aU the
components of the project. Consultants for the water management studies would be hired
according to the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, and the total value of such
contracts is estimated at US$ 5.6 nillion.
23.  Implementation. Disbursements and Financial Arrangments: The project is expected to be
implemented in three years, with closing date of March 31, 1994. swarctive financing up to a
total of US$20 million is proposed to cover eligible project expencitures incurred before signing
but after June 16,1990, the arrival date of the Bank appraisal niission in AP. The proceeds of the
Loan/Credit would be disbursed against eligible expenditures: civil works for irrigation and
drainage, roads and bridges, cyclone shelters, electricity, rural water supply, municipal services,
agriculture and fisheries - 70%; equipment, materials and vehicles - irrigation and drainage, roads
and buildings, electricity, rural water supply, municipal services, agriculture and fisheries - 100%
of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost), and 70% of local
expenditures for other items procured locally, agriculturl credit - 70%; incremental salaries -
60% (to reflect the average of a declining basis during the project life of 3 years); and technical
assistance - 100% of all expenditures. A Special Account would be established in US dollars in the
Reserve Bank of India with an initial deposit of US$ 20 million, equal to about four months
expenditures, from which project expenditures would be reimbursed. Disbursements against civil
works contracts of less than US$ 0.5 million, and equipment, materials, vehicles, consulting
services and training costing loss than US$ 200,000, and agricultural credit would be made
against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). All other payments would be made against full
documentation. For those expenditures which have been authorized for the use of SOEs, the
Bank's nonmal procedures would be followed. SOEs would be certified by GOI as representing



25
eligible project expenditures, and on which basis (in addidon to the nomal documentation such as
Withdrawal Application and Special Account Bank Statement) the expenditures would be
reimbursed from the Special Account and the Special Account replenished by the Bank for
reimbursement. The procedures for preparing the SOEs would be: (a) Project expenses would be
summanzed monthly for each participating department/agency under expense headings agreed with
the Bank and would accompany a sub-SOE (the same as a normal SOE except that it relates only to
the department/agency concerned), which woud be certified by the designated signing authorities
and forwarded to the PMU within 5 worldng days after each month end; (b) The PMU would
summize these sub-SOEs into an SOE, which would be appropriately certified and forwarded
within 10 days of each month end to the DEA (Ministy of Fiance in GOI) for processing and
reimbursement from the Special Account All supporting documentadon for the SOEs would be
retained by the responsible participating department/agency, and appropriately filed to enable easy
access for subsequent review and audit. GOT will fully pass on the proceeds of the Loan/Credit,
also including the funds from AP IU to GOAP in the namal 70:30 loan:grant) formula in which
assistance from the center is passed on to the states, with GOI assuming the foreign exchange
risks. In addition, GOI would throughout the life of the project, release about two months
antcipated project expenditures in advance to GOAP. Promptly after each such release, GOAP
would make similar advances, limited for project expenditures, through the setting up of Letters of
Credits, release of funds and government orders to the project participating departments and
agencies in accordance with its normal procedures for financing state expenditures. For its
counterpart financing, GOAP will ensure that anticipated prject expenditures are properly and
adequately included in the annual State budget plans, and it has already agreed a special
supplementary provision for the current penod until the next budget plan is prepared.
24. Project Accounts. Audits and Reports: Project expenditures incunmd by each participating
departnment/agency would be subject to the normal GOAP accounting procedures and control, with
the added requirement that a separate heading would be created in each department/agency for the
project, with appropriate sub-headings to account for the sub-components of the project The
summaries which would be used to support the sub-SOEs (pam 23) would form the background
for the project accounting to be mintained by the PMU, with the understanding that proper cross-
referencing should be maintained to ensure an easy trail from the records to the supporting
documentation. Non-SOE expenditures would be separtely incorporated into the accounts and
copies of related documentation also retained. The project accounts would be summaized on an
ongoing basis to show: (a) actual versus planned expenditures for e;h quarter, (b) actual versus
planned accumulated expenditures to date; and (c) how financed, showing expenditures financed
by the Bank and by GOAP separately. Appended to the project accounts would be a listing of the
Withdrawal Applications for the period concerned, showing the amounts reimbursed. Unaudited
project accounts with the above appendage would be submitted by the PMU on a quarterly basis to
reach the Bank within 45 days after the end of each quarter. The Accountant General of GOAP
will be considered the acceptable auditor and the audited project accounts including SOEs,
accompanied by the auditor's report and comments on the project accounts and the SOEs would be
submitted annually, to be received by the Bank no later than nine months theeftr. The Auditor
General of India would be the auditor for the Special Account The Auditor's Report, which
would be accompanied by a Summway Statement of the Special Account, would be submitted to be
received by the Bank no later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year. The PMU would
prepare a quarterly report on the projectes progress, showing the physical progress against plan for
each component, with explanation of any delay from plan and outining what remedial actions are
being taken. The quarterly report of the Technical Consultants (para. 20) would be the guide to
monitor aspects of quality, and the Procurement Specialist attached to the PMU would momtor
overall procuement. In particular, observations and remedial actions relating to the work of the
above Technical and other consultants and the Procurement Specialist will fozm an integral part of
the quarterly reports. The quarterly report will be submitted to the bank concurrent with the
unaudited quarterly project accounts discussed above.
