ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General Setting
1.01      Mali is a large landlocked country in Africa's Sahel region covering
1.24 million km2. It is sparsely populated, particularly in the northern
desert areas (almost two-thirds of the country), with a population of 6.3
million increasing at a rate of about 2.5% per year. About 90% of the popula-
tion lives in rural areas. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at about 6%
per year during 1974-78 was only US$120 per capita in 1978. Economic activity
is concentrated in the south of the country, where there is sufficient rain-
fall for rainfed agriculture.
1.02      Agriculture, including livestock raising and fishing, is the main-
stay of the economy and accounts for nearly half of GDP and for virtually
all foreign exchange earnings. Staple foods, such as sorghum and millet,
and drought tolerant export crops, such as cotton and groundnuts, are the
most important crops. In the Niger River Valley, particularly around Mopti,
there is some irrigated and flood recession cropping of rice. About 85% of
the 2 million hectares of land under cultivation are devoted to food crops;
cotton and groundnuts occupy about 100,000 and 250,000 hectares respectively.
1.03      In recent years, performance of the agricultural sector has suffered
from fluctuations in weather, particularly drought followed by occasional
flash flooding. The 1972-74 drought was catastrophic for animal husbandry:
the cattle population fell from 5.5 to 3.5 million. Cereal and export crops
also declined. However, production of export crops recovered rapidly and is
now substantially above pre-drought levels; the same is true for cereals, but
to a lesser extent. The catch of freshwater fish also exceeds pre-drought
levels.
1.04      The secondary sector, though small, has expanded more rapidly than
other sectors of the economy. Simple processing of agricultural products,
such as rice milling, cotton ginning, oil seed crushing, and the production
of agro-based factories such as textile mills and a sugar plant, account for
about half of the secondary sector. The remaining half comprises mainly
production of small import substitution and public utility goods.
1.05      Mali continues to suffer from several important development cons-
traints: (i) a weak agricultural base, because of poor soils and low, ill-
distributed rainfall; (ii) limited natural resources (identified mineral



resources are insignificant); (iii) a shortage of capital and skilled tech-
nical and managerial manpower; (iv) distance to the sea: Mali's principal
outlets to the sea, Dakar (by rail) and Abidjan (by road/rail), are 1,000 to
1,300 km from Bamako respectively; and (v) poor internal communications
due to the country's large size and its widely dispersed population.
B. Transport Infrastructure and Industry
1.06      Mali has a simple transport infrastructure with road and rail by
far the most important modes. The network consists of about 14,300 km of
roads and tracks; a 642 km single-track railway linking Koulikoro on the Niger
river with Bamako, Kayes (Mali's second largest town), and the Senegalese
border, where it joins the Senegalese railway (paras. 1.08 and 1.09); more
than 1,000 km of sparsely used inland waterways, navigable at best seven
months a year (para 1.10); and two international airports (para 1.11),
and several domestic airfields open to commercial traffic.
Road 'rransport
1.07      Road transport accounts for more than half of total freight trans-
port, including imports and exports, and probably 80% of all passenger
transport. Details of the road sub-sector are given in Chapter II.
Railway Transport
1.08      Chemin de Fer du Mali (CFM), the Mali Railway, a state-owned com-
pany, transports some 230,000 tons of freight per year or about half of Mali's
imports and exports (para 1.14) and almost all domestic freight and passenger
traffic west of Bamako. It was once part of the Dakar-Niger Railway, which
operated under a single management until 1960, when it was dissolved and
the assets were divided between CFM (38%) and the Senegalese railway (62%).
1.09      During the severe 1972-1974 drought, railway traffic increased sub-
stantially because large quantities of food were imported. After a decline
in 1975 and 1976, mainly caused by substantially reduced food imports signal-
ling the end of the drought, traffic increased in 1977 and 1978 by 3.2% and
4.2% respectively but still remains substantially below former expectation
because of a shift in traffic from rail to road (para. 1.13).
Water Transport
1.10      Water transport is only about 32,000 tons per year because the
two major rivers, the Niger and Senegal, which flow through the country
over a length of about 2,000 km, provide poor navigation conditions. The
Niger river constitutes the principal access route for the vast area northeast
of Mopti, which has about one million inhabitants. The period of navigability
extends from June/July to December from Koulikoro, near Bamako, east to Mopti,
and from August to October further east to Gao. Further navigation is impeded



- 3 -
by rapids about 150 km downstream from Gao. The Senegal river is navigable
from the sea up to Kayes, near the western border, only from August to October
which considerably limits its usefulness. A purpose of the proposed Manan-
thali Dam is to allow fuller utilization of the Senegal river. The only
company plying the Niger river is the state-owned Compagnie Malienne de
Navigation (COMANAV). On the Senegal river, transport is by private canoes.
Air Transport
1.11      Mali has two international airports:  at Senou near Bamako and at
Gao. The former was recently improved and can accommodate Boeing 707-type
aircraft. Thirty other airports are open to domestic traffic--but only seven
have regular commercial traffic: Kenieba, Kayes, Nioro, Nara, Mopti, Goundam
and Tombouctou. Air Mali, a state-owned company, carries all domestic and
about half the international passenger traffic.
1.12      Mali's air traffic statistics show a steady increase in interna-
tional air transport and a decrease in domestic air transport. Average
annual increases in international traffic during the years 1973-77 were
about 13% for passengers and 9% for freight. Domestic freight traffic,
about 150 tons in 1973, dropped to only 6 tons in 1977. This is mainly the
result of operational problems experienced by Air Mali. In a large, sparsely
inhabited country such as Mali, air transport may be a cost effective
transport mode for some parts of the country. A recently completed draft
Transport Plan Study (para 1.23) found that air transport could play a more
important role and recommended that the fleet of Air Mali, now obsolete, be
renewed.  This, however, should be carried out with a major reorganization--
technical and administrative--of the airline, which involves large invest-
ments. The study indicated that cooperation with foreign international
airlines could be a first step toward an improved service.
C. Access Routes to the Sea
1.13      Mali's international traffic to and from the sea moves over two
major routes: the Senegal route and the Ivory Coast route. The Senegal route
consists of the rail line (1,280 km) from the port of Dakar to Koulikoro. The
Ivory Coast route consists of a 610 km section between the port of Abidjan and
Ouangolodougou on the Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line (Regie Abidjan-Niger,
RAN) and a 580 km road section between Ouangolodougou and Bamako. At present,
the Malian traffic from Abidjan is carried mostly by road because the railway
station at Bobo-Dioulasso (Upper Volta), further north on the line, is no
longer used for political reasons, and Ouangolodougou has no storage facili-
ties. Alternative routes to the sea through Conakry (Guinea), Buchanan
(Liberia) and San Pedro (Ivory Coast) are shorter than through Dakar or
Abidjan, but have not been developed.
1.14      International traffic is almost evenly divided between the two most
important routes. As shown below, however, the Abidjan route has increased
its share of total foreign traffic from 38% in 1966 to 55% in 1977 in spite
of a clear cost disadvantage for goods whose origin or destination is the
Bamako area (about two-thirds of total exports-imports).

Via Abidjan      125     84    205    239    242    229    294    n.a.
1.15      The major reason for the imbalance in traffic is operational
difficulties on the Senegal and Mali railways and in the port of Dakar. Slow
mainline and terminal operations and lack of resources to complete railway
rehabilitation have been aggravated by poor operational management and staff
discipline, inadequate staff training, and poor coordination between the two
railway organizations.
1.16      As the Bamako-Dakar railway remains the in the short run least cost
means of transport from an economic standpoint, Mali should rely on the
Bamako-Dakar rail route to transport most of its imports and about half of its
exports. The Abidjan road and road/rail routes should be mainly used for
imports destined for Mali's eastern regions, exports of cotton products, and
contingencies when the Mali and Senegal railways are unable to meet demand.
However, allocation of traffic between the Senegal and the Ivory Coast routes
is not always made on sound economic criteria nor with sufficient knowledge of
all relevant data.
1.17      The Dakar-Bamako route has not always been able to meet demand
despite past efforts to improve both railways and. the transit through the port
of Dakar. However, two ongoing projects should arrest deterioration and lead
to improvements in management, operations, and capacity. At the same time,
the poor condition of 366 km of track in Senegal is going to require a massive
investment (US$70 million to US$120 million at 1978 prices) over a period of
10 to 15 years. Before such an investment is made, alternatives must be
carefully considered.



-5-
1.18      The most important alternative is a road linking Dakar with Bamako.
A paved road from Dakar to the Mali border will, in all likelihood, be com-
pleted by 1985. Once this road is completed, Mali will have to face the
dilemma of whether it will: (i) build a short road from the Senegalese border
to Kayes, possibly diverting traffic from the Dakar-Kayes section of the
railway and incurring transfer costs at Kayes; or (ii) build a much longer
road from the Senegalese border to Bamako, which could ultimately lead to the
diversion of the vast bulk of CMF's traffic to road transport.
1.19      Well before critical decisions are made, studies will have to
be undertaken to develop medium- and long-term strategies. These strategies
will need to be coordinated on a regional level in the light of plans to
complete a paved road system between Dakar and Kayes, Kayes and Bamako, San
Pedro and Bamako, and Conakry and Bamako. The Bank is studying the problem of
Mali's international corridors and is expected to discuss shortly with the
Government a work program which would assist Mali in arriving at a clear
understanding of the least-cost alternatives.
D. Transport Coordination and Planning
1.20      The Ministry of Planning (MP) is in charge of overall transport
policy and planning. Major transport companies are publicly owned: CFM,
COMANAV, Air Mali, and CMTR, a trucking company (para. 2.09). The Office
National des Transports (ONT) is a semi-autonomous Government agency res-
ponsible to the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPW), through which
the Government allocates freight to different companies, including private
truckers. The Government sets all domestic rail, air, river and trucking
tariffs.
1.21      There is no formal unit in MTPW to carry out transport planning
and coordination: individual advisors counsel the minister. The recently
completed draft Transport Plan Study recommends the creation of a unit to
continue to collect and process regularly transport data. This unit would
be staffed with Malian professionals who participated in the Transport Plan
Study and temporarily assisted by expatriate technical assistants.
1.22      The 1974-78 Economic and Social Development Plan, implicitly
extended to 1979, started in the middle of the drought and world-wide infla-
tion. Its long-term objectives were to ensure rising real incomes for the
entire population and to build a national economy insulated from adverse
climatic and external factors.  The plan outlined over-ambitious transport
investments. Out of forecasted investments for all sectors of almost MF 400
billion (US$900 million) at 1972 prices, about 20% or MF 80 billion (US$180
million) was for transport, of which 75% or MF 60 billion was for roads. By
end-1978 the total cost of the revised transport investments was MF 87 billion
at current prices, but only about MF 19.4 billion had been disbursed, mostly
for roads. Road investments (Table 1) have been primarily financed with
foreign aid, with a small local contribution to project costs (about 20%).



-6-
1.23       The ongoing discussion on the Transport Plan Study should help
the Government come to grips with the fact that there is a limit to the
growth of transport infrastructure and that emphasis must be put on better
use of the existing infrastructure. Isolated areas may have less expensive
transport links than roads, such as airfields, river ports or simple tracks.
Construction of other modal links duplicating existing infrastructure may
have to be postponed. Planned road expenditures of MF 100 billion for the
1979-83 period are somewhat lower in real terms than the MF 60 billion
during the 1974-79 period, but a realistic figure should probably not exceed
MF 10 billion per year, at current prices, or about half of the total now
being considered. The Government is examining the comprehensive report on
the transport plan and a synthesis highlighting the most critical features
is expected to be prepared by mid-1981.
11. THE ROAD SUBSECTOR
A. Road Network
2.01       Mali has about 14,300 km of roads and tracks, of which about 13,000
km are classified as national, regional or local, according to the importance
of the centers they serve and the traffic they carry. A summary presentation
of the road network follows.

2.02       The road network is concentrated in the south where population
density is highest. The main axes are Bamako-Faladie-Bougouni-Sikasso-Zegoua,
L.ie import-export route to Abidjan, and Faladie-Segou-Mopti, which serves the
eastern part of the country. Paving the Sikasso-Koutiaia link under financing
from the European Development Fund (EDF) will complete the direct road link
between the border with the Ivory Coast and Mopti. Construction to paved
standards of Sevare-Gao road (556 km) has started in 1980 under financing from
Germany and several Arab development banks. Existing paved roads were
constructed between 1955 and 1965 and are rapidly deteriorating because of
the increase in traffic and vehicle weight, and insufficient maintenance.
Faladie-Segou has been reconstructed under the Second Highway Project (para
2.32). Bamako-Bougouni urgently needs reconstruction. Bougouni-Sikasso-
Zegoua is receiving emergency maintenance under the Third Highway Project.
Other paved roads badly need maintenance. The main unpaved roads have rarely
been regravelled except for sporadic operations.
B. Road Transport Characteristics
Vehicle Fleet
2.03       The Office National des Transports registers new vehicles, but
does not record vehicles retired from service. The following table show
the vehicle fleet estimates from 1971 to 1978, the latest date for which
statistics are available. The vehicle fleet was estimated at 23,300 in 1978,
and is probably about 24,000 now.

2.04       Passenger vehicles constitute a rising percentage (58% in 1971
and 62% in 1978) of the vehicle fleet. Vans, trucks and heavy road tractors
decreased from 41% to 37% of the total fleet from 1971 to 1978, but transport
capacity increased considerably due to a shift from relatively small trucks
to large semi-trailers. The growth rate of the vehicle fleet, which averaged
almost 10% per annum between 1965 and 1971 and 7% between 1971 and 1975,
was only about 4% in 1976-78, but this rate may hide a substantial renewal
of the vehicle fleet.
Fuel Consumption
2.05       The following table shows the best estimate of fuel consumption by
road users as derived from data supplied by several sources.

Taxed consumption, which decreased in 1974 during the Sahelian drought,
increased in the 1975-1977 period with a peak in 1976 when concessions
for tax-free use of fuel were curtailed. The increase in diesel fuel con-
sumption has been more rapid than that of gasoline, which may reflect a shift
in the composition of the vehicle fleet towards heavier diesel trucks. Fuel
taxes are discussed in para 2.17.

from fuel taxes.

Traffic
2.06      During a two-week period in January (crop season) and in June (end
of the dry season), the subdivisions of the National Directorate or iubiic
Works (NDPW, para 2.10) take manual traffic counts, assess the quantities of
goods and passengers transported, and make an origin/destination survey. The
data should be analyzed by the General Studies and Programming Division (GSPD)
of NDPW but GSPD has not been able to process and verify data since 1976
because it is short of qualified staff.
2.07      The following table shows average traffic in 1976, the most recent
year for which processed data are available. Based on the increase in the
vehicle fleet and fuel consumption, road traffic is estimated to have
increased about 8% per year between 1975 and 1978.

C. Road Transport Industry
2.08      M4ali's road transport industry consists of about 500 private
truckers who own about 70% of the fleet of trucks above 5 tons, or about 1,080
trucks. State-owned companies manage the rest, but they carry less than 30%
of traffic because of their vehicles' lower capacity. Except about 20 larger
firms in Bamako, private truckers belong to regional cooperatives which are
loosely organized in the Union Nationale des Cooperatives de Transporteurs
Routiers (UNCTR). The cooperatives act mainly as lobby and mutual aid organi-
zations, and cover their costs by a small, variable levy. A proposal to set
this levy to 5% of the transport cost and to use these funds to organize
workshops in the regions is being discussed. Private taxis and minibuses
handle passenger transport.
2.09       The other components of the road transport industry are the
Government-owned Compagnie Malienne de Transports Routiers (CMTR), and agri-
cultural, commercial and industrial agencies possessing their own vehicle
fleets. CMTR is becoming less important in the road transport industry; its
fleet had gradually been reduced from 250 vehicles to about 60 vehicles by
IMarch 1976. Between 1976 and 1978 nearly 600 heavy trucks and semi-trailers
were added to the private trucking fleet, partly to replace obsolete vehicles.
The effect was to increase capacity beyond demand thereby creating irregulari-
ties in the allocation of freight. This was soon eliminated by the shift of
traffic from rail to road on the Abidjan route (para. 1.13); this is costly
and needs to be looked into urgently. The Bank study of Mali's corridors
(para 1.19) includes this issue.

D. Administration
2.10       The National Directorate of Public Works (NDPW) within the
Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPW), plans, designs, constructs
and maintains roads, and supervises technical studies for railways, river
ports and airports. NDPW has two divisions and three technical services
(Chart A): the General Studies and Programming Division (GSPD), in charge
of preparing investment and maintenance programs and budgets, and con-
trolling expenditures; the Technical Studies and Works Division (TSWD),
responsible for dealing with the study of projects and supervision of works;
the New Works Service (NWS), carrying out gravel road construction and
improvement; the Road Strengthening Service (RSS), dealing with major
maintenance of paved roads; and the Public Works Equipment Service (PWES),
which purchases and repairs road equipment. NDPW's eight Regional Direc-
torates of Public Works (RDPW) carry out road maintenance and other public
works activities through 18 subdivisions. An Accounting Office, supervised
by an Administrative and Financial Unit, performs accounting work. Other
MTPW branches relating to roads are: the Public Works Research and Experi-
ment Center (PWREC), which performs laboratory tests; the Surveying Insti-
tute (SI); and the Transport and Public Works' Training Center (Centre de
Perfectionnement des Transports et des Travaux Publics, CPTP).
E. Staffing and Training
2.11       NDPW's professional staff is composed of about 20 engineers and
60 technicians, all Malian. Generally, engineers have received adequate
training but many of the lower echelon technicians have only on-the-job
training. There is no permanent technical assistance, except one mechanical
engineer in PWES financed by the Fonds d-Aide et de Cooperation (FAC, France).
There are about 1,100 permanent workers. Temporary laborers vary between 300
and 500 according to seasonal requirements.
2.12       Training began under the First Highway Project (para 2.31).
Consultants in charge of training performed well but the tasks were too
large to be carried out in only three years. Therefore, technical assis-
tance was extended about one year under the Second Highway Project (para
2.32). Although road personnel was trained in basic skills, the reduced
maintenance activity over the past several years has had a detrimental
effect, and most old and new employees need further training. A training
center, CPTP, was created and facilities built under the Second Highway
Project, and equipment and technical assistance to train local instructors
were financed under the Third Highway Project. Little training has been
carried out at CPTP because the first instructors and monitors were not
appointed until October 1977 and then in insufficient number. At end-1979,
however, all instructors and monitors were appointed, and the Government has
extended a technical assistance contract for their training (para. 2.33)
under the Third Highway Project.

F. Planning
2.13       GSPD plans road construction, which is reviewed by the Ministry
of Planning, and road maintenance. Data collection and process-
ing have deteriorated during past years, but the Malian counterparts who
participated in the Transport Plan Study have acquired sufficient experience
to continue the data collection and processing effort generated by the study.
A transport data collection unit, which will be assisted by the proposed
project, would improve the situation (para. 3.21).
G. Financing
2.14       Road user charges comprise taxes levied on fuel and lubricants,
imported vehicles and spare parts, vehicle registration fees and duties,
and taxes on insurance and freight vehicles. Import taxes and customs duty
on gasoline and diesel fuel are the only user charges earmarked for the Road
Fund (para 2.15) and were raised in November 1979 (para. 2.17); these taxes
had remained constant since 1972, therefore the Road Fund could not keep
pace with inflation. Other road user charges go to the Treasury for general
budgetary purposes. As shown below, revenues from fuel were practically
constant during the 1971-75 period, then increased substantially in 1976 and
were practically stagnant since then.

2.15       Government expenditures for roads are financed from the national
budget, the Road Fund and foreign aid. The national budget finances part
of administration costs and occasionally urgent investment work. The Road
Fund finances (i) road maintenance including equipment renewal; (ii) road
studies and investment; (iii) the Public Works Research and Experiment Center;
(iv) urban street improvements; and (v) the debt servicing of loans for roads.
The following table shows road expenditures between 1971-78. Foreign con-
tribution represented about 56% of total road expenditures and 73% of invest-
ment expenditures. A comparison with the table in para. 2.14 indicates that
overall road user charges were on average 20 to 30% above total current road
expenditures during the years 1971-1977.

2.16      During past years road maintenance was limited to about 50% of the
total network as most revenues originating in the sector were allocated to
the treasury, and the Malian contribution to foreign financed road invest-
ment absorbed a large part of revenues earmarked for roads (para. 2.19).
Had a full maintenance program been undertaken, expenditures for road would
have far exceeded the allocated revenues for the 1971-1978 period. Given
the present limited revenue, the Government will not be able to finance both
routine and periodic maintenance of the entire network in the near future.
The Association, therefore, has recommended that the Government concentrate
on routine maintenance, leaving the backlog of periodic maintenance to be
financed from foreign aid. Since the Government has indicated that it
welcomed Bank Group advice in identifying new road user charges or other
sources of revenue for road expenditures, a Bank transport economist visited
Mali in February 1979 for this purpose. His final report sent to the Govern-
ment in April 1979 recommended additional taxes on fuels, imported vehicles,
and vehicle axle-load.
2.17      As a result of this study, the Government increased fuel taxes in
November 1979 by MF 10 per liter or 30% above the previous tax level for
gasoline and 53% for diesel fuel. Present fuel taxes, MF 43 per liter on
gasoline and MF 29 per liter on diesel fuel, represent about 12% of the
selling price (average of gasoline and diesel fuel) while they were about
17% of mid-1979 prices. In addition to the increase in taxes, fuel prices
were raised in June and November 1979, and February and July 1980 because of
increased oil cost. Between June 1979 and July 1980 fuel prices increased
by 93%. Regular gasoline now costs MF 350 per liter (US$0.83 per liter) and
diesel fuel MF 250 per liter (US$0.60 per liter). These price increases
caused a reduction in growth of fuel consumption to an estimated 5% in 1979
from about 8% in previous years. Austerity measures taken by the Government
to limit the use of official vehicles for private purposes is expected to
further reduce fuel consumption.
2.18      The following table shows that the Road Fund would still be
insufficient, at the present level of fuel taxes and despite a foreign
contribution to recurrent cost financing under the project (para 2.22), to
finance both road maintenance and the Government's contribution to the large
investment program planned for the coming years. The inadequacy of Road
Fund revenues would be further aggravated if, contrary to the assumption
made in preparing the table below, road construction contracts were not
exempted from all taxes. The proposed project aims at providing a mechanism
to assure adequate funds for a minimum maintenance program.

- 15 -
2.19      In 1976, as a covenant to the Third Highway Project, the Govern-
ment agreed that it would meet all road maintenance expenses out of the Road
Fund before allocating funds for investment. This condition, however, has
not been fulfilled since contractual obligations to foreign-financed road
projects compelled the Government to use a large part of Road Fund revenues
for road investment. Although Road Fund revenues increased by about 26%
from 1974 to 1977 (para. 2.14), funds allocated to road maintenance and
administration decreased from about 55% of total Road Fund in 1974 to about
35% in 1977. In 1978, expenditures for road maintenance increased about 60%
to MF 1,519 million, most of which appears to be spent for salaries and
settlement of outstanding debts. Although detailed figures for 1979 are not
fully available, it appears that expenditures for road maintenance exceeded
the amounts spent in 1978.
2.20      A major problem of the Road Fund is that almost all its revenue
comes from checks drawn on the Postal Checking System (PCS) managed by the
Postal Service, which is having increasing difficulty remaining liquid.
Since 1975, the Road Fund-s liquid revenues have been more and more used to
finance the Malian contribution to road investments which were financed from
foreign sources. The illiquid part was mostly left for road maintenance but
could not be fully utilized and was a main factor in the reduction of road
maintenance operations. To avoid this problem, the Government promised to
take adequate measures to rehabilitate the PCS using funds from the intended
drawings on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and requested that the
Bank and IMF provide technical assistance to help prepare a plan for such
rehabilitation. The Government, however, delayed taking action on this
matter while discussing with IMF the feasibility and legality of using IMF
funds for such rehabilitation. A joint Bank/IMF mission visited Mali in
August 1980 to initiate discussions on comprehensive macro-economic reforms,
but a solution to the PCS problem is not expected in the near future.
The Road Fund, therefore, will continue to be alimented with illiquid
postal checks, making it unlikely that it can finance timely and effectively
all recurrent costs of routine maintenance.
2.21      To ensure that the local share of recurrent costs for road mainte-
nance will be met before allocating funds for investment, a share of Road
Fund revenues will be allocated each year to routine road maintenance, based
on requirements for minimum maintenance operations. The amounts to devote to
routine road maintenance are indicated in para. 3.33.
2.22      Recognizing that a large part of the Road Fund's resources will
remain illiquid until resolution of the PCS problem, and that further delay
will cause serious network deterioration through lack of routine and periodic
maintenance, the proposed project will provide funds to help the Government
meet most of the foreign exchange component of recurrent costs of routine
maintenance for a limited period and on a decreasing basis (paras 3.04 and
3.31).

H. Engineering and Construction
2.23       NDPW's Technical Studies and Works Division is responsible for
engineering and supervision of road construction and carries out small
engineering studies and supervises minor projects. TSWD uses foreign consult-
ants, frequently assisted by its own engineers, for major engineering studies
and supervision of works. Since TSWD engineers have gained experience, EDF
is having TSWD supervise construction of the Sikasso-Koutiala road (135 km) to
paved standards with only a small advisory staff from a foreign consultant.
TSWD is helped in its engineering activity by the Surveying Institute for
topographical surveys, and the Public Works Research and Experimentation
Center for laboratory tests. PWREC is well-equipped and can perform all
regular soil and construction material tests required for road design and
construction. The Societe d'Etudes du Mali (SEMA), a state-owned consulting
firm, has also carried out road feasibility studies and detailed engineering,
often jointly with foreign consultants.
2.24      Foreign contractors, one of whom has a long-established Malian
branch, have constructed all major roads. NDPW's New Works Service has
acquired skill in feeder road constrution and improvement under IDA projects.
The army also executes some road works. There are no major domestic road
contractors in Mali, but some are able to undertake minor works such as
surface dressing. Several private Malian contractors build small buildings;
major building contracts are executed by the state-owned SONETRA and foreign
contractors. Given the Government s inclination to execute minor road works
and road maintenance by force account, the lack of continuous programs and
the limited scope of major road works, there is little short-term prospect
that domestic contractors would be able to expand to the civil works field.
I. Maintenance
2.25       NDPW, through its eight regional directorates and 18 subdivisions,
is responsible for maintaining about 11,600 km of roads including the total
classified network with the exception of local roads classified as tracks
(table, para 2.01). Routine and periodic maintenance is carried out entirely
by force account. Because of the lack of materials and equipment, NDPW has
been able to execute only scattered and ad hoc maintenance on the most
important roads (5,000-6,000 km). The subdivisions lease road maintenance
equipment from the Public Works Equipment Service which carries out major
equipment repair at its central workshop in Bamako; routine maintenance
and minor repairs are made in subdivision workshops. Equipment lease charges
have been updated recently to cover 1979 costs. The personnel was trained and
the workshops were constructed or improved and equipped under the First and
Second Highway Projects; the staff now needs substantial additional training,
and the central workshop needs minor building improvement.



- 17 -
2.26       At the end of the First and Second Highway Projects (paras 2.31-
2.32) during which road maintenance was strengthened, technical assistance
was phased out on the assumption that a smooth road maintenance program was
in place. The Third Highway Project, therefore, was directed to periodic
maintenance of paved roads (para. 2.33) but, because of poor management and a
lack of funds, the equipment was immobilized and materials were unavailable
causing road maintenance to deteriorate and the personnel skills previously
acquired to erode. The proposed project will address these issues. Addi-
tional training will improve personnel performance while funds for road
maintenance will be provided through adequate allocations under the Road
Fund (para. 3.33) and an external contribution to recurrent costs (para 3.31).
2.27       A major problem was also PWES- poor performance which was identi-
fied several years ago, but remained unresolved for political reasons. A
1978 study financed under the Third Highway Project cited poor management,
lack of funds and inadequately trained personnel as major factors contributing
to PWES unsatisfactory output. It concluded that technical assistance was
needed to retrain PWES management and personnel and to help eliminate the
substantial backlog of equipment repair. These operations will require at
least three years because, out of 625 pieces of equipment existing at the time
of appraisal, only 288 were in working condition (although 232 still needed
minor repair), 125 required major repair and 212 could only be scrapped. A
new PWES director, with a satisfactory management background in other NDPW
services, was appointed in February 1979, and, after a period under his
management, PWES has shown some improvement.
2.28       The proposed project will help PWES  management to overcome re-
maining shortcomings by (a) ensuring funds for equipment renewal and
maintenance, (b) providing technical assistance and spare parts to eliminate
the backlog of equipment repair, and (c) training staff. To give an early
start to improving PWES efficiency, the composition of the Third Highway
Project has been changed to provide early technical assistance (about 50
man-months) and the purchase of spare parts for equipment repair (about
US$0.7 million) needed until the proposed project is effective.
J. Technology Choices
2.29       An optimal balance in the use of labor and equipment for the
proposed project has been thoroughly studied in light of Mali's geographical
and economic situation, and the availability of labor. Manual labor will be
used when available for light maintenance operations ("cantonnage"), such as
filling pot-holes, cutting grass, clearing ditches and culverts and loading
small trucks whose capacity has been chosen for this purpose (para 3.08). A
mix of labor and equipment will be used for patching, spot and emergency
repair and regravelling of shoulders. Maintenance operations which cannot be
carried out by hand, such as grading, compacting and brush dragging, will
continue to be carried out with equipment. The use of manual labor under the
project, for which appropriate hand tools and simple equipment are provided,
will better utilize NDPW's unskilled staff.

K. Past Bank Group Assistance
2.30      Bank-Group involvement in Mali's road subsector started in 1967-68
when it acted as executing agency for a countrywide transport survey financed
by the United Nations Development Programme. The survey concluded that,
with the exception of a few trunk roads, the main road system could serve the
transport needs of the country without heavy investment, but highway mainte-
nance needed to be improved and agricultural feeder roads constructed. Three
highway projects have been aimed at these objectives.
2.31      The First Highway Project (Credit 187-MLI, US$7.7 million, June
1970) included the purchase of road maintenance equipment, spare parts for
equipment overhaul, construction and expansion of workshops, betterment
of feeder roads and pre-investment studies for the Bamako-Faladie-Bougouni
(160 km) and Faladie-Segou (222 km) roads.  The project also included tech-
nical assistance to NDPW. This project was completed in March 1976. A
Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) issued in February 1978 concluded
that institution building objectives were mostly achieved as NDPW was par-
tially reorganized and the Road Fund was reactivated. Road maintenance,
however, could not be fully implemented because of a shortage of local funds,
due to the drought and inflation. The PPAR also pointed out that a low 3%
economic rate of return for the betterment of feeder roads was mainly due
to higher-than-estimated construction cost and reduced construction output
(470 km instead of 1450 km).
2.32      The Second Highway Project (Credit 383-MLI, US$17.8 million as
amended in June 1975 to cover the Association's share of increased road
construction cost) included rehabilitation of the Bamako-Bougouni and Faladie-
Segou roads, procurement of additional road maintenance equipment, extended
technical assistance to NDPW, preinvestment studies for the Bamako-Kolokani
road, and a trucking industry study. Construction of the main facilities for
a training center (CPTP) was added to the project in 1975. The Bamako-Bougouni
road was not reconstructed because bids were much higher than the available
USAID co-financing. At the Government's request, USAID reduced its loan to
US$3.25 million to finance the procurement of road maintenance equipment and
spare parts. All other project items have been satisfactorily completed.
2.33      The ongoing Third Highway Project (Credit 599-MLI, US$10.0 million,
January 1976) consists of improvement of about 1,000 km of feeder roads,
periodic maintenance on about 950 km of paved roads, purchase of spare parts,
equipment for workshops in two new subdivisions, office and teaching equipment
for the training center, and the study of a country-wide transport plan. The
project was amended in 1977 to include a new detailed engineering for the
Bamako-Bougouni road which had further deteriorated since the 1972 engineering
study, and a study on how to make PWES more efficient. It has been further
modified in 1979 to provide technical assistance to PWES and additional spare
parts, and training to CPTP's Malian instructors and monitors. Construction
of feeder roads, being carried out at a lower cost than estimated at appraisal,



- 19 -
is expected to yield a satisfactory rate of return. Because of late delivery
of equipment for the force account brigade for bituminous roads and the
increased road deterioration, only about 200 km of paved roads will receive
periodic maintenance under the project. The remaining works will be continued
under the proposed project.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
3.01      Over the past ten years, improving road maintenance has been one
of the Association's goals in the road subsector. Under the First and
Second Highway Projects the road maintenance organization was strengthened,
but physical targets of road maintenance were only partly achieved due to
the chronic lack of local funds worsened by inflation and, during the last
five years, by the illiquidity of the Road Fund (para. 2.20). Originally,
the proposed project was conceived as a four-ycar step in a long-term
program to strengthen NDPW enabling it to carry out adequate and proper
routine road maintenance, and to eliminate the periodic maintenance backlog
on bituminous and gravel roads. A major feature of the project was the
creation of a reliable means for financing recurrent costs of road mainte-
nance. Achievement of this goal, however, was mainly dependent on the
reform of PCS.
3.02      The present project was created by scaling down to an acceptable
minimum the larger maintenance project when it became apparent that PCS
reform was not immediately forthcoming. The decision to proceed and to
provide special assistance by financing a share of recurrent costs was made
because the already poor condition of the network was further deteriorating
and some roads would have required complete rehabilitation if no action was
taken shortly. In addition, the road maintenance equipment, mostly financed
under previous IDA projects and whose replacement value was about US$20
million in 1978, would deteriorate to a non-repairable condition if the
overhaul program started under the Third Highway Project was not completed.
3.03      The proposed project, which will last two and a half years (the
minimum period which can yield tangible results), is conceived as an interim
project aimed at ensuring that the results obtained by the institution-
building efforts made under previous highway projects are not wasted. During
this period, the Government will have sufficient time, in consultation with
the Association and IMF, to implement a plan for the rehabilitation of PCS.
3.04      A main objective of the proposed project is to ensure that road main-
tenance is carried out by securing, through a contribution to financing recur-
rent costs, liquid funds for imported goods such as spare parts, the lack of
which was a major cause of insufficient road maintenance. However, given the



- 20 -
Government's budgetary constraints, the routine road maintenance program is
reduced to the minimum admissible to ensure the serviceability of the road
network.
3.05      Periodic maintenance is essential to ensure a normal life span for
paved roads and to allow all-weather use of unpaved roads. An important
part of the proposed project is therefore devoted to reducing a considerable
backlog of periodic maintenance after which routine maintenance can be
carried out effectively. This covers critical portions of the paved network
and some important unpaved secondary roads.
B. Project Description
3.06      To attain its objectives the proposed project includes:
(a)  a two and a half year (July 1981-December 1983) program of
routine maintenance covering about 6,600 km of national,
regional and feeder roads, including strengthening PWES and CPTP
to consolidate efforts initiated under previous highway projects;
(b)  periodic maintenance on about 680 km of paved roads and 220 km
of gravel roads by force account and contractor;
(c)  a program of vehicle axle-load control; and
(d)  assistance to ONT in setting up a transport data collection unit.
3.07      To implement the project, IDA and Switzerland will assist in
financing the following items:
(a)  road maintenance and workshop equipment, spare parts, and minor
improvements to PWES central workshop;
(b)  expansion of CPTP's facilities, purchase of training equipment,
and travel expenditures for instructors;
(c)  operating costs for periodic maintenance by force account;
(d)  periodic maintenance by contractor;
(e)  recurrent costs of routine maintenance;
(f)  fellowships for PWES and road maintenance personnel;
(g)  mobile weighing scales; and
(h)  consulting services for: (i) technical assistance to PWES and ONT;
(ii) auditing expenditures under (c), (e), and the Road Fund
expenditures for road maintenance; and (iii) updating the engineer-
ing and economic studies of the Bamako-Bougouni road (160 km).



- 21 -
C. Routine Maintenance Program
3.08      The routine maintenance program will cover about 6,600 km of
roads; all paved, unpaved, feeder roads and improved tracks are included in
the program, but only 7% of seasonal tracks. To limit the recurrent expendi-
tures, routine maintenance operations have been set at minimum standards
compatible with the type of road and level of traffic. Spot regravelling
and emergency repairs will be carried out where required to ensure road
serviceability. Maintenance operations, such as grading, compacting, and
anti-corrugation brushing, will mainly use mechanical equipment; spot
maintenance, pot-holes filling, emergency repairs and shoulder and struc-
ture clearing, will be by manual labor. The proposed project will provide
hand tools and small 2-3 m3 trucks which can be handloaded without a long
standing time. During negotiations the Government should agree on the
network to be maintained and the strategy for routine road maintenance shown
in the following table.

D. Strengthening PWES
3.09      Technical assistance to PWES has started in March 1980 under the
Third Highway Project (para. 2.27) and will continue in this project to assist
and train the new manager and help specialized personnel eliminate the backlog
of equipment repair while retraining the staff. Additional project inputs
will be (i) the purchase of spare parts to complete the overhaul of existing
road maintenance equipment, (ii) the procurement of complementary workshop
equipment and tools, (iii) minor improvements to PWES' central workshop, and
(iv) fellowships for PWES personnel. The Government agreed at negotiations to
send to the Association for approval (a) the detailed list of workshop equip-
ment and tools and a description of the proposed improvement to the central
workshop before preparing bidding documents, and (b) the name, background, and
details of proposed fellowship for each candidate before sending its employee
abroad.
3.10      Most road maintenance equipment purchased under the First and Second
Highway Projects is usable but needs extensive repairs. Some equipment is at
the end of its life or beyond economic repair and should be replaced. The pro-
posed project provides for the purchase of additional equipment (Table 2),
required for maintenance operations. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with the Government on this list.
E. Training
3.11      NDPW has enough personnel to carry out road maintenance.  Most
employees need additional training or updating in basic skills (para. 2.12)
for which only rather short retraining cycles are required. Assuming a
turnover and drop-out rate of about 20%, it is estimated that about 800
employees need to be trained or retrained by Malian instructors. It is
expected that about 600 of these employees will be trained under the proposed
project.
3.12      The training program already started in 1980, though on a reduced
scale, will be carried out between 1981-83 at CPTP in Bamako, the subdivisions
and PWES. Courses will last from three months for unit and sector chiefs to
two weeks for accountants. Theoretical courses will be held at CPTP in Bamako
for chiefs of subdivisions and workshops, chief mechanics, etc. Courses for
skilled personel at lower levels, i.e. operators, mechanics, time-keepers,
etc., will be carried out in each subdivision using the subdivisions own
equipment so that on-the-job training can be done while solving day-to-day
problems. This approach avoids a relatively large investment in training
equipment and keeps several hundred persons at their regular working place.
Mechanics and other specialized personnel of the central workshop will be
trained on the job at PWES.
3.13      Five Malian instructors and six monitors will carry out the training
program at CPTP and in the field. In December 1979 they were all assigned to
CPTP. Since they will need training before undertaking their tasks, the
Government requested, and the Association approved, an extension of technical
assistance to CPTP under the Third Highway Project for this purpose (para. 2.33).



- 23 -
3.14      The Government has prepared the following documents:  (i) a
preliminary training program for road maintenance personnel; (ii) the
categories and number of staff to be trained during 1981-83; (iii) a
proposal for the training program at CPTP and in the subdivisions; and (iv)
a provisional list of personnel proposed for fellowship.
3.15      To implement the training program, and then to continue as a
permanent training center, CPTP will need more space and additional equip-
ment. The proposed project includes construction of living quarters for
trainees and the expansion of technical facilities, procurement of furni-
ture, workshop and field equipment, and vehicles for itinerant training
staff (Table 3). The Government agreed at negotiations to send to the
Association for its approval, before their construction or purchase, a
description of the proposed facilities, a list of furniture, workshop and
field equipment, and vehicles. The proposed project will also provide
travel expenditures for Malian instructors and monitors--displacement
allowance and vehicle operating costs. This allowance will help the
training at the subdivisions since a major drawback in the past was the lack
of incentive for leaving the place of regular employment. In addition, the
project includes fellowships abroad for key personnel of road maintenance to
complete their training. The Government agreed at negotiations that it will
send to the Associations for approval, the name, background and details of
proposed fellowship for each candidate before sending its personnel abroad.
F. Periodic Maintenance
3.16      The program of periodic maintenance will (i) restore road surfaces
to make routine maintenance effective, thus reducing vehicle operating costs,
and (ii) postpone pavement failure on paved roads. The works will be carried
out by existing force account brigades and contractors to allow completion of
the program within the project period.
3.17      Under the ongoing Third Highway Project about 200 km of bituminous
roads are receiving periodic maintenance. The proposed project includes an
additional 680 km which badly need periodic maintenance. These roads were
defined at negotiations out of about 1,150 km which still need maintenance
to eliminate the accumulated backlog (Table 4). In addition to about 30,000
m2 of simple patching, RSS-s bituminous road brigade is expected to
perform the following work: about 95 km of seal coat, 115 km of single
surface treatment, and 5 km of double surface treatment. The remaining
work--about 62,000 m2 of patching, 180 km of seal coat, 75 km of single-
and 5 km of double surface treatment--will be executed by contractor.
Regravelling of shoulders, estimated at about 80,000 m3 of gravel in
place, will be carried out by the bituminous brigade with some assistance
from the subdivisions.
3.18      Only a small amount of equipment will be procured for the bitumi-
nous road brigade under the proposed project (Table 2). It has been esti-
mated that the brigade will be able to execute 400 m2 per day of patching
over 180 days per year, 3,000 m2 per day of seal coat and 1,300 m2 per
day of single-surface or 800 m2 per day of double-surface treatment over



- 24 -
160 days per year. Since it is critical that the deferred periodic mante-
nance work be carried out in the planned two-and-a-half year period to
prevent further deterioration, the Government agreed at negotiations that:
(i) the output of the bituminous brigade will be reviewed with the associa-
tion every six months starting January 1982, and (ii) should the assessed
output be less than the above estimates, the amount of work to be carr: .ie
out by contractors will be increased accordingly, in agreement with the
Association.
3.19      Three roads of the unpaved secondary network, linking some o:C!- the
feeder roads constructed under previous projects to the main bituminou.s
network, are in poor condition. Lateritic base course is nonexistent and
the subbase has been weathered to such an extent that some short sections
need reconstruction. Under the proposed project, two NWS's brigades used
for constructing feeder roads under the First and Third Highway Projects
will be consolidated in one regravelling brigade.  Their present equip,-ent
will be sufficient, after some repair, to rehabilitate 60-70 km of road per
year. Only a few pieces of equipment, such as compressors or towed fuel
tankers, will have to be purchased under the project (Table 2). About 130
km will be regravelled by the NWS- brigade and 90 km by contractor. At
negotiations, the Government agreed on design standards for these road3 as
shown on Table 5.
3.20      The Government has submitted to the Association draft bidding
documents for works to be carried out by contractor, and has indicated that
it intends to call bids for all periodic maintenance works during the first
year of the project! Works, however, will be carried out during about two
years of the project. The Government agreed at negotiations to send to the
Association for comments a detailed annual work program of periodic road
maintenance not later than October 31 of each year.
C. Transport Data Collection Unit
3.21     KTPW lacks the capacity to adequately collect, process and Ena.lyze
transport data. The Government has shown interest in setting up a smE.lI
unit in ONT to continue regularly the statistical and work initiated under
the Transport Plan Study and to prepare an annual report.  A few qualified
Malian technicians will be sufficient to carry out these tasks with tbe
assistance of other Government agencies. The Government requested, &.ring
negotiations, a limited technical assistance to help in setting up th-s unit.
H. Vehicle Axle-Load Control
3.22      The Government is not in a position to control the load of trucks
because it lacks the necessary equipment. Four portable weighing scales
will be provided under the proposed project to start random axle-loacd
control on a regular basis.  Control of heavy traffic will help safeg>ard
the road network from early failure due to vehicle overloading.  NDPw wi1l
be responsible for programming control operatipn and staffing weighin,g



- 25 -
scales. Trained personnel already exists in NDPW because they took part in
a vehicle control campaign under a program of paved road auscultation
carried out by a consultant a few years ago under Government financing.
I. Technical Assistance
3.23      The proposed project will provide a total of 100 man-months of
technical assistance and consulting services -- 80 man-months for PWES, and
20 man-months for a transport data collection unit. In addition, the
proposed project includes consulting services for auditing maintenance
expenditures of the Road Fund, the operating costs of force account brigades
for periodic maintenance, and for updating the existing preinvestment studies
for the Bamako-Bougouni road, and a decreasing contribution to the expendi-
tures for recurrent costs of routine maintenance.
3.24      Six experts (one mechanical engineer and five senior mechanics
with different specialties) will be provided to PWES under the project to
continue technical assistance started under the Third Highway Project (para.
2.27). Since there is much equipment to be overhauled and long delays in
delivering spare parts which may require extended technical assistance,
large physical contingencies on technical assistance to PWES have been
provided. The Government, therefore, agreed at negotiations to reassess, by
January 31, 1982, additional technical assistance requirements for PWES in
consultation with the Association. Terms of Reference for this technical
assistance were agreed upon under the Third Highway Project (Annex II).
3.25      Broad objectives of technical assistance for ONT-s transport data
collection unit, which will serve as basis for detailed Terms of Reference,
were discussed during negotiations. It was agreed that a total of 20
man-months will be sufficient.
3.26      An Accounting Service (AO) performs accounting for NDPW under
supervision of an Administrative and Financial Unit which controls expendi-
tures of the whole MTPW.  This organization is adequate but its personnel
needs some training in modern accounting procedures to improve their perfor-
mance. Terms of Reference for the independent auditors to be engaged to
audit Government expenditures will stipulate that they cooperate with AO's
personnel and indicate areas where improvement is required and how to effect
improvement (Annex III).
J. Project Cost
3.27      Outlays required to finance the two and a half year project
(July 1981-December 1983) amount to about US$39.5 million net of taxes, of
which US$20.8 million is capital cost and US$18.7 million represents re-
current costs of routine maintenance. The foreign exchange component is
US$16.8 million for capital costs (81%) and US$9.4 million for recurrent
costs (50%). Unwaived taxes and duties are estimated at US$3.8 million
equivalent. Project costs are detailed in Table 6 and summarized below.

- 27-
3.28      Cost estimates of road and workshop equipment which include 10%
for spare parts are based on local dealers' quotations. The cost of building
and workshop construction is based on the current cost per unit of similar
works. Operating costs of force account brigades are based on the analysis
of costs recorded in MTPW and an estimate of reasonable output. The cost of
periodic maintenance of paved roads by contractor is based on the mission
best estimate as no recent bids for similar works are available. Recurrent
costs of routine maintenance are based on costs of individual maintenance
activities shown on Table 7, and on maintenance strategy indicated in para.
3.08.
3.29      The cost of technical assistance and consulting services furnished
by consulting firms is based on similar services rendered in Mali. The
total cost amounts to US$1.0 million and the average cost per man-month
adjusted for price variation to end-1979, is estimated at about US$6,700
including salary, social security, bonuses, annual leave, expatriation
allowance, overhead and the firm-s profit. Reimbursable expenses, including
air trips, airfreight, subsistence allowance, field supervision and purchase
and operation of vehicles, total about US$3,300 per month.
3.30      Physical contingencies have been taken into account as follows:
5% on road maintenance equipment to allow for small changes in equipment
composition, and on recurrent costs of routine maintenance; 10% on spare
parts for overhaul of existing equipment; 10% on force account operating
costs and periodic maintenance by contractor and 25% on technical assis-
tance to PWES (para. 3.24). Price contingencies amounting to about 24% of
total base cost including physical contingencies have been calculated taking
into account expected average inflation in Mali and internationally as
follows:
Year      All Items
1980        12.5%
1981         9  %
1982         8.5%
1983         7.5%
K. Project Financing
3.31      IDA and Switzerland will finance US$17.0 million and US$10.0
million respectively, jointly covering 100% of project capital costs and 33%
of recurrent costs net of taxes or about 66% of the foreign component of
recurrent cost. The Government is expected to finance all taxes and 67% of
net recurrent costs for routine maintenance. Financing of eligible items
will be made in the same proportion as total financing, i.e. 63% by IDA and
37% by Switzerland. IDA and Switzerland will finance their share of recurrent
costs on a decreasing basis, namely, 40% of total expenditures for recurrent
costs made before January 1, 1982, 30% in 1982, and 25% thereafter. These
percentages represent about 100%, 75%, and 60%, respectively, of the foreign



- 28 -
exchange component of routine maintenance costs except fuel, which the Govern-
ment con still purchgse from locally established oil companies using postal
checks. Total recurrent coqt fiaancing by the Association amounts to US$3.9
million.
3.32      Experience under previous projects has shown that often the Road
Fund has no cash to meet payment schedules. Delayed payments cause distrust
among suppliers and slow down project iqiplementation. The proposed project
therefore will use a revolving fund similar to that set up under the Third
Highway Project. Immediately after Credit effectiveness the Association and
Switzerland will make an advance disbursement of US$800,000 into a Special
Account to be opened by the Government at the Banque de Developpement du
Mali (BDM). This account will serve to finance project items and will be
replenished by IDA and Switzerland upon receipt of Government withdrawal
requests. The Governmelt cannot request replenishment for items not eligible
for financing from Credit funds, which the Government would have to finance
with its own money. The Government agreed at negotiations on the use of the
Special Account. Opening of the Special Account by the Government will be a
condition for Credit effectiveness.
L. Recurrent Costs
3.33      Based on an estimated availability of repaired and new road mainte-
nance equipment, the maintenance strategy shown in para 3.08, and unit costs
of individual maintenance operations indicated on Table 7, the following
amounts will have to be budgeted for routine and periodic road maintenance:

During negotiations the Government agreed to (i) provide the above minimum
allocations for the road maintenance program duly adjusted for inflation
according to a road maintenance index agreed upon at negotiations, (ii) send
to the Association for review and comments, not later than October 31 of
each year, the proposed road maintenance budget for the following fiscal
year, and (iii) exchange views with the Association each year on the road
investment program to determine implications for the overall Road Fund
budget. To ensure that amounts for road maintenance are adequately and
regularly allocated and reach the total budgeted amount at the end of each
fiscal year, the Government also agreed at negotiations that expenditures
for road maintenance from the Road Fund will be reviewed by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association. Outline Terms of Reference for
these services are in Annex III. The auditors will submit to the Government
a mid-year report on their findings within two months after the end of each
mid-year inspection, and an annual audit report within three months after
the end of the fiscal year. The Government will then promptly send to the
Association the auditors' reports with its comments.

M. Execution
3.34      MTPW will be responsible through its technical services and field
subdivisions for all project elements. All bidding documents for goods and
civil works will be prepared by the Government. The project is expected to
start in July 1981 and be completed by end-1983 according to an implementa-
tion schedule shown in Chart B. Three project items -- repair of available
road equipment, periodic maintenance of paved roads and the training program
--have already started under the Third Highway Project and will continue
without interruption.
3.35      Implementation of the routine road maintenance program will
increase with availability of equipment. Because of the delay in starting
the technical assistance to PWES, the existing equipment is expected to be
totally repaired by end of 1982, and full-scale routine road maintenance
will be able to start only in 1983. It is estimated that about 70% of the
full-scale annual program will be carried out in 1981 and about 85% in 1982.
By mid-1983, all road equipment would be operational and about 70% of
personnel would have been trained; therefore the routine road maintenance
program should be carried out in full. To be able to undertake possible
remedial actions to improve road maintenance, NDPW will closely monitor the
subdivisions output through the reports that it receives quarterly from
RDPWs. The Association will be informed of road maintenance execution
through Government. progress reports (para. 3.37).
3.36      Execution of most periodic maintenance of gravel roads will be
carried out by force account personnel with proven capacity to Construct
feeder roads. These works will probably start a few months later than other
elements because the feeder road brigades will have to be reorganized into a
regravelling brigade. Regravelling of about 130 km of roads will be done by
force account, and 90 km by contractor.
3.37      For the purpose of project monitoring, the Government agreed
at negotiations to create by May 30, 1981 a small unit within NDPW, which
will liaise with the Association, through NDPW's Director General, on
matters relating to project implementation. The unit will submit quarterly
reports to the Association in a format to be agreed upon between the Govern-
ment and the Association, clearly indicating the progress of the project,
the problems encountered and the solutions adopted, the expenditures, etc.
It will also prepare a project completion report.
N. Procurement
3.38      Road maintenance equipment, workshop equipment and tools, furniture,
teaching materials and vehicles for CPTP, amounting to about US$5.2 million,
net of taxes but including contingencies, will be procured following interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Spare



- 31 -
parts to repair existing equipment totaling US$2.5 million 1/, construction
and improvement of building and workshops, and periodic maintenance by
contractor, amounting to about US$6.0 million, net of taxes, but including
contingencies, whicn would not attract competition of foreign contracting
firms because of their limited size and scattered nature, may be procured
following local competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures
acceptable to the Association. Items or groups of similar items expected to
cost less than US$50,000, but not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$1.0
million, and fuel, bitumen, cement and other construction materials needed
for periodic maintenance by force account, will be procured on the basis of
the Government's procurement practices, acceptable to the Association.
Technical assistance for PWES, ONT's transport data collection unit, and
services for auditing of expenditures and updating preinvestment studies
will be provided by consultants under conditions and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Association.
0. Disbursements
3.39      Disbursements from the Credit account will be made as follows:
(a) 63% of the total cost, net of taxes, of equipment, tools, furni-
ture and spare parts (US$3.65 million); consultant services
(US$800,000); and fellowships (US$130,000);
(b) 57% of the total operating costs, excluding equipment deprecia-
tion, of force account brigades for periodic maintenance of paved
and unpaved roads (US$2.30 million);
(c) 53% of the total cost of periodic maintenance of paved roads
by contractor (US$2.40 million); and of building and workshop
construction and improvement (US$170,000);
(d) 60% of the total displacement allowance and vehicle operating
costs for CPTP instructors (US$50,000); and
(e) the following percentages of total recurrent costs of routine
road maintenance: (i) 25% of expenditures made before 1982;
(ii) 19% of expenditures made in 1982; and (iii) 15% of expendi-
tures made after 1982 (US$3.90 million including contingencies).
In addition, US$500,000 will be deposited in the project Special Account and
US$3.1 million will remain unallocated. Withdrawal requests for disburse-
ments from the Credit account will be fully documented except those for
1/   To allow an efficient overhaul, these spare parts must be procured in
separated, limited lots following subsequent assessments of needs,
and must be delivered as soon as possible. About US$1.0 million of
proprietary spare parts which could be procured directly from original
manufacturers, is included.



- 32 -
operating costs of force account brigades for periodic and routine mainte-
nance which will be made against certificates of expenditures. Withdrawal
requests for routine maintenance will be based on unit costs of routine road
maintenance operations shown on Table 7, duly adjusted for inflation according
to the road maintenance index defined in para. 3.33; they will be accompanied
by a statement signed by NDPW's Director General showing the referenced
period, the roads maintained, their length and average traffic, and the mainte-
nance operations carried out on each road.  Details regarding such statement
were discussed and agreed upon at negotiations. The documentation supporting
the certificates of expenditures for periodic maintenance and the statements
on routine maintenance will be retained by NDPW and made available for
inspection by the Association's supervision missions. During audit inspec-
tions (para 3.41), unit cost of individual routine maintenance operations
will be checked for cost efficiency and reserved as and when needed.
3.40      Amounts disbursed by IDA and Switzerland with respect to recurrent
costs of routine maintenance will be deposited in the Special Account (para
3.32). Proceeds from these disbursements will be used by the Government
exclusively to purchase imported goods for routine maintenance, such as
spare parts and consumable items for equipment maintenance, construction
materials, etc., excluding petroleum products purchased locally. Since
routine maintenance costs include equipment depreciation, the Government
will be able to use the special account to finance, with the Association
agreement, the replacement of worn out equipment for routine maintenance.
These goods will be procured following the directives indicated in para.
3.38.
3.41      At negotiations, the Government agreed to:  (i) keep operating
costs of force account brigades for periodic maintenance under separate
accounts, and (ii) have these accounts and the Special Account (para 3.32)
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association. Specifically,
the auditors will submit to the Association a mid-year report on disbursement
applications made against certificates of expenditures, and the propriety
of expenditures from the Special Account, within two months after the end of
each mid-year inspection, and annual audited accounts within three months
after the close of the fiscal year. Terms of Reference for these services
were discussed at negotiations on the basis of the outline shown in Annex
III. An estimated schedule of disbursements from the Credit account is
given below.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The major benefit to be obtained from the proposed project is the
improvement of NDPW's capability in carrying out periodic road maintenance,
the strengthening of PWES through retraining of its managerial and technical
personnel, and the completion of CPTP facilities to enable regular training for
public works personnel.  The project will also supply technical assistance to
help ONT set up a permanent transport data collection unit and will ensure
that sufficient funds will be available to perform at least minimum road
maintenance.



- 34 -
4.02      Better maintenance of the road network will produce tangible and
intangible economic and social benefits to all parts of Mali and all segments
of the population. The substantially reduced transport costs which will
result from the reduction of the huge backlog in maintenance will slow
tariff increases and thus benefit producers and consumers alike. By prolong-
ing the life span of- the road network, improved maintenance will postpone
costly investments in road reconstruction or strengthening.
4.03      The most important non-quantified benefits will be shortened
travel time and more comfortable rides for those who travel in bush-taxis,
mini-buses and trucks, and less spoilage and wider distribution of their
products, thus improving the returns to the producer and lowering the average
price. Also, making easier the use of particularly difficult road sections
will expand the areas where truckers-traders can operate benefiting the
poorest, who are now cut off from the benefits of modern transport.
4.04      As road user charges are mainly paid by those who own vehicles
and at the margin are used to maintain and improve roads that also benefit the
poor, increased road user charges will result in a form of redistribution of
income from the relatively wealthy to the poor. This, when done in moderation
so as to avoid significant negative incentives for the vehicle owners, may
have an overall beneficial effect on the country.
4.05      The proposed project will also initiate a program of axle-load
control by providing NDPW with weighing scales to prevent the common practice
of overTbading trucks, which is detrimental to roads. Postponement of need
for road strengthening will free scarce foreign financing for more directly
productive investments in other sectors.
4.06      The creation of a transport data collection unit in ONT should help
establish a statistical basis for sound decision-making and healthy balance
between transport investments and maintenance of existing transport infrastruc-
ture.
4.07      The update of engineering and economic studies for the Bamako-Bou-
gouni road will allow reconstruction of this major trunk road as soon as fi-
nancing is secured. Reconstruction of this road, which was dropped from the
Second Highway Project for lack of co-financing, will benefit not only the
Bamako-Bougouni region, which is one of the most populated in he country, but
also the import-export traffic with the ocean port of Abidjan.
B. Economic Analysis
4.08      The economic justification of the project is based on an assessment
of economic costs and benefits with and without the project. The benefit/cost
ratio for the whole maintenance program is 1.88 with a 12% discount rate. The
economic rate of return (ERR) is 50%; even with cost increases of 48% or
benefit decreases of 46% the rate of return remains above 12%.



- 35 -
4.09      Vehicle operating costs (VOC) shown in Table 8 were derived by
using road deterioration parameters (roughness, rut depth and depth of loose
materials) and user cost relationships developed under the Bank and Transport
and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL, Great Britain) research programs in
Kenya.
4.10      Traffic data were estimated based on nearly complete 1976 and
partial 1978 data. Traffic growth trends of 6% per year were used for paved
roads. Traffic on unpaved roads was estimated to grow at a rate of 5% per
annum. Given the high rates of return obtained extra calculations for lower
growth trends were not considered necessary.
4.11      Costs and benefits (Table 9) were calculated in MF net of taxes at
end of 1979 prices. 1/ Costs include incremental recurrent costs for routine
and periodic road maintenance and capital costs (purchase of new equipment
and spare parts, improvement of workshops and technical assistance for the
maintenance program). The only benefits taken into consideration were VOC
savings. No allowance was made for time savings, delayed reconstruction or any
other benefit.
The Road Maintenance Program
4.12      The maintenance program consists of a routine and a periodic main-
tenance element on both paved and unpaved roads. Routine maintenance is
difficult to separate from periodic maintenance. In fact, the Bank-s Highway
Design and Maintenance Standard Model (HDM), whose principles have been used
as a guide for the economic calculations, does not distinguish between benefits
from routine and periodic maintenance.
4.13      The major operation to achieve improved routine maintenance and
the reduction of backlog periodic maintenance is the overhaul of a large
amount of road maintenance equipment that is out of order. To achieve this,
spare parts and technical assistance will be financed under the project and
the PWES central workshop improved. The cost of technical assistance to PWES
was apportioned 30% for paved road maintenance and 70% for unpaved roads, and
the cost of workshop improvement 25% and 75% respectively.   Only the incre-
ment of the operating costs for the periodic and routine maintenance brigades
between the with and without project situation, and payments to contractors
for periodic maintenance, were taken in account. The without project situa-
tion assumes that the Government's outlays for road maintenance will remain
constant. The benefits, or VOC savings, are calculated as the difference
between VOC on the rapidly deteriorating network under current maintenance and
those on the projected, better-maintained network.
4.14      Average daily traffic on the project roads, shown below, was esti-
mated on the basis of traffic growth trends indicated in para. 4.10. Traffic
on the 1,668 km of paved roads was divided in three classes; the average is
1/   Benefits were actually calculated using VOC at end-1978 prices, and
adjusted at end-1979.

151 vehicles per day (vpd). Trucks, including semi-trailers, account for
between 25 and 32% of traffic depending on traffic density. Traffic on the
unpaved roads in the program averages between 60 vpd on major roads and less
than 10 vpd on seasonal tracks.

4.15     The maintenance strategy (para. 3.08) was determined on the basis
of experience gained in other West African countries where HDM was used, by
calculating the incremental VOC savings associated with patching and resur-
facing for paved roads and more frequent grading operations for unpaved
roads. The economic return for the routine and periodic maintenance program
together was calculated by relating the incremental equipment and operating
costs to the corresponding incremental benefits from improved roads during
the average economic life of the equipment (estimated at 7 years). The
analysis of periodic maintenance of selected unpaved roads included in the
program was performed separately from routine maintenance to check on the
feasibility of this operation for each road (para. 4.17).
4.16      The cost and benefit streams are shown in Table 10.  To allow for
a gradual increase in force account performance, availability of overhauled
equipment and trained personnel, only 80% and 90% of total benefits were
taken into account for the first and second year of the project for paved
roads, and 40% and 80% respectively for unpaved roads. The benefit/cost ratio



- 37 -
for the paved road element is 1.84 at 12% discount rate. 1/ The economic rate
of return is 49% and remains above 12% even with a cost increase of 53% or a
benefit decrease of 45%. For unpaved roads, the benefit/cost ratio is 1.92 at
12% discount rate and the rate of return 72%. An increase of 45% in costs
or a decrease of 48% in benefits still yield a rate of return above 12%.
4.17      The feasibility check for rehabilitation of the unpaved roads was
based on the following assumptions: 6% annual growth in traffic over the
lifetime of regravelling determined through gravel loss under traffic and
rainfall according to a formula developed by the IBRD/TRRL research in Kenya.
Estimated traffic and results of rate of return calculations are summarized
below. Cost and benefit streams are shown in Tables 11-12-13 and sensitivity
and benefit/cost ratio calculations can be found in the project file.

C. Project Risks
4.18      The major risk of the road maintenance item would be the possible
failure of the financial arrangements worked out for the Road Fund (para 2.21).
Should the Government be compelled to divert some of these funds to already
committed road investments, road maintenance operations may have to be reduced
even with the envisaged external participation in financing recurrent costs.
1/   These results were derived from the economic analysis of periodic mainte-
nance on the whole 1,150 km backlog. It was estimated that benefits from
periodic maintenance on the most trafficked 680 km of bituminous roads
(para 3.17) would be 70% of total benefits.



- 38 -
4.19      The unavailability of overhauled equipment could also cause a short-
fall in road maintenance output. The operation, which involves a large quan-
tity of equipment, was conditional upon the timely start of efficient technical
assistance under the Third Highway Project which was modified for this purpose
(para. 2.33). This technical assistance started in March 1980, and it is
likely that the amount of equipment out of order has increased, thus extending
the time required for repair.  Full output will be reached later than estimated.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, the following items which are detailed in the
Plan of Action (Annex I) were discussed and agreed upon with the Government
and included as covenants in the Credit Agreement:
(a) assessment of additional technical assistance requirements for PWES
(para 3.24);
(b) project financing plan (para 3.31) and the use and audit of the
Special Account (paras 3.32, 3.40 and 3.41), and the Road Fund
(para 3.33);
(c) setting up a project coordinating unit; and
(d) procurement procedures (para 3.38)
5.02      During negotiations, agreement were reached with the Government on:
(a) the road network to be maintained and the strategy for routine
maintenance (para 3.08);
(b) the list and/or steps precedent to acquisition or implementation
of: (i) road maintenance equipment (para 3.09); (ii) fellowships
(paras 3.09 and 3.15); (iii) workshop equipment and improvements to
central workshop for PWES (para 3.10); and (iv) proposed facilities,
furniture, workshop and field equipment and vehicles for CPTP (para
3.15);
(c) the training program (para. 3.14);
(d) the program of periodic road maintenance and design standards for
road regravelling (paras 3.16-3.20);
(e) technical assistance to ONT's transport data collection unit;
(para. 3.21);
(f) minimum allocations for the routine maintenance program and exchange
of views each year on the road investment program (para 3.33); and
(g) outline TOR for auditing services (paras 3.33 and 3.41-Annex III).



- 39 -
5.03      The opening of the Special Account will be a condition for Credit
effectiveness (para 3.32):
5.04      Based on satisfactory agreements reached on the above items during
negotiations, the proposed project is suitable for a Credit Us$ 17.0 million
equivalent on standard IDA terms to the Government of the Republic of Mali.

ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Technical Assistance to Public Works Equipment Service
Outline Terms of Reference
Objectives
1.        The Public Works Equipment Service (PWES) intends to carry out
the overhaul of its road maintenance equipment under the Third and Road
Maintenance Projects financed by the International Development Association
(IDA). To accomplish this task, PWES will engage a technical assistance team
to assist PWES management in work organization and preparation of bid docu-
ments for the purchase of required spart parts, and to train and help Malian
specialized personnel in equipment repair.
Composition of the Team
2.        A team of six technical assistance expert will be assigned to
PWES for an initial period under the Third Highway Project. The components of
the team and their qualification are as follows:
(a) Mechanical Engineer. He should be a specialist in equip-
ment for civil works and mechanical workshop management.
He will be the advisor to PWES director and will be in
charge, inter alia, of training the chiefs of central
workshop's sections and the regional technical inspectors.
The mechanical engineer will be the team leader and will
have as Malian counterparts the chief technical inspector
and the workshop chief. He should have at least eight
years experience.
(b) Senior Mechanic. He will have to be specialized in engine
maintenance and repair and will be responsible for the
engine section of the central workshop. He should have
at least five years experience in his field.
(c) Diesel Mechanic. He will be responsible for the diesel
engine section of the central workshop. He should have
at least five years' experience in repair and maintenance
of this type of engine.
(d) Vehicle Mechanic. He will take care of repair of PWES'
light vehicle fleet. He should be expert in gasoline
engines and have at least five years experience in this
work.

(e) Auto Electrician. He should have at least five years-
experience in motor vehicle electric systems, and will be
in charge of all electric repair, including dynamo and start
motor coiling.
(f) Machine-Tool Mechanic. He should have at least five years'
experience in the use of machine-tools normally available
in mechanical workshops.
3.        The experts should have at least two years' experience in African
developing countries and should speak French fluently.
4.        The experts will work in PWES' central workshop in Bamako and will
help Malian mechanics to repair about 200 pieces of equipment. Repair work
would also serve as on-the-job training for Malian mechanics who are expected
to be able to perform their work satisfactorily after technical assistance is
phased out.
Duration of Services
5.        Total duration of technical assistance will be 125 man-months,
of which about 50 man-months under the Third Highway Project and about 75
man-months under the Fourth Highway Project. The technical assistance will
start in July 1979.

ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Audit of Accounts
Outline Terms of Reference
A.   Objectives
1.        The National Directorate of Public Works (NDPW) intends to carry
out an audit of the following accounts of its National Directorate of Public
Works (NDPW): (i) the revenues to, and expenditures from, the Road Mainte-
nance Fund; (ii) the expenditures for operating costs of the Bituminous
Brigade of the Road Strengthening Service (RSS) and the Regravelling Brigade
of the New Works Service (NWS); (iii) the Special Account; and (iv) the
Routine Maintenance Account. Audit of these accounts will be carried out
quarterly from the second semester of 1980 during the execution of the Road
Maintenance Project financed by the International Development Association
(the Association) and Switzerland.
B.   Auditors' Services
Road Fund
2.        The auditors will review semi-annually the revenues to, and expendi-
tures regarding road maintenance from the Road Fund to ensure that amounts for
road maintenance are adequately and regularly allocated and spent, and reach
the total budgeted amount at the end of each fiscal year. The auditors will
cooperate with the Malian personnel of the NDPW-s Accounting Office (AO) and
will indicate, in their first report, AO's areas where improvement is required
and how to effect improvement, and, in subsequent reports, the progress made
in improving AO's performance.
Expenditures for Operating Costs of NDPW's Brigades and Special Account
3.        The auditors will review semi-annually the statements of expendi-
tures submitted by NDPW to the Association for disbursements to:
(a) verify that the expenditures for operating costs of NDPW's brigades
for periodic maintenance drawn on the Special
Account were eligible for financing under the project and were used
in the carrying out of the project;
(b) check the brigades consumption/production ratio.

(c) verify that the expenditures drawn on the Special Account for
recurrent costs of routine maintenance were made to (i) purchase
imported goods for routine maintenance, such as spare parts and
consumable items for equipment maintenance, construction materials,
etc., excluding petroleum products purchased locally; and (ii)
replace worn out road maintenance equipment with the Association's
agreement; and
(d) the goods were purchased following the procurement procedures set
up in the Credit Agreement between the Association and the Republic
of Mali governing the Road Maintenance Project.
Reporting
4.        The auditors will pay semi-annual inspections to the accounts to
be audited. As a result of these inspections, they will send six copies of
the following reports in French to NDPW:
(a) a mid-year report on their findings within two months after the
end of inspection; and
(b) an annual audit report within three months after the end of the
Government's fiscal year.

ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Procedure for Disbursements Against Statements of Expenditures
1.        The proposed project provides for one bituminous road maintenance
brigade and one regravelling brigade administered by the Road Strengthening
Service (RSS) and New Works Service (NWS) of the National Directorate of
Public Works (NDPW). The Credit fund can be used to finance 88% of the
brigades' operating costs net of taxes or 76% including taxes (materials,
fuel, lubricants, spare parts, wages, and other equipment operating costs,
excluding depreciation). Disbursements for these operating costs, which will
be kept in separate accounts, will be made against statements of expenditures,
for which documentation will be retained by NDPW and made available for
inspection by the Association-s supervision missions.
2.        Disbursement procedures described in paras 3 and 4 are adequate, if
properly applied, to ensure an appropriate use of the Credit proceeds without
specific amendments. However, recent supervision mission have discovered
shortcomings in bookkeeping and control of expenditures. The Government of
Mali has indicated it wants to improve its accounting performance. As a first
step in that direction, an auditing firm acceptable to the Association, will
be hired by the Government and financed under the Credit to check regualrly
the expenditure statements and give an opinion on their validity and the
internal consistency.
3.        Current accounting practices in Mali are as follows:
(a) for the procurement of items (mainly materials) purchased
directly by the brigades, a purchase order carrying a
serial number and the signature of the brigade chief, and
countersigned by the chief of RSS or NWS is sent to the
supplier. When the item is received, the brigade's
storekeeper certifies on the invoice that the item has been
delivered and records the item in the "in" column of the
storebook. The NDPW's accountant prepares a payment
voucher to which the invoice is attached. The director
of NDPW signs the voucher and the supplier is paid from
the relevant category of the Road Fund.
(b) For the equipment rental to be put at the disposal of the
brigades, a request is made to the Public Works Equipment
Services (PWES), the equipment is delivered and the brigade's
account in PWES is charged for the use and maintenance cost
of that equipment, excluding the depreciation cost. Spare
parts purchased by the brigades for the equipment maintenance
are invoiced to PWES which deducts the corresponding amount
from the brigade's charge. A monthly rental status report is
established by the technical inspector and countersigned by

the brigade and the subdivision chiefs, and the regional
director of Public Works under whose supervision the brigade
operates. The report indicates for each piece of e;uipment the
number of kilometers or the number of hours it has worked.
4.        All documentation is sent for control to the Ministry of Trans-
port and Public Works's Accounting Unit and to the Ministry of Finance and
Commerce, which check the correctness of procurement and disbursements. The
Budget Control Section of the Ministry of Finance carries out occasional
checks of the accounting books of the Ministry of Transport and Public Works
and the Road Fund and occasionally even of the field offices. When irregula-
rities are discovered or suspected, the State Controllers Department, under
supervision of the President, carries out a detailed inquiry.
