REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED CREDITS
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA
FOR A RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
AND FOP A ROAD PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on two
proposed development'credits to the Republic of Upper Volta, one for the
equivalent of US$2.2 million for the establishment and operation of a
Rural Development Fund, and the other for the equivalent of US$2.8 million
for the construction of two secondary roads.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.          The basic problems of economic development in Upper Volta were
set out in a report entitled"The Economic Development of Upper Voltall and
dated November 27, 1970. An updating memorandum of January 13, 1972 was
distributed to the Executive Directors on March 2, 1972. (Annex II contains
country data, including some data on foreign aid.)
3.          Extreme poverty and the harshness of ecology and climate present
special constraintsto economic development in Upper Volta. The mass of
the population is eking out a meager subsistence from the soil with ineffi-
cient techniques and grappling with conditions which are more difficult
than in most other African countries: soils are often poor and shallow;
water is scarce; population distribution is unequal and ill-related to
physical resources; food may be sufficient, if not adequate, in normal
years, but becomes scarce in drought years and is a constant preoccupation
of the rural people; numerous endemic diseases seriously impair the effi-
ciency of labor; distance from the sea seriously handicaps external trade.
4.          Economic opportunities in Upper Volta are so few that many
young men (estimated at half a million out of a population of slightly more
than five million) work in coastal countries (mainly the Ivory Coast) and
save an average of US$30 annually for their relatives in Upper Volta.
This emigration is an ancient phenomenon. Today's rising expectations,
however, have inflated it to the point where remittances from migrant
workers have become the most important source of external receipts (about
$15 million a year).  On the other hand, this migration aggravates manpower
shortages in rural areas during the three-to-five months of the crop
season and partly accounts for the apparent decline of productivity in
traditional agriculture.
5.          The pensions paid by France to war veterans form another source
of foreign exchange. Apart from those transfers, Upper Volta can earn
foreign exchange only by exporting primary products--which do not yet include



-2-
minerals. Livestock used to be Upper Volta's main export. In recent years,
however, livestock exports have declined slightly in absolute terms and
rapidly as a percentage of Upper Volta's exports from 65 percent in 1964
to 37 percent in 1970. The difference was made up by cotton, which rose
from three percent of exports in 1964 to 29 percent in 1970. Cotton exports
will undoubtedly continue to grow largely as a result of the West Volta
Cotton project for which the Association made a'$6.2 million credit (225-UV)
in December, 1970 and of a second, smaller cotton project presently under
preparation. -However, the limits to cotton development are already apparent,
because cotton can be grown profitably only below-the 800 mm rainfall line.
The downward trend of livestock exports can perhaps be arrested and reversed,
but to make this possible many problems will have to be-overcome, such as
increasingly inadequate i ding, persistent diseases and above all unremuner-
ative meat prices maintained by the governments of the coastal countries.
6.          Minerals may some day become another source of foreign exchange.
There are a number of mineral deposits in the Liptako-Gourma, an area of
about half a million square kilometers in Upper -Volta, Niger and Mali named
after ancient 'kingdoms astride the central Niger River. Only the manganese
deposit at Tambao has.,attracted the attention of 'foreign investors so far.
A limestone deposit has been found at Tin .Hrassan and there is also some
phosphate, iron ore, copper, vanadium, molybdenum, 'zinc, lead and nickel.
However, this area is 1,500 km or more from the.,sea.
7.          The domestic market is very narrow.,,and offers little scope for
the development of manufacturing activities. ;Ampng the crops now grown in
Upper Volta, rice can be developed to meet a growing demand.
8.          Mainly because of these constraints, economic development since
independence in 1960 has been disappointing. Temporary upswings have been
followed by setbacks. Real GDP.per capita'seems to have remained approximate-
ly constant. While it declined between 1964 and 1968, it appears to have
grown about two percent a year in 1969 and 1970, but bad weather caused a
setback again in 1971. Furthermore, income disparities have probably increased.
9.          Difficulties were compounded and economic development hampered
.during the first years of independence (1960-66) by irresponsible financial
management and, since then, by financial sri4ngency. At the end of 1965,
there was an acute financial crisis. The Government had accumulated about
$20 million in short-term debts and could no longer pay the salaries of its
employees. The military government.which inherited power in January 1956
gave first priority to financial recovery, which it considered the only sound
basis for healthy growth. The austerity policy which has been consistently
applied since then has enabled the Government to repay the short-term debts
in full, to accumulate relatively large liquid reserves, and to' build up
substantial foreign assets.
1(.        'As a result of its austerity policy., the Government is now in a
position to face the adverse consequences of drought years such as 1970 and
1971 and is gradually turning to a-more development-oriented policy. Develop-
ment investments are expected to accelerate in coming years. Foreign aid
agencies .are expected to contribute not only most of the required funds, but
also assistance for the necessary strengthening of public services. The



-3-
Government realizes that these investments will increase recurrent demands
on the government budget. As a result of its austerity policy, it will have
sufficient resources to meet these demands. The Government also recently
hired, upon Bank advice, two advisers financed by UNDP (one in the Ministry
of Finance, and one in the Ministry of Planning) to review the level of
current resources required by development investments and their budgeting.
11.         The principal sources of aid until now have been the "Fonds
d'Aide et de Coop6ration" (FAC) of France and the "Fonds Europeen de Deve-
loppement't (FED) of the European Economic Community. As Annex II shows,
these two agencies together provided about 79 percent of foreign aid.
Most of their aid was in grants. About halL' of it was capital aid and one
fourth was technical assistance. An important part of French grants (in
1972, a third) has been for assistance to public administration; the rest
has been distributed (in 1972, almost equally) between agriculture, road
maintenance, education and telecommunications. FED contributions have been
primarily for water control (urban water supply and villageKwells) and roads.
FED, USADm, CIDA, the World Food Program and other organizations have been
providing emergency food aid to relieve the effects of droughts.
12.         The second five-year Development Plan (1972-76) is about to be
approved by Parliament.  Like the previous plan, it is essentially a list
of projects to be presented to foreign aid agencies for financing, but it
is unlikely to be fully carried out.   The Government hopes that it will
be possible to develop resources such as the Tambao manganese deposit and
the valleys heretofore made uninhabitable by onchocerciasis and thus to
achieve a higher rate of growth than in the past decade. The Minister of
Planning has proposed annual investments averaging about CFAF 12 billion, or
US$47 million, not including some 'optional investments" such as the ex-
ploitation of the manganese deposit at Tambeo.
13.         The development strategy is designed to make the best of limited
assets. While continuing to try and strengthen its capacity to earn foreign
exchange, Upper Volta must develop the rural sector, which employs 89 percent
of the population. Obviously, the primary goal of rural development is the
improvement of productivity in agriculture and livestock. However, this goal
itself poses problems of balance between agriculture and livestock, between
food crops and cash crops, and will also require investments in improving
the transportation network, in developing an appropriate system for the dif-
fusion of specific and general knowledge, in combatting endemic diseases and
in trying to achieve a better distribution of the population over the country.
14.         The precarious situation which continues to prevail with respect
to food must be reversed. Rice offers immediate possibilities. At the same
time, increasing attention needs to be given to the proper balance between
cash crops and food crops. The development of one sometimes contributes to
to the other, particularly when cash crops are rotated with food crops:
fertilizer benefits both. However, other effects may be less favorable.
Studies made in other similar countries seem to indicate that cash incomes
generated by export crops are sometimes more apparent than real. Labor is
drawn away from food production, which in some areas becomes insufficient.
Farmers who used to feed their families become unable to do so, when they
grow cash crops. They ought to buy food to cover their annual requirements
right after the harvest, when food is abundant and cheap. Frequently they



do not do so and spend too much of their money in other ways. One reason
is that many lack means of storing food.   But when the end of the dry season
comes, speculators sell grains at four or five times-the lowest price.
USAID, CIDA and FAC are presently financing the construction of grain stores
and Bank Group involvement does not seem to be needed at this point. Another
burden on rural development is the lack of storage-for farm inputs. The
proposed Rural Development Fund project would finance such facilities.
15.         In many areas of Upper Volta, land is becoming scarce for-
traditional extensive techniques and the soils are deteriorating under a
shortened fallow period. However, the introduction: of more intensive tech-
niques is resisted by traditional leaders as risky. Younger people, who
would be more innovative, are prevented-from -acquiring land of their own
by traditional laws and customs. Their migrati.on-;to towns or neighboring
countries might be slowed down if they could settle on presently unused
land and enjoy the fruits ofJtheir labor.
16.         Most-of-the population lives in areasc.which are unsuitable-for
cotton-and other cash crops. In these areas water is very scarce and, when
stored, it evaporates rapidly. It often-has to be carried considerable
distances by hand. However, there are underground-water tables which can
be tapped and the Rural Development Fund project provides for the sinking
of wells.
17.        -Disease and malnutrition seriously affect human beings.   In
addition to onchocerciasis, kwashiorkor -(a. children's -disease caused by
malnutrition) and bilharzia are viidespread.. It has been estimated -that close
to half the population of Upper Volta is infected-at-some time during their
lives with Schistosoma Haematobium, the- worm parasiltes-causing bilharzia.
Moreover, the disease could easily spread as a -result-of migration, concen-
tration around water holes, or the construction. of dams and the introduction
of new ways of farming -which use surface-water. Measures to guard against
such consequences are necessary in every project involving water control.
18.         Rural development is -further hampered in Upper-Volta by a very
primitive transportation network. Densely populated areas cannot be adequate-
ly supplied with food, drugs and public services. Local communities are
expected to maintain the secondary -roads, which are little more than earth
tracks, but they lack the resources- to do itl, and the-tracks are usable only
during the -dry season; The improvement of'transport.links between the villages
and the main towns is therefore an important, part of rural development. The
improvement of feeder roads is included-in the-proposed-Rural Development
Fund project.
19.         The rural population needs- advice, training and education.
Much effort has been made for agricultural extension, but the conventional
education system is both very costly and alien to-rural life. The Government
has long recognized that rural areas need a more relevant and less costly
type of education. Soon after independence, it established a rural-education
system.  However, this system has -been allocated only about eight percent
of the education budget, and owing. to lack of resources 'and prestige it
has gradually become a-second class conventional- education-.
20.         To take- into account the. diversity of!'problems in various parts
of the country, the Government has created regional, development bodies
(Organismes R6gionaux de'D4veloppement - ORD). An'ORD is a- decentralized
agency administered by a Board of Directors., that is responsible for formu-



lating and implementing development projects within its region. The eleven
OPD devote most of their efforts to extension work. Most of them have hir-ed
foreign development agencies to carry out operations and train Voltaic
nationals at all levels.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
21.         The Bank Group's contribution to Upper Volta's development is
recent.  As Annex I shows, two credits only have been made and disburse-
ments today amount to little more than $0.3 million.   The telecommunications
project for which a $0.8 million credit was made in 1969 (144-uv) has been
delayed by difficulties in recruiting expatriate experts, but is now proceeding
satisfactorily. The West Volta Cotton project for which a $6.2 million cre-
dit was made in 1970 (225-uv) is also proceeding satisfactorily, although bad
weather has kept production below expectations.
22.         The Bank Groupts strategy is in accord with the goals defined in
paragraph 13. While financing projects which will increase Upper Volta's earnings
of foreign exchange and assisting with the necessary infrastructure, it is also
directed to developing production for the domestic market mainly through rural
development. Of the two proposed projects, the Road project serves mainly the
first goal, and the Rural Development Fund project serves mainly the second.
23.         Further projects presently under consideration to increase Upper
Volta's foreign exchange earnings are:
- A second cotton project. Financing for the preparation of
this project was provided under the first cotton project.
The study will begin at the end of 1972.
- A livestock project. Livestock exports would be expected to
benefit from improvements in transportation and marketing
in the southwestern part of the country. A preinvestment
study is expected to begin later this year.
24.         There is some possibility of:
- A mining project. UNDP-financed technical studies of the
manganese deposit at Tambao have been completed and show the
deposit to be of unusually high quality (N'Sutite ore). The
deposit, however, is 1,500 km from the sea, and a railway
would have to be constructed from Ouagadougou to Tambao to
remove the ore. An economic feasibility study is now under-
way, and the Bank Group is being informed of its progress.
The Government is maintaining contacts with mining companies.
25.         Linked with the development of the modern sector would be the
following infrastructure projects:
- A second telecommnications project. Its object would be to
improve local telephone lines and switching facilities, and
micro-wave links for national and international communications.



-6-
- A trunk road project. Available data would Seem to justify
the paving of important sections of trunk roads.
26.       Fbod production is the most important of all activities oriented
toward the domestic market, and the first operation of the Bank Group in
this field'will probably be:
- A rice project. With technical assistance from Taiwan, some 300
families are being settled in the Kou valley to cultivate rice.
A similar project seems possible in the Banfora area and the
Association is considering its feasibility.
27.       Animals, which Wre plentiful in Upper Volta, are general-ly regarded
as a source of prestige and not used in agriculture for traction power and
manure, nor slaughtered for food. Although a change in attitudes will take
time, it would make possible productivity improvements in traditional crops
(millet, sorghum, sesame, etc.).  This will be.a long-term objective of
livestock development.
28.       While the reclamation of unused land is-a secondary feature of the
rice project, it is the main feature of:
- Integrated rural development projects to- follow the control
of onchocerciasis.  This disease, transmitted by a fly
(Simulium davmiosum) which breeds in turbulent waters, causes
severe itching in its mildest form and may.ultimately cause
blindness by attacking the optical nerve'.. It makes certain
valleys in Western Africa uninhabitable and seriously reduces
the productive potential of countries such as Upper Volta..
A project for the control of onbhocerciasis: in an area of
about 20C0,00 km2 in and around Upper Volta' is being prepared
by WlDH with UNDP financing and a work plan for the campaign
is expected to be ready for consideration by potential donors
next fall. When onchocerciasis is effectively controlled
in Upper Volta, certain relatively fertile valleys are likely
to be resettled promptly because land is becoming scarce
for traditional agriculture in adjacent areas. Projects for
the development of these areas are being prepared by FAC
experts for eventual Bank Group financing..
29.       The Bank Group is also concerned about the lack of employment
possibilities in rural Upper Volta during the seven-to-nine months of the
dry season.  The feasibility of more labor-intensive methods in road work
was recently discussed with the Government (see paragraph 53). The
possibilities of using rural labor for the maintenance of properly bulilt
rural schools, of developing handicrafts as well as artisan and repair
trades, and some day of introducing small manufacturing activities, are
being kept under review in cooperation with other agencies such as' IL  and
UNIDO.
30.       In education., rural areas deserve a higher priority, and the
Bank Group is presently appraising:
- An education -project, the main objective of which will be to bring
rural education back to its original purpose: training rural



- 7 -
people for rural life. The Rural Education Centers would be
integrated into village life, and teaching would be made more
relevant and practical with the assistance of the ORD. Qua-
lity improvements in conventional education would be a secondary
objective of this project.
31.       The Bank Group intends to study further nutrition deficiencies
with a view to devising a course of action to alleviate them. As a first
step, the desirability and feasibility of including nutrition among the
subjects to be taught in the Rural Education Centers will be explored.
32.       The Bank Group, with the help of consultants, is also endeavoring
to define a realistic program to improve the management capabilities of
Voltaic people working in the ORD and in the Ministry of Public Works.
33.       In conclusion, Upper Volta is an extremely poor country faced
with severe constraints, which-has made an exceptional effort to make use
of its resources. It is one of the six countries for which the UNDP will
rnake a special effort. It is eminently eligible for aid on concessionary
terms. It deserves special consideration also with respect to the finan-
cing of local costs.
PART III - THE RUPAL DEVELOPMENT FUND
34.       The proposed Rural Development Fund (RDF) project was identified
by an economic mission in November 1969. It was prepared by the National
Development Bank (BED) with the assistance of the Bank's Permanent Mission
in Western Africa (PMWA), appraised in August 1971 and negotiated in April
1972 with a delegation headed by H.E. Antoine' Dakoure, Minister of Agri-
culture, Livestock, Land and Water Resources, and Tourism.   FPAO and "Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique"l (CCCE) of France assisted in its pre-
paration and will contribute to its financing (paragraph 39).
35.       The most critical constraints on rural development in Upper
Volta, as analyzed above, can only be dealt with through a multiplicity
of small projects which do not lend themselves to direct Bank Group finan-
cing. Hence the proposal to create a Rural Development Fund (paragraph
40 below) to channel external funds to local communities.
36.       The proposed project would be the first phase of what is intended
to be an expanding program designed to alleviate various constraints and
increase agricultural production and other rural economic activities. It
would extend to most parts of the country where the Government can provide
supporting services when they are needed. It is expected that between
300,000 and )450,000 people would benefit from it.
37.       Under the proposed project, the Rural Development Fund would
finance:
(a) About 500 village wells to be constructed by unskilled
voluntary labor assisted by three well-digging teams.



-8-
The main benefits would be better protection from
waterborne diseases, savings of time and energy previously
spent on water collection, and the possibility of increas-
ing small livestock holdings.
(b) About 700 village warehouses for agricultural inputs, to
be built in the cotton belt by voluntary labor assisted
by paid masons and carpenters. They would benefit farmers
by retarding wastage of fertilizers and insecticides, thus
increas-ing cotton crops. The ready availability of inputs
-should also induce more farmers to use them.
(c)  About 190 small land and water develoPment schemes, to be
carried out by unskilled voluntary lab.or-assisted by
skilled paid labor. These schemes will include drainage
and.water control of swampy depressions (bas fonds) for
rice pr9duction; soil erosion control works on upland
farmi,nig,areas surrounding these depressions and producing
cotton, groundnuts, cowpeas, sorghum. and millet; small
gravity irrig,a,tion schemes on land lyingt-below existing
small dams. They are expected to increasqe   crop yields.
(d)  Improvement of feeder roads which can,be -shown to have a
minimum economic rate of return of ten percent from road
user savings or from -increased agricultural production
resulting from better communications wi-th extension servi-
ces or markets.
(e)  Unidentified projects,and studies, which,may include the
following :subjects already proposed by the ORD: training
of blacksmiths and other rural artisans.; direct agri-
cultural production schemes; provision of veterinary
equipment. Should the study mentioned -in paragraph 38
indicate that projects might have or have had a detri-
mental effect on the health of the peop-le, the amount
available under this heading could also be used to
finance preventive or remedial measures -such as the
purchase of knapsack sprayers to control the bilharzia
snails. Well contamination can generally be avoided
through proper location, but could be combatted through
periodic applications of perchloron or liming of the wells.
Another,possible use-of this amount would be to finance the
nutrition study mentioned in paragraph 31, should no grant
be available from other sources for this purpose.
38.       In connection with the Project, the Government has agreed to
cooperate with the Association in carrying out,a study, to be financed by
the Association on its own budget,, about the sanitary impact and the health
effects of the projects. The cost of this study is estimated at US$15,000.



- 9 -
39.       The cost of the project is estimated at $3,043,000 including some
$445,000 in taxes. The breakdown of costs is in Annex III. FAC and CCCE
would contribute about $380,000 to pay the salaries of the project manager
and of four other specialists. The Association would provide $2.2 million,
and the Government would provide the balance. The project cost estimates
do not include the monetary value of voluntary farm labor (about 370,(000)
and of resources devoted to the project by government services (about $86,000).
40.       The PDF wo ld be a new division of BND.  Its senior staff would
be a project manager initially, a well-qualified expatriate adviser to the
MND), a deputy project manager, who would be a specialist in small rural
development projects, and an evaluation officer (also initially an expatri-
ate) with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Association.
The deputy manager is expected to take over as manager about two years after
the beginning of the project, and additional personnel would be trained for
the PDF division.  Projects would be prepared by the ORD usually with
assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture, except for road improvements,
which would be designed by the Directorate of Public Works (DN4). All
projects would be appraised by the RDF before being incorporated in an
annual program. This program would be reviewed and approved, firstly by
an Interdepartmental Technical Committee to be headed by a Cabinet Officer
and cons.isting of high-level representatives of all Ministries involved,
and secondly by the Association. Establishment of this Committee would be
a condition of effectiveness of the credit. ORD would carry out the projects
described in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 37. They would be
assisted for the construction of wells by the Division of Water Development
and Rural Engineering (HER) of the Ministry of Agriculture. Farmers' groups
would be organized to carry out land and water development projects. The
road projects /subparagraph (d)] would be carried out by the DPW on force
account, or let to contractors. After construction is completed, ORD0, HEIR
and DPW would take over responsibility for subsequent management and main-
tenance of the projects. HER and DPW would, under the project, receive the
necessary technical assistance (paragraph 39).
41.       Adequate extension and credit services are essential, especially
for land and water development projects. The Government has given assuran-
ces that it would provide these services.
42.       An economic analysis has been made by type of project, because
variations between projects will be very small, particularly as regards
wells and warehouses. The justification of each type of project is reflected
in paragraph 37 above. However, a concise feasibility study would be re-
quired for each project estimated to cost more than CFAF 5 million ($20,000).
The number of such projects under the proposed project is estimated at about
25.
13.       Beneficiaries of the projects are extremely poor and unlikely to
work voluntarily on projects which would increase their debts, taxes or
input prices. They would not be expected to contribute to project costs.
The only exception is that farmers would be expected to finance land and
water project maintenance through annual levies. A model tripartite
contract between farmers, their association and ORD, incorporating this
obligation, would be agreed with the Association before such projects are



- 10 _
approved and carried out. However, if the project succeeds and its scope
expands, it may put an increasing strain on the government budget whereas
beneficiaries may become better able to contribute to investment costs.
It has been agreed, therefore, that studies would be conducted to determine
to what extent, as a result of the project, its beneficiaries may in due
course become-able to meet all or part of project costs.
44.       Goods to be procured for the project (vehicles, drills, compressors,
pumps, concrete mixers, brick presses, cement, reinforcing steel, lumber and
sheet metal roofing) would cost about $1.0 million,-but-most of the contracts
would be smalll. Fbr all purchases or contracts likely to be below $4,000
there would be, no competitive bidding. Contracts between $4.,000 and $5D,000
would be advertised only in'Upper Volta.   For all contracts above
$50,000, the Government would be obligated to consult.-with the Associa-
tion before calling for bids and awarding contracts'..
45.       The RDF would receive quarterly advances from the Government to
meet the financial--requirements of the project and.would'subsequently furnish
the Government with appropriate documentation to be--presented to the Association
for reimbursement. The Association would reimburse-the c.i.f. cost of
imported goods and 83 percent of the cost of all other items not financed
by French agencies..
46.       It is not possible to quantify. all the-b-enefits of the proljectj
particularly the improved well-being'and health of thebpeople.   On the basis
of quantifiable benefits only, the weighted'overa.l-'economic- rate of return
of the project is estimated at 15.6 percent. The rates-of return would
still exceed ten percent if costs were ten percent higher and benefits ten
percent lower than estimated.
PART IV - THE ROAD PROJECT'
47.       The proposed Road project was-identified&by the mission which
appraised the West Volta Cotton project in February, 1970. It was prepared
by the French consulting firm "Bureau Central pour les Equipements- d'Outre-
Mer" (BCE1OM), appraised in December 1971 and-negotiated in April 1972 with
a delegation headed by H.E. Antoine Dakoure, Minister of Agriculture,
Livestock, Land and Water Pesources-, and Tourism.
48.       The- proposed project (see AnnexIII) would complement the West
Volta Cotton project by upgrading to gravelled surface- two roads in the-
project area:
(a)  the'Sodlenzo-Koundougou road (70 km)-which is-used to
transport 20 percent of the total cotton production
of the lWest Volta- area;
(b)  the Hounde-Bgreba road (27 km) which connects the site
of the ginnery to be built under the Westi Volta Cotton
project to the Ouagadougou-Abidjan railroad.

49.       Total cost of the project, including taxes estimated at $0.'?
million (20 percent of total cost) would be about $3.5 million, of which
about $2.3 million would be for construction contracts and about $0.1
million for supervision. Feasibility and engineering studies would cost
about $0.5 million and contingencies about $0.6 million.
50.       The proposed project would be the second stage of road improvements
linked with the cotton project. The first stage, largely financed by credit
225-UV, is a five-year program of road maintenance and improvement on about
820 km of earth tracks serving the area. This program is now underway.
The detailed engineering for the second stage was also financed by credit
225-UV.
51.       The proposed $2.8 million credit would cover the total cost of
the project net of taxes. The Government has undertaken to provide the
additional funds that will be required for maintenance.
52.       The most likely economic return on the roads has been estimated
at 17 percent for the Koundougou-Solenzo road and 13 percent for the
Hound6-BMrdba road. The rates of return on both roads are sensitive to the
long-term trend of cotton production, which is difficult to estimate
because varying rainfall causes sharp fluctuations in output from year to
year. A sensitivity analysis, however, shows that the return on the Koundougou-
Solenzo road would remain satisfactory with conservative assumptions about
the future growth of cotton production.  The justification of the Hounde-
Bereba road is based essentially on the traffic that will be generated by
the construction of a cotton ginnery at Hounde under the TWiest Volta cotton
project being financed in part by credit 225-uv. Droughts in 1970 and 1971
reduced cotton production to a level which did not justify immediate con-
struction of the ginnery, but with the revised production forecasts for the
project area and to the southeast, operation of the ginnery is now planned
by 1975.  At the very worst, in the Association's judgment, future cotton
production will require operation of the ginnery by 1977 and full use of its
capacity in 1978, which still would imply a satisfactory return on the road
investment.
53.       The Association has explored with the Government the possibility
of amending the specifications of one or both of the proposed roads, to
encourage the use of more labor-intensive construction methods. The govern-
ment delegation welcomed IDA's interest in providing employment opportuni-
ties to the rural population. It pointed out, however, that road construc-
tion would provide on]y temporary employment; that it might be difficult
to mobilize unskilled labor for unfamiliar work; and that the longer
construction period required would increase administrative and supervision
costs. It was agreed therefore that no attempt would be made to amend the
specifications of the two project roads although it was agreed that further
consideration would be given to labor-intensive methods in the future.
The same problems, however, would not affect road maintenance, and FAC, which
is presently studying how Upper Volta could meet the requirements of secondary
road maintenance, has agreed to extend the study to the feasibility of labor-
intensive maintenance methods.



- 12 -
The proposed project would include $500,000 for feasibility
studies of about 400 km of trunk roads and engineering studies of sections
agreed to be of highest priority.
55.         Ecxecution of the project would be the responsibility of the
DP''. Contractors would be prequalified. Construction would be supervised
by DPTrW personnel with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the
Association on the basis.of a program to be mutually agreed. The Government
has agreed, however, to employ consultants, if necessary, to strengthen the
DPW staff, and funds have been provided under the,proposed credit to cover
this possibility.
56.         Construction work would.be awarded,in a single contract under
international competiti-vte bidding procedures... The Assoc,iation.would reim-.
burse .75 percent of the-cost of construction contracts.and 100 percent of the.
cost of supervision and pre-investment studies.,.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS,AND.AUTHORITY
57.         The draft Development Credit Agreements between the Republic of
Upper Volta and the Association for the Rural Develppment,Fund Project and,
for the Road Project respectively,,the Recommendations of the Committees
provided for in Article V, Section:.l(d) of the Articles.of Agreement of the
Association and.the text of Resolutions.approving.-each of the proposed Devel-
opment Credits'are being distributed to the Executive.Directors separately.
58.         The draft Development Credit.Agreement for the Rural Development
Fund project contains covenants.usually foundAin the Association!s agree-
ments for agricultural projects. The.effectiveness of the proposed credit.
would be conditional upon the establishment:of,,an.,Interdepartmental Tech-
nical Committee and-the appointment of its memb,ers,. in accordance with the
provisions set forth,in the Development Credit Agreement (Section 8.01).
59.         The-draft Development Credit Agreement for the Road Project is,
in the usual form for such projects.
