UPPER VOLTA
APPRAISAL OF A COTTON ROAD PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Economic development of the Republic of Upper Volta is hampered
by a number of serious constraints: a landlocked position in the heart of
western Africa, far from overseas markets and suppliers; a high incidence
of debilitating diseases; a general proverty of natural resources; erratic
rainfall and poor soils in large parts of the country. The economy is over-
whelmingly agricultural, primarily at a subsistence level, with cotton and
groundnuts being the only major cash crops. The Government's development
strategy is centered on the promotion of livestock and agriculture and a
particular effort is being made to increase cotton production.
ii.       The Association is assisting the Government in its efforts by a
credit (225-UV) of US$6.2 million made in 1970 to finance a cotton develop-
ment project in the West Volta area. Under that project, cotton production
is being increased through an expansion of land under cultivation and an
increase in yields per hectare by improving extension services, production
methods, and transport conditions. The proposed project will support the
West Volta cotton development scheme by upgrading, to an engineered gravel
standard, two roads which will play a particularly important role in moving
the cotton production. The Solenzo-Koundougou road (70 km) will serve
the cotton production of the Solenzo region which accounts for over 20% of
total production of the West Volta area. The Hounde-Bereba road (27 km) will
serve to haul to the railway the production of a ginnery to be constructed
under Credit 225-UV at Hounde. The present project also includes preinvest-
ment studies for about 400 km of roads.
iii.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$3.5 million.
The Association will finance US$2.8 million; that is, 100% of the total costs
net of taxes and duties. US$2.0 million of the credit will finance foreign
costs and the remaining US$800,000 will be applied toward local costs.
iv.       Substantial development benefits are expected to accrue to the
cotton development scheme, of which the proposed road construction is an
integral part. Benefits attributable to the road construction specifically
consist of savings in vehicle operating costs. On this basis, the internal
economic rates of return for the proposed investment will be about 17% for
the Solenzo-Koundougou road and about 13% for the Hounde-Bereba road. The
proposed investments remain economically justified even when the analyses
are tested with more conservative assumptions.
v.        The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$2.8
million to the Government of the Republic of Upper Volta.






UPPER VOLTA
APPRAISAL OF A COTTON ROAD PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project, which will be the Bank Group's first transport project
in Upper Volta, was identified in 1970 during the appraisal 1/ of the West
Volta Cotton Project (Credit 225-UV). At that time, it became apparent that
the increased production of cotton envisaged under the project would require,
among other things, improvement of transport facilities within the cotton
producing area. The West Volta Cotton Project therefore included (a) a five-
year program of road maintenance and betterment works on about 820 km of the
2,500 km of earth tracks serving the area, and (b) detailed engineering for
the upgrading to engineered gravel standard of two of the most important
tracks (Solenzo-Koundougou and Hounde-Bereba) totalling about 100 km, which
would carry cotton tonnages between 20,000-30,000 tons per year. The road
unit for the five-year maintenance and betterment program, headed by an
expatriate engineer and comprising regravelling and maintenance equipment,
began operations early in 1972. The economic and engineering studies for
the two roads selected for upgrading were carried out by the French consultants,
Bureau Central d'Etudes pour les Equipements d'Outre-Mer (BCEOM), and were
completed in January 1972.
1.02      Execution of the West Volta Cotton Project is satisfactory.
Although in 1971, for the second year in a row, Upper Volta suffered a
drought, project area production increased by 30% over the pre-project year
of 1970, while elsewhere in the country cotton production remained static.
1.03      The present project consists of construction of the Solenzo-Koundougou
and Hounde-Bereba roads, as well as feasibility and engineering studies for im-
provement of an additional 400 km of roads. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$3.5 million. The Association will finance US$2.8 million, that
is, 100% of total costs net of taxes and duties. About 70% of the proposed
credit, or US$2 million, will finance foreign exchange expenditures, and the
remaining US$800,000 will be applied toward local costs.
1.04      This report is based on the studies mentioned above and on the find-
ings of an appraisal mission, consisting of Messrs. W. H. Cooke (engineer) and
H. 0. Schulte (economist), which visited Upper Volta in December 1971. The
report was edited by Miss J. Murphy.
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The economy of Upper Volta, a landlocked country in western Africa,
is overwhelmingly rural in character. About 90% of the population is engaged
1/   Report No. PA-58a.



- 2 -
in farming and livestock raising, mostly at a subsistence level.  Livestock
is the most important export product, and cotton and groundnuts are the major
cash crops. The population is unevenly distributed, with approximately one-
half living in the central region, while considerable areas in the south and
southeast are virtually empty. Many fertile river valleys throughout the
country are deserted because of the incidence of river blindness. The
country's topography is generally flat, making communications easy except
during the short rainy season when wide areas are flooded.
2.02      Economic development has been very slow and is hampered by a number
of serious constraints: a geographic position far from overseas markets and
suppliers, a general poverty of natural resources, poor soils and erratic
rainfall in large parts of the country, and a high incidence of debilitating
diseases. The Government's development strategy is centered on the promotion
of livestock and agriculture, and a particular effort is being made to in-
crease cotton production, notably under the West Volta cotton development
scheme. These efforts will need to be supported by appropriate transport
investments.
B.   The Transport System
2.03      Transport within the country is primarily by road.  The road net-
work, which comprises about 17,000 km of roads and tracks, adequately covers
the economically important and populated regions. The network is, however,
of extremely low standard, consistiiag largely of unengineered earth tracks,
and only a few of the primary roads provide reliable all-weather service
(see Chapter 3).
2.04      The most important international transport connection is the rail-
way which links the capital, Ouagadougou, with the seaport of Abidjan in the
Ivory Coast, a total distance of 1,145 km. The railway, the Regie du Chemin
de Fer Abidjan-Niger (RAN), is a semi-autonomous agency jointly owned and
operated by the Governments of Uppe:- Volta and the Ivory Coast.  The RAN
carried some 2.5 million passengers and 756,000 tons of goods in 1970, with
Upper Volta traffic accounting for over 50% of total passenger-km and ton-km.
Transit traffic to and from Mali represents about 20% of total ton-km. Purely
internal traffic utilizing the 518 1m of track within Upper Volta is low, not
exceeding 25,000 tons in 1970.
2.05      Both Ouagadougou, the cap:ltal, and Bobo Dioulasso, the country's
economic center, have international airports. There are regular flight
connections between Ouagadougou and Europe as well as other West African
capitals. Internal air transport is negligible. A small domestic airline
was created by the Government and private interests in 1967 but it has not
yet been able to operate profitably due to the lack of demand.
C.   Transport Policy and Coordination
2.06      Responsibility for all mat:ters of transport policy rests with the
Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urban Affairs (see Chart). The



-3-
Ministry is directly responsible for the road sector, including road con-
struction and maintenance as well as regulation of the road transport in-
dustry; it also has supervisory authority over air and railway transport
agencies.
2.07      The role of the various transport modes is fairly well defined,
with roads being the predominant mode for internal traffic and the railway's
main role being to carry the country's import-export traffic. Road-rail
competition in the corridor served by both modes is free from Government in-
tervention, both with regard to internal and international traffic. There
is, however, a certain degree of subsidization of agricultural exports which
are shipped by the RAN at or somewhat below marginal costs. Railway tariffs
for all other goods generally cover or exceed full costs. While road trans-
port is generally more competitive than the railway for purely internal
traffic, its share of traffic to and from Abidjan is estimated at less than
15X of total tonnages shipped.
2.08      The Government's policy vim-a-vis the road transport industry is
liberal: access to the industry is easy, and there are no regulations witn
regard to transport rates, the size of companies or the kind of transport
services offered. Road user charges are high compared to Government outlays
for highways. Government receipts from taxes and duties on gasoline and
diesel oil are estimated to have been about US$3.0 million in 1971.  Tn addi-
tion, there are taxes and import duties on vehicles and spare parts as well
as various license fees on which, however, no precise information could be
obtained.  Government spending for highway maintenance was only US$1.5 million
in 1971 (para. 3.10) and its contribution to construction projects has been
negligible.
2.09      In its transport investment policy, the Government is now giving
priority to the improvement of international road links with Mali, Ghana and
Togo. The roads between Bobo Dioulasso and the Mali border and between
Ouagadougou and the Ghana border have recently been paved with financing
from the European Development Fund (FED), and work on the Ouagadougou-Togo
border road is underway, also with FED financing. While improvement of the
links with Mali, which carries considerable transit traffic between Mali and
the railway, appears justified on economic grounds alone, the Government's
decision to upgrade the road links with Ghana and Togo has been mainly based
on a desire to create alternative outlets to the sea in order to reduce the
country's dependence on the railway connection to Abidjan. The RAN, however.
is operating fairly efficiently and, except for short periods of peak demand,
has sufficient capacity to handle present and foreseeable external transport
requirements. Substantial investment programs are underway and planned in
the Ivory Coast which will further improve its services. Also, the railway
is clearly the most economic route to the sea for the western and central
areas of the country which are the most populated and active regions.
2.10      In order to direct future investment planning, the Governmetit ob-
tained financing from France's Ponda d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) for a



- 4 -
road survey by the consultants BCIEOM which will identify road investment
priorities and outline a ten-year investment program. The preinveotment
studies to be carried out under thie project (para., 4.04) will be based on
the consultants' findings.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   Highway Network
3.01      The road network (Table 1) consists of about 8,900 km of roads
classified as either primary, secondary or tertiary, and about 8,000 km of
rural tracks. The road density, .*mounting to about 4 km per 1,000 inhabi-
tants is similar to that of neigbcoring Mali. The network of primary roads
(4,450 km) radiates from the capital, Ouagadougou, and the main commercial
center, Bobo Dioulasso, and largely satisfies the current needs of the
country. About 385 km of the prirary roads are paved, with the remainder
being gravel surfaced. These road!s are considered to be all-weather, al-
though the unpaved sections are generally closed to heavy traffic for short
periods after heavy rains.
3.02      Only the primary network is maintained, and the remaining roads
have deteriorated over the past decade to little more than trails. The
secondary and tertiary roads are passable to heavy trucks and four-wheel
drive vehicles, but only during the dry season; the rural tracks are used
largely by bicycles, porters and pack animals.
B.   Traffic Growth and Characteristics
3.03      Traffic data are based on surveys taken by consultants in 1961
and 1971, with financing from FAC. The surveys, which were limited to
the primary network, indicate that traffic volumes on these roads grew at
a rate of 8% per annum over the period. This rate appears high in view
of the slow economic growth that has taken place, but it is corroborated
by 9% growth rates in the vehicle fleet (Table 2) and in fuel imports
(Table 3). Traffic volumes remain generally low, however, rarely exceeding
50 vehicles per day. Trucks account for about 30% of total traffic volumes.
The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urban Affairs intends to introduce
regular traffic counts on the basis of the 1971 survey and with personnel train-
ed by consultants.
C.   Administration (see Chart)
3.04      Within the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urban Affairs,
the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) has responsibility for the planning,
design, and maintenance of roads and bridges. The Directorate is divided
into two divisions, one for planniag and design of new works and the other
for road maintenance. The maintenance division is also responsible for
the central mechanical workshop, for stores, and for a technical training
school in Ouagadougou.



-5-
3.05      The DPW depends heavily on foreign assistance from FAC for its
staffing; at present only four (including the Director) of its 33 qualified
engineers are Upper Voltan nationals. There seems to be no shortage of funds,
mainly provided by FAC, for training Upper Voltan staff on scholarships abroad,
but only a few high school graduates are ready to take on technical studies
and most of those who have qualified prefer to work abroad or go into private
business. Though FAC is apparently willing to continue its technical assist-
ance to the DPW for the time being, a serious effort will have to be made by
the Government to improve the staffing situation. Attraction of Upper Voltan
staff will depend on improvement of conditions of service, but the possibi-
lities for corrective action are limited, not only because of the scarcity of
funds but also because changes in status of DPW personnel naturally affect
other ministries. During negotiations, the Government and the Association
discussed the measures that might be taken to improve the situation, such as
introducing changes in high school curricula or linking overseas scholarships
to a minimum period of civil service. The Government indicated that it had
the matter under constant review, stressing, however, that the problem was
equally, if not more acute in the health and education sectors and that any
measures it might take would naturally have to deal with the problem on a
multisectoral basis.
D.   Maintenance
3.06      The DPW is responsible for maintenance of the 4,450 km of primary
roads. The road maintenance division of the DPW has four regional subdivisions,
each of which has one or two grading units and a regravelling unit. FAC is pro-
viding substantial technical assistance for maintenance: since 1967 it has been
providing personnel to assist the maintenance division and more recently it
has undertaken to provide US$4.7 million worth of maintenance equipment, most
of which has arrived in the country. With FAC assistance, the division under-
took a regravelling program in 1969-1971, but due to a shortage of local funds
(para. 3.10), a considerable backlog of work remains. At the present rate of
progress, not all the primary roads can be regravelled even once in ten years.
And, while the division was able to grade the more heavily trafficked roads
from one to five times last year, some primary roads were not graded at all.
3.07      Maintenance of the remaining road network is negligible, since it
is left to the local authorities who have neither equipment nor personnel to
undertake this work. If they have funds available, the local communities
call upon the DPW organization to undertake emergency repairs. Due to the
lack of maintenance, this network has deteriorated badly, and many roads serv-
ing important agricultural regions are closed to traffic during the rainy sea-
son. FAC has agreed to finance a study of road maintenance requirements on
these roads, based on terms of reference prepared by the Bank Group, and to
assist the Government in formulating an overall road maintenance policy
(para. 3.11).
E.   Financing
3.08      The Government has relied on foreign assistance for the financing
of capital investments in the highway sector. Road construction and equipment



purchases have been financed by FAC, FED and United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID), mainly in the form of grants.
3.09      The Government finances the maintenance of its primary road net-
work through allocations from a Road Fund established in 1968. According
to the law establishing the Road Fund, about 60% of all Government income
from taxes, duties and other levies on gasoline and diesel oil are to be
allocated to the Fund and used exclusively for the rehabilitation and main-
tenance of the road network. Road Fund revenues have increased from US$1.16
million in 1968 to US$1.78 million in 1971. The Minister of Finance, however,
in line with his general policy of fiscal austerity, has released only a
portion of these funds to the DPW for maintenance operations, using the re-
mainder for other budgetary purposes.
3.10      Actual allocations to the DPW (Table 4) for maintenance of the
primary network ranged between US$1.4-1.5 million over the 1969-1971 period,
which was insufficient to keep the primary network adequately maintained.
As mentioned above, the DPW has been hampered in executing its regravelling
program and some of the equipment financed by FAC has remained idle for lack
of funds. For 1972, the DPW has requlested about US$1.67 million (US$375/km)
which would just cover operating exp3nses, and not equipment renewal; but
indications are that the Ministry of Finance will grant no more than about
US$1.46 million (US$328/km). With t1iis amount, the Directorate will be unable
to make full use of the equipment on hand, and FAC is considering postponing
procurement of the last batch of equLpment, scheduled to arrive in 1972. The
DPW will be faced with an additional financial problem when replacement of
the FAC equipment will become necessary in a few years, since renewal of the
fleet implies an additional allocation of US$600,000-700,000 annually. The
Ministry of Public Works intends to ask FAC to finance the renewal of road
maintenance equipment, but it is not certain whether FAC will be willing to
do so.
3.11      Under the road maintenance study, FAC will look into the financing
question and make recommendations as to the appropriate level of road main-
tenance expenditures required, takingr into account Upper Volta's financial
constraints. During negotiations for the proposed credit, the Government
agreed that upon receipt of this studly, which is expected to be available
late in 1972, it will discuss the consultants' recommendations with the
Association and agree upon a level of expenditure which will assure adequate
maintenance of all economically important roads.
F.   Planning
3.12      The Directorate of Planning in the Ministry of Planning, Industry
and Mines, is responsible for formulating and evaluating development projects,
for carrying out sector studies and research, and for reviewing the projects
from a financial viewpoint. The various technical ministries are responsible
for implementing individual projects and for giving technical advice to the



-7-
Director of Planning. Within the DPW, the planning and new works division
is responsible for project identification, preparation and execution. Due to
shortage of staff, the Directorate relies on consultants' studies financed by
the United Nations Development Programme, FED, IDA or USAID, for the prepara-
tion of its highway development projects.
G.   Engineering and Construction
3.13      The planning and new works division of the DPW is also responsible
for engineering and supervision of road development projects. Due to staff
constraints, all major engineering work is done by consultants, and the divi-
sion only briefs the consultants, reviews their designs and exercises tech-
nical and financial control over the project. Although supervision of con-
tracts is usually carried out by consultants, the DPW is at present super-
vising one major contract with its own staff. The Building Research
Laboratory (see Chart) under the direction of an expert provided by FAC, is
fully equipped to carry out materials testing for both road and building
works.  It has carried out extensive pavement design work for the DPW, con-
sultants, and the private sector. The capacity of the laboratory staff in
soils testing and pavement design is not fully utilized at present. The DPW
does not have any established design standards, but the roads and bridges re-
cently constructed by FED were designed for 13 (metric) ton axle loads, with
6 m wide pavement and 9 m wide formation, which are the standards normally
applied in French-speaking West Africa. While axle loads are legally re-
stricted to 10-tons, the Government has neither equipment nor personnel to
enforce the regulation. This does not appear to be a problem at present
because of the low traffic volumes.
3.14      There are a few Upper Volta firms capable of carrying out small
building contracts (small bridges, culverts and supply of materials). Major
contracts have been carried out by foreign firms registered in West Africa
which operate throughout the region and are reasonably mobile.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The project comprises the following:
(a)  the construction of two cotton roads totalling 97 km;
and
(b) feasiblity studies for about 400 km of primary roads,
to be followed by detailed engineering of those sections
found to have the highest priority.
Construction of Cotton Roads
4.02      The two gravel roads to be constructed under the project will
replace earth tracks serving the West Volta cotton producing area, and



-8-
are important elements in the overall scheme to promote cotton production
in the region. The Solenzo-Koundougou road (70 km) will connect the
marketing center of Solenzo with the paved road which leads to Bobo
Dioulasso, where the cotton is ginned prior to export via the railway.
The Hounde-Bereba road (27 km) will provide a reliable link between Hounde,
where a new ginnery is to be built, and the railway.
4.03      Engineering for the two roads, financed by Credit 225-UV, has been
completed. The design standards (Table 5) are satisfactory and consistent
with expected traffic levels of 30-40 vehicles a day. Both roads will be
given a gravel (laterite) surface, 20-30 cm thick and 7 m wide; two bridges
to be built on the Solenzo-Koundougou section will be of single lane width.
The topography of the region is flat; in some low-lying areas this will
necessitate raising the road surfaca above flood level. Ample materials
suitable for building embankments and surfacing are available along the
route.
Preinvestment Studies
4.04      The preliminary findings of the study of road investment needs
carried out by BCEOM have indicated that, by about 1975, some sections of
primary roads radiating from Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso are likely to
warrant upgrading. The project inc'Ludes the financing of (a) feasibility
studies for about 400 km of road to be agreed between the Government and the
Association after review of the consultants' final report, and (b) detailed
engineering of those road sections identified under the feasibility studies
as having proper justification. During negotiations, the Government con-
firmed that it will furnish the Association with all relevant information
for the selection of roads to be studied as soon as such information is
available.
B.   Execution
4.05      The DPW will be responsible for the execution of the project, in-
cluding the supervision of construct:ion. After completing ongoing works, DPW
staff with adequate qualification and experience will be made available to
supervise the construction under the project. The Government agreed during
negotiations that if the Associationi deems it necessary, the DPW will be
strengthened by the employment of consultants. Funds have been provided
under the project for this purpose Ehould consulting services be required.
The preinvestment studies will be cearried out by consultants, selected in
agreement with the Association.
4.06      Procurement will be in accordance with established Bank/IDA guide-
lines on international competitive bidding. Contractors have been invited to
prequalify, and a number of international contractors and their subsidiaries
established in western Africa are expected to submit bids. The Government
has expressed preference for a single contract for administrative convenience,



-9-
and the Association concurs, in view of its already small size. It is estimated
that bids will be called in late 1972 and that the contract will be awarded in
early 1973. Construction of the Solenzo-Koundougou road is expected to begin
in Fall 1973, to be followed by the Hounde-Bereba road in early 1974. The
project is expected to provide employment for several hundred men over the
two-year construction period. The Government agreed during negotiations that
upon completion of construction, the DPW will be given responsibility for the
Solenzo-Koundougou and Hounde-Bereba roads, and sufficient resources will be
made available to assure that they are maintained regularly.
4.07      Discussions were held during negotiations about the possibility of
amending the specifications of the project roads in order to encourage the use
of labor-intensive methods of execution and thereby provide employment op-
portunities to the rural population which is unemployed for part of the year.
The discussions also covered the feasibility of labor-intensive maintenanice
methods. The Government delegation welcomed the Association's interest in this
problem. It pointed out, however, that the road construction would only pro-
vide a temporary source of employment; that mobilizing unskilled labor for this
type of work would be difficult; and that the longer construction period re-
quired for labor-intensive works would increase administration and supervision
costs and postpone the benefits to be derived from the investments. It was
agreed therefore that no attempt would be made to amend the specifications of
the project roads, although the idea would be kept in mind for other operations,
particularly for the maintenance of secondary roads.

/1   Of which 20% is taxes and duties.
4.09      The cost estimates are based on current contract prices for FED
and FAC-financed road projects in Upper Volta. Contingency allowances for
price escalation reflect recently experiLenced increases of about 8% per
annum on civil works, and slightly less than this amount on consultants'
services. Physical overruns are expected to be low due to the simple
character of the construction works.
4.10      The foreign exchange component: on the civil works is estimated at
50%; about half of the local costs represents taxes and duties. The costs of
consultants' services are based on average monthly rates for construction
supervision and on unit prices for preirtvestment studies. The foreign com-
ponent for these services amounts to about 80% of the total cost. There
are no taxes on this item.
4.11      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$3.5 million.  The
IDA credit will finance total project costs net of taxes and duties, estimated
at US$2.8 million. During negotiations, the Government agreed that the necessary



- 11 -
budgetary allocations will be made to meet the remaining local costs of the
project, amounting to about US$0.7 million equivalent in taxes and duties.
D.   Disbursements
4.12      Disbursements will be made from the credit account on the following
basis:
(a)  75% of total expenditures for construction, which represents
100% of the cost net of taxes and duties; and
(b) 100% of the total cost of consultants' services.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 6.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      Under the West Volta Cotton Project, being assisted by an IDA credit
(225-UV) of US$6.2 million, production of Upper Volta's major cash crop, cot-
ton, is to be increased through an expansion of land under cultivation and an
increase in yields per hectare by improving extension services, production
methods and transport conditions. At the time of the appraisal of the cotton
project, it was estimated that total cotton production in the project area
would reach over 66,000 tons by 1975/76 and increase to 83,000 tons by 1980/81,
as compared to a production of 18,600 tons in 1969/70. Production in the proj-
ect area suffered a serious initial setback due to abnormally low rainfalls
in 1970 and 1971, and total production so far has fallen short of appraisal
estimates by nearly 50%. Still, production results in the project area fared
substantially better than in the rest of the country, and the CFDT (Compagnie
Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles), the agency responsible
for execution of the cotton project, is confident that, assuming normal rain-
fall conditions, the original targets will be met, though with a delay of
about three years.
B.   Economic Justification
5.02      Construction of the two project roads will reduce substantially the
transport costs of cotton and other traffic. The Solenzo-Koundougou link
serves the cotton production of the entire Solenzo region, which accounts for
over 20% of total production of the cotton project area. The Hounde-Bereba
road will serve to haul the production (cotton lint and cotton seed) of the
ginnery to be constructed at Hounde to the railway at Bereba.
5.03      Traffic on the two project roads has been estimated on the basis
of present cotton production projections, on data provided by the Government
concerning the transport of other agricultural products and consumer goods,



- 12 -
and on the ratio between goods and passenger movements observed on comparable
roads in the country.  Based on these estimates, goods traffic on the Solenzo-
Koundougou road in 1975 will total about 14,000 tons, of which about 10,000
tons will be seed cotton and cotton production inputs such as fertilizers
and tools. Total goods traffic is eKpected to grow to about 23,000 tons by
1980. Traffic on the Hounde-Bereba road will consist mainly of the output
of the ginnery at Hounde which will be shipped to the railway at Bereba and
thence by rail to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. Originally, construction of
the ginnery, for which financing is provided under Credit 225- WV, was planned
for 1972 when it was estimated that the existing ginning capacity at Bobo
Dioulasso (maximum 39,000 tons) woull become insufficient. With the revised
production targets, it is now planneil that the ginnery will be operational
by 1975 and be operating at full capacity (25,000 tons) by 1978. In addition,
there will be some local traffic on the road, as well as some seed cotton
going to the factory.
5.04      The proposed road construci:ion supports the cotton development
scheme to which substantial developmental benefits are expected to accrue.
These have already been considered in the economic evaluation of the West
Volta Cotton Project. Benefits which can be said to derive specifically
from the proposed road construction 2onsist mainly of savings in vehicle
operating costs, estimated at about 40%, due to the improved condition of
the roads and to the use of heavier <md more economical vehicles this will
allow. In addition, there will be d:istance savings of 7 km on the Solenzo-
Koundougou road. Most of these benelfits will accrue to the CFDT and thus to
the cotton development scheme since the CFDT transports cotton with its own
trucking fleet. Based on an analysis of costs and benefits over a period of
15 years, the expected economic life of the project, the internal economic
rates of return for the proposed investment will be about 17% for the
Solenzo-Koundougou road and about 137 for the Hounde-Bereba road.
C.   Sensitivity Analysis
5.05      The future evolution of cotton production clearly is the most un-
certain variable in the economic analysis of the project roads. In the sensi-
tivity analysis of the Solenzo-Koundougou road, therefore, two, more conserva-
tive assumptions concerning future cotton production in the project area were
introduced: (a) a five-year instead of a three-year delay in reaching the
original production targets; and, alternatively, (b) a maximum production of
only 50,000 tons which would be reachted by 1980 (Table 7). Using these alter-
native assumptions for the traffic fcrecasts, the economic returns on the
Solenzo-Koundougou road drop to either 15% or 13% respectively. Since a further
test shows that a 10% increase in corstruction costs would reduce the rate of
return by only about one percentage point, the investment for the Solenzo-
Koundougou road can be considered as sound.
5.06      With regard to the Hounde-Eereba road, the timing of construction
and operation of the ginnery at Hounde is the most crucial element determining
its economic viability. In the Association's judgment, at the very worst,
cotton production from the project area and the area to the southeast will
certainly require operation of the ginnery by 1977 and full use of the gin-



- 13 -
nery's capacity by 1978. In such a case, the return remains acceptable at
10%, indicating that construction of the Hounde-Bereba road is also a sound
investment.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      The following are the major project matters which were discussed and
agreed between the Government and the Association during credit negotiations:
(a) the submission to the Association, as soon as available, of
BCEOM's final report on road investment needs as well as
other relevant data in order to agree upon the selection
of roads for study under the project (para. 4.04);
(b) the supervision of construction by the DPW provided that
staff with adequate qualification and experience are made
available for this purpose and, if deemed necessary by the
Association, the strengthening of the DPW through the
employment of consultants (para. 4.05);
(c) the selection of consultants mutually acceptable to the
Government and the Association for preinvestment studies
(para. 4.05);
(d) the arrangements to assure adequate maintenance of the
project roads (para. 4.06); and
(e) the provision of adequate funds to cover the local costs of
the project not financed by the IDA credit (para. 4.11).
6.02      The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$2.8
million equivalent to the Government of the Republic of Upper Volta.
