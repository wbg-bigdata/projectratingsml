REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTrIE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FCR A ROAD MAINTENANCE AND RECCNSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Dominican Republic for the equivalent of US$5.0 million to help finance a Road
Maintenance and Reconstruction Project. The loan would be made on standard Third
Window terms of 25 years, including 7 years of grace, with interest at 4.85 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited the Dominican Republic in August/September
1974. Its report, "Updating Report on the Economy of the Dominican Republic"
(611-DO), was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 18, 1975. Relevant
social and economic data are presented in Annex I.
3.        In 1970-74, the Dominican economy expanded rapidly, stimulated by large
inflows of private capital into key sectors such as mining, agriculture, and
menufacturing, by rapid export growth Pnd by a dynamic public investment program.
The rate of real GDP growth averaged almost 11 percent.
4.        Mining, industry (including sugar refining), construction, and services
accounted for the bulk of output growth. Industrial incentive laws, although
offering a high degree of protection and encouraging capital intensive activities,
did stimulate private investment in manufPcturing, mostly in import substitution
industries. Construction activity was stimulated by the high level of public
investment outlays for infrastructure and by private residential construction.
M9uch of the increase in mining output came from the Falconbridge ferronickel plant
(partly financed by Lonn 6l6-DO) which started production in 1X72.  IJrban
services and tourism also expanded rapidly. The total volume of agricultural
production increased at a slower rate, as increases in export crops were partly
offset by slow growth in food crops.
5.        Responding to political stability and a favorable business climate,
gross investment increased from 19 percent to 25 percent of GDP between 1970 and
1974, an annual increase of nearly 20 percent in real terms. Much of the invest-
ment was financed out of internal savings. Domestic savings increased from just
under 12 percent of GDP in 1970 to about 18 percent of GDP in 1974. Prudent fiscal
policies contributed to the growth of savings. Consolidsted public sector savings
financed over three fourths of public capital expenditures and contributed over
one-half of total gross domestic savings in 1970-74. However, the restraint on
current expenditure involved some cost in the neglect of needed services. The
ratio of taxes to GNP is in excess of 16 percent, reflecting a substantial public
resource mobilization effort.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



6.        Exports have been the most dynamic element in the economy. Merchandise
exports increased from US$213 million in 1970 to an estimated US$634 million in
1974. The Dominican Republic was one of the few countries able to increase its
volume of sugar exports in a period of rising world prices. Raw sugar exports
amounted to 7614,000 tons in 1970 and 1,016,000 tons in 1974. Other exports have
also been buoyant. The combined export value of cocoa, coffee, and tobacco reached
US$134 million in 1974 as compared to US$63 million in 1970.   Ferronickel exports,
which began in 1972, reached US$93 million in 1974. Although tourism has only
recently become a significant source of foreign exchange, gross tourism earnings
came close to US$50 million in 1974, up from about US$20 million in 197C.
7.        The economic expansion of 1970-74 was accompanied by liberal credit
policies. In this period, the stock of bank credit to the private sector increased
at an average annual rate of over 33 percent and bank credit to the public sector
increased at an average annual rate of 14 percent. The inflationary potential of
the fast credit expansion was partly compensated by an increased willingness on
the part of the private sector to hold time and savings deposits, even though low
yields are paid to savers. Nevertheless, the Santo Domingo Consumer Price Index,
which rose at an average annual rate of 4 percent in 1970-71, accelerated to 14 per-
cent in 1973-74. Part of this increase was the result of the sharp increase that
import prices experienced in 1974. It is probable, moreover, that the cost of
living in Santo Domingo understates inflationary pressures because prices of
staples and rents, which weigh heavily in the index, are controlled. In any event,
the liberal credit policy of 1970-74 would have led to even greater price rises,
had not imports been allowed to rise from US$278 million in 1970 to US$673 mil-
lion in 1974, an annual nominal rate of nearly 25 percent and a real rate of
14 percent.
8.        In 1974, world sugar prices rose to reccrd levels.   The world price,
which had averaged 8.5 cents/lb in 1972/73, peaked at over 60 cents/lb in Novem-
ber and averaged 30 cents/lb for the year. The Dominican Republic, because it had
followed the practice of selling forward most of its crop, did not fully benefit
from these high prices in 1974, as the average price obtained was 14.7 cents/lb.
In early 1975, it was expected on the basis of future sales already contracted
at that time that Dominican sugar exports in 1975 would sell at an average
33 cents/lb. The actual average export price received in 1975 was 25.4 cents/lb.
While still a very high price, it did not allow for the reserve build-up that
had been envisaged (see Economic Report 611-DO).
9.        The potential for a reserve build-up in 1975 was further affected by a
severe drought, causing lower sugar exports and higher food imports than in 1974.
The volume of bauxite and ferronickel exports also dropped in 1974, owing to weak
foreign demand. On the other hand, the Rosario gold and silver mine started
operations in 1975, with exports of US$28.6 million. On balance, the authorities
were able to sterilize in 1975 about US$60 million of tax revenues and US$20 mil-
lion of sugar exporters' revenues in special reserve accounts. These measures
helped prevent excessive expansion of domestic credit and imports, making it
possible for banking system external reserves to increase by US$60 million in
1975. As a consequence of the poor weather and world recession, GDP growth in
constant prices was only 4.7 percent in 1975.



10.       Prospects for 1976 are mixed. Good weather in late 1975 and early 1976
is expected to lead to a recovery in agricultural output. Recent expansions in
installed electric power capacity should facilitate some expansion in industrial
production. The ongoing economic recovery in OECD countries could result in larger
volumes of bauxite and ferronickel exports, as well as in higher earnings from
tourism. Further expansions in gold mining capacity are under way. On the other
hand, with world sugar prices running at about one-half the prices obtained by the
country in 1975, total 1976 export earnings may be some US$200 million below the
1975 levels and a substantial balance-of-payments deficit is expected to re-emerge.
Because the Government feels that the Dominican Republic failed to benefit fully
from the high sugar prices prevailing in 1974 and 1975, it has been reassessing
its marketing strategy. This reassessment has led to a marked slowdown in marketing
the current sugar crop. As a result, in early 1976 domestic liquidity continued
to be tight and the authorities were again pursuing cautious fiscal and incomes
policies; overall growth is likely to be quite modest.
t1.       Because much of the recent economic growth was concentrated in the main
urban centers, it did not materially improve the living standards of the rural
majority. Although the official accounts show GNP per capita of between US$h6c
and US$480, most non-financial indicators of the level of economic development
show the Dominican Republic at par with other Latin American countries in the
US$320 to US$360 GMP per capita range (see Annex I, p. 5), and suggest that
poverty is fer more widespread than suggested by GNP per capita figures. A recent
health sector assessment found that the food int2ke of almost 70 percent of the
population is below the minimum nutritional standards established for Central Ame-
rica and Panama and that over three-fourths of pre-school children suffer from
protein-calorie malnutrition. Malnutrition in the Dominican Republic is probably
more severe than in any Central American country.
12.       The Government is acting to correct the disparity between rural and urban
incomes. It has taken action to redistribute land, to redirect public credit to
small scale farmers, and to extend the benefits of public education to rural areas.
Since 1972, the land reform institute has acquired over 225,000 hectares (almost
10 percent of the country's arable land). Much of this land has been distributed
to individuals -- in farms of under 7 hectares -- or to "asentamientos", state
farms in which the members work the land together and share the proceeds. To
ensure that subsidized credit reaches small-scale farmers, the lending ceiling
of the State Agricultural Bank was lowered from US$250,GGC to US$50,000. The
average size of new loans made in 1975 was about US$1,50C in the case of the
Agricultural Bank and even smeller in the case of the two other official agricul-
tural credit agencies. The Government also intends to broaden the opportunity
for children to have at least four years of primary schooling, especially in
rural areas. With Bank Group assistance, the Government is beginning to emphasize
nonformal vocational training for agricultural activities and industrial trades.
130       The Government is also continuing its efforts to provide new employ-
ment opportunities by pursuing growth-oriented policies and carrying out a large
public investment program. Nonetheless, despite recent increases in output,
the overall urban unemployment rate has not been significnntly reduced, m.ainly
because the urban labor force has increased by more than 6 percent per annum,
reflecting migration to the cities and an increase in the economic participation
of women. A recent ILO study suggests that in early 1973, 20 percent of the



- L -
Santo Domingo labor force was unemployed and 60 percent of the remainder were
partially unemployed. In spite of extensive rural migration, underemployment
in agriculture is still widespread. Nationwide, unemployment and underemploy-
ment are equivalent to about 4O percent of the labor force. Because of the fast
growth of population (over 3.3 percent), the economy would need to expand by
6.5 percent per year merely to maintain unemployment at its present high rate.
1a.       The Agency for International Development (AID), IDB, and IDA have pro-
vided the bulk of external assistance since 1960. Because of its income level,
the country is no longer eligible for IDA credits. AID's budget has been signi-
ficantly reduced in recent years and U. S. government assistance to the Domini-
cen Republic has gone down from over US$100 million per year in the mid-1960's
to about US$17 million per year. IDB lending has averaged US$30 million per
year. The Dominican Government has also been able to borrow modest amounts
from foreign commercial banks.
15.       The Government's prudent financial management is reflected in a relatively
small and well-structured external public debt. As of year-end 1975, the disbursed
total external public debt of US$L37 million was equivalent to 11.5 percent of
GDP. The Government has taken the position that the economy cannot afford to
service more than a quite limited amount of debt on conventional terms, because
of its lasting structural weakness. Therefore, only one-third of the debt had
been contracted at commercial terms (commercial banks and suppliers' credits),
and the debt service ratio is relatively low. The Government, in its assessment
of terms that the country can afford, is mindful of the fact that until only a
few years ago official external lenders like the Bank considered that the
economy's creditworthiness was so fragile as to warrant lending only on highly
concessionpry terms such as those provided by IDA.
16.       Despite progress achieved in recent years towards diversifying exports,
sugar still represents more than half of export earnings. Sugar prices, trEdition-
plly highly volatile, are expected to remain depressed for several years, while
other traditional exports (ferronickel, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, bauxite) are
expected to grow slowly in the medium term. While gold and silver exports are
expected to expand, as well as tourism earnings, and the country could develop
new exports, such as agroindustrial products, the balance of payments outlook
is not likely to change significantly until the mid-1980's. Cn balpnce, export
earnings over the next decade are likely to fluctuate considerably and can be
expected to lag behind import growth if an effort to improve social conditions
is to be sustained.
17.       Because the authorities have pursued prudent debt management policies,
they h.ve some untapped borrowring capacity from private sources. But they could
draw from these sources only in moderate amounts, if overall debt terms are to
remain sufficiently soft in the face of poor prospects in the world sugar market.
To the extent that new commerciel borrowing is kept at moderate levels and a
suitable balance is maint ined between conventional and concessionnry loans, the
Dominic2n Republic can be considered creditworthy for some Bank lending.
B'lig,ibility f'or Third Window Lending
iF.       The foregoing raragraphs (11 through 17) present material which is relevant
to the consideration of Third Window financing for the Dominican Republic.   In sum-
mary, the country is considered eligible for this type of financing on the basis of
she following criteria:



(1) Poverty: Although the GNP per capita is shown at about US$460 in 1972 (Bank
Atlas figure), most non-financial indicators of the level of economic and social
development show the Dominican Republic at par with other Latin American countries
in the-US$320 to US$360 per capita income level (see Annex I, p. 5)
(2) Performance:   The Dominican Republic is making a substantial development
effort in relation to its resource base and economic potential. The Government
is pursuing growth-oriented policies designed to provide new employment opportu-
nities, attempting to correct the imbalances between the urban and rural popule-
tion and promoting the diversification of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
(3) Creditworthiness:   The Dominican Republic is creditworthy for limited amounts
of Bank lending. Its external debt and debt service are at moderate levels,
although its overall borrowing should continue to be on relatively soft terms gi-
ven the critical dependence of the balance-of-pAyments on sugar exports and the
depressed outlook for world sugar prices.
(4) Alternative sources of fin?nce:   In the past, the bulk of the Dominican
Repubiicrs borrowings has come from IDA, AID, and IDB. The country is no longer
eligible for IDA financing, AID has sharply reduced its lending program, while
IDB lending is expected to remain at recent levels. As indicated in paragraph 15,
the Government is prudently limiting its recourse to borrowing on commercial terms.
PART II - BAIK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
19.       Since the Bank Group began operations in the Dominican Republic in
1969, the country has received three IDA credits totalling US$22 million and three
Bank loans totalling US$ 54 million, making a total for the Bank Group of
US$76 million. At the end of April 1976, the Bank and IDA held about US$70.6 mil-
lion, including US$40.2 million not yet disbursed. One loan, for the Falcon-
bridge ferronickel project, has been fully disbursed.
20.       Two IDA credits were made in FY71:  US$4 million for an Education
Project and US$5 million for a Livestock Development Project. A third IDA
credit for US$13 million was approved in FY73 for an irrigetion project (Yaque
del Norte) which is being jointly financed with IDB. Two Bank loans were made in
FY75: one for US$21 million to finance a tourism project and another one for
US$8 million to finance a Second Education Project.   IFC m-de one investment
in the Domiricar. Republic:  a loan end an equity comdmtment fcr US$7.L million
in FY74 for a cement project, which has been fully disbursed.   Execution of
Bank Group projects has been, on the whole, satisfactory. Annex II cortains a
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments as of April
30, 1976,2nd notes on the execution of ongoing Bank and IDA financed projects.
21.       When the Bank Group began to lend to the Dominican Republic in the
late sixties, the country's precarious economic and financial situation required
that all external assistance be on highly concessionary terms. Therefore, with
the exception of the Falconbridge ferronickel project, an enclave export project,
all lending up to fiscal year 1973 was on IDA terms, In view of the considerable
economic progress achieved by the country in recent years, the Dominican Republic
is no longer eligible for lending on IDA terms. However, for the reasons explained
in Part I, the Dominican Republic will continue to require some external finnn-
cing on concessionary terms.



22.       Bank Group lending to the Dominican Republic has been primarily direc-
ted at redressing the three major obstacles to economic and social development:
the vulnerability of the balance of payments, high rates of rural underemploy-
ment and urban unemployment, and weakness of the institutions responsible for
sectoral policies, project preparation, and project execution. The ferronickel,
livestock, and tourism projects are aimed at strengthening the Dominican Republic's
balance of payments. The livestock and tourism projects have at the same time
strengthened sectoral institutions. The education projects are directed at
upgrading the capabilities of the labor force, thus helping to resolve the
underemployment and unemployment problems. The Yaque del Norte Irrigation Pro-
ject will assist both to improve the standards of living of the rural population
es well as to increase production in a potentially rich agricultural area.
23.       Although the Government has been carrying out substantial investment
in road construction, allocations for maintenance have not kept up with the needs
of the expanded network, both because of resource constraints and because of
institutional weaknesses. As a result, there is an urgent need to rehabilitate
and reconstruct some important roads which have been allowed to deteriorate,
and to strengthen maintenance services. The main purpose of the proposed
Project is to support the Government's efforts at strengthening highway mainten-
ance organization and procedures.
24.       The Dominican Republic's population density ranks among the highest
in the hemisphere, and the net population growth rate would also be among the
highest were it not for substantial emigration to the United States and Puerto
Rico. The Goverrment has begun an active, though limited, family planning
program with the support of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and
AID, 2nd has requested Bank assistance to complement the activities of these
agencies.  Preparations to bring a Family Welfare Project to the Executive
Directors are well advanced.
250.      Sugar exports are likely to remain the Dominican Republic's principal
source of foreign exchange earnings in the foreseeable future. The State Sugar
Enterprise, which is responsible for some 60 percent of the country's sugar
output, is considering, with the assistance of Bank staff, a project designed
to increase field and factory productivity. Implementation of this project would
assist the Dominican Republic to maintain its competitive position in the
world sugar market and to make more effective use of its limited lend resources.
The Government and the Bank are also discussing the possibility of a second
livestock project.
26.       The U. S. Government has in the past been the Dominican Republic's
major source of external finnncing, mainly for budget support and for projects
in agriculture, education, health, and for industrial credit. However, as noted
above, this support has been declining sharply.   The IDB has been active in
power, irrigstion, water and sewerage, industrial and agricultural credit, and
higher education and has made one loan for ports development. iuture lending by
AID is expected to be concentrated in health. agriculture and rural develop-
ment, while IDB expects to continue lending in the sectors in which it has been
active in the past.

27.       The Bank Group's share in the Dominican Republic's publicly-guaranteed
external debt outstanding and disbursed, amounted to 11 percent at the end of
1975.  The Bank Group's share of public external debt service was 11 percent.
Its share in the Dominican Republicls external debt and debt service is likely
to remain below 15 percent by the end of the 1970's. The service of public exter-
nal debt in 1975 was equivalent to about 3.6 percent of foreign exchange earnings,
i.e., exports of goods and non-factor services plus transfer receipts. Though some
increase in this ratio can be expected, it should not exceed 10 percent in the
early 1980's, provided the Government's present policy of restricting its
borrowing on cammercial terms is continued.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Main Characteristics
28.       The Dominican Republic occupies the eastern two-thirds of the island
of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti. Its territorry is crossed by low
mountain ranges with fertile valleys in between.
29.       Over half the population is employed in agricultui;i..  The bulk of the
population is located in three areas: in the capital, Santo lhomingo, in the south;
in the agriculturally rich Cibao Valley which runs parallel to the north coast,
and in the eastern region, where most of the sugar cane is grown.



- 8 -
30.       Because of the relatively small size of Uhe country and its economic
structure, internal transport distances are short. The main exports -- sugar
and ferronickel -- are produced near ports and normally require hauls of less
than 100 km.   Domestic trade is mainly in agricultural products from the Cibao
Valley, and in industrial products and imports from Santo Domingo; their average
haul distance is about 125 km.   There is little or no commercial traffic with
neighboring Haiti. Because hauls are over relatively short distances, road trans-
port, is the most widely used mode, accountirng for about 95 percent of tot"1.
internal transport of passengers and goods.
31.       Railway transport accounts for 4 percent of domestic freight traffic
and an insignificant proportion of passenger movement. The Government owns and
operates a 112 km railway in the northeast which transports mostly agricultural
products; the remainder of the small rail network is owned by the sugar companies
and is generallly in poor condition. Airlines transport 4 percent of all
domestic passengers and 1 percent of total freight. There are 16 local
airports in service, in addition to an international airport. Coastal
shipping is negligible.
32.       International air traffic is through the modern Las Americas airport
near Santo Domingo, which is now equipped to handle jumbo jets and to service
aircraft. In order to handle an expected increase in tourist traffic to the
north coast, a second international airport is being built under the Bank-financed
Puerto Plata Tourism Project (1051-DO). About 90 percent of the volume of mer-
chandise imports and 20 percent of merchandise exports pass through Santo Domingo,
which has three harbors. Another 45 percent of merchandise exports pass
through Pedernales, in the southwest near the frontier with Haiti, a port special-
izing in mineral exports; and the rest is mainly exported through Puerto Plata on
the north coast.
33.       The major producing areas of the country have access by road, and
the transport system does not constitute a serious bottleneck to the economic
development of the Republic, provided it is not allowed to deteriorate. However,
the productivity of ports in the area of Santo Domingo could be improved;
some major roads are in poor condition, and the coimunications network in the
northwestern region is inadequate. Public expenditures in transport, which
reached 19.2 percent of Central Government expenditures in 1971, have declined in
importance and are eBtimated to have accounted for 8 percent of expenditures in
1974. Amounts spent on highway maintenance have been inadequate and additional
attention will have to be given to it.
Transport Administration and Policies
34.       Several Government agencies have responsibilities over various facets
of transport. Their functions are not clearly defined, there are overlapping
responsibilities and there is little coordination among them. Most agencies
with responsibilities in transport have inadequate budgets and insufficient
technical staff. In addition, traPsport priorities and policies are not clearly
defined. Investment projects, which are normally financed with funds controlled
by the Presidency, are selected without reference to a national transport
scheme and their economic priority is not always clearly established.

35.       To improve planning and rationalize investment decisions in the
transport sector and to impiove coordination in the administration of the various
modes, a transport sector study will be prepared with IDB financing. At the
Government's request, the Bank has commented on the consultant's terms of reference.
The IDB is in agreement with the Bank's suggestions. The Government has agreed
to carry out the transport sector study by December 31, 1977 along the lines
agreed with the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
The Highways Subsector
36.       There are approximately 10,700 km  of highways in the Dominican
Republic, and road communication is adequate throughout most of the country. About
half the highway network was originally paved and about one-third are secondary
gravel and improved earth roads. The main population and production centers are
joined by four highways, which total 540 km., all starting from Santo Domingo.
The most important is the Duarte Highway, which crosses the Cibeo Valley and
links Santo Domingo in the south to Santiago, the country's second largest city,
in the north. The network is satisfactory, except in the northwest region.
Thus, the construction of additional highways at present is not of high priority,
although the rehabilitation and reconstruction of certain existing highways,
which have been allowed to deteriorate, requires urgent attention.
37.       Traffic counts over the 1968-1973 period suggest an average traffic
increase of 12 percent per annum. This conclusion is supported by data on the
growth of fuel consumption and road vehicle purchases. Largely as a result of the
structure of customs duties, which favor light vehicles over medium-size
trucks and buses, the vehicle fleet, which reached 94,000 units in 1974, includes
a large proportion of small pick-ups and vans, comparatively few trucks, and
even fewer buses. Cars, taxis, and light vehicles represent 85 percent of the
traffic in the main highways, which results in traffic congestion and artificially
creates the need to enlarge the main highways. The previously mentioned trans-
port sector study (see paragraph 35 above) is expected to recommend means by
which the efficiency of highway use could be improved.
Highway Acdminiistration
38.       The Government agency which is principally responsible for highway
construction and administration is the Secretariat of State for Public Works
and Communications (Secretaria de Estado de Obras Pu'blicas y Comunicaciones -
SEOPC). The SEOPC is divided into two loosely defined Sub-Secretariats. One
is responsible for programming, planning, designing, building, and maintaining
primary and secondary roads, as well as for maintenance of some ports and air-
ports. Another Sub-Secretariat is responsible for highway transit regulation,
for postal services and telecommunications and for administration of the small
public railways system. The General Directorate of Rural Roads, a subdivision
of SEOPC which is funded directly by the Presidency, is responsible for the
administration of' local roads.
39.       The consultants who assisted in the preparation of the proposed pro-
ject reviewed highway administration and made several recommendations on SEOPC's
organization. The consultant's recommendations on internal SEOPC practices --



- 10 -
such as the reorganization of the Secretariat along functional lines --
have been implemented during the preparation of the proposed Project. However,
those recommendations which have implications on the functions of other Govern-
ment agencies involved in transport administration will only be taken into
account when the conclusions of the IDB financed inter-sectoral transport
study become available.
Highway Construction
40.       SEOPC has been responsible for preparing the final design for all
primary and secondary roads and f'or supervising their construction. Up to
about five years ago, detailed engineering was inadequate and construction
supervision insufficient. Initial construction problems have increased the
maintenance requirements, and some roads must be reconstructed or rehabilitated
before routine maintenance can be effectively carried out. During the past live
years, however, the quality of construction has improved substantially:
acceptable detailed engineering is now being prepared and acceptable geometric
standards are used. Improved supervision has also resulted in better construction.
41.       Most road construction work has been carried out by local firms of
which the larger ones are associated with international firms. The total
capacity of the contracting industry is about RD$40 million per year, but only
three or four firms, all of which have international affili^tions, are capable
of undertaking works of up to RD$7.0 million per year. Contracts have normally
been awarded by the Office of the Presidency without competitive bidding and at a
price determined by SEOPC.
Highway Maintenance
42.       The m?jority of the Republic's highways suffer from either complete
lDck of' maintenance or lack of proper maintenance. Equipment and spare parts and
a well defined maintenance program are lacking; accounting of field and workshop
maintenence costs are inadequate. Although SEOPC's budget expenditure for
routine ma-intenance is below requirements, a redefinition of procedures and the
rehabilitation of workshops are needed before maintenance expenditures can be
substantiplly increased to good effect.
L3.       To carry out maintenance work, the Government has been employing a
large number of people, part-time and at low wages, rather than fewer people
with higher qualifications and pay. While this policy msy be justified in the
light o,' high rates of unemployment among unskilled workers in the Dominican
Republic, the large labor force (about 7,000 full and part-time workers) working
on maintenance has not been effectively employed. Management has been weak and
proper work procedures and standards have been lacking.
bL0       The heterogeneous maintenance equipment fleet has not itself been
adequately maintained, and about three quarters of the fleet is old, out of order
and i, need of replpcement. Workshops have been neglected and cannot adequately
hnndle normal equipment maintenqnce. The proposed Project aims primarily at
addressing the problems associated with highway maintenance described above by
financing a technical assistance program (designed to improve maintenance
practices and procedures) and the necessary equipment and spare parts.



SECTION IV - THE PRJWECT
45.       In 1970, the Government requested that the Bank Group consider
financing a highway project and, after a project identification mission visited
the Dominican Republic early in 1971, it was agreed with the Government that
a highway maintenance, rehabilitation, and administration study should be pre-
pared. UNDP granted US$400,000 for the preparation of such a study, for which
the Bank was named Executing Agency. The study, which serves as the basis for
the proposed Project, was carried out by Lamarre Valois International (LVI) of
Canada.
L6.      Bank missions visited the Dominican lRepublic in June-July 19h7 to
appraise a project on the basis of the LVI study, and again in November 1974
to update cost data. The scope of the Project was subsequently substantially
modified as a result of the Government's decision to limit its request for
Bank financing to the urgent maintenance program and the reconstruction of one
key road. A post-appraisal mission visited the Dominican Republic in March
1976 to redefine the civil works component of the Project. A report entitled
"Appraisal of a Rood Maintenance and Reconstruction Project" (No. 1216-DO),
dated June 21, 1976 is being distributed separately. The matin features of the
lonn and Project are summarized in Annex III. Loan negotiations were held in
Washington, from May 17 to May 21, 1976.  The Dominican negotiating team was
led by Mr. Manuel Alsinn Puello, Secretary- of Public Works and Communications.
Project Objectives and Description
47.       The proposed Project would be the first financed by the Bank in
the transport sector in the Dominican Republic. Its main objective is to
bring about an improvement in highway maintenance procedures and planning. The
Project would consist of the following:
(A) Reconstruction
(i)  Reconstruction of the 19 Im Puente Camu-San Francisco de
Macoris Road. The road is heavily travelled and feeds into
the main trunk road from Santo Domingo to Santiago.
(ii)  Rehabilitation, widening or reconstruction of bridges on the
Puente Camu-San Francisco de Macoris Road.
(B) A road maintenance program, including:
(i) purchase of highway maintenance equipment, workshop tools
and equipment;
(ii) Purchase of spare parts;



- 12 -
(iii) Rehabilitation and reconstruction of workshops;
(iv) Improvement of maintenance procedures and planning.
(C)  Provision of consulting services for:
(i)  Supervision of the reconstruction of the Puente Carru-San
Fra.ncisco de Macorl-s Road;
(ii)  Technical assistance to implement the maintenarncc program.
48.        The Project contains consulting services for construction s'1pervision
and to provide technical assistance for the maintenance program.   It is estina-
ted that 100 man-months of consulting services will be required for construction
surervision.  The estimated total cost of these consultant services is USS2K'CCC
oran average cost of US$2,O0C per man-month. In the case ol the technical
assistance for maintenance, it is expected that 8C man-months of consulting
services will be required. The estimated totol cost of these consultant ser-
vices is US16C0,CCOCor an average cost of US$7,500 per man-month.  The cost
of maintenance consultants is higher than that for supervision becauFe of the
snecializeq nature of this work.
4 0.       The bridge works included in the Puente Camu-San Frencisco de Macoris
Roa2 will be carried out without Bank financin;g.  The Government has agreed to
send to the Bank the design and specifications of such bridges (which will be
consistent with the design standards of the road) before disbursements are made
for the works on the road (dreft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, Paragrnph i~ (b)).
The Government also agreed to complete the bridge works by the time the road
is completed (dreFt Loan Agreement, Section 3.06).
>C.       iIew maintenance equipment and equipment spares to rehabilit-te use-
ful units now in the fleet will be acquired tc bring the mTintenance fleet to
an -cceptable level. A list of maintenaince equipment and workshop tools and
equipment has been agreed with the Government.  F'urther, the Government has
af reed sc provide evidence of satisfactory progress on the construction of the
Santiego workshop and to rehabilitete or reconstruct the other workshops
included in the Froject before any disbursements are made for mrintenance equip-
ment (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, 1-aragraph 1 (c)).
The irrrovements in hia,h.Yray m:int,en::rice procedures to be imnlemented
under the Prciject are based on the recomrmendaviorn., Ynk: bG,- the conn,c  ts (LVTI).
Te ½overrnennT would hire snecialist consultants who will   ss±st it i   rn imp'e-
mentin- these recormendcJations on highway maintenance procedures, and would
*asFi:n comrp,tent coiunterpart, staff to work with the specialist conrm.tant9 (draft
L)ani --rperent, Section 3.0 2 (b) and (c))>  Lhe LVJI study indic?.ted that a cause
o. ;-r-iaY deericration is that vehicle axle lods are e.cessive.    Several
w-Zi1-'r- st^tions exist on the main highwa- s and, al "hou1- tri,,ks are Jnsr;ectcd



- 13 -
for compliance with total vehicle weight requirements, axle loads and
vehicle dimensions are not verified because present regulations do not con-
tain clear maximum limits. The Government has agreed to enact regulations
on maximum vehicle axle loads and vehicle dimensions, not later than December
31, 1976, and to enforce such regulations (draft Loan Agreement, Section
4.04 (b)).
52.       The Government has also agreed on the adoption of specific nainte-
nance measures. First, it will limit recruitment of additional staff for
highway maintenance with the exception of staft which cannot De replaced by train-
ing existing employees, until the optimum size of the labor force has been
established. Second, the Government will determine by July 31, 1977 the proper
size and composition of the labor force and equipment fleet for maintenance, and
will take measures to achieve the desired maintenance strength shortly there-
after.  Third, the Goverrment has agreed-that it will establish a maintenance
budget which will take into account the labor and equipment needs determined
with the assistance of the consultants. It will initially establish, starting 2n
1977, an annual budget for routine maintenence at least US.C.G millicn which
will be revised when the specialist consultants' recommendations become available
(draft Loan Agreement, Sections h.CL (b) and b.C5).
Project Execution
53.       The Project would take about three years to complete.   It would be
carried out by SEOPC with the assistance of consultants. Specialized consul-
tants, acceptable to the Bank, would provide technical assistance in accordance
with terms of reference agreed with the Bank to implement the maintenance prog-
ram, and supervise construction of the Puente Camu-San Francisco de Macoris Road.
The Government has agreed to hire the maintenance consultants as a condition of
effectiveness for the loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.01).
Project Costs and Financing
54.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$8.2 million includ-
ing contingencies, of which US$5.3 million or 65 percent represents the foreign
exchange component. The proposed loan of US$5.0 million would finance the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the Project excepting those of the bridge
works to be carried out in the Puente Camu-San Francisco de Macoris Road and
off the repair of the maintenance workshops, which may be carried out by force
account. The Project costs not financed by the Bank loan -- US$3.2 million --
would be financed by the Government.
Procurement
55.       Contracts for civil works financed under the loan would be awarded
after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Bidders would be required to prequalify.
56.       Maintenance equipment, equipment spares, and workshop tools and
equipment would be procured after international competitive bidding in accor-
dance with Bank guidelines, except that contracts for spare parts may be awarded



through direct negotiations with local spare part dealers under procedures
acceptable to the Bank, provided that the value of the spare parts so procured
does not exceed US$200,000 and that the purchase of individual packages of
spares valued at more than US$10,000 would be subject to Bank approval. Pur-
chases from local dealers would encourage the local availability of spare parts
for maintenance and also ensure that the Goverrnment does not have to purchase
unneeded spares. Consultants would be selected in accordance with normal Bank
procedures.
Disbursonents
57.       Disbursenents for civil works financed under the loan would be made
on the basis of 58 percent of the total expenditures representing the estimated
foreign exchange component. Disbursements for the maintenance equipment and
workshop tools and equipment would be made against the full foreign exchange
cost. For-spare parts purchased locally, disbursements would be made against
85 percent of total costs which has been estimated to represent the foreign
exchange component of such equipment. Disbursements for consulting services
would be made against 63 percent of total expenditures, representing the aver-
age estimated foreign exchange component of such services.
;conoru c Justification
58.       The overall economic return of the Project is 24 percent.   The
economic return for reconstructing the Puente Camu-San Francisco de Macoris
Road -- which accounts for 34 percent of Project costs excluding price contin-
gencies -- is 29 percent. A sensitivity analysis indicates that if construction
costs increase by 25 percent and traffic is 50 percent lower that forecast, the
economic rate of return would still be 19 percent.
59.       The economic return for the maintenance program -- which represents 5c
percert ol Project costs excluding price contingencies -- is estimated at 20 percent.
Because the Bank's knowledge of actual road conditions and traffic is limited
to some 2,000 Ian of the 10,700 km of the network, only a rough estimate of
the potential savings accruing from improved maintenance was possible. The
analysis assumes a 10 percent saving on fuel which will result from improved
surface conditions. Quantified costs include the investment for maintenance
equipment, equipment spares, workshop tools and equipment, plus the annual
costs for maintenance, estimated for this purpose to be about US$6.0 million.
Consulting services are considered justified since they will assist in bringing
about reforms that will increase efficiency in highway maintenance planning
and adninistration, and in the necessary improvement and maintenance of the
highway network.
60.       In addition, there are other benefits which could not be quantified
because of lack of data. Of these, the most important will be a reduction in
the future need for investments in road reconstruction. Indirect socip! benefits
are also likely to result from the Project. Improved maintenpnce will make many
roads usable under all weather conditions, thereby providing the rural population
with mo-re reliable access to urban facilities (such as hospital services).



61.       There are no special risks associated with the proposed Project.
PART V - LSGAL INSTRUMENTS &ID AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Dominican Republic and the Bank,
the Report of the Commrittee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, 2nd the text cf the draft Resolution approving the pro-
posed loen are being distributed to the Executive Directors sep2rately.    Fea-
tures of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to in paragraphs
35 and 49 through 53. A special condition of eff'ectiveness is thpt the consul-
tants which will assist in implementing the road maintenance program have been
employed (draf't Loan Agreement, Section 5.C1). In addition, two conditions of
disbursement have been established: (a) no disbursements will be made for the
works on the Puente Camu-San Francisco de l'4acoris Road until the design for the
necessary reconstruction of the bridges on thct road has been sent to the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, Paragraph a (b); and (b) no disbursements will
be made for maintenance equipment until evidence has been furnished to the
Bank th.t there is satisf'actory progress on the construction of the Santiago
workshop and until the other workshops included in the Project have been rehabili-
tated or recorstructed (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, Paragraph L (c)).
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and with the established criteria for Third Wviindow
loans.
PART VI - RECONMENDATION
64.       I recommend the1t the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 2
Credit No. 225:     Education Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of February 18,
1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 17, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Project is about nine months behind schedule, due principally
to staff changes in the Ministry of Education and shortage of counterpart funds
which disrupted construction work. Adequate local counterpart funds have now
been allocated. Construction work of the remaining five project schools is
progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed before the end of
1976. Procurement of furniture and equipment for the project schools and the
technical assistance and fellowship programs have been completed. The loan
should be fully disbursed by the new Closing Date of December 31, 1976.
Credit No. 245:     Livestock Development Project; US$5.0 Million Credit of
May 19, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: October 15, 1971;
Closing Date: December _1, 1976
Sub-loan funds were fully committed in August 1975, about eight
months later than anticipated. Delays resulted from a downturn in lending
activity during the election year of 1974. Disbursements are expected to be
completed by the end of 1976. Preliminary indications are that significant
productivity increases have been achieved as a result of the Project and a
survey is to be initiated soon to collect data on the impact of the Project
in a systematic manner. Results of pasture trials carried out under the
Project are to be analyzed during the first half of 1976. A study of the
dairy processing industry financed under the loan is being evaluated.
Credit No. 352:     Yaque del Norte Irrigation; US$13.0 Million Credit of
January 17, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: January 2, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Parallel financing for the Project is being provided by 1DB. The
selection of supervising consultants was the main cause for delays in effec-
tiveness. The consultants have completed final designs and tender documents
for the works to be constructed under the first contract, which will be
financed by IDB. The schedule for signature of the first construction con-
tract is contingent on IDB authorization. This authorization will depend on
IDB's interpretation of a provision in its loan contract whereby rights-of-way
must be acquired prior to recuestLr.g bi ds.  It- hns now beer. estimated thst
the rights of way wcuId be acquired by e2rly 1?77.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balance evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

and in the meantime, the process of prequalification, invitation to bid,
and negotiation of a contract would be completed. A special office for land
acquisition and settlement has been established in the project area which
should facilitate project execution.
Loan No. 1051:      Puerto Plata Tourism Project; US$21.0 Million of
November 6, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: November 7, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Site preparation works which were behind schedule have recently
resumed and it is anticipated that the lost time will be recovered. Detailed
engineering studies and preparation of bidding documents for all Project com-
ponents are progressing.
Loan No. 1142:      Second Education Project; US$8.0 Million Loan of
July 17, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: October o, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Architectural designs for project agricultural and vocational
training institutions are being reviewed and construction is expected to
begin in August 1976. Equipment bid proposals for existing secondary schools
are under review. A draft law for the national vocational training scheme
has been prepared with technical assistance from ILO.

and equipment would be procured after international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines, except that con-
tracts for spare parts may be awarded through direct negotia-
tions with local spare part dealers under procedures acceptable
to the Bank, provided that the value of the spare parts so
procured does not exceed US$200,000 and that the purchase of
individual packages of spares valued at more than US$10,000
