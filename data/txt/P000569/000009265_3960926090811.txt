MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
FOR A PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loar. to the People's Republic  of
the Congo for  an amount of  US$15.2 million is  submitted for approval.   The
proposed loan would be payable over 17 years including 4 years of grace, at
the standard variable rate and help finance a project of institutional support
for implementation of Congo's program  of public enterprise (PE) reform.   The
proposed loan would also finance essential studies and short-term advisory
services to the structural adjustment program.
2.        Background.  There  are  over 90  public  enterprises (PEs)  in  all
sectors  including  utilities,   transport,  manufacturing,  agriculture   and
services,  employing   about  35,000   workers.   PE   performance  has   been
characterized by low productivity, high losses, rising debt burden and growing
illiquidity with a concurrent burden on public finances and on the balance of
payments situation and with a negative effect on the country's economic
growth. The main reasons for such a poor performance include: lack of
financial and economic viability, unclear objectives, lack of financial
discip'z.ne, overinvestment, inappropriate macroeconomic policies,  unwarranted
monopolies ard poor pricing policies, overstaffing, poor enterprise management
and  deficiencies   in  the   legal   and  institutional   framework.    These
inefficiencies have been permitted to persist for a long period of time
because of the availability of oil wealth but cannot be tolerated any longer
in face of the sharp drop in the Congo's petroleum revenues.
3.        To address  these  issues,  the Government  has  adopted,  in  close
consultation with the Bank, a detailed action plan for comprehensive PE reform
as a major component of its Structural Adjustment Program to be supported
under a separate loan. PE reform will start a program to rehabilitate key
public enterprises, rationalize the sector's size through privatization and
liquidation, launch the financial restructuring of the sector through debt
settlement and measures to instill financial discipline, liberalize the
economic  environment  in which  PEs   operate  to  promote  efficiency   and
competition, and enhance PE autonomy and acco'intability through legal and
institutional reforms.   Other  measures  designed to  improve  the  country's
macroeconomic management and to promote the non-oil productive sectors will
also be  taken  under  the Structural  Adjustment  Program.   Preparation  and
implementation of these macroeconomic measures are being assisted by the
Bank's Second Technical Assistance project (Ln2753-COB).
4.        Project Obiectives.  The main objective is to facilitate formulation
and implementation of the Governmer.t's Structural Adjustment Program by the
Interministerial Steering Group, which is charged with responsibility for the
overall program, with a special focus on the PE sector. Assistance will be
provided to the Steering Group's Secretariat (composed of high level civil
servants) which will coordinate the project activities and to four key
enterprises which are  being rehabilitated.   The project will  also serve  to



- 2 -
strengthen the Government's ability to monitor PEs and devise institutional
and financial policies  for the sector.   An additional objective  is to  help
Government elaborate further necessary macroeconomic and sectoral reforms to
be implemented in the medium-term and provide additional support needed for
implementation.
5.        Project  Description.   The  proposed   project  would  assist   the
Government in acquiring the necessary technical and administrative capacity to
implement PE reforms and to improve PE management by: (a) support to a PE
technical unit in the Prime Minister's Office serving the Steering Group's
Secretariat that will coordinate the overall reform program (a resident PE
advisor, others short-term advisors, plus vehicles, equipment, audits and
operating support); (b) short-term consultant services for implementation of
PE reform measures, particularly for PE liquidation and privatization, reform
of the banking sector, preparation of staff reduction plans, and preparation
of financial agreements between PEs and Government; (c) support for a
management training program; (d) auditing and accounting assistance; (e)
advisory and consultant services to improve management and restructure several
key enterprises--ONPT, SNDE, HYDRO-CONGO and ATC--according to their agreed
action plans; and (f) consultant services for other critical structural
adjustment tasks as needed to supplement resources available under the ongoing
Second Technical Assistance project. Annual work programs will be established
for the overall execution of the project, and the individual PE rehabilitation
plans in agreement with the Bank. The project, to be carried out over five
years, is estimated to cost US$20.8 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component  of  US$16.1  million  (772).   Provision  for  retroactive
financing totalling US$2.0 million will be included to cover technical
assistance to ONPT (US$490,000) and SNDE (US$400,000) as well as enterprise
audits (US$1 million) and assistance for PE liquidation and privatization
(US$110,000). A PPF of US$1 million extended to ONPT to prepare its
rehabilitation plan, which is being supported under the PE reform program,
will be refinanced.   'Caisse Centrale  de Cooperation  Economiquen of  France
(CCCE) will provide cofinancing, amounting to US$1.2 million, for advisory
services to the PE technical unit  and studies of PE personnel management.   A
breakdown of costs and  the financing plan are  shown in Schedule A.   Amounts
and methods  of procurement  and disbursements  are shown  in Schedule  B.   A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Congo  are given in Schedules  C and D respectively.   Since
there is no separate staff appraisal report, more detailed information on the
proposed project is provided in Annex 1. The President's Report for the
accompanying Structural Adjustment Loan is No. P-4544-COB, dated -         1 987.
6.        Rationale for Bank  Involvement.  This project  is essential to  the
Bank's strategy to help the Congo carry out a structural adjustment program
with a particular emphasis on the public enterprise sector. In addition, the
project is designed to strengthen the Congo's institutional capacity in
monitoring the PE sector and in managing enterprises, central to achieving
durable change in the Congo. Starting in 1985, the Bank took a leading role
in helping Government to formulate its medium-term adjustment strategy.
Moreover, the Bank has long supported several of the key enterprises included
in the program and has a base of knowledge on these institutions and their



policy environLent.    The  Bank's continued  involvement  is also  needed  to
coordinate and to attract further co-financing for PE rehabilitation.
7.        Actions Agreed.  The Government has agreed that: (a) a PE  Technical
Unit serving the Steering Group's Secretariat will be established and
adequately staffed before effectiveness; (b) a management training program
will be carried out under CENAGES; (c) a comprehensive review of the legal and
institutional framework  will  be  carried  out to  promote  PE  autonomy  and
accountability by December 1988; (d) annual financial agreements will be
reached between  Government and  each key  PE by  December of  each year;  (e)
annual work  programs  for  the  overall execution  of  the  project  and  the
concerned enterprises to be rehabilitated will be prepared and approved by the
Bank by December of each year; agreement on the first twelve-months' programs
will be a condition of effectiveness; (f) annual audits and project monitoring
procedures will be carried out and a special account established; (g) studies
to be undertaken and service of advisors and consultants will be done
according to agreed terms of reference and obtained according to Bank
guidelines; and (h) prior agreement would be sought on the use of funds
available for structural adjustment studies. An additional condition of
effectiveness is that the Structural Adjustment Loan is also effective.
8.        Justification.  The project  will support a  far reaching PE  reform
program as a  key element  of the  Congo's structural  adjustment effort.   In
addition to the immediate benefits related to the implementation of those
reforms, a lasting institutional basis for better management of the PE sector
is expected to be derived from the project. The main benefits are: (a)
enhanced  Government   and   PE   capabilities  for   timely   and   effective
implementation of sustainable PE reform; (b) improved efficiency in Government
supervision of the sector; (c) improved management and financial performance
of individual PEs; and (d) development of the basis for designing and
implementing future adjustment measures.
9.        Risks.  The main  risks are  that the  economic crisis  and lack  of
resources may prevent the full implementation of the program. In addition,
the  Government's  commitment  might  falter  if  political  support  is   not
maintaired and the Government may not develop adequately the technical
capacity needed for implementation. These risks, however, are reduced by: (a)
the strong commitment shown thus far by the international financial community
to  support  Congo's   adjustment;  (b)   a  consensus   approach  with   wide
participation to reform design and implementation; and (c) wide-ranging
technical assistance and advisory support that are being provided by the Bank
and several other multilateral and bilateral donors.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would  comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
A. Project Description
1.        Characteristics and Performance of the Sector.  As described in
the President's Report for the accompanying Structural Adjustment Loan
(P-4544-COB), public enterprises, which have been Government's favored
instrument for development, grew rapidly during the oil boom in the 1970s
and early 1980s. There are now about 90 wholly-owned PEs and mixed
enterprises with majority Government ownership. In addition to the basic
utilities for water (SNDE), electricity (SNE), 1,ort, rail and river
transport (ATC), post and telecommunications (ONPT), PEs are involved in
virtually all sectors, including road and air transport, manufacturing,
marketing boards for exports and imports, petroleum distribution and
refining, forestry, tourism, agriculture and services. In terms of
employment, the PE sector accounts for over 20 percent (35,UO0) of total
modern sector employment (roughly 185,000) with the reminder employed in
government administration (70,000) and the private sector (80,000). Seven
key enterprises -- the public utilities (SNE, SNDE, ATC, ONPT), Hydro-Congo
(petroleum distribution), CORAW (petroleum refinery) and SUCO (sugar
refinery) -- dominate the sector, representing about half of total
revenues, employment and value-added. The 30 largest PEs, furthermore,
account for over 90 percent of sector revenue, value-added and employment.
2.        The performance rf the PE sector has been characterized by low
productivity, high losses, rising debt burden and growing illiquidity with
a concurrent burden on public finances and on the balance of payment
situation and with a negative effect on the country's economic growth.
Despite rapid revenue growth, losses (before subsidies) escalated from CFAF
8 billion in 1981 to CPAF 25 billion in 1985. The biggest losses in 1985
were encountered by SUGO (CFAF 3.0 billion), ATC (CFAF 1.9 billion),
OFNACOM (CFAF 4.2 billion); CIDOLOU (CFAF 2.0 billion) and SCBO (CFAF 2.3
billion). Government subsidies peaked in 1982 (CFAF 12.5 billion) but have
been reduced in the last three years to about CFAF 6.8 billion (US$21
million) annually as a result of the Government's liquidity crisis.
3.        Main Difficulties.  The difficulties facing the Congo's PE
sector, exacerbated by the availability of oil wealth which permitted
inefficiencies to persist for a long period of time, are: (a) Size and
viability of the sector. Many PEs have been created without adequate
analysis of their viability and have operated with ill-defined objectives,
inadequate infrastructure, and unsuitable capital equipment. Furthermore,
they have been required to undertake uneconomic investments or provide
non-viable services without adequate compensation from the Government; (b)
Lack of financial discipline. The lack of timely payments on the part of
PEs and the Government has resulted in a large cross-debt situation which
exacerbates the illiquidity crisis in many PEs. Government is a heavy
debtor to PEs, mainly for public services (water, electricity,
telecommunication and fuel) and its outstanding net debt owed to PEs in
1985 was about CPA? 15 billion; (c) Inappropriate macroeconomic policies.
A poor policy framework and a lack of incentives have discouraged PEs from

ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 7
operating in a commercial manner. Artificially low prices for goods and
extensive import controls were maintained by official policies despite
enterprises losses while wide-ranging monopoly privileges have promoted PE
inefficiency and discouraged private operators. Government's policy to
provide employment to all graduates in the public sector, combined with the
lack of autonomy for PE management to reduce staff, has resul d in
overstaffing estimated at 30 percent of the total PE labor f te, while
qualified and trained personnel is often lacking. Generous collective
bargaining agreements inflated operating costs while good managers were not
adequately rewarded for performance; (d) Institutional weaknesses. While
Government tends to intervene excessively in day-to-day management of PEs,
especially through controls of expenditures and procurement, it is poorly
equipped to set clear targets for PEs, evaluate investments, monitor
performance and supervise the sector's operations. Complex institutional
arrangements under the "trilogie determinante" impose constraints on PE
management by involving the trade unions and the political party in
operational decisions such as personnel appointments and staff discipline;
(e) Poor enterprise management. PE performance has also been impaired by
the lack of qualified personnel including competent managers and of basic
accounting and information systems. This has hindered the development of
enterprise plans, budgets and financial statements, the proper costing of
goods and services, the timely and accurate billing of customers, and
proper maintenance.
4.        Government's Reform Efforts.  As the sector's difficulties became
more prorournced in the early 1980s, Government began a process of reform.
In 1983, the ten most important PEs were targeted for major changes in
their level of managerial autonomy, coupled with the introduction of
performance contracts ("contrats de programme") and reinforcement of its
oversight functions through the National Management Center (CENAGES) and
the Prime Minister's Office. It also created a new agency, the National
Accounting Commission (CNC), to audit PE accounts and to develop accounting
norms and reporting standards, as well as develop local auditing
capabilities. Within the Government's 1985-86 adjustment effort, further
measures toward PE reform were taken: strategic studies of some 80 PEs were
launched to establish a sectorwide classification into PEs to be
rehabilitated, privatized or liquidated and to prepare staff reduction
plans; investments and subsidies were reduced; a PE cross-debt settlement
plan was prepared; and price controls were liberalized.
5.        Building upon these initiatives, the Government has formulated,
in consultation with the Bank, a public enterprise reform program
1987-1989. This reform program includes efforts to: (i) reduce the size of
the sector through liquidation and privatization; (ii) carry out a
financial restructuring exercise to settle PE debts, recapitalize the main
PEs and instill greater financial discipline in the sector; (iii)
rehabilitate seven key PEs (SNE, SNDE, ONPT, ATC, Hydro-Congo, CORAF and
SUCO); (iv) reduce PE overstaffing and improve personnel management
procedures; (v) launch a management training program; (vi) liberalize
pricing policies and abolish monopolies; and (vii) initiate a review of the
legal and institutional framework to enhance PE accountability and

autonomy. These measures will be reinforced by the Bank through the
accompanying Structural Adjustment Loan supported by the proposed project.
6.        Project Description.  The project will provide the necessary
technical skills, advisory services and institutional support for
implementation of the Government's PE reform program. It consists of: (a)
general institutional support to the PE Technical Unit, located in the
Prime Minister's Office, serving the Steering Group's Secretariat as the
key agency responsible for overall coordination of the Project; (b)
short-term consultant services for the timely implementation and monitoring
of Government's reform program; (c) management training for PE and
Government staff; (d) support to the National Accounting Commission (CNC);
(e) technical assistance and advisory services for the rehabilitation of
four of the seven key PEs (SNDE, ATC, ONPT, Bydro-Congo); I/ and (f) funds
for the development of additional macroeconomic and sectoral reform
measures. Each of these components is described below:
(a) General Support to the PE Technical Unit. In order to formulat4
and implement the PE reform, according to a work program set out in
Schedule 1. the project will finance; (a) a resident PE advisor (36
person-months) who will advise the Steering Group in all technical and
policy aspects of the reform and coordinate the work of short-term
consultants; (b) a legal-institutional expert (10 person-months) who will
help review the sector's institutional framework by December 1988; (c) a
financial analyst (12 person-months) who will help Government prepare
financial projections for key PEs and advise on financial issues; and (d)
logistical and operational support including office equipment,
micro-computers, vehicles and other operating expenses. In addition, the
project will include provision for salaries, for two local staff to be
assigned to that unit. Finally, the project will finance annual audits of
the project.
(b) Support for Implementation and Monitoring of Reform Measures.
The project will finance short-term consultant services to: (i) assist in
t. a divestiture effort (20 person-months of an advisor on privatization and
industrial policy, 10 person-months for legal advice for privatization, 10
person-months for investment promotion, 15 person-months for liquidation
advice and/services); (ii) review PE cross-debts (3 person-months); (iii)
monitor the reform of the banking sector and advise in particular on credit
ceilings and regulations (8 person-months); (iv) review PE salary
structures, personnel statutes and management procedures (12
person-months); (v) assist in the preparation of staffing plans in key PEs
(12 person-months); (vi) elaborate financial agreements with key PEs (15
/   As for the three remaining key PEs, assistance to SUCO and to SNE is
provided by CCCE while CORAF is receiving management assistance under
the ongoing management contract with a private company.

Page 4 of 7
person-months); and (vii) develop procedures to evaluate and monitor PE
investments as part of the public investment program (10 person-months).
(c)  Su2port for Establishment of a Training Program.  The project
will finance the preparation (5 person-months) and implementation (35
person-months) of a Management Training Program under CENAGES as well as
needed training materials. The program (outlined in Schedule 2) will
develop in-house training capabilities and provide courses and seminars
aimed at PE management and Government officials responsible for the
monitoring and evaluation of PE performance in core areas such as corporate
planning, financial management, budgeting, internal auditing, management
information systems and personnel administration.
(d) Auditing and Accounting Assistance. The project will finance
assistance to the National Accounting Commission (CNC) to continue its
program of audits of about 20 PEs per year plus training of CNC personnel
(140 person-months). Provision is also made for assistance needed to
prepare an accounting manual (8 person-months) designed to improve
procedures and control in PEs, to facilitate auditing and to train
accountants.
(e) Technical Assistance to the Key PEs. A major component of the
project will be assistance to the Government for implementing the
managerial and organizational reforms for key PEs as follows; (i) SNDE:
The project will finance assistance to prepare a comprehensive
reorganization plan and launch an inventory of customers (18
person-months), and a team of three advisors (financial, technical and
commercial) to help implement the enterprise's rehabilitation program (72
person-months); (ii) ONPT: The project will finance efforts to improve
investment programming, maintenance, auditing and accounting, billing and
personnel management (refinancing of a PPF of US$1 million) and advisors to
assist in the computerization of ONPT's accounting system (20
person-months); to prepare andlor update ONPT's accounts (10
person-months); and continue improvements to ONPT's financial management
and accounting systems (27 person-months). A study on ONPT's eventual
reorganization into separate entities for post, telecommunications, and
financial services will also be financed (3 person-months); (iii) ATC: The
project will support the continuation of the reorganization study including
a tariff review, a study of privatization of ATC's peripheral activities
and preparation of financial projections (14 person-months). Financing of
the design and implementation of decentralized management information,
accounting and personnel systems (90 person-months) will also be provided;
and (iv) Hydro-Congo: The project will finance two advisors (48
person-months) to Hydro-Congo's senior management to assist in the
implementation of its rehabilitation program.
(f) Structural Adjustment Reforms. Funds will be earmarked for
studies and advisory services required to formulate necessary medium-term
policies and sectoral strategies to complement assistance already being
provided under the Second Technical Assistance Project. These funds would
be available to the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Finance and



- 14 -
ANNEX 1
Page 5 of 7
the Debt Management Agency (CCA) to further the adjustment process.
Agreement on the use these funds would be reached by the Steering Group and
approved by the Bank. Activities already identified under this item
include advisory services for preparation of the next round of the Congo's
debt rescheduling. Other activities will be identified as the adjustment
program progresses.
(g) Unallocated. In order to ensure adequate resources to meet
unforeseen needs during implementation, the project includes a provision of
US$800,000 of unallocated funds.
7.        Coordination and Cofinancing with Other Donors.  The project is
designed to help the Government to more effectively implement activities
supported by other donors and to pursue measures initiated under previous
Bank projects. In particular, the project will complement the ongoing and
planned efforts of other donors to rehabilitate specific enterprises such
as SNE, ONPT and ATC by CCCE; SNDE by ADB; SNDE and ONPT by EIB; and SNDE
and ATC by French bilateral assistance. The project will be cofinanced by
CCCE which will finance several sectorwide reform studies as well as the PE
advisor in the Technical Unit. Finally, the training component will
complement the institutional support provided so far to CENAGES by ILO.
B. Project Administration and Implementation
8.        Organization and Management.  As chairman of the Steering Group,
the Prime Minister has the overall responsibility for coordinating the PE
reform program as part of Government's structural adjustment effort. A
Technical Unit will be created in the Prime Minister's Office which will
complement the assistance already being provided under the Second Technical
Assistance Project to support the Steering Group's larger mandate to design
and implement the Government's economic adjustment program. The unit will
thus beniefit from the existing logistical facilities under the ongoing
project. Agreement on the project's work program for the first year will
be a condition of effectiveness. Thereafter, annual work programs will be
approved by the Bank by December of each year.
9.        The unit is to be fully equipped and staffed (two local staff)
under the project. The resident advisor is already in place with CCCE
financing. His terms of reference have been prepared and are acceptable to
both the Bank and CCCE. Terms of reference have also been prepared for the
legallinstitutional expert and the financial analyst. Placed in the Prime
Minister's Office, the advisors will work under the authority of the
Steering Group's Secretariat in the execution of their assignments.
10.       Assistance to the Key PEs.  The specific action plans for
managerial atid organization reform and rehabilitation of SNE, SNDE, ONPT,
ATC, Hydro-Congo and CORAF have been agreed with the Bank under the
Structural Adjustment Program. The Technical Unit will be responsible for
monitoring these programs in close coordination with the management of the
concerned PEs which will have the responsibility for execution in
collaboration with the other donors providing complementary assistance.

ANNEX 1
Page 6 of 7
Each enterprise will establish a small task force to work along with the
Technical Unit in order to formulate and implement its reform program.
Annual work programs for each PE will be agreed to with the Bank by
December of each year; the work pro-rams for the first twelve-months will
be a condition of effectiveness.
11.       Interministerial Coordination.  In carrying out its task, the
Steering Group, including representatives of the Prime Minister's Office,
the Ministry of Plan and the Ministry of Finance, will collaborate with
other ministries, especially the concerned technical ministries, and the
Ministries of Commerce and Labor as well as the PE management, which are
directly responsible for carrying out many aspects of the reform program.
Coordination with these parties is therefore an important part of the
Steering Group's operations which will be facilitated through the creation
of working groups for specific areas.
12.       Implementation Plan.  A summary of the project's key project
activities is presented in Schedule 1 of the Memorandum of the President of
the project. Implementation of the main activities is anticipated to take
about five years counting from the date of Board approval of the loan. The
project is thus expected to be largely completed by the end of 1992 and
finished by September 1994.
13.       Procurement.  The goods and services to be financed under the
project would be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to the
Bank as summarized in Schedule B of the Memorandum of the President of the
project. Training, technical assistance and consultancy services would be
procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Equipment and vehicles
would be purchased through international shopping with at least three
quotations. Expenditures for supplies and maintenance and items of less
than US$20,000 equivalent will be disbursed against statements of
expenditure.
14.       Disbursement.  In line with the average disbursement profile for
Technical Assistance projects in the Western Africa Region, the project is
projected to be disbursed over seven years. However, the Government is
targeting to complete disbursement in a much shorter period.
15.       Revolving Fund.  To expedite implementation, the Government will
establish a Special Account at the central bank as a revolving fund for the
Bank's contribution to the project. This account will be financed with an
initial deposit of CFAF 250 million (US$800,000) from the proceeds of the
proposed loan upon effectiveness and replenished upon receipt of statements
of expenditure giving evidence that expenditures financed out the Special
Account were eligible for financing.
16.       Project Preparation Facility.  A PPF advance of US$1 million was
approved on September 18, 1985, to help prepare ONPT's rehabilitation plan.
Implementation of this plan will now be supported by the project and the
PPF refinanced.

17.       Accounts and Audits.  The Prime Minister's Office will establish
separate accounts to be managed by the Technical Unit, in accordance with
accepted accounting principles, to record all project expenditures and to
maintain records on commitments, reimbursements and the status of project
funds. Agreement has been obtained that independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank will annually audit these accounts in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles and in such details as the Bank may request. Audit
reports will be due six months after the end of the fiscal year.
18.       Reporting and Monitorin .  The Primt Minister's Office will be
required to submit quarterly reports on the progress of project
implementation, and reform progress. In addition, it will prepare an
annual report summarizing progress in all key areas of the reform. At the
completion of the project, it will prepare the project completion report.

TRAINING
1.        The training program is designed to fill the gaps in the skills
required for implementing the PE sector reforms: corporate planning and
objective-setting, performance monitoring and evaluation, financial audit
and control, management information, and related subjects. It will also
strengthen more traditional skills such as general management, accounting
and personnel administration whose weakness has in the past contributed to
poor PE performance. The program is primarily directed at technical and
other middle-level personnel, both in PEs and Government, whose work will
be crucial over the next few years in rationalizing the sector and in
bringing about needed improvements in efficiency of PEs.
2.        The program will also contribute to building up the capability
and experience of the local management institution, CENAGES, which has
received technical assistance from ILO and the Bank's First Technical
Assistance Project. ILO will continue its assistance (two advisors) to
CENAGES to keep support CENAGES' ongoing training efforts.
3.        Over its three-year duration, the program will support the
development of specific courses (5 person-months), training materials, and
the execution of the proposed courses and seminars. Training sessions will
all take place locally, and be managed by CENAGES. It is anticipated that
about 250-3GO weeks equivalent of training will be provided to about 100
PE managers, targeted at the key PEs to be rehabilitated, and selected
government officials. The total cost of the program is about US$960,000
plus contingencies.
