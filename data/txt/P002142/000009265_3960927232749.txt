NIGERIA
REFINERIES REHABILITATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)
Guarantor:             Federal Republic of Nigeria
Amount:                US$27.7 million equivalent
Terms:                 The loan will be made to NNPC at the Bank standard
variable interest rate for 15 years including 3 years
of grace. Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) would
guarantee the loan and NNPC would pay a guarantee fee
to FGN equal to 102 of the Bank interest rate.
Additionally, NNPC would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Project
Description:           The main project objectives are to improve:
(a)    NNPC's institutional approach to preventive
maintenance, decision making on investments and
repairs and rehabilitation of its assets;
(b)    utilization and efficiency of its existing
refineries; and
(c)    monitoring and control of environmental
pollution on account of oil spillage from its
refineries.
The proposed project would comprise for Warri and
Kad ina refineries: (i) waste water treatment; (ii)
condensate recovery system modification; (iii)
laboratory equipment; (iv) workshop on preventive
maintenance, corrosion protection and environmental
protection to be conducted by experienced
professionals; and (v) preparation of engineering
studies to review existing facilities and recommend
medium/long term requirements of the two refineries to
improve their operational efficiencies to international
standards. In addition for the Warri Refinery: (i)
power generating system study; (ii) replacement of fire
water lines; (iii) essential spareparts; and (iv)
instrumentation replacement and for the Kaduna Refinery
inclusion of a data logging computer. There is also a
provision to replenish in the future the stock of
essential spares and materials required for the
satisfactory operation and maintenance of the two
refineries.



- iv -
Project Benefits
and Risks:             The economic benefits from the various project
components are expected from: (i) an increase in the
capacity utilization of the two refineries; (ii)
increases in the general operational efficiency; and
(iii) reducel cost of operation and maintenance. The
improved operation of the refineries would also have a
direct effect on the efficiency of NNPC's
Petrochemicals Phase I investments. Since all items
included in the project are for improving existing
facilities and are well defined in the consultant's
report, no major risk is anticipated in the
implementation of the proposed project. Since the
operation of many of the facilities is essential for
the continuous operation of the refinery, the
rehabilitation work needs to be scheduled to
synchronize with the refinery turn-around program to
the maximum extent possible. There could be some delay
in the completion of some of the items on this account.
The engineering contractor will be asked to prepare a
detailed time schedule taking this aspect into account
which will be monitored during implementation of the
Bank's supervision missions. An added benefit of the
project is that it would pave the ground for future
Bank operations aimed at the overall rationalization of
the petroleum sector in general and NNPC's operations
in particular.

NIGERIA
REFINERIES REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Supply and Dema7'd
1.01     Nigeria has substantial and diversified energy resources, including
oil, natural gas, hydro potential, coal, and fuelwood. Since the first
commercial discovery of oil in 1956, Nigeria ham become one of the world's
leading oil-exporting countries. Proven recoverable oil reserves, onshore
and offshore in the Niger River delta, amount to some 2.2 billion tons and
undiscovered recoverable oil reserves may reach an additional 1.1 billion
tons. Gau reserves are estimated at about 2.4 trillion cubic meters (85
trillion standard cubic feet), about 2.1 billion tons of oil equivalent,
including about 1.2 trillion cubic meters of associated gas (about 1.1
billion tons of oil equivalent). Recoverable undiscovered gas reserves are
estimated to be in the order of 1.6 billion tons of oil equivalent, two-
thirds of which probably would be non-associated gas.
1.02     Nigeria's installed electric power capacity was about 4,000 MW in
1987, primarily in generating plants of the government-owned National
Electric Power Authority (NEPA). A significant amount of captive private
generating capacity also exists, mainly as back-up for NEFA. The country's
substantial hydro resources total about 11,500 MW in technically feasible
potential. Current installed hydro capacity, however, amounts only to about
1,300 MW, with installations totalling an additional 600 MW under
construction. The feasibility of any new hydroelectric power projects of
major size should be evaluated vis-a-vis other potentially cheaper power
sources, particularly gas.
1.03     The most recent estimates of proven, indicated, and inferred coal
reserves range between 270 and 980 million tons which are located in the
upper southeast of the country. Output reached a peak of more than 900,000
tons per year in t + late 1950s. Interrupted completely during the Civi.
War in 1968-69, production never fully recovered and amounted to only
117,000 tons in 1987. While potential consumption and output could total as
much as one million tons, the proper role of coal, if any, vis-a-vis the use
of other energy resources, still needs to be evaluated.
1.04     The main fuels utilized by the country's rural population are
firewood and charcoal, supplemented by crop residues and dung in the dry
Sudan and Sahel regions. While the supply of wood fuels is generally ample
in the forested regions of the south, increasingly severe resource
constraints are being encountered in the dry central and northern regions of
the country.



-2-
1.05     The outlook for use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in Nigeria's
transport sector and in households also appears promising. Nigerian
refineries have the capacity to produce over 350,000 tons per annum (tpa) of
LPG, and possible expansion of basic and cracking capacity could increase
this to about 450,000 tpa. Additional quantities of LPG could also be
extracted from natural gas streams. Current consumption averages 70,000
tpa. Part of it is met by imports because of unreliable supplies from the
refineries. Although the potential market could reach about one million tons
of oil equivalent (toe) per annum over a relatively short period of time, a
substantial amount of the LPG now teing produced at refineries is being
flared because of an inadequate distribution network.
1.06     Total annual energy consumption in Nigeria is estimated at about 20
million toe; commercial energy accounts for about 60 percent of this total.
Petroleum products make up about 70 percent of commercial energy
consumption, while the rest is accounted for by gas (20Z), hydro and coal
(1O2). Electricity consumption, which is low for a country with 105 million
inhabitants, has increased by less than 6 percent per annum between 1980 and
1987, reaching about 7.3 GWh in 1987. Consumption of petroleum products
rose at an annual rate of about 15 percent p.a. from 3.9 million tons in
1976, to over 9.2 million tons in 1982, peaked in 1983 when it reached 9.5
million tons and slowly reduced until 1987, when it reached 8.5 million
tons. Together, gasoline and gas oil account for around 60 percent of total
petroleum consumption in Nigeria; kerosene, mainly used as a household fuel,
accounts for another 22 percent. The Government has come to recognize the
importance of substituting liquid fuels with gas to meet domestic needs of
large-volume power and industry users, whenever technically and economically
feasible. The estimated commercial energy balance is shown in Annex 1-1.
B. Energy Prices
1.07     Inter-fuel prices.  Energy prices in Nigeria are determined by the
Federal Government through parastatal entities such as the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and NEPA. While prices oi gasoline and diesel
are close to their economic costs (see table below), household kerosene, gas
oil prices and electricity tariffs are quite low relative to their border
values. The price of LPG is also low, compared to an FOB price abroad.
Natural gas is the lowest cost fuel on a heat equivalent basis for high
volume uses in urban areas, not considering other advantages it offers as a
clean fuel. At present fuel prices, gas is still competitive with low pour
fuel oil, its major substitute fuel. If gas is to be priced at un-
subsidized levels, and escalated with rising inflation, fuel oil prices need
to be brought closer to their economic value to retain the economic relative
price structure for Nigeria. The same applies to diesel fuel prices, as
diesel is used particularly in private standby electricity generation.
Inter-fuel prices will be reviewed in detail by the Energy sector review
mission scheduled for FY90 (para. 2.09).

1/   Until December 1988, the foreign exchange market (FEN) was a
combination of an auction (fortnightly), and interbank market which
operated in response to supply and demand. The average of FEM rates
in the auctions of September 1988 was US$1 - N4.67. Since the
preparation of this report the Naira has undergone considerable
devaluation. On January 9, 1989, Nigeria moved from the fortnightly
auction system to direct daily sales of official sources of foreign
exchange to the banks, and the exchange rate is now established in the
interbank market. The exchange rate in the second half March 1989 was
about US$1 = N7.5

C. Institutions
1.0      While Nigeria has a predominantly private market economy,
Government institutions and corporations play a dominant role in the
various energy supply sectors. This is particularly true in electricity
and coal, where the Government has a near monopoly through NEPA and the
Nigerian Coal Corporation and, to a slightly lesser degree, in petroleum
marketing. All the three existing domestic refineries, and the one under
construction, are owned and operated by NNPC. Of the eight major petroleum
marketing companies, three (African Petroleum, National and Unipetrol) are
controlled by NNPC. Together they hold a market share of about 34Z for
gasoline, kerosene and gas oil and about 49 percent for other products
(fuel oils, base oils, asphalt). The other five (Agip, Mobil, Texaco,
Total, Elf) are subsidiaries of international oil companies (IOCs) and have
majority ownership by Nigerian nationals (60Z). They hold a market share
of about 43Z for gasoline, kerosene, gas oil and about 512 for other
products. The remaining market share is hela by small independent
companies.  The small LPG market is served fur 751 by eleven major Nigeri
distribution companies, the rest is held by independent companies. The
administration of forest lands is a state r?spon3ibility, with the Federal
Government's Department of Forestry p .ying an advisory, investment-
financing and coordinating role. Given the relative autonomy of the
energy-related agencies for each of the 21 states and their divergent
interests, major decisions on energy matters are diffic!1lt to reach and can
be based on political compromises rather than rational economic criteria.
However, the National Energy Commission, that coordinates all activities in



-4-
the energy sector under the Presidency, has been reactlvated in 1968 and
one may expect that a more coherent energy policy will be formulated in the
future.
1.09     The rapid grewth of Government-owned energy supply organizations
has led to a scarcity of trained personnel, poor operating records,
insufficient maintenance and frequent equipsnt failures. This is
particularly true for organizations such as WPA which are subject to civil
service regulations and wage levels that lag substantially jehind private
sector ones. As a result, many middl* and upper management positions
cannot be filled or are filled vith unqualified personnel, reducing the
overall performance of Government-owned corporations.
1.10     Overall sector planning.  The Office of the Petroleum Ministry was
created to deal with petroleum and gas related issues previously handled
by the Special Advisor. Although the in-house staff and evaluation
capacity of the petroleum ministry is limited, it has access to NNPC staff
for analysis of petroleum issues. It needs strengthening in conjunction
with efforts to enhance the vlanning and evaluation capacity of NNPC.
Also, prooer coordination mechanisms with other agencies operating in the
energy sector need to be set up.
1.11     Institutions in the oil and gas sector.  Oil and gas activities
are governed by the Petroleum Decree of 1969. The Petroleum Ministry is
responsible for policy direction, and the Petroleum Minister is ex-officio
chairman of NNPC. Statutory control of the petroleum industry rests with
the Petroleum Inspectorate's Office, which is now separated from NNPC.
1.12     Oil and gas are produced by joint ventures between the Federal
Government of Niger.a, through NNPC, and several IOCe viz. Shell, Gulf,
Mobil, Agip, Texaco, Elf and Pan Ocean. Companies were granted oil mining
leases, with the Nigerian Government acquiring participations over time
starting with 35 percent in 1973. The present Government equity positions
of 80 percent in the joint venture with Shell, and 60 percent with the rest
were reached in 1979.   The IOCs act as operators in all of these joint
ventures.
1.13     In addition to the joint ventures, NNPC has a production sharing
contract with Ashland on behalf of zhe Federal Government of Nigeria,
whereby it is entitled to 55 to 67 percent of the profit of Ashland's
operations on the level of production. It has also signed service
contracts for oil exploration with Elf, Agip and Nigus Petroleum Corp.,
under which the companies are required to carry out, at their own expense,
oil exploration, development and production in specific allocated blocks
for a period of time. The contracts establish that, where oil is found in
commercial quantity, such oil irrevocably vests on the Federal Government
of Nigeria, but the contractors are entitled to the payment of an agreed
fee per barrel produced. No petroleum is being produced yet from the
service contract areas.
1.14     The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  In its early
years, NNPC mainly oversaw state participation in the producing and
marketing oil companies. However, in recent years, it has taken a more
active role in exploration, refining and marketing. The corporation has
been decentralized and commercialized as of June 1, 1988 and individual
units have been given more autonomy, as discussed in chapter III. The
organization chart for NNPC is shown in Annex 1-2.



II. PSTROLEUM SUBSECTOR
A. Resourca Base
2.01     Proven recoverable crude oil reserves on land and offshore in the
Niger River Delta were about 2.2 billion tons. Undiscorored, recoverable
oil reseree ar* estimated to be about 1.1 billion tons. The current
maximum production capacity is said to be about 110 million tpa (2 million
barrels per day), but production would have to start declining in the early
1990. if it took place at maximum capacity. However, this is not the case,
as production in the recent years was 547.1 million barrels (Mbb) in 1985,
534.2 Mbb in 1986 and 483.34 Mbb in 1987 (73.4, 71.7 and 64.9 million tons
respectively), as a result of OPEC quota restrictions. Such low rates of
production, if maintained, would extend the reserve life so that the
decline would not set in before the late 1990s.
B. Refining Facilities
2.02     There are three refineries operating in Nigeria, at Port Harcourt,
Warri, and Kaduna -- all owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company
(NNPC). They have a combined crude distillation capacity of 295,000 bpsd
(13 million tpa), but only 180,000 bpsd are effective because of
operational problems partly connected with power generation and other
support facilities in the Warri refinery and lack of demand for lube oil in
the Kaduna refinery. A fourth refinery with 120,000 bpsd capacity at Port
Harcourt was commissioned in March 1989 mainly for the export market. The
project is financed by Nigerian funds and suppliers' credits and will be
commissioned in the beginning of 1989. In order to materialize the export
of products from Port Harcourt, a 120 km product pipeline to Bonny will be
required. NNPC has not yet taken a decision in this matter.
C. Demand for Petroleum Products
2.03     There is a considerable difference between the consumption forecasts
of petroleum products made in 1982 and the actual consumption (1982-87), and
forecasts up to 1993. Whereas it was estimated in 1982 that the demand for
petroleum products would increase at an average annual rate of 7.62 between
1981 and 1995 (27.52 for LPG, 10.6Z for fuel and 6.7Z for the other
products), the variation in actual consumption was -1.52, on average annual
rate from 1982 to 1987 [+12.0? for LPG, +2.3Z for fuel oil, -2.32 for
gasoline, +8.4Z for household kerosene, -8.5? for diesel] and the forecast is
still a negative growth at -1.4? on average annual rate from 1987 to 1993
[+11.4Z for LPG, -2.8? for fuel oil, -3.8? for gasoline, +1.22 for household
kerosene, +1.5Z for diesel]. The 1982 forecasts were based on expected snarp
reductions of growth rates, compared to the 18.4? average annual increase
from 1974 to 1981 during the oil boom, but did not anticipate as sharp a
downturn as actually took place. The present forecasts, made by NNPC for its
five-year plan, extrapolate the low-growth trend of the last five known
years, because the Nigerian Government has made the decision to stop
subsidizing domestic consumption, and has increased petroleum prices (by an
average of 182) in April 1988, which will have a marked incidence on
consumption. A summary of petroleum products consumption and future demand
is presented in Annex 2-1.



- 6 -
2.04     The Government and NNPC rightly emphasize the need to increase the
consumption of LPG, as it could displace household kerosene and motor vehicle
fuels. The cause of its present relative scarcity is not only the lack of
storage and transportation facilities, which are certainly obstacles to
increased consumption, but especially the refineries' inefficiency since they
function unevenly and below capacity. An impact of the proposed project, in
the long and medium terms, would be to increase reliability of LPG supplies
to the domestic market. However, gasoline and diesel consumption will slow
down because of the low economic growth. Kerosene consumption has grown at a
91 annual rate over the past five years, because at a subsidized price it was
competitive with woodfuel. Following the recent increase in prices, a short-
term shift towards a larger consumption of woodfuel is expected, that should
be reverted in the future, when supplies of LPG can displace wood fuel
consumption. The potentially large bunker market is still untapped for lack
of an aggressive marketing policy.
D. Petroleum Product Supplies
2.05     Production, imports and exports.  The present output of products
from the three refineries is about 6.1 million tons. In 1987, imports of
refined products were about 5.4 million tons, while exports of refined
products (mainly surplus high-pour fuel oil and some LPG) were 900,000 tons.
Exports of refined products to neighboring countries were small, at about
140,000 tons. The major supplementary import needs are for gasoline,
kerosene and automotive gasoil. In addition, the bulk of the specialty
products and part of lubes and greases have to be imported, in spite of the
Kaduna refinery's capacity to meet domestic demand. By increasing the output
of the two refineries, the proposed project would improve their
profitability. Production from the three refineries and imports pending
commissionning of the fourth refinery are summarized in Annex 2-2.
E. Petroleum Product Distribution and Marketing
2.06     Following the severe shortages of petroleum products in the interior
of the country during 1974 and 1975, the Government decided to embark on the
construction of 3,000 km of pipelines, linking the refineries to storage
terminals (depots) located :n 19 towns, and commissioned most of them in 1980
and 1981. The refineries of Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna are supplied
with national crude oil, the Kaduna refinery is also supplied with imported
Venezuelan oil through the pipeline originatirn. in Escravos and going through
Warri. The white products (gasoline, kerosene and diesel) are then
transported through four systems of pipelines of 6 to 16 inches in diameter
to the 19 depots throughout Nigeria, from where the marketing companies take
the products to their depots and pump stations, by rail tank cars and trucks.
The other products, including LPG, are transported by rail and road, directly
to retail outlets and bulk consumers.
F. Petroleum Product Pricing
2.07     Petroleum products ex-refinery and pump prices are determined by the
Federal Government through NNPC. The ex-refinery prices are low in
comparison with international prices (CIF Lagos). In April 1988, the
Government made the decision to increase the prices gradually to
international levels (para. 2.03). The breakdown of the current pump prices
is given in Annex 2-3.

G. Importance of the Petroleum Subsector in the Nigerian Economy
2.08     Crude oil production represented 15.0 percent and 13.5 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP), in 1986 and 1987 respectively. Taking into
account refining, and traL.. and transportation involved in the distribution
of petroleum products, the subsector is estimated to represent about 20
percent of the GDP, less than a decade ago when the prices of crude oil were
much higher. Investments in the petroleum indu,try are about N2.8 billion
(US$600 million) a year, compared to about N8 billion (US$1.7 billion) for
the Gross fixed capital formation of the economy as a whole. The total
investment to date in the refining industry alone is about US$2,500 million.
To calculate the receipts in foreign currency from crude oil exports, it is
estimated that, out of the average price of US$18.50 per barrel for Nigerian
crude in 1987, US$2 are paid as a royalty to the IOCs and USS3 are the cost
of production. Even though revenues from crude oil production are split
about 70 percent for the Nigerian Government and 30 percent for the IOCs, the
Government recoups most of the IOCs' share through taxation. The net
earnings in foreign currency are thus about US$13.50 per barrel. As exports
of crude oil were 445.7 Mbb in 1986 and 390.5 Hbb in 1987, the foreign
currency receipts came to about N28 billion (US$6.0 billi,a equivalent) in
1986 and N25 billion (US$5.3 billion equivalent) in 1987, compared to N83 and
N85 billion for the total GDP, in 1986 and 1987 respectively.
H. Energy Policy
2.09     Petroleum exports will remain Nigeria's dominant source of foreign
exchange for the foreseeable future. The mainstay of the energy policy is
therefore to undertake necessary long-term investment in the oil sector to
ensure that productive capacity is maintained. At the same time, in order to
increase exports, domestic petroleum consumption must be reduced, and this
leads to pricing energy products at economic levels and encouraging liquid
fuel substitution into gas via the public investment program, which is under
way. Increased reliability on gas priced at an economic level implies that
tariffs of electricity which is a major gas consumer must be raised towards
long run marginal cost. At the same time reliability of electricity supply
needs improvement through proper investment program. In order to transfcrm
NNPC to a market oriented entity, its various operating units are being
commercialized under the restructuring program implemented in June 1988
(para. 3.03). The future Bank mission that will help the Government define
an Energy sector strategy will develop an inter-fuel pricing policy by
comparing the advantages of using gas and alternative fuels for electricity
generation and domestic consumption and by assessing the potential domestic
and export market for LNG.
I. Bank's Role in the Sector
2.10     Bank involvement in Nigeria's energy sector has until recently been
mainly in the power subsector, to which six loans totalling US$407.5 million
have been made. The main objectives of the Bank in the power sector were to
contribute to consolidation of sector development and operation through the
establishment of NEPA, to help make NEPA financially viable through tariff
increases, and to strengthen the competence of staff through training.
Although some progress has been made toward the physical development of the
power system, serious weaknesses remain in the institutional development of
NEPA, affecting reliability of the system and NEPA's financial viability.
These are to be addressed under a proposed power system maintenance and
rehabilitation project.



- 8 -
2.11     Bank involvement with Nigeria's gas sector stLrted with the
Bank/UNDP Energy Assessment mission in 1982 which identified policy options
for utilization of gas reserves, analyzed investment priorities, provided a
framework for technical assistance and advised on the implementation of
energy programs. The mission's findings clearly showed the important role
that gas could play in Nigeria's future, particularly by substitution for
liquid fuels and preserving Nigeria's fuel oil export capacity. The Bank's
efforts have increased awareness within the Nigerian Government of the need
to resolve complex issues in the country's energy sector, including the need
for energy price adjustments. The Energy assessment will be updated by the
proposed Bank Energy sector review mission.
2.12     The Bank has continued to provide a framework for the resolution of
important sectoral issues, in the context of project discussions, about the
gas utilization program. The Bank has contributed to the development of a
policy framework for attracting the IOCs to make investments in non-
associated gas field development, for setting economic criteria for recovery
of associated gas being flared, and for establishing the long run marginal
cost (LRMC) principle as a basis of consumer pricing, to induce appropriate
inter-fuel substitution and economic efficiency. However, so far there has
been no implementation of the LRMC principle. The Bank also contributed to
the dialogue on pricing of petroleum products in general. The first
significant price adjustments were made in April 1988. Through the public
sector investment review mission, the Bank has helped the Nigerian Government
and NNPC evaluate energy sector investment plans and define a program of more
realistic investments in the power and petroleum subsectors, in keeping with
the Government's tight budgetary position.
2.13     The Bank's first loan to NNPC, for the Gas Technical Assistance
(T.A.) Project, approved in May 1984 and became effective in September 1986,
was designed to help accelerate the utilization of Nigeria's gaseous fuel
resources. The project also emphasizes institution building, including
training and operating assistance, to enable NNPC to manage, operate and
maintain efficiently the existing facilities. As of March 1989, only US$1.1
million were disbursed out of the loan amount of US$18.4 million. The
implementation of this project has been slow due to: (a) a slow start of
project implementation due to the unfamiliarity of NNPC with the Bank's
procedures; (b) complexity due to some ten difterent project components to be
implemented by different departments of NNPC; and (c) the reorganization of
NNPC which after two years has just been completed and is now under
implementation. As a result of agreements reached by the Bank's supervision
mission in February 1989, commitment to the implementation schedule for the
key project components has been secured from the relevant managers, and the
initial hurdles, especially concerning procurement, have been overcome.
Three of the project components amounting to about US$3.5 million have now
been processed and expected to be committed within about 3 months.
Disbursements should therefore pick up with respect to the redefined and
agreed components of the Project.
2.14     For the future, the Bank wou'd continue to act as a sounding board
for important policy decisions in the knergy sector (para. 2.09), help to
define investment priorities, as is the case for the proposed refineries
rehabilitation project, and help identify, prepare and finance, as well as
mobilize co-financing for priority investments, such as the petrochemical and
the Oso condensate projects.

III. THE BORROWING AGENCY
THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
A. Organization. Functions and Staffing
3.01     The NNPC was established on the lst of April 1977 in accordance with
the provisions of the NNPC Act No. 33 ('the Act'). The rationale behind
NNPC's establishment was basically to provide for effective government
participation and control of the oil industry in all its ramifications, with
a view to ensuring optimal utilization of Nigeria's depletable petroleum
resources. Subject to the provisions of the decree, NNPC is charged with the
following responsibilities:
i) exploring, prospecting for, or otherwise acquiring and
disposing of petroleum;
ii) refining, treating, processing and generally engaging in
handling of petroleum for manufacture and production of
petroleum products and its derivatives;
iii) purchasing and marketing of petroleum products and derivatives;
iv) providing and operating pipelines, tankership or other
facilities for the conveyance of crude oil, natural gas, and
their products and derivatives;
v) carrying out research in connection with petroleum and its
derivatives and promoting commercial activities derived from
it;
vi) to enter into contracts or partnership with any company, firm
or person to facilitate the discharge of the above
responsibilities;
vii) to train managerial, technical and other staff for the purpose
of running its operations and for the petroleum industry in
general;
viii) amongst other duties, the inspectorate arm, which is now
separate from NNPC, is charged with the responsibility for
issuing permits and licences for all activities connected with
petroleum exploration, refining, storage, marketing,
transportation and distribution thereof;
The Act establishes NNPC's formal hierarchical structure - a Board
of Directors (whose chairman is the Petroleum Minister and whose members
are the Managing Director, the two Deputy Managing Directors, two
representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Petroleum Resources, and
five other members from the business community), a managing director, two



- 10 -
deputy managing directors, sector coordinators and m rs?es and
departmental heads.  At the apex of the structure is tae Fedur.al Executive
Council which reserves the right to undertake a general review of the
affairs of the corporation and any of its subsidiaries. The Board of
Directors regulates the conditions of service, the granting of pensions,
gratuities and otLur retirement benefits among other things.
3.02     NNPC is charged with the execution of agreements entered into by
the Federal Government with foreign oil companies. The Federal Government
of Nigeria through NNPC has participating interest in joint oil exploration
and production ventures with IOCs (para. 1.12). NNPC, on behalf of the
Federal Government of Nigeria, has also entered into a production sharing
agreement with Ashland Oil (Nigeria) and servire contracts for oil
exploration with other IOCs (para. 1.13). NNPC operates in the domestic
market for its own account, but all export revenues accrue to the
Federation account.
3.03     As part of a program of commercialization of parastatals under the
Government Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), NNPC was radically
restructured in 1988 by a Board decision, with a view to transforming it
into a commercialized, integrated international company (see Annex 1-2).
This development is expected to facilitate effective control, faster
reaction to conditions in the market place, efficient management and
minimum political interference. The conversion of NNPC from a cost centre
organization which is entirely dependent on government for capital funding
to one that is profit driven, commercial in orientation and independent of
government financial £-ant, is a major transformation.  Hitherto, NNPC has
been largely dependent on government for capital funding through grants
from the Federal Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and Federal
Government guaranteed loans. NNPC is now commercialized and is expected to
raise loans on the strength of its balance sheet from commercial/merchant
banks and other financial institutions within and outside Nigeria to
finance its investment programs. Government interest in the new business
organization will be based largely on equity participation. Under the
Board of Directors that delegates its authority to the Managing Director
for day-to-day operations, there are now three lines of delegation, one for
corporate services under a deputy managing director, applied to the head
office and all the subsidiaries (previous departments); one for the
management of the operations of the wholly owned subsidiaries (including
the refineries) and the NNPC-controlled distribution subsidiaries, under
another deputy managing director; and one for joint ventures in exploration
and production, under a coordinator. Because of the great number of
operating subsidiaries, they will be grouped into three units with a
coordinator for each, reporting to the deputy managing director
(operations). The new organization chart shows the different business
units of the corporation and has trimmed down the span of control so as to
ensure greater delegation and efficiency in management and administration.
It establishes operating business units as profit centres. These business
units are scheduled to operate as autonomous units in line with defined
missions, objectives, targets and goals, so as to enhance the commercial
objective of the Corporation. Like organizations in the public sector,
NNPC and its various business units will be subject to government policies



- 11 -
and regulations. Since the restructuring of NNPC is only in its initial
stages, the exact implementation of all these goals cannot be assessed for
another year or so.
3.04     The magnitude of employment in NNPC is related to its growing role
in the Nigeriar economy. As the Corporation diversified from participation
in crude oil production to manufacturing and marketing of petroleum
products and derivatives, the manpower requirements grew with it. In 1979,
3,072 persons were in the employment of the Corporation. By 1981 the
figure had increased two-fold to 6,000, due mainly to the construction of
the Warri and Kaduna refineries. NNPC's total staff strength today stands
at over 14,000, and is projected to increase by about 252 in the next five
years in view of NNPC's new development programs and cxpansion of existing
activities.
3.05     The current planning cycle of NNPC covers five years.  Following
the first corporate planning projection, for the period 1988 to 1992, made
in 1987, a second one is currently under preparation, with the help of
Arthur Andersen & Company, for the period 1989-1993. It will still be
supported by many policy assumptions concerning prices, the scope of NNPC's
investment program and financing, and debt servicing, to be discussed and
settled with the Governament later on. The strategic planning process is
thus increasingly a tool for the formulation of development lines of the
petroleum sector and for the preparation of policy decisions.
B. Accounting Systems
3.06     Since 1983 basic accounting systems have been set up in NNPC
concerning general accounting and collection of data from NNPC's various
branches, cash management and budget preparation and control (budget
performance reports are obtained within three months after any month
closing date). Considerable work remains to be done to implement fully
existing procedures and to develop additional control systems. Under tLe
ongoing Gas T. A. project, implementation of cost accounting practices
similar to those widely adopted by most major commercial oil companies on a
world wide basis is underway. This will entail a major reorganization of
accounting, as it implies introducing tighter closing schedules for general
accounting, accelerating the payment process with adequate controls,
implementing the capital expenditure procedure devised by the newly
established corporate planning division, improving project controls and
cash flow planning, and establishing a reliable system of fixed asset
accounting. A major training program for accountants is included in the
Gas TA project.
C. External and Internal Auditing
3.07     NNPC's external auditors, Peat, Marwick and Ani, Ogunde (Nigeria),
a partnership between a Nigerian and a U.S. firm acceptable to the Bank,
and Muhtari Dangana, also acceptable to the Bank, are issuing NNPC's
audited financial statements. With the implementation of the
restructuring, each NNPC subsidiary will produce its own financial
statements, which will be subject to independent audit. This will apply to
the Warri and Kaduna subsidiaries, which will execute the proposed project.
Audited financial statements of NNPC would be submitted to the Bank within



- 12 -
six months of closing of the financial year; they would include the audited
financial statements of the Warri and Kaduna refineries. The internal
audit department will take on an increased importance, as a central control
function for the new commercialized and integrated structure of NNPC (para.
3.03), to ensure adherence, by the new semi-autonomous decentralized
centres, to NNPC's policies, guidelines and operating and administrative
procedures. In order to carry out efficiently those functions, training is
being provided to key specialists under the ongoing Gas T.A. project (para.
2.13).
D. Past Accounts
3.08     NNPC's accounts can be shown for the Head Office alone (i.e., for
the Corporation), or for the Corporation and subsidiaries (i.e., for the
Group), or for an enlarged Group including joint ventures with foreign
IOCs. Subsidiaries are petroleum distribution companies in which NNPC
holds a majority of the capital, so their accounts should be included in
NNPC's consolidated accounts, whereas it is misleading to include joint
ventures in which NNPC is only acting on behalf of the Federal Government.
Nevertheless, NNPC's 1985 audited accounts included joint ventures while
:he 1986 consolidated audited accounts correctly only include the
subsidiaries, accounts. However, as planning projections are presented for
the Corporation alone, for the sake of consistency the Corporation's
accounts will be discussed without the subsidiaries (accounts for the Group
are presented in Annexes 3-1 to 3-5).

3.09     Although the NNPC 1987 accounts have been finalized, they have not
been communicated to the Bank because the ownership of non-commercial
activities, to be excluded from the accounts as part of the
commercialization program, has not yet been discussed with the Government.



- 13 -
Therefore, the only available accounts for 1987 are part of the planning
exercise 1988-92 which is incomplete.  Healthy characteristics of NNPC's
balance sheets are high current assets to current liabilities ratios, of
almost 4 in 1986 and 3.5 in 1987, high net working capital to net fixed
assets ratios, of 861 in 1986 and 602 in 1987, high equity (including
capital grants) to debt and equity ratios, of 892 in 1986 and 782 in 1987,
and a comfortable cushion of cash and short term investments, that
constitute 622 of the net current assets in 1986. Another feature of
NNPC's balance sheets is the almost equal sharing of the fixed assets
between net operating assets (mainly the three refineries and the oil and
gas pipeline system) and works in progress in 1986, an equilibrium which
was tipped in 1987 in favour of works in progress, because of heavy
investments planned in exploration and petrochemicals (Port Harcourt).

3.10     The Nigerian currency unit, Naira, lost much of its value as
expressed in dollars from 1985 to 1987, going down from US$1.3 to 0.25.
However, mince domestic sales are only reflected in NNPC's revenues
(exports accrue to the Federation Account), and since domestic product
prices have not increased in line with the devaluation cf the Naira, NNPC's
net income only increased from Nairas 0.63 to 0.95 billion (for total sales
of petroleum products of N3.24 and 4.66 billion), from 1986 to 1987. Rates
of return on net fixed assets in operation were over 402 and 30Z
respectively. It should be noted, however, that fixed assets are not
revalued. It was agreed at negotiations that NNPC would revalue the fixed
assets of the two refineries, as necessary. Moreover, part of the increase
in gross margin in 1987 and 1988 is due to the fact that the cost of crude
oil to NNPC refineries was reduced from N20.58/bbl to Nll.75/bbl (US$5 to
US$2. 5/bbl)
E. Projections for the Planning Period 1988-92
3.11     Projected NNPC (Corporation) income statements, cash flow
statements and balance sheets are shown in Annex 3-5. From 1989 on, the
gross margin on petroleum products is projected to increase by 11l
annually. Operating costs related to petroleum products are expected to



- 14 -
increase sharply in 1989 to N7.07 billion, from a level of N1.96 billion in
1988, as the cost of crude oil to NNPC increases to international levels
(from US$2.51bbl in 1988 to US$17.5 in 1989 and US$18.5/bbl in 1992,
calculated by NNPC to increase from N11.75/bbl to N79.8 and N115.26/bbl).
Revenues from petroleum products are expected to increase correspondingly
from N4.05 billion in 1988 to N9.80 billion in 1989 and will go on
increasing to N14.08 billion in 1992, while the demand is expected to
remain about stagnant in spite of price increases. Other causes for an
increase in revenues are gas sales expected from the completion and
commissioning of the Escravos-Lagos pipeline (ELP) (from N0.18 billion in
1987 to NO.53 and 1.18 billion in 1988 and 1989, and following up to N2.33
billion in 1992), and sales of petrochemicals, following the completion of
the new Port Harcourt refinery in the first quarter of 1989. Income after
depreciation is expected to be sufficient to pay for the sum of corporate
tax (increasing from N0.40 billion in 1988 to N0.53 billion in 1989 and up
to N1.13 billion in 1992), a new petroleum profit tax (from N80 million in
1989 to 5173 million in 1992), and dividends (from 5360 million in 1989 to
N840 million in 1992).
F. Investment Program
3.12     The investment program is enormous, as NNPC is expected to invest
515.6 billion in five years (about US$3 billion), which compares to net
fixed assets in operation of about US$2.5 billion (the amount is estimated,
as the breakdown between assets in operation and works in progress is not
available). A capital review process started in 1988 with the introduction
of capital spending policies and procedures typical of international oil
companies, as part of the strategic planning exercise. The objective of
the capital review process, being implemented, is to give the highest
priority to projects essential for efficiency improvement, safety, loss
prevention and environmental control, and to projects necessary to maintain
cash flow, and to complete viable on-going projects. Projects were thereby
required to meet return on investment targets ranging from 15Z (for low
risk and maintenance projects) up to 25Z and higher (for higher risk
projects such as exploration) as well as meet payback targets. Before
being included in the strategic plan, each major project is supposed to be
subjected to an economic and financial analysis and funding must be
available for it. The capital review process is likely to reduce the
dimension of the investment program, when projects are all subjected to its
economic criteria.

Source: NNPC
1/  The cost of completion of the new Port Harcourt refinery under construction is included
(11,315 million).
3.13     The basic program (Basic I) totals N7.7 billion and provides funds
required to complete major ongoing projects, like ELP (111.8 billion) and the
telecommunication project (ETSD: N0.3 billion) which is expected to achieve
an efficient nationwide telecommunication network. Other projects include
those required to maintain existing operations, improve operational
efficiency and safety of the refinery, pipeline and marketing depot
operations, and initiate low-risk crude oil production from NNPC licensed
areas (E/P:NO.6 billion) and NNPC's share (about 502) in the execution of the
Liquefied Natural Gas project, to be undertaken by an international
consortium (LNG: 13.1 billion).
3.14     A second category of projects (Basic II) totals N5.2 billion.  The
main projects on that list are petrochemicals phase II (13.5 billion),
pipeline phase III (N0.7 billion), butanisation-merox (N0.6 billion) and
crude-coastal tankers (110.4 billion). In addition, the investment program
includes special projects for N1.4 billion that need not meet return on
investment criteria, as they are considered to be in the national interest:
the main projects in that category are pipeline phase IV and exploration in
new areas.



- 16 -
3.15     The application of the rules of the capital review process (para.
3.12) will be less stringent on the Basic I program, than on Basic II. The
latter will be reduced as the successive corporate planning exercises (the
second five-year exercise is presently under way) become more sophisticated
and the program is confronted with financing requirements. The decision to
implement special projects, as they are financed primarily on Government
funds, will be made at the Government level.
3.16     Financing for the 1988-92 plan will be provided by NNPC's own funds
(N1.6 billion accumulated in current assets at the end of 1987, 15.9 billion
generated from operations over the planning period), an additional foreign
loan for the new Port Harcourt refinery, and Government funding for N6.8
billion (M2.3 billion as equity contribution, N3.1 billion as LNG escrow and
N1.4 billion for special projects). The plan has not provided for the
replacement of existing investments in refineries, pipelines and related
capital assets which will require investments of the order of about seven or
eight times the historical cost. Replacement of such assets must eventually
be taken into account in product pricing, debt/equity structure and dividend
policy decisions.
3.17     It is assumed that the fozeign loals and capital grants outstanding
at the end of 1987 will be converted to equity in 1988. It implies that the
debt service will be taken over by the Government and that NNPC will pay M3
billion dividends to the Government over the five-year period. The financing
for the five-year program would come from the Government (N6.8 billion) and
from funds generated from operations, after payment of taxes and dividends
(M7.5 billion). It is not clear whether those projections are coneistent
with the pricing policy of the Government and with the demand elasticity of
petroleum products. A more elaborate projection is expected from the current
1989-93 corporate planning exercise. The structure of the balance sheet at
the end of 1992 would be profoundly different from that of 1987, since the
ratio of current assets to net fixed assets would have been reduced from 61?
to 18? and there would be no long term debt.
G. Refineries
3.18     In the new NNPC structure, the two refineries of Kaduna and Warri,
to be rehabilitated under the proposed project, will be part of two separate
wholly-owned subsidiaries of NNPC, together with the associated
petrochemicals activities. The refineries at Port Harcourt will form part of
a separate company. The financial statements of the refineries in the past
(Annex 3-1 and 3-2) had little significance since they had no sales and the
subsieies provided by the head office (their revenues) were calculated to
cover their expenses. In the future, in order to assess their performance,
it is necessary to calculate the cost of the refining process, i.e., the cost
of the added value by the refineries to the cost of crude oil, that can be
compared internationally. Prior to the reorganization NNPC did not bave a
system of keeping precise individual accounts for each of its operations
spread all over the country. As one of the main objectives of the
reorganization, NNPC in the future will operate as a commercial organization
and each operating entity will become a cost centre. Under the ongoing Gas
T.A. Project, the services of Arthur Andersen and Co. are being used to
prepare an efficient accounting system in order to implement the objectives
of the reorganization. As such precise operating costs of each refinery



- 17 -
apportioned to its refining activities would be available only then the 1988
accounts are finalized. However, on the basis of NNPC's best eutimatei of
operating costs apportioned to the refinirg activities of the two refineries,
the economic viability of their operations vas evaluated. The evaluation
indicates that the operation of the two refineries, even vith the present
inefficiencies, is profitable to Nigeria vis-a-vis finished product imports
on the basis of sunk cost of existing investments and import/export parity
prices for products and crude. The details of this evaluation are presented
in Annex 3-3.
3.19     The operation of the two refineries, however, are inefficient
compared to similar refineries in Western Europe. For instance the operating
cost of the Warri Refinery at its present level of capacity utilization as
presented in Annex 3-3 amounts to about US$22 per ton as against about US$13
per ton for a similar West European refinery operating at 70 percent
capacity. Assuming that the capacity utilization of the Warri Refinery can
be improved to about 4.9 million tons after rehabilitation, resulting from
the engineering studies included in the proposed project, the operating cost
is estimated to be about US$15.2 per ton which is about 17 percent higher
than the West European cost. The main reason for this increased operating
cost is the high level of energy consumption (10.7Z of the crude throughput).
Similarly, the Kaduna refinery operating cost is estimated to be about US$28
per ton at its 3.294 million ton operating level as against about US$24 per
ton for a similar refinery in Western Europe. The main reason for this
higher cost in Kaduna Refinery is again the high level of energy consumption
(15.7% of the crude throughput). The proposed engineering studies will
review this aspect in detail so that a second phase rehabilitation project
could include measures for improving energy efficiency in the two refineries.
3.20     The main investments in the refineries, in the 1988-92 program
excluding the completion of the Port Harcourt refinery (about N580 million or
US$lUO million equivalent), are the gas turbine and the fourth boiler in
Warri (beginning of the period), the butane merox treating unit (beginning of
the period) and the asphalt package (end of the period) in Kaduna, and the
naphta hydro treating unit and the feeder switch (end of the period) in Port
Harcourt. Those investments are mainly related to maintenance and are,
because of that, included in the Basic I program.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Genesis
4.01     The refineries at Warri and Kaduna ezperience difficulties in
achieving full operational efficiency at their design capacities. Even
t),ough they are modern refineries built in the 1980 by experienced
contractors (SNAMPROGETTI of Italy in Warrn *nd CNIYODA of Japan in
Kaduna), operational problems arose from the very beginning with respect to
a number of support facilities such as the turbo generator, waste water
treatment, steam condensate recovery, and fire water lines in the Warri
refinery and waste water treatment and steam condensate recovery in the
Kaduna refinery. Besides, the Kaduna refinery has a lube base oil
manufacturing complex which is operating at around fifty percent of the
design capacity due to low domestic demand and lack of export potential
since the refinery is located more than 1000 kilometers inland. The
underutilization of capacities in the two refineries has been the main
reason for substantial import of petroleum products for domestic
consumption.
4.02     World Bank missions visited these refineries and had detailed
discussions with the NNPC officials, the contractors (SNAMPROGETTI and
CHIYODA), and the NNPC's consultants, BEICIP of France, in September and
November 1987 on a rehabilitation scheme to improve capacity utilization.
BEICIP which has provided Consultancy Services to the Warri Refinery
Project Management team during its construction was asked to provide a
report identifying the reasons for the malfunctioning, remedial measures
required, and estimate cost of engineering services, contracting and
hardware required to rectify each item. The study was financed by the Bank
under the ongoing Gas T.A. Project. BEICIP's report was jointly reviewed
by the officials of NNPC and the Bank in February 1988, and the scope and
cost of the rehabilitation program included in the proposed project was
finalized. The proposed project is planned to tackle the immediate
necessities in the off-sites and utility systems in the two refineries.
The problems connected with the process technology and plant and machinery
in the main battery limits will be covered by the engineering studies
included in the project.
B. Project Objectives
4.03     The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(i)   to complement the Bank's earlier institution building
efforts with NNPC under the Gas T.A. project to strengthen
NNPC's management effectiveness and investment planning
capacity to focus on repairs and rehabilitation of its
assets and to improve the capacity utilization of existing
facilities which hinge on suitable preventative maintenance
procedures, funding and spare parts inventory planning;
(ii) to rectify the malfunctioning of various support facilities
in order to increase capacity utilization and operational
efficiency in the two refineries at Warri and Kaduna;



- 19 -
(iii) to improve and institutionalize the preventive maintenance
system and corrosion protection program in the two
refineries to reduce malfunc ioning/break-down of support
facilities, and ensure that the problems being corrected
will not recur in the future; and
(iv) to improve the functioning of the waste water treatment
systems to cope vith the increased load of conthminated
water in the two refineries and to reduce environmental
pollution to normal industry standards.
C. Project Description
4.04     Warri Refinery:
(i)    Power generating system study.  It was agreed at
negotiations that the originally planned turbine vibration
study for the three turbo sets would be expanded to cover
the entire power generating system with a view to arriving
at guaranteed solutions to the identified problems. Such
guaranteed solutions can only be obtained if the original
supplier of the turbine is entrusted with a single point
responsibility for rectifying the entire system because the
internal parts of the turbines may have been severely
damaged due to deposits and erosion. In the past NNPC had
engaged other turbine manufacturers and independent
consultants, but did not succeed in getting satisfactory
solutions. After reviewing the circumstances, including
the possibility of a conflict of interest in appointing the
original suppliers to carry out the study, it was cgreed
that the only way to get guaranteed solutions to this
problem would be to engage the original supplier with
single point responsibility, and NNPC would negotiate terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for the proposed
studv.
(ii)   Modification to the Waste Water Treatment:  The existing
system does not have the capacity to handle the total waste
water of the refinery especially after the substantial
increase in crude oil storage capacity built for supplying
crude to the Kaduna refinery. Furthermore, some of the
equipment are faulty, probably because of inadequate
maintenance and poor operating practices. The proposed
modifications will include facilities segregating storm
water and oil contaminated water, replacement of efficient
water lifting pumps, installation of new oil separators to
reduce the load in the existing waste water treatment unit,
installation of motor driven oil scrapers, installation of
a new waste water treating section exclusively to treat
oily water from tank farm, new pumps for disposal of
treated water, new pumps for storm water handling,
rehabilitation of sludge treating and incineration
facilities, replacement of a number of worn out pumps and
installation of two new slop tanks. All operational
procedures would be reviewed and modified to the extent



- 20 -
required, and an efficient monitoring system would be
introduced. It was agreed that the NNPC would establish
limit for pollutants and maintain pollution control
measures as per industry norms and limits, by July 1, 1991.
(iii)  Replacement of Underground Fire Water Liness   The carbon
steel pipes used for fire water circulation are buried
underground throughout the refinery without cathodic
protection. The pipes are severely corroded and the safety
of the refinery and personnel is compromised. All the
underground fire water pipes would be replaced with
overground pipes except in a few areas in the process units
and road crossings where glass reinforced thermosetting
resin pipes will be used.
(iv)   Modification to the Condensate Recovery System:  Due to
unreliable power supply, the refinery uses an unusual
number of steam driven standby pumps making the steam
consumption very high and steam header collecting the
exhaust steam overloaded. Until the power supply is made
reliable, the refinery steam consumption cannot be
substantially reduced; therefore, the proposed modification
is to reduce the overloading and improve the efficiency of
the existing system. The modification job would include a
new steam header to gather the exhaust steam, installation
of a heat exchanger between exhaust steam and demineralized
water, a new air cooled condenser to produce exhaust steam
condensate to supplement boiler feed water and installation
of two active charcoal filters to remove oil traces from
process condensate.
(v)    Replacement of Inefficient Instruments:  The existing field
transmitters for pressure, flow and level instruments have
become unsuitable for tropical climate conditions causing
frequent failures and loss of process control. Also, the
existing uninterrupted power supply (UPS) is connected only
to one busbar of switchboards which can cause power cut to
the instruments during maintenance shutdown or failure of
one busbar. To rectify these defects the field
transmitters would be replaced and new UPS units installed
with power supply from another busbar of each substation.
(vi)   Maintenance Spare Parts:  When new equipment and
machineries were purchased for debottlenecking the refinery
facilities, necessary spare parts for those items were not
purchased to keep the expenditure low. Without these
essential spare parts the operation of the refinery could
be interrupted at any moment causing costly damages in
maintenance and loss of production. The exact requirement
will be reviewed item by item; only an estimated fixed
amount is included (the expenditure will be limited to this
amount) in the proposed project.



- 21 -
(vii) Laboratory EquiPment: Some of the laboratory equipment,
necessary for day-to-day quality control have become
obsolete or worn out. Spares and services for some are not
available due to the obsolescence of the equipment. In
view of the importance of quality control, an estimated
fixed amount to cover the essential items are included in
the proposed project.
4.05     Kaduna Refinery
(1)    Modification to the Waste Water Treatmeat:  The existing
facilities for waste water treatment ara overloaded and
deficient on account of deficiency in design, failure of
some equipment and lack of operational care. The first
stage oil separation is insufficient causing complete
failure of the biological treatment facilities. Oil leaks
through all sections of the treatment facilities due to
permanent overloading and design deficiencies in the
flocculation section.  The remedial measures included in
the proposed project are a new flocculation-floatation unit
to treat process waste water, an activated sludge system to
reduce phenol content, a new oil separator equipped with
mechanical skimmer, a new flocculation-floatation unit to
process oily sewer water, and modification to the sludge
processing unit and other existing facilities. All
operational procedures will be reviewed and modified to the
extent required and an efficient monitoring system would be
introduced. It was agreed that the NNPC would establish
limit for pollutants and maintain pollution control
measures as per industry norms and limits, by July 1, 1991.
(ii)   Modification to the Condensate Recovery System:  The
refinery has been experiencing difficulties in recovering
condensate to complement boiler feed water due to defective
steam traps, deficiency in the steam trap assembly design,
lack of inspection and maintenance of steam-traps, and
insufficient steam flash pots. The program is to rectify
these defects by providing around 250 steam-trap manifolds
with condensate recovery system, installation of condensate
headers between steam-trap manifolds and flash pots,
providing insulation and aluminium cladding for the lines
upstream of each steam-trap, and installation of flash pots
with pumps, instruments and corresponding discharge lines
to the existing condensate recovery system. Necessary
spare parts for the existing steam traps would also be
provided.
(iii)  Laboratory Equipment:  Some of the laboratory equipment,
necessary for day-to-day quality control, have become
obsolete or worn out. Spares and services for some of them
are not available due to obsolescence. In view of the
importance for quality control, an estimated fixed amount
to cover the esser.tial items are included in the proposed
project.



- 22 -
(iv)   Data Logging and Shipment Computer:  The existing computer
has become obsolete and deficient in operation. Some of
the equipment are so obsolete that their replacement may
not be possible or will result in excessive cost and
limited services. Therefore, after reviewing the options
with the refinery operating personnel, the consultants
recommended a new system which includes data acquisition of
1200 inputs (expandable), data logging of all inputs,
monitoring of all units with alive graphics, computation of
heat and material balance, management control, invoicing of
shipment. etc.
4.06     Studies, Workshop and Training
(i)    The proposed project represents the first step of a
comprehensive rehabilitation program for the two refineries
at Warri and Kaduna. It would deal with the immediate
needs of some of the off-site facilities and utility
system. The long-term requirement of the refineries to
achieve design capacity and operational improvenments would
be defined by diagnostic operations studies followed by
detailed engineering studies for which funds are included
in the proposed project. It was agreed at negotiations
that, not later than June 30, 1989, NNPC would complete
diagnostic operations studies with terms of reference
satisfactory to the Banlc, and promptly thereafter furnish
to the Bank the results of the said studies. NNPC would,
not later than December 31, 1989, complete the engineering
studies, with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,
including the preparation of cost estimates to define the
long term requirements for the refineries of Warri and
Kaduna in order to achieve design capacity and to design
operational improvements, and promptly thereafter furnish
to the Bank the results of the said studies. Consultants
for the engineering studies would be selected by February
28, 1989.
(ii)   A workshop on preventive maintenance, corrosion protection
arnd environmental protection will be conducted by
experienced professionals in the Warri refinery training
center for the benefit of personnel from the two refineries
and other organizations such as petrochemicals,
fertilizers, etc. It was agreed at negotiations that NNPC
would establish and maintain by July 1, 1990, preventive
maintenance schemes satisfactory to the Bank to improve the
operational efficiency in the two refineries.
(iii)  Many staff members, trained by the contractors at the time
of the refinery commissioning, have been dispersed for
other projects and the a-ality of the personnel filling
these gaps is not satisfactory. Therefore, specialized



- 23 -
training would be provided for NNPC personnel in refinery
operating economics, energy and utilities conservation,
preventive maintenance, inventory control, corrosion
protection, inspection of equipment and machinery,
pollution control, project planning and project monitoring.
It was agreed at negotiations that NNPC would prepare the
training program in consultation vith the Bank by October
1, 1989.
4.07     Replenishment of Spare Parts and Materials Stock.  Both Warri and
Kaduna refineries suffer considerable production losses since essential
spare parts, catalysts, and chemicals are not purchased in an expeditious
manner due to the difficulty in arranging sufficient foreign exchange. In
Warri this also affects the operations of the petrochemical plant. In
order to overcome this difficulty, it was agreed at negotiations that NNPC
would establish a foreign exchange account. This *NNPC Refineries'
account, to be opened and maintained in dollars in a commercial bank on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and to be managed by NNPC's
Corporate finance services, would be initially funded with proceeds of the
proposed loan in an amount corresponding to the estimated foreign exchange
needs for essential spare parts, chemicals and catalysts during a twelve
month period (US$6.0 million for the two refineries). The account would be
continuously replenished, once the goods are received in the refineries, by
purchasing necessary foreign exchange through the auction system within
three months. Use of the account would be exclusively reserved for
purchasing spare parts needs for maintenance, and chemicals and catalysts
for the normal operation of the two refineries. The account would be
audited annually by independent auditors appointed by NNPC and acceptable
to the Bank and the audit report would be submitted to the Bank within six
months after closing of the account, on 31 December of each year. It was
further agreed that NNPC, not later than July 1, 1990, would pay
US$6,000,000 equivalent into the NNPC Refineries account and thereafter not
later than January 1 and July 1 of each year would pay into the NNPC
Refineries account amounts sufficient to replenish that account to the
limit of the imprest of US$6,000,000 equivalent.
D. Project Managtinient and Implementation
4.08     The Warri and Kaduna refineries of NNPC would be responsible for
the implementation of the rehabilitation program. It was agreed that the
refineries would be required to appoint a Project management team wit; a
full-time Project Manager, assisted, as and when required, by engineers
from various disciplines, a procurement specialist and a cost accountant to
manage the implementation of its respective items. The Proiect management
team would have functions and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
The refineries would also retain engineering consultants on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA to assist in the implementation. At the
NNPC Headquarters, the Head of the Corporate Planning and Development
Division will co-ordinate with the two refineries.

E. Project Schedule
4.09     Some of the items included in the proposed project involve
detailed engineering, procurement, transportation to the refinery location,
site fabrication, erection, and comissioning. They will take about 36
months for completion. The implementation schedule for various components
is shown in Annex 4.1. Since the replacement of the fire vater lines in
Warri Refinery and some of the modifications to the waste vater treatment
facilities in Kaduna Refinery cannot wait until the loan is made effective,
it was agreed that NNPC would go ahead with expenditures of up to US$2.6
million to implement these items prior to the Board presentation, starting
after November 1, 1988. It is recommended that this amount would be
retroactively financed from the proposed IBRD loan (para 4.22).
F. Prolect Cost Estimates
4.10     The estimated total cost of the project is US$39.2 million of
which US$27.7 million equivalent is in foreign exchange and US$11.5 million
equivalent is in local cost. The consultants, after conducting basic
design and enquiries with prospective vendors, estimated the cost of the
various items and engineering and construction services required for the
proposed project. The detailed project cost estimates are shown in Annex
4.2 and summarized in the table below.

4.11      The cost estimates are considered to be realistic.  They are
exclusive of duties and taxes. The estimted costs include physical
contingency of 15 percent, price contingency of 10 percent for foreign
costs and 25 percent for local costs.
G. Financing Plan
4.12      The proposed Bank loan of US$27.7 million equivalent would meet
100 per cent of the foreign exchange cost. The proposed financing plan is
as follows:
Table VI
Local     Foreign    Total        I of Total
(US$ million equivalent)
IBRD                 -       27.7         27.7          71

4.13      The loan would be made available to the NNPC at the prevailing
Bank interest rate with a repayment period of 15 years including a grace
period of 3 years.  Additionally, NNPC would pay to the Government a
guaranty fee of 102 of that rate. The foreign exchange risk would be borne
by NNPC. NNPC would finance local costs of US$11.5 million equivalent from
its internal cash generation.

- 26 -
4.14     The procurement of various equipment and materials to be financed
by the Bank that are not proprietary items or need not match existing
equipment for purposes of standardization would be through international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines. To the
extent practicable, contracts for goods would be grouped in bid packages
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more each. However, items
or groups of items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$100,000
could be procured on conditions satisfactory to the Bank by limited
international bidding (LIB). Consultants for the diagnostic operations
studies for the two refineries will be selected on a short list of
international oil companies operating in Nigeria. Engineering studies to
review all the existing facilities in the two refineries and to recou end
the medium/long-term requirements of the two refineries would be carried
out by direct contracting with the original contractors, who are better
qualified for the job than other engineering firms unfamiliar with the
plant and machinery, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Consultants for conducting the workshop and training would be selected by
inviting limited internationel bidding on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank, the short lists would include qualified Nigerian consultants
to the extent practicable. Procurement arrangements for the overall
financing and for the proposed Bank loan are summarized in the above table.
Procurement arrangements for the two refineries are indicated in paras.
4.15 to 4.21.
4.15     Power generating study: AEG-KANIS of West Germany, the original
supplier of the turbo-sets, and Warri Refinery would negotiate a service
contract on terms acceptable to the Bank to conduct all necessary
inspections and appraise the entire power generating system, including the
turbo set foundation, grouting, anchoring bolts, internals, pipings
attached to the turbo sets and the quality of the boiler feed water with a
view to submitting a comprehensive proposal to rectify the vibration
problem. The proposal would include detailed scope of work, engineering
design, material list, specifications, and estimated cost. AEG would
subcontract the services of experienced specialists, acceptable to NNPC,
for activities for which AEG is not specialized. They would be able to
guarantee their respective scope of work in the event of execution.
4.16     Modification to the waste water treatment, replacement of
underground fire water lines, modification to the condensate recovery
system, and replacement of inefficient instruments would be carried out by
inviting quotations from internationally reputed Engineering Contractors
selected through ICB for the design, detailed engineering, procurement,
inspection, construction supervision, construction and commissioning so
that the overall responsibility for the quality and efficient
implementation of the project would remain with the main contractor.
Experienced local sub-contractors are available to assist the main
contractor for site fabrication and local construction. The bidding
document will seek to maximize such local inputs to the extent possible.
Warri Refinery Project Manager would prepare the tender document and
finalize it in consultation with the Bank.



_ 27 -
4.17     Spare parts and laboratory equipment immediately required would be
procured directly by the Warri Refinery. Single items costing less than
US$100,000 which cannot be grouped together with others would be purchased
through limited international bidding (LIB) by calling for quotations from
at least 3 internationally recognized suppliers. Proprietary items or
spare parts for existing equipment which cannot be obtained from
alternative suppliers would be purchased by single source procurement.
4.18     Modifications to the waste water treatment and condensate recovery
system would be implemented through ICB as explained in para 4.16 above.
The Kaduna Refinery Project Manager would prepare the tender document and
finalize it in consultation with the Bank.
4.19     Laboratory equipment would be procured directly by the Kaduna
Refinery as explained in para. 4.17 above.
4.20     The data logging and shipment computer would be procured by ICB by
inviting quotations for design of the system, supply of hardware and
software, installation, commissioning and training of required number of
personnel.
4.21     All tender documents for goods worth above US$100,000 would be
submitted to the Bank for review prior to distribution to the bidders. In
view of the technical complexity of the nature of the items (waste water
treatment, condensate recovery and fire water distribution system for Warri
Refinery and wastewater treatment and condensate recovery and the computer
system for Kaduna Refinery), it is proposed to follow a two stage bidding
procedure in that the bidders will be asked to submit the technical
proposals which will be evaluated and cleared with the Bank. The bidders
would be instructed by NNPC to submit one copy of the technical part of the
bidding document for the Bank's review. Thereafter, the bidders will be
asked to submit their price proposals. It was agreed that all contracts
worth above US$100,000 would be submitted to the Bank for review prioer to
signature.
I. Retroactive Financing
4.22     Advance contracting and retroactive financing of up to
US$2.6 million for expenditures after November 1, 1988 for the replacement
of the fire water lines in Warri Refinery and modification to the waste
water treatment in Kaduna Refinery would be done since the condition of
these items is so deteriorated that they cannot wait until the loan is made
effective (para. 4.09).
J. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
4.23     The allocation of the proposed loan is shown in the table below.  The
estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 4.3. It has been
prepared on the basis of the implementation schedule for individual project
components, given that there is no previous disbursement profile for these types
of projects in Nigeria. To facilitate project implementation, NNPC will open a
special account in the amount of US$3.0 million to be used for expenditures made
by NNPC under the proposed project. The account will be held in a commercial
bank, and operated on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Withdrawal



- 28 -
applications will be submitted with full supporting documents, except for
contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent, and individual training programs
which will be reimbursed on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs).
Supporting documents related to SOEs will be retained in a central location by
NNPC, and made available for review by visiting missions. As part of the annual
audit of NNPC, external auditors acceptable to the Bank would specifically
review accounts and submit their reports within 6 months of the close of each
fiscal year. The audit reports would make specific reference to the audit of
SOEs and provide an opinion on the use of the special rccount.

K. Environmental and Safety Aspects
4.24     In general, environmental pollution from petroleum refining could occur
through gaseous effluent and liquid waste. Gaseous effluent consists of gases
containing sulphur oxides, hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans and particulate matters.
Since Nigerian refineries, except to some extent the Kaduna refinery, process
low sulphur Nigerian crude oils, pollution due to sulphur compounds is limited,
and is well below the industry norms. Emission of particulate matter containing
catalyst fines from the catalytic cracking units are minimized by the use of
effective cyclones. However, liquid waste released from both the refineries
contain oil and phenols, presumably, beyond the standard industry norms. There
is no regular measurement and recording to quantify these pollutants. The
additions and modifications proposed in the project will reduce the pollutants
to normal industry norms, and periodical analysis of the waste water and
recording the results in all the refineries will be made mandatory. To increase
the awareness of the environmental pollution among the refirery and
petrochemical industry staff, a workshop on pollution control by specialists
will be conducted in Warri (para. 4.06).

L. Proiect Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
4.25     Various indicators for monitoring project implementation and the
operations of Warri and Kaduna refineries were agreed with NNPC during
negotiations (Annex 4.4). These will be highlighted in the quarterly progress
reports to the Bank. It was agreed at negotiations that within six months after
the completion of the project, NNPC would prepare a 'Project Completion Report'
on the basis of an outline to be agreed with the Bank.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Project Justification
5.01     The proposed project, particularly the rehabilitation components, would
correct the problems in the support facilities of the two refineries so that
they can be operated with improved reliability and capacity utilization. Delays
in the rectification of these problems have caused product shortages which are
met through imports. The savings in imports on account of the project
implementation produce an internal rate of return of 38 percent for Warri
R&finery and 31 percent for Kaduna Refinery.
5.02     From the institutional standpoint, the proposed project would enhance
the commercial orientation of the two refineries and institutionalize the
preventive maintenance system and pollution control measur-s. The refinery
personnel will be trained to maintain the facilities and monitor the operational
results in the future.
B. Economic Returns
5.03     The proposed project has components which are mainly intended to
rehabilitate the existing facilities, increase the safety aspects and effect
pollution control. Justification for such components should be mainly on the
basis of safe operating practices and the needs for environmental protection.
Wherever the operational efficiency is increased to effect improved productivity
and cost reduction, it is taken into account in evaluating the economic
viability of the investment. The economic return for the investments in the two
refineries are summarized in the table below; the details are presented in Annex
5.1.
Economic Return, 2      NPV at 10  Discount
(US$ million)
Warri Refinery                      38                       36
Kaduna Refinery                    31                        13
C. Project Risks
5.04     Since all the items included in the project are for improving existing
facilities and the p-oject preparation is well advanced and the project
components are identified with specific details, no major risk is anticipated in
the implementation of the proposed project. Since the operations of many of the
facilities is essential for the continuous operation of the refinery, the
rehabilitation work needs to be scheduled to synchronize with the refinery turn-
around program to the maximum extent possible. There could be some delay in the
ccmpletion of some of the items on this account. The engineering contractor
will be asked to prepare a detailed time schedule taking this aspect into
account, which will be monitored during implementation by the Bank's supervision
missions.

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     Agreements were obtained at negotiations on the following:
li) NNPC would cause the fixed assets of the two refineries to be revalued,
as necessary (para. 3.10);
(ii) NNPC would establish by July 1, 1991, limit for pollutants and
maintain pollution control measures as per industry norms and limits (para
4.04 (ii) and 4.05 (i));
(iii) UNPC would complete diagnostic operations studies in the two
refineries with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank by June 30, 1989
and the subsequent implementing engineering studies by December 31, 1989
(para 4.06 (i));
(iv) NNPC would establish and maintain thereafter by July 1, 1990,
preventive maintenance schemes in the two refineries satisfactory to the
Bank (para 4.06 (ii));
(v) NNPC would prepare, by October 1, 1989, for the Bank review a training
program for the refinery personnel in preventive maintenance and pollution
control (para 4.06 (iii));
(vi) NNPC would utilize the funds provided by the Bank (US$6.0 million
equivalent) to establish a NNPC Refineries account in a commercial bank on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para 4.07);
(vii) The Warri and Kaduna refineries would appoint project management
teams with full-time Project Managers, and functional engineers, cost
accountant, etc., appointed as and when necessary (para 4.08);
(viii) All contracts and agreements worth above US$100,000 would be
submitted to the Bank for review prior to their signature (para 4.21);
6.02     Based on the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable for
the proposed IBRD loan of US$27.7 million equivalent. The proposed loan
would be lent to NNPC at the Bank standard variable interest rate for 15
years including three years of grace. Retroactive financing of US$2.6
million for the replacement of the fire water lines in the Warri Refinery
and modification to the waste water treatment in Kaduna Befinery is also
recommended (para 4.22), and is included in the amount mentioned above.

fuel oil in Northwest Europe minus a discount to compensate for
the extra freight to Nigeria.
(viii)   Price of LPG which is not usually quoted in the Platts oilgram was
estimated on the basis of actual prices at which it is imported in
recent times in the region.
(ix)   The operating cost of the refinery (fixed and variable) was
estimated from its 1986 operating cost apportioned to the refinery
activities as per NNPC's best estimates.
(x)   Nigerian Naira was converted to United States dollars at the 1986
average exchange rate of N1.54 per US$ for estimating the
operating cost in 1986 in USS.
(xi)   All existing investments are considered sunk costs.
(xii)   Terminal cost for product import includes cost of personnel,
utilities, chemicals, etc. for operation and maintenance of
product unloading, storage and handling facilities.

B. KADUNA REFINERY
Assumptions:
(i)   Crude oil processed: 552 Nigerian crude supplied from the Warri
terminal and 452 imported from Venezuela - total quantity
processed in 1987 is 3.294 million tons.
(ii)   Crude oil transportation: both the Nigerian and Venezuelan crudes
are transported by a commnn pipeline from Warri to Kaduna.
(iii)   Inland transportation cost of crude oil and products are not taken
into account -- both are assumed landed at the coast since
imported products have to be transported to Kaduna by rail/road
which involves considerable extent of local cost and the import
parity comparison would not be realistic on that basis.
(iv)  crude oil price: for the Nigerian crude, its opportunity price
i.e., spot price for export as reported in Platts oilgram and for
the Venezuelan crude, its actual price CIF, Escravos were assumed.
(v) Fuel product prices: spot prices ex-Northwest Europe plus freight
to Nigeria in 35,000 DWT clean tankers and insurance and ocean
loss at 0.71 of the FOB plus freight value.
(vi)  For lube base oils, US Gulf Coast FOB prices and transportation in
bulk are assumed.
(vii) Price of fuel oil is assumed at spot FOB price for low sulphur in
Northwest Europe minus a discount to compensate for the extra
freight to Nigeria.
(viii) Price of LPG which is not usually quoted in the Platts oilgram was
estimated on the basis of actual prices at which it is imported in
recent times in the region.
(ix)  Prices of Paraffin Wax and sulphur were also based on market
information on actual sales in recent times.
(x) Price of asphalt is estimated on the basis of FOB high sulphur
fuel oil plus transportation in bulk in heated tankers.
(xi)  The operating cost of the refinery (fixed and variable) was
estimated from its 1988 operating cost apportioned to the refinery
activities as per NNPC's best estimates.
(xii) Nigerian Naira was converted to US$ at the 1988 average exchange
rate of N5 per US$ for estimating the operating cost in 1988 in
US$.

PROJECT MONITORING INDICATORS
During negotiations, indicators pertinent to the project implementation
and efficient operation of the two refineries at Warri and Kaduna, along the
lines outline below, would be discussed and agreed with the representatives of
the Government/NNPC as the basis for establishing an agreed project monitoring
system.
(i)   Maintaining in each refinery up-to-date record of inspection history of
all important equipment and machinery and necessary spares and materials
required to carry out timely preventive maintenance.
(ii)  Maintaining up-to-date record of pollutants measured in each refinery,
particularly oil content phenol and biological oxygen demand, at least
once in a week in order to monitor the harmful effects of the waste water
leaving the refinery and maintain their levels in the waste water at
appropriate US Environmental Protection Agency standard or its equivalent.
(iii) Maintaining strict safety standards pertaining to the storage and handling
of petroleum.
(iv)  Maintai; up-to-date record of all technical and financial information
required to assess the refinery processing margin periodically (such as
consumption of fuel, utilities, catalysts and chemicals; cost of labor,
maintenance and administration; quantity and cost of crude processed and
products delivered).
(v)   Employ suitably qualified personnel and provide training to establish an
efficient team of professionals in each refinery for project evaluation,
investment planning, planning and conducting preventive maintenance,
pollution control and monitoring, and enforcement of safety regulation.
(vi)  Preparation of quarterly reports by each refinery for the Bank review of
the physical and financial progress of the project, status of procurement
and contracting, and disbursement schedules.
(vii) Preparation of quarterly and annual financial statements of each refinery
for review by the Bank.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Warri Refinery
(i)      The components that would improve productivity and reduce cost in
the case of Wnrri Refinery are: (a) waste water treatment
modifications; (b) condensate recovery modifications; (c)
instrument replacement; (4) laboratory equipment; and (e) spare
parts. The benefits expected after the implementation of the
proposed project are improved capacity utilization, product
upgradation, hydrocarbon recovery, and reduced operating cost.
(ii)     The investment costs are estimated by the consultants after
conducting basic designs, wherever required, and inquiries with
prospective vendors. They are exclusive of Nigerian duties and
taxes.
(iii)    A residual value of 152 of the capital cost is assumed at the end
of 15 years.
(iv)     The investment cost is disbursed in four years:  102 in the first
year, 301 in the second year, 402 in the third year, and 202 in
the fourth year.
(v)      Operating costs for running the various facilities proposed are
already included in the general operating costs of the refinery.
Therefore, no operating cost is included separately for these
items.
(vi)     The consultants estimated that the daily cost of the shut-down of
the Warri Refinery amounts to US$300,000 on account of production
losses and US$50,000 for fixed costs. Consequential losses in the
petrochemical production in the Warri polypropylene plant which
receives its feed-stock from the refinery is not included.
(vii)    After the modification of the vaste water treatment, it is
estimated to save about 27,000 tons per year of oil (US$2.94
million).
(viii)   For the condensate recovery, the savings estimated are 23,600
tons/year of fuel oil (US$1.89 million) and 830,000 m3/year of
boiler feed-water (US$1.25 million).
(ix)     About 50,000 tons per year product upgradation and 1 day of
production loss for spare parts (US$1.35 million) and 5 days of
production loss for instrument replacement (US$1.75 million) are
estimated. For the replacement of laboratory equipment, about
100,000 tons of product upgradation is estimated (USS2.0 million).
(x)      The estimated costs and benefits in average 1988 product prices
are summarized as follows:

S. Kaduna Refinery
(i)      The ca ponents that would improve productivity and reduce cost in
the case of Kaduna Refinery are: (a) waste vater treatment; (b)
condensate recoveryl (c) laboratory equipment; and (d) co puter.
The benefits expected after the implementation of the proposed
project are improved hydrocarbon recovery. product upgradation and
reduced operating cost.
(ii)     The investment costs are estimated by the consultants after
conducting basic designs. wherever required, and inquiries with
prospective vendors. They are exclusive of Nigerian duties and
taxes.
(iii)    A residual value of 15 percent of the capital cost is assumed at the
end of 15 years.
(iv)     The investment cost is disbursed in four years:  10 percent in the
first year, 30 percent in the second year, 40 percent in the third
year, and 20 percent in the fourth year.
(v)      Operating cost for running the various facilities proposed are
already included in the general operating cost of the refinery.
Therefore, no operating cost is included separately for these items.
(vi)     After the iqodification of the waste water treatment, it is estimated
to save about 17,000 tons per year of oil (US$2.0 million).
(vii)    For the condensate recovery, the savings estimated are about 130,000
cubic meters per year of boiler feed water (US$0.20 million) and
about US $0.25 million per year by postponing an investment of about
US$2.5 million for the expansion of the demineralization plant.
(viii)   For the replacement of laboratory equipment about 50,000 tons of
product upgradation is estimated (US$1.0 million).
(ix)     By the installation of the data logging and shipment computer, about
50,000 tons per year of additional upgradation of products is
estimated (US$1.0 million).
(x)      The estimated costs and benefits are sumiarized as follows:
