TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETUOLEW  CORPORATION
FOR A REFINERIES REHBILITATION PROJE
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for US$27.7 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on
standard variable interest rate for 15 years including 3 years of grace and
would help finance the rehabilitation of the refineries at Warri and
Kaduna.
2.       Background.  Investments in the petroleum industry are about
US$600 million a year compared to about US$1.7 billion for the gross fixed
capital formation of the economy as a whole. The total investment to date
in the refining industry alone is about US$2,500 million. Since petroleum
resources will remain Nigeria's dominant source of foreign exchange for the
foreseeable future, the country's energy policy is geared to undertake
long-term investments in the oil sector to ensure that productive capacity
is maintained to the maximum extent possible. Present output of products
from the three operating refineries in Nigeria amounts to about 6 million
tons per year even though the total installed capacity of about 13 million
tons per year should have produced about 11.5 million tons. Consequently,
import of refined products to meet the domestic demand amounted to about
5.4 million tons in 1987. A fourth refinery of about 6 million tons per
year capacity was commissioned in March 1989. NNPC now gives priority to
increasing productivity in the existing facilities through low cost
rehabilitation/modernization and management improvement programs. This
approach is expected to reduce the cost of petroleum products supplied for
domestic consumption and increase the potential for additional foreign
exchange earnings through increased product export from the fourth
refinery.
3.       Bank involvement in Nigeria's petroleum energy sector started with
the Bank/UNDP Energy Assessment mission in 1982 which identified policy
options for utilization of gas reserves, analyzed investment priorities,
provided a framework for technical assistance and advised on the
implementation of energy programs. The Bank's efforts have increased
awareness within the Nigerian Government of the need to rewolve complex
issues in the country's energy sector, including the need .or energy price
adjustments. The energy assessment will be updated by the proposed Bank
Energy Sector review mission. Meanwhile the Bank is contributing to the
development of a policy framework for attracting international oil
companies to make investments, for setting economic criteria for recovery
of associated gas being flared, for establishing the principle of long run
marginal cost as the basis for consumer pricing and for inducing
appropriate inter-fuel substitution. The Bank also contributed to the
dialogue on pricing of petroleum products, resulting, in April 1988, in the
first significant price adjustments. Through the Public Expenditure Review
missions, the Bank has helped the Government and NNPC evaluate energy
sector investments ar define a program of more realistic investments in



- 2 -
the power and petroleum subsectors, in line with the Government's tight
budgetary position. The Bank's first loan to NNPC, in May 1984, was
designed to help accelerate the utilization of Nigeria's gas resources and
emphasize institution building, including training and operating
assistance, to enable NNPC to manage, operate and maintain efficiently the
existing facilities. Since institution building is a slw process, these
activities would require sustained Bank efforts over the next few years.
For the future, the Bank would continue to act as a sounding board for
important policy decisions in the energy sector, help define investment
priorities and mobilize co-financing for priority investments.
4.       Rationale for lank Involvement.  NNPC is preseantly undergoing the
ixdtial stages of a thorough reorganization started in June 1988 with a
view to transforming it into a commercialized, integrated international
company. The conversion of NNPC from its total dependency on Government
for capital funding to becoming a profit driven commercial organization,
independent of government support, is a major transformation. As part of
its new investment strategy, NNPC is looking into various possibilities to
improve the existing capacity utilization in preference to new investments
which hinge on suitable preventive maintenance procedures, spare parts
funding and inventory planning. The proposed loan would address these
bottlenecks and complement NNPC's institutional approach to preventive
maintenance, decision making on investments and repairs and rehabilitation
of its assets.
5.       Proiject Objectives. The main project objectives are to improve:
Mi)    NNPC's institutional approach to preventive maintenance,
decision making on investments and repairs and
rehabilitation of its assets;
Cii)   utilization and efficiency of its existing refineries; and
(iii) monitoring and control of environmental pollution on
account of oil spillage from its refineries.
6.       Proiect Description. The proposed project would comprise for
Warri and Kaduna Refineries: (i) waste water treatment; (ii) condansate
recovery system modification; (iii) laboratory equipment; (iv) workshop on
preventive maintenance, corrosion and environmental protection to be
conducted by experienced professionals; and (v) diagnostic operations
studies and engineering studies to review existing facilities and recommend
mediumllong term requirements of the two refineries to improve their
operational efficiencies to international standards. In addition, for the
Warri Refinerys (i) power generating system study; (ii) replacement of
fire water lines; (iii) essential spare parts; and (iv) instrumentation
replacement; and, for the Kaduna Refinery, inclusion of a data logging
computer. There is also a provision to replenish in the future the stock
of essential spare parts and materials required for the satisfactory
operation and maintenance of the two refineries. The total cost of the



-3-
project is estimated at US$39.2 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$27.7 millon (712). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts, methods of procurement and of
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
time table of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Nigeria are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7505-WI dated June 8,
1989 is attached.
7.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, NNPC agreed that it would (i)
cause the fixed assets of the two refineries to be revalued; (ii) submit
all contracts and agreements worth above US$100,000 for the Bank -eview;
(iii) appoint full-time project managers, assisted with teams for the Warri
and Kaduna refineries; (iv) establish and maintain by July 1, 1990
preventive maintenance schemes in its refir ties, satisfactory to the Bank;
(v) establish limits of pollutants and maintain pollution control measures
by July 1, 1991 as per industry norms; (vi) prepare for the Bank review the
terms of ref~erence for the diagnostic operations studies to evaluate the
long term need for cost reduction and cost efficiency improvement in the
two refineries; cause such studies to be completed by June 30, 1989, and
the subsequent engineering studies by December 31, 1989; (vii) by October
1, 1989 prepare for Bank review a training program for refinery personnel
in preventive maintenance and pollution control; and (viii) utilize the
funds provided by the Bank (US$6.0 million equivalent) to establish an NNPC
Refineries account exclusively for the purchase of essential spare parts,
chemicals, and catalysts for Warri and Kaduna refineries and ensure the
timely purchase of foreign exchange to replenish it, which will be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
8.       Project Benefits and Risks.  The economic benefits from the
various project components are expected froms (i) an increase in the
capacity utilization of the two refineries; (ii) increases in the general
operational efficiency; and (iii) reduced cost of operation and
maintenance. The improved operation of the refineries would also have a
direct effect on the efficiency of NNPC's Petrochemicals Phase I
investments. By improving the waste water treatment systems in the two
refineries, the project helps in reducing environmental pollution to normal
industry standards. Since all items included in the project are for
improving existing facilities, the project preparation is well advanced and
the project components are identifisd in specific detail, no major risk is
antic*ipated in the implementation. Since the operation of many of the
facilities is essential for the continuous operation of the refineries, the
rehabilitation work needs to be scheduled to synchronize with the
refineries' turn-around program to the masimum extent possible. There
could be some delay in the completion of some of the items on this account.
The engineering contractor will be asked to prepare a detailed time
schedule taking this aspect into account, which will be monitored during
the Bank's supervision missions. An added benefit of the project is that
it would pave the ground for future Bank operations aimed at the overall
rationalization of the petroleum sector in general and NNPC's operations in
particular.
