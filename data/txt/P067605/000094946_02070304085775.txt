Financed with the support of the World Bank
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
DATE: June 2002



Description of the Project
1.    Under the proposed Project the Bank will assist the Borrower to (i) strengthen its
national capacity for disaster management, and (ii) reduce urban vulnerability to natural
hazards. In order to achieve these objectives, the Project shall have the following
components:
Component 1: Strengthening the national capacity for disaster management
through:
(a) Developing an integrated early warning system;
(b) Carrying out a study of the events leading to the floods;
(c) Carrying out a study of vulnerability reduction in the Bouzareah
catchment;
(d) Carrying out a study of urban vulnerability of the Wilaya of Algiers;
and
(e) Strengthening the Borrower's Implementing Agencies through the
provision of goods, equipment, services and training to support
improved disaster management.
Component 2: Emergency physical works through:
(a) Building flood storage and conveyance structures in the Oued Koriche
catchment;
(b) Reconstruction of flood embankments and soil protection in the Massif
of Bouzareah catchment;
(c) Reforestation in the Massif of Bouzareah catchment ; and
(d) Construction of 5000 housing units and ancillary facilities to relocate
families presently living in hazardous and vulnerable areas.
Component 3: Project Management

Environmental Policy Framework
2.    The long term impact of the project is considered to be essentially positive and
would lead to a significantly lower vulnerability in the area. Since the Project is being
prepared under the Bank's Operational Policy 8.50 as an emergency recovery project, the
Environmental Management Framework defines mitigating measures to be identified and
carried out during the Project implementation in order to prevent any adverse impacts
and to assist in the the effective and timely achievements of the Project objectives. To
comply with Bank's requirements under the Bank's Operational Policy 4.01, the
Environmental Management Framework    has been prepared to address all direct
environmental impacts of the projects which are limited in scope.
The Environmental Impacts of the Project
3.    The environmental impacts of the works involved by the Project will be minimal
and will be addressed in detail during the course of the Project implementation as a result
of the integrated vulnerability reduction study. However, some measures have been
defined in order to reduce, offset or eliminate the eventual damages caused by the works
involved. The resettlement of 5,000 families currently living in areas vulnerable to
natural hazards is the most serious issue and was analyzed very carefully. From the
environmental point of view, the new sites for resettlement of the 5,000 families will be
subjected to environmental screening and environmental management plans will be
prepared as needed to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures will be implemented
and monitored. Besides, the environmental screening and management of the resettlement
sites, the Project aims at removing, offsetting or mitigating all impacts of unregulated
urban development that magnified the adverse consequences of the flash floods of
November 10, 2001. This will be done through works to be carried out on the concerned
watersheds and embankments, and will include slope stabilization by tree plantations,
retention basins and drainage collectors.

Institutional and Legal Framework
4.    In Algeria, the environmental protection is the core mandate of the Ministry of
Land Planning   and Environnement (MATE). Environmental impact assessment is
regulated by the Decree 90-78. The MATE is currently upgrading environmental policies
and the decree 90-78 is being revised to make it consistent with international standards.
To implement its environmental management and protection mandates, the MATE has
decentralized offices (Environment Inspectorates) within the 48 Wilayas of the country.
The Wilaya of Algiers has an Environment Inspectorate staffed with  engineers,
technicians and administrative assistants. The Environmental Inspectorate is also
equipped with basic basic equipments and has a budget for the fulfillment of its very
mandate.
5.    However, the mission of the Environment Inspectorate is constrained by the
centralized administrative structure and the lack of communication between sectors.
Furthermore, the control and monitoring functions are constrained by the complexity of
the procedures, the limited human and material resources and the lack of awareness of the
different economic actors on environmental issues.
Environment Inspections' Role Under the Project
6.    Notwithstanding the constraints mentioned above, the Environment Inspectorate
will have to implement a central function in the monitoring of the environmental aspects
of the Project. But to do so, it will need to be strengthened through the following
measures: (a) technical assistance and training on the monitoring of development and
construction projects including evaluation of  cost/benefits, and (b) provision of
equipment and goods including vehicles, computers, cameras and other office
equipements.
