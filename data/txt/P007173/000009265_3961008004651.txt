MEMORANDIUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO EL SALVADOR
FOR AN ENERGY SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of El Salvador for the equivalent of US$65 million
to help finance an Energy Sector Modernization Project. The loan will be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace. The Government of El Salvador (GOES) will onlend US$62 million
equivalent to the Comisi6n Ejecutiva Hidroeledctrica del Rfo Lempa (CEL) at the same
Bank lending terms. Cofinancing of US$20 million is expected under the Japan
Accelerated Cofinancing Facility (EXIMBANK).
Country and Sector Background
2.    Macroeconomic Reforms. During the 1980s, El Salvador's key
macroeconomic and social indicators declined due to structural imbalances, the 1986
earthquake and the civil war. In 1989, the GOES launched a comprehensive
macroeconomic reform program, supported by the IMF and the Bank (SAL 1, 1991),
which increased growth (from 1.1 % in 1989 to 3.4% in 1990, 3.5% in 1991, 4.6% in
1992, 5.1% in 1993 and 5.8%, provisionally, in 1994), reduced inflation (from
23.5% in 1989 to 7% in 1994) and increased real minimum wages (from US$540 per
month in 1989 to US$935 in 1993). The second phase of the program is underway,
again supported by the IMF and by the Bank, through a second structural adjustment
loan (SAL II, successfully completed and fully disbursed in December 1994) and a
technical assistance loan for the power sector (TAL) of US$11 million approved in
1991. The reforms focus on: (a) modernizing the public sector (e.g., expenditure
management, tax policy and administration, the civil service, and privatization of
some activities); (b) fostering private sector export-led growth; (c) improving the
efficiency of social services and reducing poverty; and (d) insuring that development
will be environmentally sustainable over the long-term. In addition, SAL II supports
reforms in the hydrocarbons sector and the TAL also supports the development of an
institutional and regulatory framework for protecting the environment.
3.    Sector Organization and Performance. Until 1989, the energy sector was
characterized by a high degree of government intervention and an inadequate
institutional framework. CEL was responsible for policy, planning and operations for
the whole energy sector. It controlled all upstream activities in the petroleum
subsector and all forms of hydrocarbon imports, as well as the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity. The latter function, which was originally
the responsibility of private utilities, was transferred to CEL in 1986, at the end of the
concession period. However, the distribution companies have retained their original
structure and limited operational autonomy. In 1990, a newly created Directorate of
Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons in the Ministry of Economy took over all petroleum
activities. Within the power sector, CEL has continued to operate as a vertically
integrated entity.



4.     The economic growth of the past four years has accelerated the demand for
energy and shifted the pattern of consumption markedly. Total energy consumption
grew at 6% p.a. over 1989-1993; there was also a shift away from traditional fuels,
with firewood's share of final consumption declining by 17%, while petroleum and
electricity's share increasing by 4% and 2%, respectively. The share consumed by
transport, industry and agriculture increased by 3.9% while that of the
commercial/residential sector declined by 4%. El Salvador has limited indigenous
energy resources, mainly geothermal and hydropower potential whose commercial
feasibility has not yet been verified. This, coupled with the increase in energy demand
and a shift to commercial fuels, will mean greater future reliance on oil imports.
5.     In spite of past reforms, energy prices are still distorted. The import of
petroleum products, although officially liberalized, remains a de-facto monopoly of
RASA, a private joint venture that has the only installed capacity for fuel storage in
the country. Domestic oil prices continue to be controlled by the Ministry of
Economy, with uneven adjustments to international prices. An import parity pricing
formula is being recommended by the Bank to define price caps for fuels during an
interim period until the market is fully liberalized. Diesel and LPG are presently
subsidized, resulting in a black market and a fiscal drain of about US$30 million in
1993.
6.     Electric power consumption has grown rapidly over the last four years, (by
8.5% in 1990, 6.0% in 1991, 5.8% in 1992, 15.6% in 1993 and 9.5% in 1994), with
the commercial and industrial sectors growing fastest. This rapid growth has been due
to increased economic activity and the absence of demand side management policies
and programs with the very high growth of 1993 being explained by the easing of
supply shortages. Nevertheless, due to the low level of electricity coverage (61 %)
and moderate industrial development, power consumption remains low (418 kWh per
capita compared to over 1,200 kWh per capita for Costa Rica and Panama).
7.     Electricity service is unreliable, with voltage and frequency variations higher
than acceptable standards. Equipment in generating plants and in transmission
facilities has deteriorated seriously over the last 12 years, due to sabotage and
continuous overloading. Maintenance has been insufficient because: (a) resources for
the power sector were insufficient due to inadequate tariffs (para. 8); and (b)
resources earmarked for maintenance were used instead to increase security staff and
repair transmission line damage during the war. These factors, combined with the
recent acceleration in electricity demand, have strained the power system to its limits.
8.     Electricity prices have not been based on economic criteria nor have rates
been adjusted to reflect inflation, devaluations, or operating cost increases. No formal
mechanism currently exists for setting or adjusting prices. Average tariffs for
electricity sharply declined in real terms from USc 6.2 per kWh in 1982 to USc 3.0
per kWh in 1990 (65% to 32% of long run marginal costs (LRMC)). Thus, the power
sector (i.e. CEL) increasingly depended on government transfers (about US$40
million p.a. in 1991-1993). However, electricity rates have increased in recent years,
and with the last increase of about 30% in June 1994 the average tariff reached USc



- 3 -
7.6 per kWh, approximately 70% of marginal costs. Additional tariff adjustments
agreed with the Bank, as part of this operation, and with the IDB (the latter under
their most recent loan to the power sector in El Salvador) will bring tariffs to 85% of
marginal costs by 1996 and to 100% of marginal costs by 1999.
9.     Tariff increases will improve CEL's finances, but if the growing demand for
power is to be met efficiently, tariff adjustments must be also accompanied by major
changes in the sector's structure. CEL's roles as policy maker and regulator conflict
with its operational functions. Also, as frequently happens with state-owned-
enterprises, the government has systematically intervened in the utility's commercial
affairs (e.g. in pricing, staffing, investment allocations and financing), which has
reduced CEL's accountability for performance. These factors diminished CEL's
ability to mobilize the resources required to meet the growing demand for energy and
power and meant that the power sector imposed a heavy burden on the public budget,
absorbing scarce resources that could have supported priority programs in other
sectors. In addition, CEL's centralized, vertically integrated control structure and its
insulation from competition have sharply limited incentives to invest and operate
efficiently.
10.   Proposed Energy Sector Reforms. GOES has recognized the urgent need to
address these fundamental structural and pricing problems and, with assistance
provided under the TAL, it has prepared a far-reaching program for restructuring the
legal and institutional framework in order to increase investment and operating
efficiency. The centerpiece of this program is a set of laws, presented to the
Legislative Assembly in April 1995 aimed at restructuring the power sector. The
three items of legislation are the Electricity Law, and two separate laws establishing,
respectively, the National Energy Council (NEC) and the Electricity and
Hydrocarbons Regulatory Commission (EHRC). The Electricity Law separates
planning, regulatory and operating functions in the power sector, ensures open access
of power generators to the national interconnected grid and to distribution networks
and establishes the procedures by which bidding for generation projects and
distribution concessions is undertaken. It also calls for the environmental assessment
of proposed projects and proof of project clearance by the appropriate environmental
authority as part of sector licensing arrangements. The EHRC, as established under
the proposed law, would be an independent entity with the power to regulate rates for
monopoly portions of the electricity sector, in addition to its other functions. The
NEC would be responsible for energy policy and indicative sector planning.
11.    A Hydrocarbons Law has also been presented to the Assembly. This will
simplify and reduce unnecessary regulation of prices, exploration and distribution of
petroleum and derivatives. It includes technical and quality standards for petroleum
products and introduces measures to protect the environment against oil spills and
pollution.
12.    The participation of private investors in the energy sector is essential to obtain
greater efficiency through competition and to finance much-needed investments.
Independent power producers (IPPs) will be allowed to sell power to CEL, to



- 4 -
distribution companies or directly to large consumers. CEL has contracted to purchase
80MW from an IPP, due to start production in late 1995. The Legislative Assembly
has already approved legislation for the sale of the distribution companies and a plan
for their privatization (known as the Power Distribution Plan, or Plan de Gestion del
Servicio Publico de Distribucion de Energia Electrica) was submitted to the President
of El Salvador by CEL on April 4, 1995. The new legal framework (para. 10)
defines a concession regime for the private sector in power distribution with service
responsibilities and provisions to cancel contracts in the event of poor service or other
violations of the law and regulations.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
13.    The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for El Salvador was presented to the
Board in conjunction with SAL 11 on September 17, 1993. It emphasized modernizing
the public sector, fostering private sector-led growth, investing in human capital, and
managing the environment prudently. The proposed project is fully consistent with the
CAS as it focuses on improving sectoral efficiency and the productivity of existing
facilities through: (a) refurbishing existing facilities and expanding the system to help
serve new demand in the commercial, industrial and household sectors; (b) continuing
support for legal and institutional reforms in the energy sector; and (c) assisting in the
preparation of engineering studies for future projects. The proposed project is also
consistent with Bank policy on lending to the energy sector. Bank presence is
essential to help GOES and CEL prepare additional legislation, restructure the sector
and execute the privatization program. In addition, the Bank can play a catalytic role
in securing and coordinating cofinancing for future operations, and reducing private
investors' perceptions of risk.
14.   In recent years, the Bank has played a pivotal role via the ongoing TAL in
designing a reform program for the sector and in evaluating various restructuring
options. It has also coordinated closely with the IDB and assisted GOES in mobilizing
substantial donor support for the reform program and facilitated contacts between
GOES and potential private investors. The Bank's continued involvement in the
program would reinforce the fundamental policy and institutional changes, and, given
the breadth of reforms contemplated, could provide important lessons for other
countries of comparable size and sophistication.
Project Objectives
15.    The proposed project will support GOES's objectives for the power sector,
which are to: (a) improve service reliability and coverage by rehabilitating,
modernizing and expanding power generation, transmission and distribution systems
and (b) assist in restructuring of the sector and reform of the regulatory framework
through the preparation of secondary legislation and procedures, and to support the
EHRC and NEC when their respective laws are enacted. In conjunction with the
project, the GOES is establishing policies to promote environmentally sound
investments and operating procedures by establishing project guidelines and quality
standards and by strengthening management and enforcement capacities.

Project Description
16.   The proposed Energy Sector Modernization (ESM) Project is part
(representing 11 % of financing) of the 1995-99 time slice of the Power Sector
Investment Program and will support: (a) studies and technical assistance (US$9.4
million including contingencies or 8% of total project cost); (b) rehabilitation of the
existing hydroelectric plants Guajoyo, Cerron Grande and 5 de Noviembre, and the
addition of a third unit at Cerron Grande (US$75.2 million including contingencies or
81 %); and (c) modernization of CEL's telecommunications and information systems
(US$7.9 million including contingencies or 9%). The total project cost is US$92.6
million, and including interest during construction, financing requirements are
US$101.2 million. The IBRD will provide US$65.0 million of this, with US$20.0
million being provided by EXIMBANK and US$16.2 million provided by CEL.
Retroactive financing, to the amount of US$6 million (9% of the loan amount), is
available for eligible expenditures for project equipment, materials and consultancy
services incurred by CEL and the Ministry of Planning (MIPLAN) after April 1,
1995. It is expected that this retroactive financing will be used to fund consultant
support for GOES and CEL to implement the restructuring program and prepare final
engineering designs for investments to be funded by the project, as well as for any
urgent rehabilitation works required at the hydroelectric power plants.
17.   The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A;
withdrawal of the proceeds of the loan, the amounts and methods of procurement and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in El Salvador are given in
Schedules C and D respectively. Two maps showing infrastructure facilities and the
power system installations are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12528-
ES, dated May 26, 1995, is being distributed separately.
18.   The 1995-99 time slice of the Power Sector Investment Program calls for the
modernization of 388 MW installed in existing power plants and the installation of
200 MW of new generating capacity (including at least 80 MW of private power), the
rehabilitation of the sub-transmission and distribution systems damaged during the
war, and the most urgent expansions needed for the transmission and distribution
networks. In addition it supports the implementation of reforms embodied in the new
legal and regulatory framework for the sector. In the power subsector these are: (a)
deregulation of power generation and promotion of greater private sector
participation; (b) developing regulations for transmission and distribution
concessioning and pricing; (c) the formulation of environmental assessment guidelines
and procedures and of pollution emission and ambient quality standards, applicable to
public and private sector projects and activities; (d) privatization of the power
distribution system; (e) strengthening CEL's administrative, financial and
environmental management capacity; and (f) supporting the new regulatory and
planning bodies for the sector, EHRC and NEC. The Program will be financed with
funds from the proposed IBRD and EXIMBANK loans, and by the IDB, CEL and the
private sector.

Project Implementation
19.    MIPLAN will execute the technical assistance component of the project related
to the privatization programs and the planning and regulatory institutions, with the
assistance of the inter-governmental coordinating body (UES), composed of
representatives of CEL and the Ministries of Planning and Economy. CEL will
execute the engineering and environmental studies and the investment component.
CEL will also assist GOES in its efforts to carry out the privatization program for the
power sector and supervise the technical activities of the distribution utilities until the
regulatory agency is operating. To mitigate risks of slow project implementation, CEL
will appoint a Project Director to head a Project Implementation Unit. Targets for the
power sector's financial, commercial and technical performance, annual and mid-term
project reviews, and auditing arrangements have been agreed during negotiations.
Project Sustainability
20.    The project will build on the existing consensus for change in El Salvador.
The sector restructuring is designed to strengthen the institutional framework, promote
private sector participation, ensure adequate financing, and improve sector efficiency.
Both supply-side measures and demand management further strengthen the project's
technical sustainability. Supply side measures for energy conservation include
reducing technical losses in distribution networks, increasing the efficiency of plant
operations, and improving power service reliability. On the demand side, reform of
the electricity tariff structure and significant rate adjustments will further reinforce
conservation efforts. The agreed tariff increases will provide CEL with enhanced
profits and a strengthened financial structure. Though its level of external debt is
forecast to significantly increase over the next five years, given the tariff increases
CEL will be in a position to bear this increase. A one year delay in implementing the
increases will reduce profitability and cause CEL to delay part of the investment
program. Failure to increase tariffs from present levels will cause CEL to suffer
increasing losses. In this situation it would not be able to fund its planned investment
program. The Bank will review progress on implementing CEL's investment plan on
a semi-annual basis (see para. 22). Environmental sustainability will be enhanced by
the preparation of guidelines, standards, plans for mitigating the environmental impact
of energy projects, and the strengthening of enforcement capacity of environmental
and regulatory agencies.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement
21.    The Bank has made one credit and eight loans to the power subsector in El
Salvador. The latest was the Power Sector TAL (Loan 3389-ES) in 1991 (following a
hiatus in lending of about 14 years), which also supported studies for the
hydrocarbons subsector. The main lessons learned are: (a) the power sector's financial
viability can only be maintained if tariffs are aligned with marginal costs and private
investors participate in financing expansion needs; (b) technical and management
capacity for project implementation has been relatively weak; and (c) the pace of
implementation and disbursement assumed at appraisal has been overly optimistic, due



- 7 -
to lengthy delays in procurement. These lessons have been incorporated into the
design of the proposed project: significant tariff increases have already been enacted
(para. 8) and a satisfactory automatic tariff adjustment mechanism has been agreed
upon. Technical and managerial capacity will be strengthened through technical
assistance defined in the proposed project. More timely project implementation will be
facilitated by advanced preparation of engineering designs and bidding documents and
the assignment of key staff to project procurement and disbursement functions. In
addition, implementation will be expedited through in-country seminars for CEL staff
on procurement and disbursement procedures.
Agreed Actions
22.    Satisfactory understandings have been reached with GOES and CEL on the
major policy issues, particularly on the legal, institutional, environmental, technical
and pricing aspects. A. Documents Presented During Negotiations. GOES furnished
the Bank with: (a) a letter of energy sector policy; (b) evidence that the agreed
legislation (Electricity Law, and laws for the creation of EHRC and NEC) was
received by the Legislative Assembly on April 25, 1995; and (c) plans for restructur-
ing the energy sector, restructuring CEL and increasing electricity tariffs levels to
reach marginal costs by 1999. CEL furnished the Bank with: (a) a satisfactory
Performance Plan to improve efficiency in the administrative, financial and technical
management of CEL; (b) an updated Power Sector Investment Program, including a
proposal for private participation in generation; (c) a plan for the privatization of the
power distribution system, submitted by CEL to the President of El Salvador and (d)
evidence that the execution of the Sectoral Environmental Assessment Study was
initiated (para. 23). B. Agreements Reached During Negotiations. GOES and CEL
agreed to: (a) carry out the plans indicated in A above (the plan for restructuring the
energy sector is to be implemented when the Electricity Law, the EHRC Law and the
NEC Law are enacted); (b) carry out the Sectoral Environmental Assessment and
furnish to the Bank its recommendations by December 31, 1995 and promptly
thereafter adopt an Environmental Action Plan satisfactory to the Bank, and discuss
with the Bank progress on its execution not later than June 30, 1996; (c) CEL and/or
NEC shall discuss with the Bank at each review of the project any proposed changes
to the Power Sector Investment Program; (d) create at CEL by September 1, 1995 a
Project Implementation Unit to be responsible for the execution of the components of
the project that are the responsibility of CEL, and appoint a full-time Project Director,
with qualifications acceptable to the Bank, to be in full control of the execution of the
project and to act as coordinator with the Bank; (e) submit to the Bank: (i) semi-
annual progress reports for the project and for the Power Sector Investment Program
in a format satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) annual financial statements audited by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, no later than four months after the end of
each financial year; and (f) (i) undertake jointly with the Bank annual reviews and a
Mid-Term Review of the implementation of the proposed project, including the
Environmental Action Plan, and (ii) undertake any corrective measures (acceptable to
the Bank) required to remedy or mitigate any shortcomings in performance, and
inform the Bank of the new targets for the coming year. C. Condition of
Effectiveness. GOES and CEL will provide the Bank with a signed Subsidiary Loan



- 8 -
Agreement between both. D. Condition for Disbursement of Selected
Expenditures. Disbursements to fund the technical assistance components of the
project related to sector restructuring and strengthening will be made subject to the
passage of the Electricity Law, the NEC Law and the EHRC Law and the
establishment of the NEC and the EHRC in a form satisfactory to the Bank.
Environmental Aspects
23.   GOES is currently engaged in a comprehensive effort to halt environmental
degradation and improve the management of its natural resources. This involves legal
reform, strategic planning and institutional strengthening within the environmental
agencies. The effort is supported by the IDB, through the "El Salvador Environmental
Program," approved in June 1993, and by the Bank, through the SAL Il/TAL
projects. These initiatives include drafting a National Environmental Law, preparing
an Environmental Strategy and Action Plan, and redefining the role, powers and
internal organization of the National Council for the Environment (CONAMA) and its
Executive Secretariat (SEMA). The proposed loan will provide technical assistance to
strengthen CEL and the new regulatory institution, EHRC, enabling them to carry out
environmental impact assessments and the licensing of public and private projects. In
addition, it will fund environmental impact assessments for four of CEL's
hydroelectric plants as well as the purchase of sedimentation control equipment. The
proposed project's environmental rating is categorized as "Type B", and although a
separate Sectoral Environmental Assessment is not required for the project, GOES,
CEL and the Bank considered it appropriate to prepare one to identify priorities in
institutional strengthening, preparation of guidelines for environmental impact
assessments, definition of pollution standards, and evaluation, mitigation and
monitoring of social and environmental impacts of existing and future facilities.
Therefore, a Sectoral Environmental Assessment will be carried out, under terms of
reference agreed with the Bank, funded by the ongoing Power TAL (and if necessary
with funds from the existing project). GOES has, in its Statement of Energy Policy,
confirmed its commitment to executing and implementing the Sectoral Environmental
Assessment. This study will be completed by the end of 1995. A comprehensive
Action Plan, acceptable to the Bank, is expected to be implemented promptly
thereafter, and progress on its implementation shall be discussed with the Bank not
later than June 30, 1996.
Program Objective Categories
24.   PV (private sector development). The project will assist GOES in
restructuring the sector to introduce private sector participation in the generation and
distribution of electricity.
Project Benelits
25.   The technical assistance components of the project can be expected to bring
substantial benefits to the sector, in terms of strengthening the capabilities of CEL and
other existing government entities involved in the sector, as well as providing support



-9-
to the new bodies to be created under the GOES's legislative program. The investment
components of the project will increase output from existing facilities, improving
system reliability. The improvement in CEL's telecommunications and information
systems will also allow it to operate the system more reliably and efficiently. The
1995-99 time slice of the Power Sector Investment Program, which the project
supports, will allow 185,000 new consumers to be connected to the system, increasing
the proportion of the population with access to electricity from 61% to 68%. The
great majority of new connections will be residential consumers, and expansion of the
system will allow a shift away from traditional fuels, such as firewood, to electricity.
In addition, a Sectoral Environmental Assessment is being undertaken in conjunction
with the project, which will assist in introducing environmental considerations into
management and planning decisions in the energy sector (para. 23).
Project Risks
26.    The investment components of the project (relating to the rehabilitation and
modernization of generation and telecommunications/information assets) do not
involve any unusual technical complications. Under the loan, CEL will create a
Project Implementation Unit to ensure smooth implementation (see para. 19).
Although the GOES is strongly committed to the legislative package, there remains a
possibility that the laws will not pass through Congress in a form that is satisfactory to
the Bank. This could affect the implementation of the restructuring plan of the power
sector and the specific technical assistance components related to this. Therefore it
will be a condition of disbursement for these technical assistance components that the
required legislation be passed and the subsequent necessary actions for the
establishment of the concerned institutions will have been taken. The legislative
package has been developed in extensive consultation with the Bank, and GOES's
commitment to reforming the sector mitigate the risk that the legislation will not pass.
The package is part of a series of ongoing sectoral reforms (para. 28).
27.    The main risk to CEL's financial viability is that tariffs are not increased as
planned (see para. 20). GOES has made a commitment under the project to increase
tariffs to marginal cost levels by 1999 (see para. 22). If tariffs are not increased over
present levels, CEL would face increasing losses and be unable to fund its planned
investment program. A slippage of one year of the planned tariff increases would
reduce profits and force CEL to delay part of the investment program. GOES's
commitment to increase tariffs, and the recent tariff increases, mitigate this risk. In
addition, the Bank will review progress on implementation of the investment program
(see para. 22). Beyond the risks associated with tariffs, CEL, like other electric
power utilities, faces risks relating to currency and interest rates and fuel supply costs.
These risks will be manageable with the higher projected profit margins and better
cash generation and CEL has initiated discussions with an international commercial
bank regarding the management of financial risks. The main risk to viable economic
returns for the rehabilitation and modernization of the existing hydroelectic stations is
that the increase in output attributable to the rehabilitations might not be as high as
anticipated. However, overall plant availability and capacity would have to fall
substantially to pose such a risk. Adequate maintenance of the plant, the financing of

which would be well within CEL's capbilities under the financial projections and
which is not expensive for hydroelectric generation, as opposed to thermal generation,
would mitigate the risk of this occurring.
28.    As far as the achievement of project objectives is concerned, GOES's actions
to date have shown its strong commitment to reforming the sector to introduce
competition in generation and supply and to introduce private sector participation in
the generation and distribution of electricity. The Legislative Assembly has already
approved the privatization of the distribution companies and CEL has presented to the
President of El Salvador a plan for their transfer to the private sector. CEL has
contracted to purchase 80MW from an independent power plant, due to start operation
in late 1995. The legislative package introduced to the Assembly in April 1995
represents a continuation of these reforms.
Recommendation
29.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Bank's Articles of
Agreement and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
