                         The Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs (MoJHA) which implements this project continues to be very supportive and actively engaged in the EJSSP as are the other direct
                         beneficiaries, the General Council of Courts (GCC), the administrative courts, the Court Decision Enforcement Agency (CDEA), the participating law schools and legal aid centers.
                         Recognizing the good progress made, all agencies were equally open to discussing the few remaining delays in implementation, finding solutions to address these and thinking about

                         Since the last supervision mission, the project has made substantial progress in a number of areas and is beginning to show some excellent results. Over the last 10 months,
                         disbursement rates have increased from 6% to 44%. Construction work on 2 of the 4 General Council of Courts (GCC) buildings and 1 of the 3 Court Decision Enforcement Agency

                         (CDEA) buildings have been completed and that the remaining buildings are scheduled to be finished by the end of this calendar year. As is set out elsewhere significant progress
                         has been made since the last supervision mission in ensuring that the new software and connections will soon be available. With regards to the final indicator – increased access to
                         information – 1,000 paralegals have been trained and are providing legal advice across the country. The project has already surpassed the planned number of laws and other legal
                         information to be translated into minority languages. A substantial amount of legal information has been generated, is available on websites and is being distributed to various
                         information centers and legal clinics. At the time of the mission, the PIU was unable to report on the full penetration of distribution efforts of such information. The project has now
                         been restructured, the closing date was extended to June 2013, and the PDO and results framework were amended accordingly.
