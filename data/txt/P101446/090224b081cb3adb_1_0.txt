                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Enhanced Justice Sector Services Project (EJSS) has been highly relevant and important for Mongolia's economic development since its inception; justice sector reform is key to
                         democratic development and essential to economic development. Therefore, it is not surprising that justice reform is again a core priority of the new and current government in 2013.
                         The completed work feeds well into the new reform strategy and provides the tools for an envisioned broader justice system management reform and capacity creation.

                         After significant start-up delays, client commitment contributed to substantial uptake of project activities resulting in a steady increase in disbursements from just 6% in June of 2010
                         to almost 91% by mid-June 2013. After much delay for the first two years, despite many ups and downs since then and some serious remaining challenges, it has to be recognized
                         that the client managed to implement a project designed for 5 years, basically in 3 years, with a 6 month extension and only few activities remaining to be completed before the end of

                         the project. As a result of these delays, it is currently only possible to track outputs; it is feasible that in the coming months there will be more capacity to capture PDO outcome
                         measures.

                         The project went through significant restructuring in 2012 to reflect the need to change planned construction due to environmental safeguard issues, a significant and continuing
                         increase in construction cost, and a US$1 million shortfall of funds due to an envisioned grant to support technical assistance not materializing. During the last year of operations, the
                         project also had to further scale down due to an adverse development of the exchange rate. A minor restructuring to reflect changes in disbursement categories was required in 2013.

                         The adjusted construction component provided for the construction of 4 new court buildings and the refurbishment of one additional court; the project also financed the construction of
                         3 court decision enforcement agency buildings. All new construction/refurbishment was located outside of the capital of Ulaanbaatar, thereby addressing access to justice and service
                         delivery needs in the Aimags. Delays in procurement for these activities were significant but at the the time of this mission only one court building remains in final construction status,
                         and one court enforcement agency building remains in final refurbishment status (replacement of a roof) due to the prior contractor defaulting. Both should be completed by project
                         closing.

                         The project supported the creation of a fiber optic cable network to all courts and court enforcement agencies across this vast country, a significant contribution to developing the
                         basis for more efficient and accountable operations of these agencies. Again, procurement issues have impeded the successful implementation of this activity in a timely manner but
                         at the time of this mission the courts and court enforcement agencies in all but 3 of 21 Aimags are connected.

                         The project supported the development of advanced software to manage administrative court cases and solid case tracking software for the court enforcement agencies. Both have
                         the potential to increase performance in these agencies in terms of efficiency as well as accountability and transparency. Procurement delays resulted in late delivery of this software,
                         meaning that full testing and deployment of the application will come only at the end of the project. Accordingly, results and the actual impact of this software cannot be assessed
                         during the project period. First results may be detectable by September, when the ICR will be completed; measurable outcomes and impact are likely to require one full year of
                         operations.

                         All activities under the project component concerned with providing comprehensive public legal education and enhancing law school education in Mongolia have been completed on
                         time. Targeted assistance to the Kazakh minority groups made measurable contributions to access to justice, especially for poor and disadvantaged groups and poor women in this
                         region, though their future financing through the state budget has yet to be confirmed. Several activities to provide targeted legal aid and public education across districts of
                         Ulaanbaatar, especially in the disadvantaged ger districts have been highly effective and are so cost effective that their likelihood to be sustained is high. To address access to justice
                         needs for people with disabilities, the project also supported the development and wide distribution of laws and other important legal information in braille, a first in Mongolia.

                         Another important and successful component has been the work to support the advancement of law school education. Building upon activities developed under the previous World
                         Bank project, the EJSSP, in close cooperation with the Mongolian Law School Association, the MoJ and MoE, succeeded in supporting the inclusion of a requirement to provide legal

                         clinical education and related standards in the accreditation requirements for all Mongolian law schools. Considering the otherwise limited opportunities for law school students to gain
                         practical experience this is an important element for developing their skills. Not surprisingly, the number of law schools complying with these standards – and using the Bank
                         supported material has increased from 2 in 2012 to 10 in June 2013. In addition, the project supported the development of standard syllabi, teacher and student reading material for
                         now over 20 required and elective law school courses, including many topics that are important to the changing Mongolian environment, such as securities and banking laws. This is
                         the first time such standard teaching and reading material is available, contributing to the overall quality of law school education across Mongolia. The MoE considers these
                         developments as leading best practice models for other higher education branches.

                         Considering the many advancements and results the EJSSP has brought to date it is especially troubling that 2 of 4 PDO indicators will not be met by the end of June, largely due to
                         delay in procurement. As a result the project maintains a moderately unsatisfactory rating. Further measures to address the data shortcomings are being discussed with the client. If
                         it appears at the time of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) finalization that the government can demonstrate that the PDO outputs have materialized, the Bank may
                         reconsider the PDO rating.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Despite substantive outputs and outcomes progress since the last supervision mission and throughout the project's cycle, in specific after the restructuring in April 2012, the project is
                         to be considered as moderately unsatisfactory on "Progress towards achievement of PDO". The main reasons are significant shortcomings and delays in procurement related to key
                         deliverables and the resulting inability to present progress data, especially for two of the four PDO indicators. Steps to ensure all project activities are fully completed by the project's
                         closing date and that relevant data to support project outcomes are available by September have been discussed with the borrower. Still, concerns remain that the outcomes may
                         remain untested and without substantiated results indicators by the end of the completion grace period (October 31, 2013).

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
