Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project's development objective is to enhance the efficiency, transparency and accountability
of justice sector institutions. This objective will be achieved by assisting the Government of
Mongolia to mainstream and scale-up the results achieved, and lessons learned, through the
Mongolia Legal and Judicial Reform Project (LJRP). In order to achieve the goals of
transparency and accountability the following areas will be supported under the project: (i)
Enhancing public legal education on the justice sector (ii) Increasing transparency through
improved access to legal information (iii) Enhancing judicial operations, enforcement and
monitoring of court decisions. The key outcome indicators which will be used to measure
success are: (i) Information on enforcement of court decisions is available and shared between
the Court Enforcement Agency and the General Council of Courts (ii) Discrepancies between
statistical information provided by Court Enforcement Agency and General Council of Courts is
shared and reduced (iii) Improvement in level of court decisions enforced.

              ENHANCED JUSTICE SECTOR SERVICES PROJECT

                               RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce
changes to the Mongolia Enhanced Justice Sector Services Project (EJSSP), IDA Credit No.
4493-MN and IDA Grant No. H413-MN. The proposed restructuring would: (i) modify the
project activities, particularly in the area of court construction, to better target government
strategies and priorities for the development of the justice sector; (ii) revise the project
development objective (PDO) to reflect the project’s new activities; (iii) Amend the results
framework in order to align it with the revised PDO; and (iv) extend the closing date from
December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013, primarily to allow sufficient time to undertake the new
civil works activities since the construction window in Mongolia is relatively short.

2.       The primary reason for the proposed restructuring is the fact that construction of the
Supreme Court building and co-located central judicial archives, which comprised a major
part of Component 3 (and 43% of total project costs), was dropped after consultation with the
Government. Additionally, some co-financing that the project was relying on to
implement certain activities was cancelled, leaving the project short of US$ 1 million
dollars.

3.      The Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs (MOJHA) as well as the Supreme Court
(SC) proposed scaled down and adjusted activities to reflect the need for restructuring, and
reaffirmed their commitment to achieving the development objectives of the project, even
with reduced financing. Finalizing this process, however, took nearly one year.

4.      Based on a comprehensive implementation assessment, the Task Team has confirmed
that the Project Development Objectives (PDO) are still achievable with a more targeted
focus and with adjusted and refined indicators for more effective and efficient project
monitoring and reporting.

5.      The new proposal reflects downscaling of construction of Court Enforcement Agency
(CEA) buildings (from 11 to 3) to ensure that those components essential to achieving the
PDOs, i.e., enhanced information exchange structure among key justice sector agencies,
support for a comprehensive public education and outreach campaign to increase public
understanding of justice values and justice sector operations, and support for improved
law schools education to strengthen the legal profession, are adequately funded. It also
reflects the proposal submitted by the GCC to reallocate funds intended for the Supreme
Court building for other priority civil works at local courts in Aimag centers (provinces)
and at the Soum level. The civil works will be in compliance with the approved
Environmental Safeguard Guidelines (ESG) which have been developed as part of the
Project.
                                              7
6.      To date, the project has adhered to the applicable safeguards policies (indigenous
people and environmental assessment). As a result of new construction sites added to
Component 3 (i.e. a change from one Supreme Court building to 4 small court buildings
and 3 CEA buildings), and based on the advice and review of Safeguard specialists
advising the task team, the project had to be re-categorized as an Environmental Risk “B?
project.

7.     The above mentioned modifications are confirmed by official correspondence
from the newly appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court dated January 28, 2011,
and a request for Amendment of the Financing Agreement from the Ministry of Finance
dated March 15, 2011.


B. PROJECT STATUS

8.      Implementation of the Project has been slow due to the inability to agree on a
specific site for the construction of the new Supreme Court building, as well as a one year
delay in the project becoming effective. Once it became clear that the Supreme Court
construction would incur substantially more costs than originally planned, discussions
were immediately entered into with regards to how best to re-allocate funds in order to
achieve the original (or marginally revised) project development objective and drop the
construction of the Supreme Court. An interim project work plan was agreed upon in
June 2010 to continue key project activities while the restructuring proposal was prepared
and agreed by the Government and submitted to the Bank. The discussion within the
Mongolian Government to finalize the restructuring took close to one more year.
Additionally, some co-financing that the project was relying on to implement certain
activities was cancelled. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) for the project will be carried
out in the Spring of 2012. The Borrower will submit the Mid-Term Review Report for
review by the Bank.

9.      To reflect the slow implementation, the project was rated as “Moderately
Unsatisfactory? for both “Progress towards Achievement of PDO?, and “Overall
Implementation Progress? in the December 2010 Implementation Status and Results
Report. During the June 2011 implementation support mission, it was agreed with the
Borrower that the Bank would consider upgrading the ratings to “Moderately
Satisfactory?, or even “Satisfactory?, provided the Borrower would complete certain
milestones within specific timeframes (as laid out in the June 2011 Aide Memoire).
Good progress has been made in the project between June and October, including:

       a. Commencing construction work on three of the CEA buildings and 4 of the
          GCC buildings;
       b. Finalizing a Memorandum of Understanding between the GCC, GIZ and the
          PIU outlining the roles and responsibilities of each organization in developing
          the software for the administrative courts based on that developed for the civil
          courts;
       c. Effective analysis of the impact that the legal clinics under the project are
          having. The project has invested US$16,000 and, over only 9 months, the
                                            8
          clinics in the Bayan-Ulgii Aimag have managed to directly assist 2065
          individuals - of whom 1117 (54%) were women. The legal issues have ranged
          across very diverse areas including bankruptcy, contract law, family law and
          loan applications. In addition to the direct assistance 4158 people were
          reached through the public education campaigns funded under the project; and
       d. Implementing a framework to adequately report on the monitoring and
          evaluation of the project.

10.     While the PIU has been functional, the oversight function by the Project Steering
Committee (PSC) had been less than optimal. The PSC was restructured in September
2010 and has met three times since that time and has provided clearer direction to the
PIU. The meeting, held on June 22, 2011 during the supervision mission, focused on
agreeing to a more intense involvement of the PSC members, including the establishment
of clear tasks and responsibilities.

11.    As of June 30, 2011, the cumulative project expenditures are US$ 787,786 (16%).
However, due to the construction works being undertaken now, disbursements are
expected to rise to 60% by the calendar year end.

12.    Additional project progress to date includes:

Component 1: Enhancing Public Legal Education in the Justice Sector
   Sub-component: comprehensive legal education reform in law schools to improve
     legal education syllabi and assist legal education institutions to meet both
     national and international standards
     (i)    Training of trainers (substantive knowledge and new interactive teaching
            methods) carried out.
     (ii)   70 professors from 14 law schools received training on core courses
            (constitutional law, civil law, criminal law, administrative law and ethics).
     (iii) Standards for Legal Clinics have been drafted and adopted as an Annex to
            the National Standards on Bachelor Legal Education.
   Sub-component: development and implementation of a bilingual National Public
     Information Strategy:
     (i)    Development and publication of four Mongolian laws, declaration of
            human rights and convention on the rights of persons with disabilities in
            Braille alphabet.
     (ii)   Legal Aid Center in Bayan-Ulgii Aimag functional and providing legal
            services, including translation and printing of 13 laws in Kazakh language.
     (iii) First Mongolian – Kazakh legal glossary developed.
     (iv)   Third public awareness campaign carried out across the country through
            various media sources (TV talks, radio broadcasts, print, community
            engagement).

Component 2: Increasing Transparency through Improved Access to Legal
Information
    Sub-component: development and implementation of a National Justice Sector
      Information Networking Strategy and System:

                                            9
       (i)     Discussions underway with key Mongolian stakeholders on creating
               connectivity between and within the justice sector institutions.
       (ii)    Feasibility study and budget for connectivity solutions developed.
       (iii)   Draft plans for implementation of fiber optic network developed.

Component 3: Enhancing Judicial Operations, Enforcement and Monitoring of
Court Decisions
   Consulting firm for architectural services has prepared architectural drawings for
      the CEA buildings and the GCC court buildings.
   Bidding process for new construction of (i) 3 CEA offices; (ii) 4 new construction
      GCC court buildings and (iii) refurbishment of one GCC building has been
      initiated with bids due July 14, 2011.
   Initial training for court enforcement officers carried out.
   Methodology for development of Administrative Court software completed.

Component 4: Project Management.
   Key staff have been hired and the PIU is fully functional.

13.    An Action Plan was agreed during the June 2011 implementation support mission
with a series of dated milestones. Some delays have been encountered due to the short
construction season in Mongolia, which has affected completion of the civil works under
the project, as has the need to hire a technical specialist to review the best options in
terms of fiber optic connectivity between the justice sector institutions. 1 out of the 5
agreed milestones have been met, and the PIU has informed the task team that the
remaining will be met by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2012.

14.    During the last supervision mission, the task team noted the good progress made
by the PIU since the previous mission in June, 2011. It was agreed to review the gains
made during the “mid-term review? (MTR) scheduled for April of 2012.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Project’s Development Objectives

15.     The project’s development objectives are adjusted from “to enhance the
efficiency, transparency and accountability of justice sector institutions? to the
following, more targeted statement: “to enhance access to justice sector information
and legal advice and increase the efficiency and transparency of the courts and
court enforcement agencies?. The key indicators which will be used to measure success
are the following:
         Data and statistics on enforcement of court decisions is shared regularly
            between the CEA and the GCC.
         Local courts submit electronic cases data regularly to the GCC.
         CEA processes are unified and monitored for increased effectiveness.
         Access to legal information and advice is increased across all Aimags
            (provinces).

16.    The PDO performance indicators have been modified to take into account what
can reasonably be achieved within the adjusted project scope by the extended Closing
Date.

17.    The outcome indicators have also been modified to take into account what can
reasonably be achieved with the adjusted project scope by the extended Closing Date, and
acknowledging the slow implementation experience to date.

18.    The Results Framework has also been modified to include quantifiable indicators
where possible (see Annex 1). Targeted templates for monitoring and evaluation for each
component will be developed with each participating agency under the Project which will
improve upon the more limited survey originally anticipated. The design of such
templates has been agreed with the Borrower and will be in place by the time of the
approval of the Restructuring.

Components

19.      The following would not be financed by the Project:

      (i) Creation of a centralized judicial archive (Component 3). The remainder of the
           originally planned activities will be carried out.
      (ii) Supreme Court construction (Component 3).
      (iii)The original project design had foreseen renovation or construction of eleven (11)
           CEA facilities. The reallocation - as a result of the restructuring – and due to
           higher construction costs - will be adjusted to project financing of three (3) new
           constructions (Component 3).

20.     The revised Borrower project proposal includes (inter alia) the following
activities:

      (i) Construction of four GCC court buildings for remote areas, and extension and
           refurbishment of one GCC court building. (Component 3).
      (ii) Fiber optic connections to the local court offices, GCC, CEA buildings, PGO, and
           prosecutor offices (Component 3).
      (iii)Supply and installation of administrative case management and monitoring
           software to support the development of national justice sector information
           networking strategy and systems (Component 3).

Safeguards

21.    The approved Project was categorized as an Environmental Risk “C? project at
the time of project approval. The applicable safeguard policies triggered were
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) and Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). To date,
the project has adhered to the applicable safeguards policies (indigenous people and
environmental assessment).

                                              11
22.     As a result of new construction sites added to Component 3 (i.e. a change from
one Supreme Court building to 4 small court buildings and 3 CEA buildings), and based
on the advice and review of Safeguard specialists advising the task team, the project had
to be re-categorized as an Environmental Risk “B? project. OP 4.01 is the only safeguard
which remains triggered. To determine the scope of the environmental assessment, the
Bank’s Environmental Specialist visited Ulaanbaatar in early June 2011 and met with the
Borrower. The Bank was informed that for the type of small scale construction, as it will
be supported by the EJSSP, no Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) documentation
or Environmental Assessment (EA) approval is needed from the Ministry of Nature and
Environment in accordance with the national EA regulations. Given the nature and small
scale of the proposed civil works, the potential impacts on the environment are expected
to be minor, site-specific and for which mitigation measures can be readily designed.
There are likely to be some concerns relating to inconveniences or nuisances to
surrounding areas during construction. Therefore, for the purpose of enhancing
environment-friendly measures and mitigating any adverse impact caused by the
construction activities, the Borrower has prepared Environmental Safeguard Guidelines
which will be implemented by the concerned implementing agencies. The Guidelines
have been prepared, translated into the local language, and published in a local
newspaper. The Guidelines have also been publicly disclosed through the Bank’s
InfoShop.

Institutional arrangements

23.      The current project maintained the identical implementation structure as utilized
under the predecessor LJRP, which was identified as appropriate. It was determined that
the MOJHA was best able to provide both physical and logistical support to the PIU. To
further enhance activity coordination and sequencing, the PIU was to be overseen by a
Project Steering Committee. The Terms of Reference for the PSC were to focus on
providing overall guidance, support and coordination for effective project
implementation. The membership of the PSC was comprised of representatives from the
MOJHA, Supreme Court, GCC, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Science, CEA, and the National Legal Center. Additional members could be
added at the request of a majority of PSC members. The PSC was to operate under TORs
acceptable to the Association, and the PIU Project Coordinator was to serve as the PSC
Secretary. The PSC was to meet at least twice a year for formal PIU briefings. A
Ministry of Finance Regulation on Implementation of the grant and loan financed
projects was adopted in May 2007, which includes a provision on the PSC’s
responsibilities. Recently this document was updated by MOF and sent to the MOJHA
for its review and comments.

24.     Despite this structure, the PSC was not functionally active until September 2010,
when it was restructured and had its first meeting on September 16, 2010 to discuss the
project restructuring and approved the interim project work-plan. As part of the
restructuring, the Borrower has agreed to reinvigorate the Terms of Reference for the
PSC, and has reaffirmed its commitment and role as the guiding body for successful
implementation of the EJSSP.

Financing Plan

25.     The project restructuring would entail a revised withdrawal schedule, to accommodate
the project related expenditures under the Public Information Strategy sub-component (creating a
new Category 5 “Training and Workshops? under the IDA Grant with an allocation of SDR
82,000). Training and Workshops will consist of locally organized events, and provision of
consultant services.

Reallocations

26.     After the proposed restructuring, the project funds would be disbursed against
eligible expenditure categories as set forth in the table below:

27.    The existing financial management system meets the Bank’s minimum financial
management requirements, as stipulated in BP/OP 10.02, to carry forward the project
financial activities after the restructuring.

28.     The PIU’s FM performance has been rated “satisfactory? by a recent Financial
Management Review. The accounting policies and procedures of the existing project will
still apply for the restructured project. The project financial management manual, chart
of accounts, and Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) format have been updated to include
the specific requirements and categories of the restructuring. Bank’s audit and IFRs
requirements, and will apply for the restructured project. The Audit Report for FY10 has
been received by the Bank.

Procurement

29.     The Procurement Post Review Supervision Mission Report carried out in May
2011 noted that, based on the review, the Bank’s procurement procedures and
procurement provisions in the Development Credit Agreement of this Project were
followed in the procurement and contract award process. The overall risk rating is
“Moderate? and there were no recommendations to be addressed as part of the
restructuring.

Closing date

30.    The Government is proposing a six month extension in the closing date (from
December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013). This is to take into account the revised scope of
construction activities under the project and the short construction season in Mongolia.

Implementation Schedule

31.     An adjusted implementation schedule has been agreed with the Borrower.
Acceleration of implementation activities during the remaining project period has been
discussed with the Borrower. The Borrower will review if adjustments will need to be
made to existing oversight structures or to the existing PIU, which has been managing
this project for over 2 years, to ensure that the project progresses after restructuring.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

32.     The findings stated in the original Appraisal Summary of the PAD remain
unchanged except in relation to the potential environmental impact of the project. As a
result of additional new construction the project has been changed to an Environmental
Assessment category “B? project. Environmental Safeguard Guidelines have been
completed and the Borrower has confirmed that the construction of the small court
buildings will be in existing lots that are owned by the courts and that no environmental
safeguard issues are triggered. The Guidelines have been translated into the local
language, posted on the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs website, and distributed. A
notice announcing the Guidelines has also placed in the local newspaper. The Guidelines

                                           14
have also been disclosed through the Bank’s InfoShop. The Borrower has committed
itself to supervise adherence to the guidance provided in the document.

trainings and workshops.

                                Extension of Closing Date

1.     As part of the restructuring, the closing date for Mongolia Enhanced Justice
Sector Services Project, IDA Credit No. 4493-MN and IDA Grant No. H413-MN,
P101446 will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013.

2.      Although the current closing date of the project is still some way off, the
extension is required (and has been requested by Mongolian Ministry of Finance) at this
time, in order to ensure that relevant construction contracts can be signed in order to
provide sufficient time for the work to be completed due to the short construction season
in Mongolia.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary given that implementation commenced in
earnest in June 2010. While the project was approved in June 2008, it only became
effective on June 16, 2009. The effectiveness delay, coupled with the dropping of the
construction of the new Supreme Court, caused further major delays in moving forward
with project activities. An Implementation Schedule (including Action Plan and revised
Procurement Plan) for the remainder of the project following the Restructuring has been
agreed with the Borrower.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project.
