MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$80.8 MILLION
TO REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY
FOR A TRANSPORT PROJECT I
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Republica Oriental del Uruguay for US$80.8 million equivalent is submitted
for approval.   The  proposed  loan would  be  for  a  period of 15 years,
including 5 years of grace with interest at the Bank's standard variable
rate. The project would be cofinanced by the Export-Import Bank of Japan
(Eximbank) with a loan for US$73.9 million equivalent.
2.        Background . Much  of  the  existing transport infrastructure of
Uruguay is old and inadequate for present and future needs: important
sections of the highway network were built over 30 years ago; little
investment has been made in public ports since the late 1930s; and railway
investments  have  been  minimal.       The  organization,  regulations  and
functions of the transport sector agencies are largely obsolete and
inadequate to support the main macro-economic and sectoral objectives, viz
to control Government expenditures, increase foreign exchange earnings and
modemnize transport infrastructure and its management. In roads, although
substantial progress was achieved under previous Bank projects, there is a
need to improve management capability further, particularly in relation to
road maintenance, and to transfer know-how to the local governments. In
ports,  a  cluster  of   uncoordinated  public  agencies,  an  organization
unsuitable for present day ship and cargo handling technologies and
overstaffing result in low productivity and high costs. The railways have
faced serious problems for many years, requiring subsidies from the
Government.    Finally,  sector  planning  and  its  integration  with  the
budgeting process needs to be strengthened at all levels.
3.        The main  sectoral  issues  identified  in  the  Bank's Transport
Sector Strategy Paper for Uruguay (Report 6747-UR of May 11, 1987) were
discussed with the Government during project preparation. The Government
shared, in principle, the Bank's conclusions and in April 1987 issued a
statement on its  strategies  for  the  transport  sector.   The Government
designed a program to rationalize railway services in 1987. This program
is reflected in a Government-Railways Performance Contract and includes,
inter alia, a complete reorganization of the enterprise and reductions in
service,  lines  and  employees.    The  Government  has  already initiated
successfully the most important measures of the rationalization program.
The proposed project will support the Government's programs in the roads
and ports subsectors, but it will not deal with the railway subsector in
light of the advanced stage of the rationalization program. The Government
is also discussing external support of that program with OECF (Japan).

4.        Rationale For Bank Involvement.   The Bank's strategy for Uruguay
supports measures designed to enhance Uruguay's balance of payments
prospects through increased exports, and assist. the Government in reducing
the fiscal deficit.   Major  reforms  are  now  called for in the transport
sector to support such a strategy: transport facilities and services and
management procedures should be modernized to meet present and forecast
demand; transport costs should be reduced in order to help promote foreign
trade, strengthen regional integration and facilitate domestic growth; and
parastatals need to eliminate their deficits and contribute to national
savings. Through its participation in earlier highways and ports projects,
the Bank is particularly well placed to offer assistance in the major
institutional reforms under the project. The Bank's involvement would help
initiate and accelerate the policy alnd institutional reforms and provide
the required continuity while the investment financing would increase the
operating efficiency of the existing surface transport system and help the
Government carry out its sector program.
5.        Proiect  Objectives  .      The   proposed  project  supports  the
Government's objectives  to  reform  the  transport  sector, strengthen its
managerial and planning capabilities and stimulate competition and private
sector  involvement.      It   includes   policy  reform  and  institutional
development Action Plans for the Ministry of Transport and Public Works
(MTOP) and the National Port Administration (ANP) and provides support for
high  priority  investments  in  the   roads  and  ports  subsectors.    In
particular,  the  action  plans  would   aim  at:  (a)  strengthening  road
management capability, especially maintenance planning and programming of
MTOP and the transfer of know-how to departmental governments; (b)
reorganizing  the  ports  subsector   to  improve  planning,  construction,
maintenance ind operation of the ports; and (c) improving transport
regulations and tariffs, and reducing subsidies.
6.        Project Description  . The  project  consists  of  an investment
component to be financed under the loan, and the Government's Action Plans
for policy reform and institutional development of the roads and ports
subsector agencies. The investment component would include the following
high priority investments:   (a)  roads:  a  highway replacement program, a
time-slice of MTOP's road rehabilitation and maintenance program, and a
departmental gravel roads program; (b) ports: construction of a dike to
reduce maintenance dredging, remodeling of the commercial area, upgrading
of port utilities and power supply systems, and provision of cargo handling
equipment, all the above at Montevideo port; construction of a second
breakwater, dredging to expand the access channel and basin and civil works
and equipment to expand the water supply at the Paloma fishing port;
expansion of berthing facilities at Punta del Este small craft port and
civil works for the extension of the existing breakwater, berthing and boat
repair facilities, and dredging and reclamation, including paving and
utilities at Piriapolis small craft port; and (c) technical assistance and
training to support the implementation of the Action Plans. The Action
Plans would include measures  to:    (a)  strengthen transport planning and
adjust sector policies (development of rolling pluriannual transport plans



and strengthening of MTOP*s investment coordination role); (b) ensure roads
and ports cost recovery through adequate user charges systems (institution
of mechanisms for systematic updating of user charge levels); (c) improve
road management practices (strengthening of road maintenance and oreration
techniques); and (d) increase port operating efficiency (improvement of
port operation practices and cost reductions).
7.        The Project would be implemented  by  MTOP (roads and small craft
and fishing ports component), and ANP (commercial ports component).
Project monitoring and coordination would be carried out by a unit within
MTOP. The Government would on-lend funds from the proposed loan to ANP for
the implementation of the Montevideo port component substantially on the
same terms and conditions as those of the Bank loan. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$257.4 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of  US$136.3  million  (53?).    A  breakdown  of  costs  and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements. and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
group operations in Uruguay are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
Maps are also  attached.    The  Staff  Appraisal  Report No. 7290-UR dated
November 23, 1988, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions:  Assurances  were obtained during negotiations on
the following: (i) the Government would discuss the results of the road-
user charges revenue study with the Bank by October 31, 1989 and would make
the necessary adjustments to the level of user charges by December 31, 1989
to ensure cost recovery; (ii) ANP would restructure its tariffs by March
30, 1990 to reflect costs of services rendered; (iii) ANP would not incur
any debt, in addition to the proposed loan, unless its net operating
revenues are at least 1.5 times the annual debt service charges; (iv) ANP
would maintain for each of the years 1990 through 1995 operating ratios
decreasing from 87? to 792, and would achieve financial rates of return on
fixed assets increasing from 2.0? to 4.0? over the same years; (v) the
Government will inform the Bank on each updating of the MTOP's Transport
Expenditure Program; (vi) the Government would furnish confirmation of the
start of operations of a second fish processing plant in La Paloma, as a
condition of disbursement for the La Paloma port component, and ensure at
all times compliance of the second plant with environmental protection and
pollution control regulations; (vii) DNV's signing of the agreements for
the departmental maintenance program with at least 502 of the departments
would be a condition of disbursement for the departmental maintenance
program component; (viii) timing and scope of the technical assistance
component; and (ix) details of semi-annual consultations. Conditions of
loan effectiveness would be: (i) fulfillment of conditions of disbursement
under the Eximbank Agreement and the signing of a colenders' agreement
between the Bank and Eximbank; (ii) effectiveness of a subsidiary loan
agreement satisfactory to the Bank, between the Government and ANP for the
implementation of the Montevideo port component; (iii) establishment of the
Project Coordinating Unit; and (iv) the strengthening of the monitoring
capabilities of the Economic and Financial Advisory Unit within MTOP.

9.        Benefits.  Financial  benefits  would  include  the reduction and
eventual elimination of .ie ports deficits and the preservation and
upgrading of the capital stock in the roads subsector. Economic benefits
would  be  lower  transport  and  transfer  costs,  savings  from deferring
investments and increased foreign exchange earnings. The proposed project
would have an economic rate of return on civil works and equipment (972 of
total project costs) estimated at about 28S.
10.       Risks.  The project comprisps  the  roads and port subsectors and
involves several agencies.    There  is,  therefore,  risk  of slow projecc
implementation. To minimize this risk a Project Coordinating Unit in liTOP
would coordinate  and monitor  implementation  progress.    Some risk also
exists that the next Government may falter in carrying out the agreed
reforms. In order to lessen that possibility, the project arrangements
include provisions for joint annual reviews to enable continuation of an
effective dialogue.
11.       Recomnendation.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
