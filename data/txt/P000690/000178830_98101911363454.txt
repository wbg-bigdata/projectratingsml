ETHIOPIA
REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agricultural productivity in Ethiopia is in general very low, and
methods of cultivation used by most farmers have changed little over the
centuries. While the development of agriculture raises extremely difficult
problems, the lack of other resources means that the country's economic
progress will have to rest almost entirely on the development of this sector.
In outlining its development priorities, Government has therefore indicated
that it will give primary emphasis to agriculture and to narrowing the gap
between rural and urban living standards. As part of this overall program,
the expansion of irrigated crop production in the Awash River Valley is now
well underway. The Awash Basin covers about 115,000 km2 and is drained by
the Awash River and its tributaries; it is the only area in Ethiopia with
extensive water resource development, and consequently it offers the best
opportunity for the expansion of large-scale agricultural enterprises. As of
1976 some 20,000 ha had been irrigated in the upper and middle valleys, and
32,000 ha in the lower valley. The proposed Project would help in the dev-
elopment of irrigated agriculture in the Melka-Sadi and Amibara plains in the
Middle Awash Valley, some 175 km east of Addis Ababa. It would make a sig-
nificant contribution towards supporting Government's development strategy by
increasing crop production for domestic consumption, building up a cadre of
trained and experienced personnel for further development of irrigation, and
by providing an important source of foreign exchange through the expansion of
cotton production. The Project would replace an IDA credit of US$17.0 mil-
lion approved in 1973 for irrigation development in the Amibara area. 1/
ii.       The Amibara Irrigation Project was originally appraised in 1972
and a credit of US$17 million was approved by IDA on July 5, 1973. This
was to be the first Bank Group irrigation project to be carried out by the
Government and the ninth Bank Group lending for agricultural development in
Ethiopia. The credit was not made effective until August 30, 1974, because
of a delay in parliamentary ratification. At the time a review of the cost
estimates indicated that Project costs had risen 2-1/2 to 3 times the esti-
mates used in the appraisal report, and a reappraisal of the project became
necessary. The proposed Project is the outcome of further investigations
carried out by the Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA) and its con-
sultants. Although the revised Project concept is similar in many respects
to the Original Project in that it would provide for the irrigated develop-
ment of some 10,000 ha, the overall technical design of the Project was
significantly changed at reappraisal. The original high cost diversion
structure would be replaced by a rock-fill weir and relocated to a point on
the Awash River upstream of the Melka-Sadi area. The relocation of the
1/   For the purposes of this report the term "Original Project" means the
Amibara Irrigation Project approved by the Board in 1973 (Credit 418
ET) and the term "Project" means the revised project which is the sub-
ject of this report.



- ii -
weir also necessitated a substantial change in the layout and design of the
irrigation works. The weir would provide gravity irrigation by diversion
from the Awash River for about 10,300 ha of land, 2,800 ha of which is
presently being served by pumps and 7,500 ha of which is undeveloped. It
would include settlement of some 800 Afar families (about 4,000 people) on
2,000 ha of which about 480 families have already been settled on 1,200 ha;
the development of 4 state farms; the construction of Project headquarters,
workshop, stores, staff housing and related facilities for all portions of the
development; the purchase for AVDA of operation and maintenance equipment,
including vehicles; and the purchase of farm machinery and vehicles for all
farm operations. AVDA, the implementing agency for the Project, would continue
to employ a consulting firm to supervise construction and provide technical
assistance for Project management, operation and maintenance, as well as other
technical staff to provide agricultural extension, management and other
sistance for the state farms and the settlement program. Works already
implemented under the previous IDA credit include construction of the link
road from the Awash-Tendaho highway to the Melka-Warer townsite, the fea-
sibility study for the future Bolhamo and Angelele projects, the construction
of four wells to open new grazing areas on the Alledeghi Plains, construction
of some office and staff housing facilities for AVDA, and bush clearing of
about 2,000 ha of land.
iii.      An IDA credit of US$25.0 million is proposed which would replace
the previous IDA credit of US$17 million. The revised commitment of US$25.0
million would cover 44% of the revised total Project costs of Birr 117.6
million (US$56.8 million). The Project's foreign exchange component would
total US$30.3 million, or 53% of total costs. Customs duties and other
taxes totalling US$4.5 million were not included in the above cost estimates.
Additional finance was also secured by Government from the European Economic
Community (US$16.9 million), and the African Development Fund (US$5.5 million).
These contributions would total US$22.4 million or 40% of total Project cost.
Government would put forward an additional contribution of US$3.6 million,
raising its total contribution for the Project to US$9.4 million, or 16% of
total costs. The proceeds of the contributions from the international finan-
cing agencies, together with Government's contribution relating to the irriga-
tion network, roads, on-farm development and technical assistance, would be
onlent to AVDA at an annual interest rate of 6% repayable over 50 years
including an eight year grace period on interest and principal. All civil
works contracts for the weir, main canal, main drain, eastern flood dyke and
the distribution network (US$10.5 million including contingencies), and
internal roads (US$4.2 million including contingencies) would be tendered on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines. Buildings and housing at Project Headquarters would be constructed
after local competitive bidding.
iv.       At full development, total incremental production from the Project
would reach 22,000 tons of seed cotton, 420 tons of maize and 60 tons of beans
per annum. Most of the food crops are for settlers' home consumption; maize
yields, however, are likely to produce a surplus over normal family food
requirements. As experience and ability to properly handle crop production is



- iii -
developed, rotations with economically viable oil and/or grain crops can be
introduced on the state farms. These could include sesame, groundnuts and
higher yielding maize. Both the state farms and the settlers would in the
long term develop a crop rotation program to maintain soil fertility and
soil condition. At that stage, several oil and grain crops plus legume-type
forage crops could provide the needed break in continuous cotton planting and
would offer reasonably good financial returns.
v.        The overall economic rate of return for the Project over 50 years
would be about 13.0%. In this analysis foreign exchange was shadow priced
at a rate of Birr 2.70 per US$1.00 (as compared with an official rate of
Birr 2.07/US$1.00) to reflect more accurately the value of foreign exchange
to Ethiopia. Unskilled farm labor was shadow priced at 50% of the standard
wage rate. The major benefits from the Project would be: the opening of
the Middle Awash Valley (one of Ethiopia's most promising agricultural areas)
for commercial farming; better employment for the rural population of the
areas; and foreign exchange earnings from the export of cotton. The Proj-
ect would create employment for the local Afars and for underemployed work-
ers from the highlands. The AVDA settlement would provide land for 320 fam-
ilies and would, in addition to the family labor employed, allow for the
hire of seasonal labor for cotton picking. At full development, it is esti-
mated that regular employment for about 3,500 farm workers and seasonal em-
ployment (three months per year) for about 7,500 workers would be created
by the settlement, the research station and the state farms. During the
construction period, it is estimated that up to 750 workers would be employed
on construction of the Project infrastructure. As a result of the Project,
the per capita income for a settler family of five is expected to rise from
an average in the area of about Birr 60 to Birr 422 at full development. For
fully employed wage earners, assuming 250 working days per year, the annual
income is expected to be about Birr 500 and for seasonal workers Birr 200.
These incomes would accrue to the presently underemployed workers from the
highlands as well as some Afars from the valley whose incomes are at the
subsistence level.
vi.       This would be the Bank Group's thirteenth lending for agricultural
development in Ethiopia since the beginning of 1969. These include: the
First Amibara Irrigation Project, the Lower Adiabo Development Project,
two Wolamo Development Projects, the Humera Development Project, the Coffee
Processing Project, the Minimum Package Project, the Addis Ababa Dairy Proj-
ect, the Second Livestock Project and the Rangelands Development Project.
vii.      Subject to the required assurances and conditions, the proposed
Project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$25.0 million to the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia to replace Credit 418-ET in the amount of US$17.0 million,
approved by the Executive Directors on June 7, 1973, which would be cancelled.

REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Agricultural productivity in Ethiopia is in general very low,
and methods of cultivation used by most farmers have changed little over the
centuries. While the development of agriculture raises extremely diffi-
cult problems, the lack of other resources means that the country's eco-
nomic progress will have to rest almost entirely on the expansion of crop
production. In outlining its development priorities, Government has therefore
indicated that it will give primary emphasis to agriculture and to narrowing
the gap between rural and urban living standards. As part of this overall
program, the expansion of irrigated cropping areas in the Awash River Valley
is now well underway. The Awash Basin covers about 115,000 km2 and is
drained by the Awash River and its tributaries; it is the only area in Ethiopia
with extensive water resource development, and consequently it offers the best
opportunity for the expansion of large-scale agricultural enterprises. As of
1976 some 20,000 ha had been irrigated in the upper and middle valleys and
32,000 ha in the lower valley. The proposed Project, which is a revised
version of the original Amibara Irrigation Project approved by the Board in
1973 (para 1.03), would help in the development of irrigated agriculture in
the Melka-Sadi and Amibara plains in the Middle Awash Valley, some 175 km east
of Addis Ababa. It would make a significant contribution towards supporting
Government's development strategy by increasing crop production for domestic
consumption, building up a cadre of trained and experienced personnel for
further development of irrigation, and by providing an important source of
foreign exchange through the expansion of cotton production.
1.02      This would be the Bank Group's thirteenth lending for agricultural
development in Ethiopia since the beginning of 1969. These include: the
first Amibara Irrigation Project, the Lower Adiabo Development Project,
two Wolamo Development Projects, the Humera Development Project, the Coffee
Processing Project, the Minimum Package Project, the Drought Areas Rehabilita-
tion Project, the Agricultural Credit Project, the Addis Ababa Dairy Project,
the Second Livestock Project and the Rangelands Development Project.
1.03      The Amibara Irrigation Project was originally appraised in 1972
and a credit of US$17 million was approved by IDA on July 5, 1973. This was
to be the first Bank Group irrigation project to be carried out by the Govern-
ment and the ninth Bank Group lending for agricultural development in Ethiopia.
The credit was not made effective until August 30, 1974 because of a delay
in parliamentary ratification. At that time a review of the cost estimates
indicated that Project costs had risen 2-1/2 to 3 times the estimates used
in the appraisal report, and a reappraisal of the project became necessary.
The proposed Project is the outcome of further investigations carried out by
the Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA) and it's consultants. From these
investigations it was concluded that a revised gravity scheme to irrigate the



Melka-Sadi area and a portion of the Amibara area would be the most practic-
able and economic plan of development. To fully evaluate the Project a
reappraisal mission consisting of Messrs. T. Baddar and J. Frankel (IDA) and
L. Bartsch (Consultant), visited the Project area, Government Agencies and
the Consultants' Offices in Addis Ababa and London during the period January/
February, 1976. This report is based upon documents submitted by AVDA and
their consultants, the feasibility studies, and the findings of the re-
appraisal mission.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2
2.01      Ethiopia has a total land area of about 1.2 million km . The
central part of the country is mostly high plateau, 1,500 to 3,000 meters
above sea level and dissected by gorges and broad valleys; this plateau is
surrounded by extensive lowlands, most of which are inhabited only by nomadic
pastoralists. The country is divided into six basic ecological regions which
vary considerably with regard to topography, climate, soils, natural vegeta-
tion and agricultural potential.
2.02      The total population, estimated at 27.9 million (in mid-1975),
is growing at an annual rate of about 2.5%. Gross Domestic Product at
current factor cost (GDP), was estimated at US$2.7 billion in 1975/76. Real
GDP has grown at an average rate of 1.5% over the last four years. Over 90%
of the people live in rural areas, and overall per capita income is estimated
at US$100.
B. The Agricultural Sector
2.03      The agricultural sector is distinguished by wide climatic and eco-
logical diversity which allows a large variety of crops to be grown. Agricul-
ture forms the base of the Ethiopian economy, contributing some 50% of GDP
and providing a livelihood for 85% to 90% of the population. Agricultural
productivity is, in general, quite low: methods of cultivation used by most
traditional farmers have remained unchanged over many centuries, and about
two-thirds of the country's farm population operate holdings of less than one
hectare of crop land. Crop production accounts for about 70% of total agri-
cultural production with livestock products making up the balance. Agricul-
ture also dominates the exports of Ethiopia; agricultural products have
represented over 90% of total value of exports in recent years.
Land Use
2.04      Only limited information is available on the resource base since
there has been no census of agriculture or livestock nor2any detailed land
use survey.  About 65% of total land area, or 790,000 km , has been defined



as agricultural lan , consisting of about 140,000 km of cropped or fallow
land and 650,000 km of permanent pasture. Less than 10% of the total land
area is actually under crops. In much of the highland area the agricultural
potential is good for crops ranging from coffee, maize and bananas in the
lower elevations to wheat, barley, sorghum, teff, oilseeds and pulses in
the higher, cooler locations. However, with the long history of human set-
tlement the soil fertility has been degraded through deforestation, over-
grazing, overcropping and resultant erosion.
Agricultural Production
2.05      The absence of reliable estimates for agricultural production has
been a problem for many years in Ethiopia. Cereals account for about 45% of
the gross value of agricultural production, while coffee, other crops and by-
products and livestock products account for 11%, 25% and 20% respectively.
Cereal production on a national basis may have fallen in 1974/75, but pro-
bably recovered in 1975/76, the first year of the land reform. Coffee pro-
duction (using coffee arrivals in Addis Ababa as a proxy for production)
reached a peak of 111,000 tons inl972/73, but declined in the following year
to 79,000 tons mainly because of coffee berry disease. A small recovery in
production took place in 1975/76 (81,000 tons). Expansion took place in oil-
seeds and pulses, exports of which peaked in 1973/74 and 1974/75 respectively;
since then they have declined due to the loss of production from Setit Humera
in northern Ethiopia, where security problems have been serious, and because
of dislocation following the nationalization of commercial farms from which
such production emanated. Domestic production of cotton has increased over
the years, but exports, (which were significant in 1973/74 and 1974/75) fell
substantially in 1975/76. In spite of increased domestic demand for cotton
it is expected that Ethiopia would become a net exporter of cotton in the
near future.
2.06     Irrigation.  The expansion of Ethiopia's irrigated crop areas offers
a significant opportunity for future increases in total agricultural produc-
tion. About 60,000 ha are now irrigated in Ethiopia, and the technical
possibilities for expanding this area are immense. For example, reconnais-
sance data suggest that the soil and water resources in the Blue Nile basin
would permit the year-round irrigation of about 500,000 ha. With the addi-
tion of potentially irrigable areas in the Awash and Wabe Shebelli basins,
a total of some 750,000 ha could be brought under irrigated production in
the long term. The Awash River basin contains some 175,000 ha of irri-
gable land and is the only area in Ethiopia where large-scale water resource
development has been carried out thus far. Development has been accomplished
largely by private capital, with Government, bilateral and international par-
ticipation under loose water allocation and control arrangements. The lar-
gest of these developments are the Wonji and Metehara sugar plantations and
the Tendaho cotton plantation; in addition, several other smaller agricul-
tural estates have also been established. In 1976 the Valleys Agricultural
Development Authority (VADA) was created to coordinate and oversee the
water resource development of all river valleys in Ethiopia; the VADA thus
supervises the activities of the Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA), the
agency with direct responsibility for implementing projects in the Awash
Valley.



- 4-
Priorities and Pattern of Development
2.07      The basic dependence of the Ethiopian economy on agriculture will
not change in the near future. On March 4, 1975, the Government issued
a land reform proclamation which has introduced sweeping changes in the agri-
cultural sector. The basic thrust of the land reform has been the abolition
of private ownership of rural land. In former tenant and owner-cultivated
areas user rights of up to ten hectares are to be allocated to each farm
family. Former large scale farms have been turned over to smallholders or are
being operated as cooperatives or state farms. The role of the Government in
the agricultural sector will increase substantially - the land has been
nationalized, many of the former commercial farms have been taken over by the
Ministry of Agriculture, and Government investments in infrastructure and in
supporting services to agriculture will be increased in both absolute and
relative terms. Despite the expanded role of Government in agriculture, the
bulk of production will still come from individual small-scale farmers. Con-
sequently, improvements in the rural infrastructure through public investment
will continue to be vitally necessary. Likewise, any substantial increase in
agricultural production will depend upon the responsiveness of traditional
farmers to the availability of credit, improved inputs and marketing services
provided by Government.
III. PROJECT HISTORY AND THE PROJECT AREA
A.  Project History - Amibara Irrigation Project (Annex 1)
Background
3.01      A United Nations Development Program (UNDP) study of the Awash
River Basin, carried out from 1961-1964, recommended the early irrigation
development of the Melka-Sadi and Amibara areas. These areas are located
in the middle valley of the Awash River in the central eastern part of
Ethiopia, about 175 km east of Addis Ababa and about 50 km downstream from the
Awash Station. Preparation work was entrusted to the Awash Valley Authority
(AVA) now known as the Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA), a Government
public authority which was created in 1962 to administer and develop the
natural resources of the Awash River Basin. The World Bank Group first
assisted the Awash Valley development in 1964 with the financing of two power
plants. In 1968 the Bank Group helped finance a two lane bituminous surfaced
road from Awash to Tendaho (303 km) in the middle and lower valley; this road
was justified partly on grounds of opening the valley for irrigation develop-
ment. The Loan Agreement provided for the preparation of a specific irri-
gation project covering about 20,000 ha in the Melka-Sadi and Amibara areas
in the middle valley, and a committee was set up in 1968 to supervise the
preparation of a project. Agencies represented on the committee included
AVDA, UNDP, FAO, the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and the Bank. Italconsult
of Italy was retained to do a feasibility study.



- 5 -
3.02      An IDA appraisal mission visited the area in October 1969 and
found that further studies, particularly on soils, were required before
an appraisal could be completed. After the completion of the additional
investigations, a 14,600 ha project including the Melka-Sadi and Amibara
areas was appraised by an IDA mission in October, 1971. Subsequently the
Government, after consultation with IDA, decided to lease the upstream
Melka-Sadi area of about 4,600 ha to the Melka-Sadi Agricultural Estate
Company (MAESCO), to speed up construction and utilize private capital
and expertise in land development. This change in the project restricted
the development under the IDA project to the Amibara area of about 10,000
ha. A further mission reviewed the modified project in December 1972 and
a credit of US$17 million was approved on July 5, 1973 (418 ET).
3.03      In accordance with the Credit Agreement, AVDA employed a firm
of consultants (Sir William Halcrow and Partners (UK)) to complete final
designs and supervise construction of the project. In early 1974, the
consultants reviewed the cost estimates. They found that there had been a
rapid escalation in construction costs and estimated that project costs had
risen 2-1/2 to 3 times the estimates used in the appraisal report. In view
of the substantial increase in cost, AVDA after consultation with IDA
requested the consultants to work out an alternative plan. The consultants
proposed a gradual development of the Amibara area based on pump irrigation.
This proposal deviated from the original plan, thus requiring a revision of
development strategy. It was, therefore, deemed advisable to examine the
various alternatives of project implementation and to identify the best
means of construction of project works. An IDA mission visited Ethiopia in
February 1975 to review the status of the project and determine the best
means of development under the changed conditions. At the suggestion of
the consultants, the mission also evaluated, as an alternative to gravity
irrigation, a pumping scheme for the Amibara area consisting of five pumping
plants. The principal advantages of pump development were the comparatively
lower initial cost and the opportunity to phase investment and development
to adjust to the capabilities of the borrower to implement the project. The
lower initial cost of the pumping scheme, however, was offset by the higher
annual operating costs - particularly for fuel, repairs and replacement
costs - and the difficulties of pump maintenance which could impair the
reliability of the water supply and crop yields. The mission therefore was
of the opinion that a gravity plan with less elaborate designs would,
subject to completion of further studies by the consultants, be preferable
to a pump scheme. Discussions with Government and the completion of further
studies by the consultants confirmed these views, and IDA concluded that a
reappraisal of the project was necessary in order to fully evaluate the
latest proposals. The proposed Project was developed out of the reappraisal
carried out in January/February 1976.
B. The Project Area
3.04      The middle Awash Valley has a semi-arid climate, with an average
rainfall of 550 mm occurring in two seasons. The "short rains", unreliable



- 6 -
both in time and quantity, come in February/April, while the more reliable
"long rains" fall from July to September and account for about 50% of the
annual total.  Mean monthly temperatures range from just under  2 0C in
December/January to 300C in June. The Project area has good road and rail
connections with Addis Ababa and the ports of Assab and Djibouti. An all-
weather road runs to Addis Ababa and to Assab where port facilities are
available.
3.05      The population of the Project area consists mainly of about 7,500
nomadic Afars (some 1,500 families) who occupy the Project area and its
environs including the Alledeghi Plain for a portion of each year; these
nomads own about 15,000 to 20,000 head of camels, cattle, sheep and goats.
In addition, the 2,500 ha already developed (1,300 ha now being developed by
MAESCO and 1,200 ha being used by AVDA for the settlement of Afars) has
attracted up to 5,000 full time and seasonal workers from the upland areas
who have established communities on or adjacent to the ongoing farm develop-
ments.
Soils, Topography and Drainage (Annex 2)
3.06      Soils are recent alluviums of considerable depth, with satisfac-
tory rates of infiltration and a water table at about 10 m. About one-half
of the soils consist of sandy loams to clay loams, with good permeability;
these Class I soils are suitable for a wide range of annual and perennial
crops. The other half, consisting of Class II soils of loamy clays with
restricted permeability, are better suited for cotton and forage crops.
Soil salinity and alkalinity cause no problem under present conditions,
but could become critical under irrigation without adequate provision for
drainage. The topography of the plains is generally flat, with slopes vary-
ing from 0.5 to 2%, and well suited to gravity irrigation.
Land Utilization
3.07      The Project area includes both the Melka-Sadi area and part of
the Amibara area in the Middle Awash Valley (Map IBRD 10313R). In the Melka-
Sadi area, some 1,300 ha have already been developed by the Melka-Sadi Agri-
cultural Estate Company (MAESCO) and are being farmed in high value crops
(para. 3.11). In the Amibara area 300 ha are being utilized by the Melka-Warer
Agricultural Research Station, and 1,200 ha are being utilized by AVDA for
settlement of Afars. Immediately adjacent to the Project area in Amibara,
three farms comprising a total of 1,300 ha which were operated as concessions
until early 1975 are now being operated as state farms. All these cultivated
areas are being irrigated using a series of pumping stations along the Awash
River.
3.08      Amibara Settlement.  The rapid increase during the period 1965-1970
in the number of large farms utilizing the waters of the Awash River for ir-
rigation of valley land began to have a serious impact upon the availability
of dry season grazing for the indigenous Afar herders. In order to alleviate



this problem, the Ethiopian Government determined to resettle the semi-nomadic
Afars in the middle and lower Awash Valley. AVDA was assigned the responsibil-
ity for developing a settlement program. Small pilot settlement projects were
started in 1967 with 19 families in the lower valley and 67 in the Amibara
area. The number of families in the latter project increased slowly over a
period of seven years to about 500 families, each assigned a 2.5 hectare
irrigated plot. An evaluation of the settlement program was conducted in
1974 by AVDA and a group of consultants; the main finding was that under the
existing system of communal farming, the settlers lacked any formal identifi-
cation with their plots, and that the system was strongly paternalistic with
the settlers having little if any decision making responsibility or initiative
concerning their economic welfare. The evaluation recommended that the
settlement schemes be reorganized using the traditional Afar tribal clan
organizational structure as the basis for settlement units. The 2.5 hectare
family plots were considered a satisfactory size, but these plots needed to
be grouped into more viable cultivation units. They also recommended the
diversification of cropping patterns to include traditional food crops for
home consumption along with a cotton cash crop. AVDA assisted by a UNDP/FAO
team is in the process of adjusting the present settlement scheme in order
to correct these deficiencies.
3.09      Performance of Afar settlers in crop cultivation over the past
several years has provided evidence to refute early negative generalizations
about the ability of Afars to adjust to sedentary living. In addition, while
the devastating drought of 1972-1973 was seriously depleting their livestock
herds, they have observed the excellent crop yields resulting from irrigated
cultivation. This has created an awareness of the value of valley land and
of the danger of losing the land to strangers, thus precipitating a demand
for a share of what they consider traditionally theirs.
3.10      State Farms.  Early in 1975 the Provisional Military Administra-
tive Council abolished all large private ownership or private operation of
farms. The Ministry of Agriculture has been given responsibility for organiz-
ing and operating all nationalized enterprises including commercial farms.
The State Farms Development Authority within the Ministry is responsible
for the operation of all nationalized commercial farms. The authority has
established separate corporations to oversee development of individual farms
or groups of farms in various parts of the country, with the Awash Valley
Corporation (AVC) designed as the operator of all state farms in the Awash
Valley.
3.11      Melka-Sadi Agricultural Estate Company (MAESCO).  In 1972, MAESCO
was granted a concession to develop 4,600 ha of land leased to it by AVDA;
the area included all of the Melka-Sadi area in the Middle Awash, located
upstream of the Amibara area. The lease terms required MAESCO to develop all
irrigable land in the area by 1979. To date, MAESCO has 1,300 ha of pump
irrigated land under cultivation with the following crops: 250 ha sweet
peppers, 150 ha maize and alfalfa, and 900 ha bananas. The alfalfa and maize
are providing fodder for a livestock fattening operation. Animals are
trucked live to the port of Assab for shipment to Saudi Arabia. Green peppers
and banana sales are almost all for export, although MAESCO is shipping a
fairly large quantity of lower quality bananas to the Addis Ababa market.



- 8-
Although all other concessions in the valley have been nationalized, the
MAESCO farm has thus far been allowed to continue operation under the existing
lease. However, Government intends to take over the already developed MAESCO
farm and to operate it as a horticultural enterprise. The area now leased by
MAESCO but not yet under development would be taken over by Government for
development under the proposed Project (para 4.12).
Agricultural Production
3.12      Cotton at present is the main crop in the Middle and Lower Awash
regions. In 1973/74, this area produced some 70,000 tons of high grade
medium staple 1-1/16 inch seed cotton equivalent to about 24,000 tons of
lint, or 80% of the country's total cotton crop. Cotton trials at Melka-
Warer Station with varieties now available for commercial production have
yielded up to 40 quintals/ha of seed cotton with minimal fertilizer appli-
cations.  Commercial growers and AVDA working with settlers have consistently
produced yields in excess of 30 quintal/ha of seed cotton under mechanized
farming conditions.  Results with maize have not been as encouraging,
primarily because of the use of seed varieties developed for highland
rainfed conditions. Varieties presently used yield up to 35 quintal/ha.
The research station is experimenting with imported hybrids developed in
similar irrigated lowland areas, and it is expected that properly adapted
varieties could yield up to 60 quintals per hectare in the valley. Trials
for haricot bean production, on the other hand, have given excellent results,
with several good canning varieties yielding up to 20 quintals/ha.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The Project would provide gravity irrigation by diversion from the
Awash River for about 4,600 ha in the Melka-Sadi area and approximately
5,700 ha in the Amibara area. It would include settlement of some 800 Afar
families (about 4,000 people) on 2,000 ha 1/; the development of 4 state farms;
the construction of Project headquarters, workshop, stores, staff housing
and related facilities for all portions of the development and the purchase
for AVDA of operation and maintenance equipment, including vehicles. The
revised Project concept is similar to the Original Project proposed for IDA
financing in 1973 in that it would provide for the development of approxi-
mately 10,000 ha by gravity irrigation. However, the overall technical
design of the Project was significantly changed at the reappraisal. The
original high cost diversion structure which was to be constructed on the
Awash River at Melka-Warer would be replaced by a low rockfill diversion
weir at a site upstream of the Melka-Sadi area at a narrow point in the
river (Map, IBRD 10313 R). The relocation of the diversion structure
allowed the inclusion of the Melka-Sadi area in the gravity irrigation

- 9 -
scheme and thus, should this be desired in the future, the ultimate expan-
sion of the system over a considerably greater area than would otherwise
have been possible. The relocation of the weir also necessitated a sub-
stantial change in the lay-out and design of the irrigation works.
4.02      Works already implemented under the previous IDA credit include
construction of the link road from the Awash-Tendaho highway to the Melka-
Warer townsite, the feasibility study for the future Bolhamo and Angelele
projects, the construction of four wells to open new grazing areas on the
Alledeghi Plains, some office and staff housing facilities for AVDA, and
bush clearing on about 2,000 ha.
4.03      Works to be implemented under the Project would include:
(a) a diversion weir on the Awash River;
(b) irrigation and drainage networks to serve a total of
10,300 ha, of which 7,500 ha would be heretofor un-
developed land and 2,800 ha would be converted from
pumping to gravity supply;
(c) flood protection dykes;
(d) roads along the main canals and drains;
(e) on-farm development for two state farms of 1,700 ha
each in the Amibara area, and two state farms of
1,650 ha each in the Melka-Sadi area adjoining the
MAESCO farm, as well as settlement on some 800 ha
in the Amibara area;
(f) technical assistance including engineering supervision
and recruitment of technical personnel; and
(g)  institution of environmental controls.
All Project works would be completed in seven years with construction
beginning by late 1977. A detailed construction schedule is given in
Annex 8, Chart 16919.
B. Detailed Features
Irrigation and Drainage (Annex 3)
4.04      The Project would provide gravity irrigation for an area of some
10,300 ha; of this total, some 2,800 ha which is already under pump irriga-
tion would be converted to gravity. The total incremental irrigated area
would therefore be about 7,500 ha. The areas to be irrigated would include
three sites in the Amibara area and one in the adjacent Melka-Sadi area.
The Amibara sites would comprise: (a) two state farms of 1,700 ha each;



- 10 -
(b) the 2,000 ha AVDA settlement area (of which 1,200 ha has already been
developed); and (c) 300 ha at the research station (which is already devel-
oped). In addition, the Project would provide for the irrigation of 4,600
ha in the Melka-Sadi area; 3,300 ha would be newly irrigated, while some 1,300
ha which has already been developed by MAESCO (para 3.11) would be converted
from pump to gravity irrigation. The works to be constructed would include a
low rockfill weir across the Awash River upstream from the Melka-Sadi area,
a main canal, drainage, flood protection dykes and a distribution network.
4.05      Diversion Weir and Irrigation System.  The diversion weir to be
constructed on the Awash River would consist of a rockfill weir about 4 meters
high with a central overflow section and, a concrete canal headworks at the
right abutment. A main canal, about 26 km long, would receive its supply
directly from the weir. Delivery to the irrigated area would be by gravity
through earth canals, including control and water measuring structures,
turn-outs and culverts. Canal lining would be limited to very short
stretches over permeable soils. The distribution network would consist of
secondary and tertiary earth canals conveying water to each block or farming
unit of approximately 10 ha.
4.06      Drainage Network.  Secondary, tertiary and field drains, with
spacing similar to that of the irrigation network, would remove surplus
water from the fields and convey it to the main drains. Two main drains
would remove excess rain and irrigation water from the Project area. An
eastern drain 28 km long would drain the Melka-Sadi area and the eastern
portion of the Amibara area. The remainder of the Amibara area would be
drained by a western drain running along the partially constructed dyke
adjacent to the Awash River. Drainage waters would be discharged into
natural drainage channels leading to the Cadda Billen Swamp downstream from
the Project area.
4.07      On the basis of present knowledge of groundwater levels and soil
permeability, it is likely that after about five years from the implementa-
tion of irrigation additional water-table control facilities may have to be
installed. The design of the main drains would take this into account.
The timing and area to be served by these additional facilities would be
determined by drainage investigations and water-table monitoring initiated
under the Project (Annexes 3 and 6). The cost of constructing tile drains has
been included in the economic analysis, but not in the Project financing.
However, assurances were obtained that should ground water levels rise so as
to affect the productivity of soils in the Project area, Government would make
available to AVDA the funds needed to meet the cost of installing additional
water-table control facilities.
4.08      Flood Protection Dykes.  Portions of the Project area are subject
to annual flooding from high water in the Awash River. To reduce the sever-
ity of the floods a dyke has been constructed along the river banks to pro-
tect the lands already developed. This 27 km dyke on the western edge of
the Project area would be improved by raising the existing dyke embankment
over about 8 km of its length; also an additional 16 km of new dyke would be
constructed. An eastern dyke of about 32 km in length would be constructed
to protect the Project area from run-off from the Alledeghi Plains. The



- 11 -
dykes would be up to 2 m in height and would protect the Project from floods
having a frequency of less than once in five years. For floods of greater
magnitude some portions of the dyke may be breached. The downstream 500 ha
of the Melka Sadi area and the upstream 1,000 ha of the new development in
Amibara would be most vulnerable. It is expected, however, that in the event
of flooding there would be time to plant another crop after the flood recedes.
Roads
4.09      The Project would include provision for the construction of ap-
proximately 40 km of principal roads, and 50 km of service roads along the
main canals and drains. A stabilized surface course of 0.30 m thick on
principal roads and 0.20 m thick on service roads would be provided. In
addition, about 100 km of unsurfaced tracks would be constructed as part
of the tertiary irrigation network.
Project Headquarters and Settlements (Annex 4)
4.10      The Project would include provision for the construction of a
Project Headquarters at or near the present AVDA facilities at the Melka-
Warer research station. The facilities to be constructed would include
offices, a workshop, stores and staff housing. Provision would also be
made for vehicles and related costs.
4.11      The Project would provide assistance to AVDA for the completion
of its ongoing settlement program. Some 320 Afar families (1,600
persons) would be settled on the 800 ha which have not as yet been de-
veloped. Funds would be provided for on-farm development including bush
clearing and levelling, as well as for farm machinery and some staff hous-
ing. The settlers would be organized in groups of 40 families; each group
would be allocated 100 ha or 2.5 ha per family. These 100 ha blocks would
then be further divided into five 20 ha irrigation units served by a cen-
tral field channel with a drainage ditch on both sides. The cropping pat-
tern on the arable areas would be 80% cotton, 15% maize and 5% beans. The
overall intensity may be increased to 120% by the introduction of double
cropping groundnuts and/or sesame once the settlers are permanently estab-
lished and familiar with irrigated farming. The plots may also include
forage for dry season supplemental livestock feed if livestock owners so
desire.
State Farms (Annex 5)
4.12      Two state farms of 1,700 ha each would be established on now
undeveloped land in the Amibara area and two other state farms of some
1,650 ha each would be established in the Melka-Sadi area adjoining the MAESCO
farm. Provision would be included under the Project for on-farm development
(including construction of field canals and drains, bush clearing, land
levelling, etc.), staff housing, and for farm machinery, equipment and vehic-
les. These farms would be administered by the Awash Valley Corporation (para.
3.10), which would be responsible for their staffing, organization and manage-
ment. Farm development would be phased over a four year period to coincide



-12 -
with the establishment of the irrigation network. Initially, the entire crop
area would be devoted to cotton, although eventually it is expected that
rotations with economically viable oil or grain crops could be introduced.
During the Project period, technical specialists would also be employed (para.
4.15) to assist in the establishment of the farms and to help set up a train-
ing program for farm personnel. Funds are, therefore, provided under the
Project for the recruitment of three technical personnel: a Farm Manager, an
Agronomist/Entomologist and an Agricultural Mechanical Supervisor.
4.13      In addition to the new land to be brought under cultivation in
the Melka-Sadi area, the 1,300 ha already developed by MAESCO (para 3.11)
would be transformed from pump to gravity irrigation.
Technical Services (Annex 6)
4.14      Engineering Supervision.  Since mid-1973 AVDA has employed Sir
William Halcrow and Partners (UK) as its engineering and technical consultant
for the Amibara Project. The responsibilities of the firm are detailed in
Annex 6, but these basically include: carrying out any additional investiga-
tions and topographical surveys; preparation of detailed designs and tender
documents for civil work contracts and equipment purchases; analysis of
bids and recommendations for award of contracts; supervision of civil works
construction and on-farm development; and establishment of an operation and
maintenance unit for AVDA including the provision of a repair and mainte-
nance workshop. These services would be extended over the seven year
Project period. The operation and maintenance unit would be established
approximately one year before the first delivery of water so as to become
fully operational when the initial stage of the on-farm development is
undertaken (para 5.06).
4.15      Technical Personnel.  A number of qualified technical personnel would
be recruited to help AVDA with Project implementation and to train Ethiopian
counterpart staff to fill key positions. Staff to be recruited would include:
(a) a Project Manager (Engineer) and all necessary staff for the AVDA field
headquarters (para. 4.10); (b) operations and maintenance staff including an
Engineer and a Mechanical Supervisor; and (c) a Senior Agriculturalist, an
Agricultural Mechanical Supervisor, an Agronomist/Entomologist, a Farm
Manager (State Farms), an Extension and Training Officer and a Water Management
Engineer. A list of these personnel and the years in which they would be
required is given in Annex 6.
Environmental Effects
4.16      The environmental changes which would be induced by the Project
would have both nositive and negative aspects. On the one hand, in an
area where malaria and schistosomiasis are endemic, the introduction of
flood control, drainage and land levelling would substantially reduce
swampy areas and so decrease the present naturally-occurring breeding
areas for the disease vectors, mosquitoes and snails. On the other hand,
although the design of the drainage and irrigation systems would take ac-
count of the necessity to create as far as possible a water environment
unfavorable to the snail vectors of schistosomiasis, these systems would



- 13 -
be likely to become new health hazards because they would inevitably harbor
these vectors unless preventive control measures were undertaken.  The
Ethiopian Institute of Pathobiology has been engaged in a number of epi-
demiological and control studies on schistosomiasis in Ethiopia over the last
ten years. Studies have been carried out on the possibility of using an
indigenous natural product from the berries of a plant known as Endod which
has demonstrated a remarkable toxicity to the snail vectors of schistosomiasis.
Funds would therefore be included under the Project for the provision of
control measures against schistosomiasis and other water borne diseases.
These measures would be based on the above research and on field trials in
the area; as the details of these proposals are still being finalized, the
eventually agreed controls would be carefully monitored during the implementa-
tion period.
4.17      AVDA has been and is now aware of the importance of adopting satis-
factory standards of environmental health from the inception of development.
In order to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained in the future,
assurances were obtained at negotiation that AVDA, the State Farms Develop-
ment Authority and any other organization operating on Project lands would
be required to provide adequate medical, sanitary, training and other social
services in the Project area.
C. Project Costs (Annex 7)
4.18      Overall costs of the revised Project excluding duties and taxes are
estimated at about Birr 117.6 million (US$56.8 million), of which about Birr
62.8 million (US$30.3 million) or 53% would represent foreign exchange costs.
Costs of the revised Project include disbursements of US$1.8 million (US$1.3
million from original IDA credit and US$0.5 million from Government) for the
construction of the link road from the Awash-Tendaho highway to the Melka-
Warer townsite, the feasibility study for the future Bolhamo and Angelele
projects, construction of four wells to open new grazing areas on the Alledeghi
Plains, some office and staff housing facilities for AVDA and bush clearing on
about 2,000 ha. (para 4.02). Total costs of the revised Project are detailed

4.19      Estimates for civil works and on-farm works are based on completed
engineering designs prepared by the Project consultants. Base prices were
estimated using actual bids received for Bank Group supported road projects in
Ethiopia and updated on the basis of more recent information available in
Ethiopia to bring them in line with February 1977 costs; equipment purchases
were valued at February 1977 cif prices. Customs duties and other taxes
totalling US$4.55 million have not been included in the cost estimates. Proj-
ect costs include a physical contingency averaging 15% on all items. Annual
price contingencies vary between 13% and 5% per annum for civil works and 9%
and 7% for equipment, machinery and supplies. The price contingencies were
based on an expected work program which would involve awarding a substantial
volume of contracts by September 1977. On this basis, civil works inflation
was assumed at 12% for 1977 to 1979 and 10% from 1980 onwards. After award of
contracts it was assumed that escalation would be limited to 5% on contract
work because 50% or more of the contractors' costs would be fixed at the time
of tendering (principally construction machinery costs).
4.20      Although the revised Project concept is similar to the Original
Project in that it would provide for the development of approximately 10,000
ha by gravity irrigation, the two projects differ in their technical design
due mainly to the relocation of the weir and the accompanying partial change
in the Project area. For this reason, a detailed comparison of the costs of
both would not be meaningful; however, a general comparison of the overall
costs excluding customs duties and taxes can be made. The base cost of the
Original Project in 1972 was about US$17 million; if this project were to be
undertaken today, the base cost as of February 1977 would be about US$45
million, an increase of US$28 million. A rough comparison may be drawn
between these estimates and the cost of the revised Project. The base cost of
the revised Project minus the new components added at reappraisal (housing,
machinery and equipment for state farms, and funds for environmental controls)
plus an allowance for the already completed components, is estimated at US$33
million; when compared with the base cost today for the Original Project
(US$45 million), it can be seen that a saving of some US$12 million was
achieved through design changes. Price and physical contingencies under the
Original Project were estimated at US$6 million. Contingencies under the
revised Project are US$21 million. It can therefore be seen that the recent
period of world-wide inflation necessitated an increase of US$15 million for
contingencies in the revised Project. Thus, the additional financing require-
ment of US$34 million can be explained as follows: an increase in base cost of
US$28 million, an increase in contingencies by US$15 million, and additional
components added at reappraisal (estimated at US$3 million) would have yielded
an increase of US$46 million; this increase was, however, offset by a saving
of US$12 million through design changes.
D. Financing
4.21      The original IDA credit of US$17 million would have financed about
75% of the total cost of the Original Project (US$22.8 million); the remaining
US$5.8 million would have been financed by Government through annual budget



allocations to AVDA.  Works already implemented under tne original Project
include construction of the link road from the Awash-Tendaho highway to the
Melka-Warer townsite, the feasibility study for the future Bolhamo and Angelele
projects, the construction of four wells to open new grazing areas on the
Alledeghi plains, some office and staff housing facilities for AVDA, and
bush clearing of about 2,000 lha of land. Total IDA disbursements have
amounted to US$1.3 million, leaving an undisbursed balance of US$15.7
million available from the original credit. The proposed revised Project
cost net of taxes and duties is US$56.8 million. In order to meet this
greatly expanded Project cost, supplemental financing was requested by
Government from IDA, while at the same time additional financing was secured
from the European Economic Community (EEC) and the African Development Fund
(ADF). Government agreed that in line with this new financing arrangement,
it would significantly increase its own contribution. The revised schedule
of Project financing is given below:
 ----------US$ million       
Original              New
Commitment           Commitment   %
IDA                           17.0                25.0      44
Government                     5.8                  9.4     16
EEC                            -                  16.9      30
ADF                            -                   5.5      10
Total                    22.8                56.8    100
IDA, together with Government, would finance the major portion of the
irrigation system and the roads; it would also finance the consultants and
some of the buildings and housing at Project Headquarters. The EEC would
finance on-farm development, the farm machinery and part of the equipment and
vehicles and the buildings and housing. ADF would finance the western flood
dyke, the environmental controls and part of the equipment and vehicles and
the buildings and housing. (Annex 8, Table 1). A condition of effectiveness
for the proposed IDA credit of US$25.0 million would be that Government had
signed Loan agreements with the other financing agencies and that conditions
of effectiveness under said loans had been met. The proceeds of the IDA
credit and loans from other financing agencies together with Government funds
allocated for Project development would be channelled through Government and
the funds relating to the irrigation network, roads, on-farm development and
technical assistance would be onlent to AVDA at an annual interest rate of
6% 1/ repayable over 50 years including an eight year grace period on interest
and principal. It would also be a-condition of credit effectiveness that
Government and AVDA had entered into a Project Financing agreement providing
for the onlending of the Credit proceeds to AVDA.
1/   This rate of interest is based on the expected return to AVDA from the
water charges (para 6.10) levied on all Project settlers and the state
farms; the water charges were set at a level which it was felt would
not result in disincentives to production.

E. Procurement
4.22      All civil works contracts for the construction of the weir, main
canal, main drain, eastern flood dyke, and the distribution network (US$10.5
million including contingencies), and internal roads, (US$4.2 million
including contingencies) would be tendered on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. Buildings and
housing at the Project Headquarters (US$400,000), would be constructed after
local competitive bidding. It is unlikely that foreign bidders will tender
for any civil works construction because of unsettled and unfavorable local
conditions. Local contractors are of two basic types; those owned and
operated by Ethiopians and those owned and operated by foreigners who are
residents of Ethiopia. The latter group includes firms that have been
established in Ethiopia for up to 50 years, are incorporated and operate
only in Ethiopia, but are owned by individuals who although they may have
been born in Ethiopia have elected to retain their foreign citizenship
(usually Italian); in most cases they are the more qualified local contrac-
tors and have a better financial position. AVDA has already advertised
locally and sent a circular to 14 foreign embassies for "Expressions of
Interest" on the part of contractors interested in participating in the
Amibara construction program. Six local contractors, each of which is
capable of undertaking the work, indicated an interest in participating in
the competitive bidding process; of the six, four companies are owned by
foreign nationals and two by Ethiopians. As tenders are issued the contrac-
tor situation will be reviewed by the borrowers consultants, particularly with
respect to anticipated competition and capability, and the scope and magnitude
of contracts and tender documents adjusted in accordance with the findings at
that time. The contract documents have been prepared by the consultants.
AVDA, with the assistance of the consultants, will be responsible for the
evaluation of bids and award of contracts. Sir William Halcrow and Partners
has been retained by AVDA (para 4.14) to serve as engineering and technical
consultants for the Amibara Project. It is expected that the firm would
continue to serve AVDA in this capacity until the completion of the irriga-
tion system. Other technical personnel (para 4.15) would be recruited
internationally following IDA guidelines.
F. Disbursement
4.23      The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed on the following
basis:
(a) 63% of cost of civil works including the weir, the main
canal, main drain, eastern flood dyke, and the distribution
network (US$10.5 million), Project roads (US$4.2 million) and
buildings and housing at Project Headquarters (US$400,000).
(b) 100% of foreign cost of consultants (US$8.6 million).



- 18 -
Disbursements would be fully documented. An estimated schedule of disburse-
ments from the Credit is presented in Annex 8, as is an estimated Project
implementation schedule.
G. Accounts and Audit
4.24      AVDA is subject to annual audit by the Office of the Auditor Gen-
eral which is satisZactory to IDA. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that AVDA would ensure that: (a) separate accounts for the Project would
continue to be maintained in a manner satisfactory to IDA; (b) AVDA's and
Project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA; and (c) within six months of the close of financial year, certified
copies of the audited financial statements and the auditors report thereon
would be forwarded to IDA.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      The Ministry of Agriculture, acting through its subsidiary agencies,
would have general responsibility for all aspects of Project development
(Chart, World Bank 16754). A Valleys Agricultural Development Authority
(VADA) was recently established within the Ministry with powers to establish
and designate River Valleys as semi-autonomous entities to oversee the dev-
elopment of all river valleys in Ethiopia. VADA is governed by a board of
commissioners which includes the Minister of Agriculture and Settlement
(Chairman) and representatives of the Ministry of Mines, Power and Water
Resources; the Ministry of Commerce and Industry; the Ministry of Interior
and the Planning Commission. The Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA) which
replaces the Awash Valley Authority (AVA), now the most important agency
within VADA, is the agency with overall responsibility for the administration
and development of the natural resources of the Awash Valley; it is AVDA which
would be immediately responsible for the major part of Project implementation.
In order to isolate Project related development within the Valley, a Project
office has been established within AVDA (World Bank Charts 16752 and 16753).
A highly qualified Ethiopian Project Executive Director has been recruited to
head this office, and recruitment of key Project staff is now underway. In
order to assist the Amibara Project Office with its responsibilities, the
General Manager of AVDA has appointed a Project Coordinating Committee to
advise the Executive Director with regard to technical details of Project
implementation and to consider certain overall policy issues.
5.02      Since inception AVA had been plagued with several major problems,
of which the lack of qualified technical staff ranks first and most impor-
tant. This shortage of competent and experienced staff was later compounded



- 19 -
by the reshuffling of personnel by the new Government. Moreover, field staff
were totally dependent on an inefficient head office for all operations in-
cluding the smallest disbursement. Another constraint on AVA's operations
was the lack of flexibility in Government regulations with regard to the re-
allocation of funds from one activity to another. Any reallocation of funds
from one activity with surplus funds to another with a deficit required a
request for supplementary financing from the Ministry of Finance with all the
accompanying red tape and cumbersome procedures. In financial matters, AVA
operated essentially as a Government department and not as an autonomous de-
velopment agency. As the new agency, AVDA is a de facto descendant of AVA,
steps would be taken to strengthen it to meet the increased demands made upon
it as its responsibilities expand and the Agency should be strengthened to
enable it to act as an autonomous development agency capable of Project
implementation. For this purpose, assurances were obtained at negotiations
that Government would allow AVDA sufficient independence to carry out its
duties effectively. Specifically assurances were obtained that:
(a) In the first week of each fiscal quarter AVDA would
receive from Government the budgetary funds
allocated it for that quarter.
(b) The use of these funds would not be restricted
but would be transferable from one item of
expenditure to another in AVDA's budget for the
prompt and efficient execution of the Project.
(c) The Project Executive Director shall have adequate
powers to authorize payments on account of Project
expenditures.
5.03      Assurances were obtained that AVDA would appoint:  (a) a qualified
and experienced person recruited after consultation with IDA as a counterpart
to the Project Manager not later than December 31, 1977 (para 4.15); and
(b) counterparts to the other technical staff to be provided by the consult-
ants. Assurances were likewise obtained that the qualifications and job
descriptions of these staff would be sent to IDA for review not later than
September 30, 1977.
Water Supply. Demand and Quality (Annex 9)
5.04      Water Supply.  The Project area would obtain its water supply
from the Awash River system which has been partially regulated by the Koka
Dam and hydroelectric plant, which commenced operation in 1961, and by the
Awash II and Awash III dams and hydroelectric plants, constructed with the
assistance of Bank Loan 375-ET (1964). These dams, which are controlled by
the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA), have increased
the dry season flows and reduced the intensity of floods. As a result,
several irrigation projects, totalling about 32,000 ha, have been under-
taken upstream of the Project area. On the basis of stream flow records
(1962-1974), it was found that the Awash regulated flow would be adequate to



meet the irrigation requlements of the upstream schexues and the Project area
with on'ly minor deficits in severe drought years, provided that:  (1)  water
diversion by all upstream users is properly controlled, and not permitted to
exceed its preeas1t levels; and (i)'  EELPA agrees to operate the Koka hydro-
electric plant so as to release, during periods of anticipated low flow, dis-
charges sufficient to meet irrigation requirements. Over the past ten years,
EELPA has cooperated with AVDA in drought periods to provide sufficient
irrigation water for downstream users. This cooperation is expected to
continue, especially since the completion of the Fincha hydroelectric plant
gives EELPA greater operating flexibility. AVDA has collected some data on
the diversion needs of all irrigation users. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that (i) AVDA shall carry out a continuous survey of irrigated
areas and water diversion requirements for purposes of irrigation throughout
the Awash Valley to be able to establish monthly estimates of such diversion
requirements in advance; and (ii) establish a monitoring system and install
additional recording gauges on all major river diversions to ensure efficient
use of the available flows. Assurances were also obtained that Government
would not permit river flows at the diversion weir to be depleted below the
Project's requirements.
Water Rights
5.05      In the proclamation for its establishment, VADA is given responsibi-
lity for administering all water allocation and the power to issue directions
relating to the use of water resources. Government's elimination of all large
landholdings by private parties has significantly reduced the problem of water
control in the valley. Because of the limits on land ownership, it is unlikely
that any other irrigation developments would be carried out in the valley
which might seriously affect the water supplies.
Operation and Maintenance
5.06      As initial delivery of irrigation water to the first section of
the Project area would commence in mid-1979, an operation and maintenance
service would be established at the beginning of that year with the neces-
sary equipment purchased under the Project. The consultants would be respon-
sible for the operation and maintenance service until Ethiopian personnel are
fully trained and are competent to assume full responsibility. The operation
and maintenance service would be responsible for all works (including roads
within the Project area), down to and including the turn-outs to the state
farms, Research Station, AVDA farms and blocks of settler development. The
State Farms Development Authority, research station, and AVDA farm authorities
would be responsible for operation and maintenance below the turn-outs. Upon
completion of the Project, the estimated annual operation and maintenance cost
in 1977 constant terms, including amortization of equipment, would be Birr
950,000 or about Birr 95 (US$46) per irrigated ha. Detailed operation and
maintenance costs are shown in Annex 14.

VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Production (Annex 10)
6.01     Cotton is at present the main crop in the Awash Valley, and due to
its favorable price/yield situation it will continue to be the predominant
crop for the foreseable future. At full development, cotton yields are
expected to reach 30 quintals/ha on the state farms and 25 quintals/ha in
the settlements. At full development, total incremental seed cotton produc-
tion from the Project would reach almost 22,000 tons per annum, maize would
reach 420 tons and beans 60 tons per annum. Most of the food crops are for
settlers' home consumption; maize yields, however, are likely to produce a
surplus over normal family food requirements. The table below shows yields
and total Project production at full development (year 10):
Crop           Area             Yield            Production
(ha)          (tons/ha)            (tons)
State
Farms       Cotton          6,700             3.0              20,100
Settle-
ments       Cotton            640             2.5                1,600
Maize             120             3.5                 420
Beans              40             1.5                  60
6.02     As experience and ability to properly handle crop production is
developed, rotations with economically viable oil and or grain crops can be
introduced on the state farms. These could include sesame, groundnuts and
higher yielding maize. Both the state farms and the settlers would in the
long term adopt a crop rotation program to maintain soil fertility and
soil condition. At that stage, several oil and grain crops plus legume
type forage crops could provide the needed break in continuous cotton
planting and still offer reasonably good financial returns.
6.03      Availability of improved seed (except higher yielding maize),
fertilizers and pesticides has not been a problem in the past and should
continue to be readily accessible to valley producers. Most land prepara-
tion and many field cultivation practices are fully mechanized, and provi-
sion has been made for equipping AVDA and the state farms with the required
tractors and equipment to handle the new irrigated land. Regular aerial
spraying of cotton is a successfully established practice and has proven
most effective. A certain amount of hand labor for weeding and thinning
cotton in addition to total hand picking would be required.



- 22 -
Markets and Prices
6.04      Cotton production in Ethiopia has increased rapidly in recent
years and is currently estimated to be about 90,000 tons of seed cotton
or 30,000 tons of lint. The Awash Valley produces 80% of all lint grown
in Ethiopia, all under irrigation. The most recent estimate, 1973/74
season, was 70,000 to 72,000 tons of high grade medium staple 1-1/16
inch seed cotton - which produces a much better quality lint than domes-
tic mills require and can bring a premium on the world market. Present
domestic lint production and demand are almost in equilibrium; the nine
textile mills in the country have a spinning capacity of about 30,000
tons. Domestic demand is growing, but at a slower rate than production
which is expected to be well in excess of local requirements by 1985.
Project generated incremental lint production will probably move into
the export trade. The total projected volume of cotton lint available for
export at full development would be some 12,000 tons; this would represent
only a negligible portion of expected 1985 world export trade of 4.7 mil-
lion tons. The plans to construct a ginnery in the Middle Awash region will
contribute to improving the economic advantages of the export market by
eliminating the costly trucking of loose seed cotton to the Addis ginneries.
The proposed location of the ginnery is on the main highway and railroad
routes to the ports of Assab and Djibouti, a factor which would further
reduce handling and transport costs.
6.05     Total Middle Awash Valley cotton production including the Project
area should increase by about 12,000 tons of lint by 1985. Cotton acreage
should also continue to expand in the Upper and Lower Awash, increasing the
total to about 10,000 ha of new irrigated land producing about 8,500 tons of
lint. Lint from sources outside the Awash Valley should increase by about
6,000 tons bringing total 1985 production to about 44,000 tons of lint.
Because of the demand by domestic textile manufactures for shorter staple
lint, limited imports will continue.
6.06      Until 1972-73 Ethiopia was a net importer of cotton lint and the
price paid by manufacturers for locally produced lint tended towards parity
with the cost of imported lint. In fact it was slightly higher because
local lint could be bought in smaller lots and payment made either on, or
shortly after delivery, rather than in advance as in the case with imports.
The effect of taxation and duties on imported lint was to increase the cost
above the cif price by between 20 and 30 percent. With the addition of port
handling costs, port dues, exchange commission and transport to Addis Ababa
the cost of imported lint delivered to the mill was roughly one-third higher
than the cif price at Assab.
6.07      The three year average price for strict middling 1-1/16 inch sta-
ple cif UK from 1971 to 1973 was US$0.45 per lb. In the first six months
of 1974 prices averaged over US$0.60 per lb, having peaked at US$0.93 in
January. IBRD projections for the price of cotton in 1980 are US$0.58 per lb
cif, Liverpool in 1975 constant terms. This is equivalent to Birr 264.1 per
quintal of lint cif Liverpool and Birr 230.1 per quintal of lint at the
farmgate. A Middle Awash farmgate price of Birr 83.0 per quintal of seed
cotton was used in Project calculations.

State Farm and Settler Income (Annex 11)
6.08     Summaries of farm budgets for a state farm and for a 2.5 ha individ-
ual settlement plot are presented in Annex 11, Tables 5 and 6. The direct
beneficiaries of the Project would comprise the settlers on the AVDA farms
and the wage earners on the state farms. For the settlers the per capita
income for a family of five is expected to rise from an average in the area
of about Birr 60 to Birr 422 at full development. For fully employed wage
carners, assuming 250 working days per year, the annual income is expected to
!, -bout Birr 500 and for the seasonal workers Birr 200.  These incomes would
accrue to the presently underemployed workers from the highlands as well as
some Afars from the valley whose incomes are at the subsistence level.
Recovery of Costs
6.09     Project investment costs subject to recovery amount to about US$34
million, which cover all investment costs except (a) those for farm ma-
chinery, buildings and housing depreciation of which is included in the annual
production costs and operation and maintenance equipment, the depreciation of
which is included in operation and maintenance costs respectively; (b) 30% of
the cost of all roads as (i) these would also serve non-Project users, and
(ii) part of the cost would be recovered through a gasoline tax and other
charges; (c) price contingencies; and (d) the cost of additional water-table
control facilities which, if found to be necessary, would be recovered through
reassessment of water charges.
6.10     In the Project calculations, it was assumed that settlers and state
farms would be required to pay within one year after land is irrigable, an
annual operation and maintenance charge of not less than Birr 95/ha to cover
the cost of operating and maintaining the irrigation scheme. Likewise, it was
assumed that an annual water/land charge of not less than Birr 200 per ha for
settlers and Birr 800 per ha for state farms in 1977 constant terms would be
collected from the beginning of the fourth year (i.e. full development)
following the introduction of irrigation. These charges were assumed at a
ievel which it was felt would not result in disincentives to production (Annex
11, Table 7) and would be sufficient to cover AVDA's administrative expenses
relative to Project works and to repay the loan onlent by Government at 6% per
annum over 50 years including 8 years grace period for both interest and
principal. In order to a1low for the maximum recovery of Project costs, suchl
charges would have to be adjusted over the years to allow for any fluctuations
in the purchasing power of the Birr. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that AVDA will collect charges from settlers and state farms in order to
obtain revenues at least sufficient to cover all its operating, maintenance
and administrative costs relating to the irrigation facilities included in the
Project and in addition to recover the funds, including interest thereon,
invested in such facilities taking into account the relationship of the
investment recovery rate to settlers' and state farms' production incentives
and capacity to pay. Assurances were also obtained that AVDA will periodical-
ly review in consultation with the Government and the Association, at least
once every three years, the adequacy of these charges.
6.11      The possibilities of volumetric pricing of water based on actual
installation of meters or through estimating water allocation based on crops



- 24 -
were investigated and found to be too costly to be justifiable in the first
instance and too cumbersome to implement in the latter. It was therefore
felt that a simple straightforward charge as indicated above would be easy to
apply since there are only two classes of beneficiaries, namely the settlers
and the state farms. The revenue from the above charges would recover all
Project costs at about 7% over 50 years.
6.12      Income tax would be levied at a rate of 10% on settlers with a
net annual income over Birr 1,200 but not exceeding Birr 3,000, and at a
rate of 70% on state farms whose net annual income is expected to be
above Birr 33,000. Land tax would be levied at a rate of Birr 4/ha for
settlers and Birr 2/ha for state farms. It is estimated that annual tax
collection on income at full development after deduction of AVDA charges
would amount to Birr 0.7 million. Government's incremental cash flow from
the Project in constant terms would approximate Birr 230 million over the
estimated life of the Project (Annexes 12 and 13).
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Economic Benefits (Annex 16)
7.01     The major benefits from the Project would be the opening of the
Middle Awash Valley, one of Ethiopia's most promising agricultural areas,
for commercial farming; better employment for the rural population of the
area; and foreign exchange earnings from the export of cotton. The poten-
tial for export of cotton is good and the prospects for the export of other
high value agricultural products clearly exists. Although other crops with
higher value are being grown successfully in the Project area, the Project
analysis was made on the basis of cotton production alone. This decision
was based on the fact that cotton is a proven crop which has been grown
successfully in the valley at high yields over a period of years, and
there is little question that it can continue to be produced at satisfac-
tory yields under monocultural cropping for a long period. If the Proj-
ect is viable with cotton, it would have even higher returns with crops
such as bananas and peppers which are now grown in limited amounts in the
Project area.
7.02     The overall economic rate of return for the Project over 50 years
would be 13.0%. In this analysis foreign exchange was shadow priced at a
rate of Birr 2.70 per US$1.00 (as compared with an official rate of Birr 2.07/
US$1.00) to reflect more accurately the value of foreign exchange to Ethi-
opia. Unskilled farm labor was shadow priced at 50% of the standard wage
rate. The Project would not be particularly sensitive to changes in the
basic parameters. An increase in Project costs by 20% would reduce the rate
of return to 11.1%, while a decrease in production, yields or prices by 20%
would reduce it to 8.9%. A delay in Project benefits by one year would
reduce the rate of return to 11.5%.
7.03      The principal risk facing the Project would be the tenuous political
situation and the unfavorable climate for contractors who would be involved



- 25 -
in the Project. Otherwise, however, the Project should have a reasonable
expectation of success. Several other risks were identified which could
affect either the construction of the irrigation works or the operation of
the settlement scheme and the state farms. However, these risks do not
appear to be significant. The construction and operation of the irrigation
system will be supervised by a firm of consultants who have been working
with AVDA for the past four years; the final designs have been completed and
the tender documents prepared. The system is a relatively simple one and no
difficulties are foreseen in its construction. Likewise, the settlement
scheme is not expected to encounter any undue problems. AVDA has been
working with the Afar people in this area for many years. Some 500 families
have been settled and are already actively engaged in crop cultivation.
Given the experience in the area and the wide acceptance of this program by
the Afar people, the settlement of the remaining 320 families should proceed
as expected. The risks associated with the development of 4 new state farms
in the Project area would be minimized by the availability within the State
Farms Development Authority of a number of field personnel experienced in
large-scale crop cultivation in the Awash Valley. The Authority has retained
the services of the former owners of several large private farms in this
area. These people would provide the experienced managerial skills so
necessary to the profitable operation of the new farms and to the training
of new personnel.
Employment
7.04     The Project would create employment for the local Afars and for
underemployed workers from the highlands. The AVDA settlement program would
provide land for 800 families and these farmers would, in addition to the
family labor employed, hire seasonal labor for cotton picking. At full
development, it is estimated that regular employment for about 3,500 farm
workers and seasonal employment (three months per year) for about 7,500
workers would be created by the settlement, the research station and the
state farms. During the construction period, it is estimated that up to
750 workers would be employed on construction of the Project infrastruc-
ture.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government on the
following points:
(a)  Should ground water levels rise so as to affect the
productivity of soils in the Project area, Government
would make available to AVDA the funds needed to meet
the cost of installing additional water-table control
facilities (para 4.08);
(b)  AVDA, the State Farms Development Authority and any other
organization operating on Project lands would comply
with the restrictions specified in para 4.17;



- 26 -
(c) the procurement procedures specified in para 4.22 would
be followed;
(d) separate accounts would be kept for the Project by AVDA,
AVDA's and Project accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and the audited
financial statements and the auditor's report thereon would be
forwarded to IDA within six months of the close of the financial
year (para 4.24);
(e)  Government would allow AVDA sufficient independence to carry
out its duties effectively; this would include stipulations
that: in the first week of each fiscal quarter AVDA would
receive from Government the budgetary funds allocated it for
that quarter; the use of these funds would not be restricted but
they would be transferable from one item of expenditure to
another; and the Project Executive Director shall have adequate
powers to authorize payments on account of Project expenditures
(para 5.02);
(f) Government would not permit river flows at the diversion weir to
be depleted below the Project's requirements (para 5.05);
and
(g) AVDA shall collect charges from settlers and state farms in
order to obtain revenues at least sufficient to cover all its
operating, maintenance and administrative costs relating to the
irrigation facilities included in the Project and in addition to
recover the funds including interest thereon invested in such
facilities taking into account the relationship of the invest-
ment recovery rate to settlers and state farms production
incentives and capacity to pay. These charges shall be reviewed
in consultation with Government and the Association at least
once every three years (para 6.10).
8.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) Government had signed loan agreements with the other
financing agencies and that conditions of effective-
ness under these loans had been met (para 4.21);
(b) Government and AVDA had entered into a Project
financing agreement to cover the revised Project plan
(para 4.21).
8.03     Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed Project
would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$25.0 million to the Government of
Ethiopia to replace Credit 418-ET in the amount of US$17.0 million, approved
by the Executive Directors on June 7, 1973, which would be cancelled.

REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Project History
1.        A United Nations Development Program (UNDP) study of the Awash
River Basin, carried out from 1961 to 1964, recommended investment in capi-
tal intensive commercial agriculture with initial emphasis on irrigation the
Melka Sadi and Amibara areas. Since 1965 the UNDP and FAO have been provid-
ing technical assistance to the Awash Valley Authority now known as the Awash
Valley Development Agency (AVDA), a Government public authority which was
created in 1962 to administer and develop the natural resources of the Awash
River Basin. The World Bank Group first assisted with the development of the
Awash Valley in 1964 through its support for two power plants. In 1968 the
Group helped finance a two-lane bituminous surfaced road from Awash to Tendaho
(303 km) in the middle and lower valley. This road was justified partly on
grounds of opening the valley for irrigation development. The Loan Agreement
provided for the preparation of a specific irrigation project covering about
20,000 ha in the Melka-Sadi and Amibara areas in the middle valley. A commit-
tee was set up in 1968 to supervise the preparation of the project. Agencies
represented on the committee included AVDA, UNDP, FAO, THE FAO/ IBRD Co-
operative Program and the Bank. Italconsult of Italy was retained to do a
feasibility study.
2.        In September 1969, the Government submitted the final feasibility
report to the Bank. The proposed project was appraised by an IDA mission
late in 1969. Several basic issues were raised including the adequacy of
the soil survey and land classification and the role of tobacco in the pro-
posed cropping pattern. Additional field investigations were then carried
out and in October 1971 an IDA mission appraised the Project. As proposed
at the time, the project called for construction of two diversion weirs on
the Awash River at two points upstream of the Melka-Sadi and Amibara areas,
con struction of irrigation and drainage works on 14,600 ha, construction
of dykes, roads and on-farm development works, construction of service
buildings and housing as well as provision for consultant services to AVDA
for additional investigations and studies (including a feasibility study for
a second stage project) and technical assistance for project operation and
maintenance.
3.        Subsequently the Government, after consultation with IDA, decided
to lease the upstream Melka-Sadi area of about 4,600 ha to the Melka-Sadi
Agricultural Estate Company (MAESCO) to speed up construction and utilize
private capital and expertise in land development.  This change in the proj-
ect restricted the development under the IDA project to the Amibara area of
about 10,000 ha. In December 1972, a further IDA mission reviewed the modi-
fied project, called for gravity irrigation by a diversion weir to about



ANNEX 1
Page 2
10,000 ha in the Amibara area only, and a credit of US$17 million was ap-
proved on July 5, 1973. The credit was not made effective until August 30,
1974 because of the delay in parliamentary ratification.
4.        The IDA project as approved in 1973 was intended to provide
gravity irrigation by diversion with a weir at Melka Warer from the Awash
River to about 10,000 ha of land in the Amibara area. In addition to the
diversion weir, the principal works were to include irrigation and drainage
networks to serve the 10,000 ha, flood protection dykes, roads, on-farm
development and service buildings and housing. It also provided for studies
for a second-stage project to be carried out by the consultants for the
development of Bolhamo and Angelele areas as well as a study of public
health considerations in all project areas. The Project works were to be
completed in five years. The total Project cost at time of appraisal was
estimated at US$22.8 million. The IDA credit of US$17 million was intended
to finance about 75% of the project's cost, or US$13.7 million of foreign
exchange costs and US$3.3 million of local costs on construction contracts.
The balance of local costs of approximately US$6 million were to be met by
Government through annual budget allocations to AVDA. The project plans
called for the settlement of 800 Afar families on 2-1/2 ha holdings which
would have utilized 2,000 ha; 400 ha were to be devoted to agricultural
investigations and the remaining 7,600 ha were to be leased as farming
concessions to groups of 3 or more individuals or to share companies with 5
or more shareholders. Under the project, concessionaires and settlers would
have been required to pay, as soon as land was irrigable, an annual opera-
tion and maintenance charge of Birr 57 (US$27.5) per ha. In addition, with
a view to recovering as much of the project cost as practicable while
providing adequate incentives to the concessionaries, an annual water and
land charge of not less than Birr 300 (US$145) per ha was to be levied from
the beginning of the fourth year of irrigation. This charge was to be
raised from the ninth year onwards to not less than Birr 500 (US$242) per
ha. The annual water and land charge proposed for Afar settlers was to be
Birr 100 (US$48) per ha from the fourth year onwards following the introduc-
tion of irrigation. The revenue from the above charges would have recovered
all project costs at 7%, or if the opportunity cost of capital were assumed
to be 10%, at a 10% discount rate the present value of revenues would have
covered 79% of the present value of costs. Thus, there would have been
an implied subsidy to settlers of Birr 7.1 million (US$3.4 million). With
cotton as the only crop and a shadow wage rate of Birr 0.50 per day (Birr
1.00 was the accepted regular rate) for unskilled agricultural labor, the
economic rate of return on the project was estimated at appraisal at 16%.
5.        In accordance with the Credit Agreement, AVDA employed a firm of
consultants (Sir William Halcrow and Partners) to complete final designs
and supervise construction of the project. In early 1974, the consultants
reviewed the cost estimates using current road construction bids received
by the Highway Authority on road projects and applying these to quantities
estimated in accordance with their engineering designs for this project.
Based on the above they found that project costs had risen 2-1/2 to 3



ANNEX 1
Page 3
times the estimates used in the appraisal report. In view of the sub-
stantial increase in costs, AVDA after consultation with IDA requested
the consultants to work out an alternative plan. The consultants proposed
a gradual development of the Amibara area based on pump irrigation. This
proposal deviated from the original plan, thus requiring a revision of
development strategy. It was, therefore, deemed advisable to examine the
various alternatives of project implementation and to identify the best
means of construction of project works. An IDA mission visited Ethiopia in
February 1975 to review the status of the project and determine the best
means of development under the changed conditions. The mission also eval-
uated, as an alternative to gravity irrigation, a pumping scheme for the
Amibara area consisting of five pumping plants. The principal advantages
of pump development would be the comparatively lower initial cost and the
opportunity to phase investment and development to adjust to the capabili-
ties of the borrower to implement the project. The lower initial cost of
the pumping scheme, however, would be offset by the higher annual operating
costs - particularly for fuel, repairs and replacement costs - and the dif-
ficulties of pump maintenance which could impair the reliability of the water
supply and crop yields. It was the mission's view that several important
aspects of the project alternate schemes had not been completed or adequately
resolved to meet the requirements of a full appraisal. The mission was of the
opinion that a gravity plan with less elaborate designs would be feasible
subject to completion of further studies by the consultants. Discussions with
Government and the completion of further studies by the consultants confirmed
these views, and IDA concluded that a reappraisal of the project was necessary
in order to fully evaluate the latest proposals.
6.        The reappraisal was carried out in January/February 1976. The
revised Project concept is in many respects similar to the Original Project
in that it would provide for the irrigated development of some 10,000 ha.
However, the overall technical design of the Project was significantly
changed at the reappraisal. The original high cost diversion structure
which was to be constructed on the Awash River at Melka-Warer would be
replaced by a low rockfill diversion weir at a site upstream of the Melka-
Sadi area at a narrow point in the river (Map, IBRD 10313 R). The reloca-
tion of the diversion structure allowed the inclusion of the Melka-Sadi area
in the gravity irrigation scheme and thus, should this be desired in the
future, the ultimate expansion of the system over a considerably greater
area than would otherwise have been possible. The relocation of the weir
also necessitated a substantial change in the lay-out and design of the
irrigation works.

REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Soils
1.        During the course of the feasibility study, about 1,700 soil pro-
files were examined throughout the Amibara and Melka-Sadi Plains. The soils
were classified and a land use classification was then developed from the
information obtained.
2.        The soils of the Project area are recent alluviums of considerable
depth in which two main phases of deposition are recognized. During the first
phase, sandy loams to clay loams (the "brown" soils) with good permeability -
Class I soils - were deposited, while in the second phase, loamy clays with
restricted permeability - Class II - were deposited in the low lying areas
along the eastern and western edges of the brown soils. The thickness of
these heavier "black" soils varies from a few centimeters to more than 3 m.
3.        Following the 1969 appraisal mission, it was found that supplemen-
tary work was required on the Project land classification, including studies
on soils, drainage, water quality, and economics. Italconsult was given the
assignment and work was completed by September 1971.
4.        During the course of these supplemental studies, field investiga-
tions were carried out at more than 300 additional sites in the Project
area; soil samples from these areas were then analysed in the laboratory.
As a result:
(a) the accuracy of the land classification was increased;
(b) the degree of salinity and alkalinity in Project soils
under existing conditions was determined accurately;
(c) additional information was obtained on soil permeability
by carrying out tests on infiltration rates and hydraulic
conductivity; tests of salt leaching were also made; and
(d) the existing boron content of soils and Awash River water
was determined and a judgement was made whether excessive
boron would be likely to accumulate in the soils under
irrigation.
5.        The revised survey and land classification shows that salinity and
alkalinity are not problems under present conditions and would not become
critical under irrigation if adequate provision were made for drainage.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Boron occurs in moderate concentration in certain areas under present con-
ditions but would be expected to be leached under irrigation development,
especially with the anticipated good quality irrigation water.
6.        The arable soils of the area have satisfactory infiltration rates.
The brown soils can be leached of soluble salts but, since the heavier black
soils have low salt levels, their susceptibility to leaching was not deter-
mined. Italconsult, the Institute of Agricultural Research, and Victoria
State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (SRWSC) have determined that the
black soils in the arable area have sufficient vertical water percolation to
meet requirements for salt balance in the soil profile. Nevertheless, the
Melka Warer research station is continuing its investigation of the vertical
hydraulic condutivity of the black soils in relation to leaching capacity.
7.        On the basis of recent supplementary investigations 47% (3,500 ha)
of the net Project area to be developed is regarded as Class I. About 49%
(3,700 ha) is regarded as Class II, and 300 ha in the western Melka-Sadi area
is of lower quality but suitable for cultivation.

ETHIOPIA
REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Project Works
Project Concept
1.        Two alternative methods of diverting water from the Awash River
were examined: gravity and pumping. Gravity diversion was selected as the
more economical and most desirable method. The small pumps presently oper-
ated by the state farms and AVDA to irrigate about 2,800 ha would be
discarded when a gravity supply becomes available, by which time their
salvage value would be small.
2.        The adopted gravity scheme for the Project would have a low rock-
fill weir across the Awash River upstream from the Melka-Sadi area with a
main canal serving 3,200 ha of new land in the Melka-Sadi area and 4,300 ha
of new land in the Amibara area. In addition, 1,300 ha of presently pumped
irrigation in the MAESCO estate in Melka-Sadi and 1,500 ha at the AVDA farm
and Melka-Warer Research Station in Amibara would be converted to gravity
irrigation.
The Diversion Weir
3.        The rockfill diversion weir would have a maximum height of appro-
ximately 4 meters with a central overflow section and a canal headworks at
the right abutment. The weir crest elevation of 749.0 in the overflow section
would maintain a full pond level of 748.80 and a fully supply level of 748.0
in the canal at the inlet.  The abutment sections of the weir would be csn-
structed to elevation 753.0 which would allow a discharge of about 700 m /sec
(approximately a 1,000 year flood) over the weir and emergency spillway. The
crest level of the emergency spillway would be it elevation 750.0 at which
level the discharge over the weir would be 60 m /sec, about twice the
average discharge from Koka Dam. After each use of the emergency spillway,
maintenance of the spillway would be required.
4.        Investigations of the weir site, by drilling, show foundations
of gravels and boulders mixed with clay. Tests of the foundations during
investigation showed high permeability rates and the weir and headworks
would be designed for these conditions.
5.        The canal3headworks would be reinforced concrete with two barrels,
each discharging 6m /sec at a pond elevation of 748.80. A sluice channel
through the rockfill weir would be controlled by a gate and would carry the
coarse bed load away from the entrance to the canal headworks.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
6.        Because of the negligible storage above the weir a high degree
of water control along the main canal system will be required; this becomes
more important as a minimum freeboard has been provided on the main canal
to reduce costs.
Main Canal
7.     3  The main canal about 26 km long would have at its inlet, a capacity
of 12 m /sec for the 10,300 ha to be irrigated. The canal would be designed
for maximum velocity of 0.75 m/sec and for a freeboard of 450 mm. Eleven
offtakes with drops would be provided to serve the several land areas. In
addition, three drop strutures would be provided, where the natural slope of
the land exceeds the canal slope. Small stretches of concrete lining would
be required where the canal passes through pervious strata.
Main Drains
8.        It is not possible to divert drainage water from the Melka-Sadi
area into the river at Melka-Warer due to the high river stages during the
periods when drainage would be required. Drainage from Melka-Sadi would be
carried by an eastern drain, 28 km long flowing eastward crossing the main
canal and link road east of Melka-Warer hill thence along the eastern edge
of the Amibara area where the drain would follow the eastern dyke system and
pick up the surplus waters from the newly developed 4,300 ha area in Amibara.
The drainage flows would discharge by gravity into the Cadda Billen swamp.
A western drain system would start in the AVDA farm and follow the dyke along
the Awash river in the Amibara area and drain into natural channels leading
to the Cadda Billen swamp.
Flood Protection Dykes
9.        A system of flood protection dykes would be constructed along the
western and eastern fringe of the Project area. The total length of the
western dyke is about 43 km, of which 27 km exists. About 16 km of new
dyke would be constructed and about 8 km of existing dyke between the
Melka-Warer farm and the Amibara state farms would be improved and height-
ened. The average height of the western dyke would be 2 m above the river
bank level on which it would be constructed. The eastern dyke would be
approximately 32 km long and would be between 1.5 m and 2 m in height.
It would protect the Project from the surface run-off from the Alledeghi
Plains.
10.       The dykes are designed to protect the Project lands from floods on
the Awash River. The cost of dykes placed economic limits on the height to
which they could be constructed. As designed, they would protect the lands
from floods having a frequency of less than once in five years. For floods
of greater magnitude some portions of the dyke may be breached. The down-
stream 500 ha of the Melka-Sadi area and the upstream 1,000 ha of the new
development in Amibara would be most vulnerable and would probably flood



ANNEX 3
Page 3
first.  It is expected that in the event of flooding there would be time
to plant another crop after the flood recedes so that some benefits would
remain.  After the Project is underway and some experience has been gained it
is expected that short sections of the dyke susceptible to over-topping
could be improved economically to reduce agricultural losses.
Irrigation Networks
11.       Irrigation networks would consist of secondary and tertiary earth
canals conveying water to each block or farming unit consisting of rectangu-
lar fields of up to 10 ha with a short side of approximately 100 m long run-
ning parallel to the contour and a long side of up to 1,000 m long depending
on the slope of the land. In general these fields would be irrigated in
pairs from a common supply canal and would be similarly drained to a common
drain. It has been assumed that a distribution efficiency and field effi-
ciency of 70% each would be attained for an overall Project efficiency of 49%.
Accordingly, assuming 24 hours operation, the design irrigation duty at the
field gate, allowing for field application losses would be 0.85 liter per sec
per ha, and the design irrigation duty at diversion, allowing for distribu-
tion losses, would be 1.2 liters per second per ha.
12.       In general irrigation structures would be simple and constructed
from local materials. There are few major-sized structures required and
most structures would therefore be designed using, as far as possible,
masonry retaining walls and lightly reinforced concrete aprons, Control
and check structures on the primary and secondary canals would consist of
long-crested weirs to maintain constant upstream water levels. For the
primary check structures, stop-log grooves would be provided to control
upstream water levels. Secondary canal check structures would consist of
simply-constructed horse-shoe shaped rubble weirs with a long crest formed
by a masonry core wall. Offtakes to secondary canals would be gated with
steel gates. Steel paddles or stop logs would be sufficient to control flow
to the field channels.
Drainage Networks
13.       Secondary and tertiary drains, with spacing similar to that of the
irrigation network, would remove surplus surface water from the field drains
and convey it to the main drains. Drains would be designed to collect and
discharge excess storm rainfall to prevent crop damage. A storm with a ten
year return period in which 63 mm of rainfall would occur in 24 hours, would
be used for design. Drains would be capable of removing the 24 hour rainfall
in 18 hours. On this basis tertiary drains would have a capacity of 1.2
liters/sec/ha and secondary drains a capacity of 0.25 liters/sec/ha. This
would be acceptable for the proposed cropping pattern.
14.       A recent hydropedological report (1975) estimated that appro-
ximately 5 to 10 years after irrigation development groundwater levels
would have risen to such a level that the installation of sub-surface



ANNEX 3
Page 4
drainage would be required to control water tables and soil salinization.
The precise location, timing and density of this additional deep drain-
age network would have to be determined by further investigation based on
continuous water table monitoring during the course of the Project develop-
ment. The depth of the drains and the sill levels of drainage structures
would be set so that the surface drain system would be able to accommodate the
effluent from the future tile drains.
Roads
15.       Approximately 40 km of principal roads and 50 km of service roads
would be constructed. Both types would be gravel surfaced, locally availa-
ble, and would be 5 m and 4 m in width respectively with 1 m wide shoulders.
A stabilized surface course 0.30 m thick on principal roads and 0.20 m thick
on service roads would be provided. In addition 50 km of unsurfaced tracks
would be considered a part of the tertiary network.
On-Farm Development Works
16.       Approximately 2,300 ha of new development in Amibara and approxi-
mately 3,000 ha in Melka-Sadi will need to be cleared. Land levelling would
be carried out on the 7,500 ha of new development, after which the construc-
tion of field channels and drains would be carried out. The construction
schedule would coordinate the completion of these works with the correspond-
ing distribution system to achieve immediate use of water in the main and
and secondary canals.

REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Amibara Settlement Scheme
AVADA Settlement in the Amibara Area
1.        The Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA) 1/ was established in
1962 and was entrusted with overall responsibility for "the most efficient and
economic development and use of the resources of the Awash Valley." Studies 2/
of the water and land potential of the valley had conclusively established
that this objective could best be achieved through development of irrigated
agriculture in the valley.
2.        The Awash valley's agricultural potential has led to an increasing
rate of establishment of irrigated farms in the middle and late sixties; by
1970 there were 22,000 hectares in the Lower Awash, 2,500 ha in the Middle
Awash and 14,000 ha in the Upper Awash under cultivation.  Most of the Awash
Basin has been the traditional grazing grounds of the nomadic Afar people, and
the introduction and expansion of irrigated crop production has seriously
disrupted the main source of livelihood of these livestock owners. Government,
recognizing the problem of the Afar herders, began a program for the resettle-
ment of Afars in the Lower and Middle Awash Valley. The Finance Ministry
provided a total of Birr 2.1 million over the period 1966-1972 expressly for
a resettlement program, and AVDA was designated as the responsible agency. Pilot
programs were started in 1967 with 67 Afar families in Amibara and 19 families
in Dubte in the Lower Awash.
3.        AVDA has slowly increased the number of settlers in the Amibara
section to 500 families by 1976. As a farming operation the scheme has
achieved considerable success. Initial poor yields were increased to 2.0 tons
of cotton per hectare in the 1970/71 season, and since then yields in excess
of 3.0 tons per hectare have been reached over the entire area. AVDA is
presently operating about 1,200 hectares, which have been allocated to
the 500 settlers at 2.5 hectare holdings each, all of which are in cotton
production.
4.        Despite the successful production results, the present settlement
system has not been able to establish a workable structure for permanent Afar
settlement. The system is strongly paternalistic 3/ with the settlers having

little if any decision making responsibility or permitted any initiative in
activity concerning their economic welfare. Several studies 1/ have recom-
mended using the traditional Afar tribal clan organization structure as the
basis for settlement units. The 2.5 hectare family plot sizes are satisfac-
tory, but the current settlers lack any formal identification with their
own holdings, as the entire area is communally farmed. AVDA's present system
of only involving the Afar in weeding and picking field tasks has contributed
very little to the overall crop culture training necessary to assist the Afar
in his transition to crop farming. Another constraint to learning has been
the limiting character of involvement in a single crop - cotton, with no
exposure to basic food crop production.
5.        Recent study and observation has done much to refute the early
negative generalization about the ability of the Afars to adjust to seden-
tary living. Afars in the Awash region are not truly wide-ranging nomads
but are semi-nomadic, moving relatively short distances between the grassy
flood plains of the Awash in dry seasons to the adjoining Alledeghi plateau
in the wet season. They have semi-permanent village sites in each area
which are seldom more than 30 km apart, and they have traditionally carried
on aggressive sales and purchases of cattle, sheep and goats in the larger
livestock markets of the region. There is further evidence that the Afars
can, with training, adjust to the change from pastoral livestock keeping to
the diversified irrigated crop culture required in the valley resettlement
program. Admittedly the transition will require a carefully planned training
program with enough field follow-up to assist the cultivators through several
growing seasons.
6.        Most important, however, in evaluating the Afar desire to settle
is the fundamental change in the Afar caused by the severity of the recent
drought. The Afar recognized that the effects of the drought were worsened by
the loss of large areas of traditionally grazed grasslands in the flood plain
and at the same time observed the rich returns produced by irrigated crops.
This has caused a militancy among the tribal groups and an awareness that if
they do not settle on these desirable plots the land will be lost to them
completely.
7.        AVDA assisted by a UNDP/FAO team is adjusting the present settle-
ment scheme to correct the weaknesses of the early settlements. Settlers
will be organized in approximate 40 family clan units, a traditional group-
ing for a tribal village. The 2.5 hectare individual family holdings would
be grouped in units of about 100 hectares of irrigated land for a 40 family
village. Eighty percent of the land would be planted to cotton, the major

cash crop, with the village block farmed communally; in addition, maize
would be planted on about 15% of the settlers' holdings and beans on the
remaining 5%. The two food crops would be cultivated by the settler
family, while cotton cultivation would be partially mechanized. Live-
stock production of both large and small animals traditionally herded by
Afars could also be a viable economic addition to the settlers' farm oper-
ations. Cotton would be the main crop cultivated as it offers the least
marketing risks yet provides the opportunity for good economic returns
under the prevailing conditions.
8.        Planning for the settlement land area in the Amibara area will
include consideration for the following:
(a) Areas would be selected that have predominantly better soils
so that smallholder units of 2.5 hectares can have maximum
production potential. It is important that a unit of this
limited size not be burdened with land of marginal produc-
tivity. Fortunately, almost all the land in the 2,000 hec-
tares of settlement area is classified as Class I land with
high fertility and crop potential. 1/
(b) The 40 family blocks would be located where the village
housing units can be placed in the unimproved fringes of
the cultivated areas, thus reducing idlying of productive
land and permitting uninterrupted field operation in mech-
anized plowing, land-levelling, spraying etc.
9.        The Project would provide assistance to AVDA for the completion
of its ongoing settlement program. Thus, some 320 Afar families (1,600 per-
sons) would be settled on the 800 ha which have not as yet been developed.
Funds would be provided for on-farm development, including bush clearing
and levelling, as well as for farm machinery and some staff housing. The
settlers would be organized in groups of 40 families; each group would be
allocated 100 ha or 2.5 ha per family. These 100 ha blocks would then be
further divided into five 20 ha irrigation units served by a central field
channel with a drainage ditch on both sides. The cropping pattern on the
arable areas would be 80% cotton, 15% maize and 5% beans. The overall in-
tensity may be increased to 120% by the introduction of double cropping
groundnuts and/or sesame once the settlers are permanently established and
familiar with irrigated farming. The plots may also include forage for dry
season supplemental livestock feed if livestock owners so desire.
10.      The farming system would be based on a mixture of hand and mech-
anized operations which would require the involvement of the settler family
in the farm but which would not put a great or unaccustomed a burden on the
family. Land preparation for all crops would be mechanized but planting,

ANNEX 4
Page 4
harvesting, and the disposal of trash would be carried out by hand. One
mechanical weed-control operation has been allowed for the cotton crop, but
all other weeding would be by hand. Pest control would be maintained by
aerial spraying. Although there is tradition of oxen cultivation among the
Afar of the Lower Plains, the use of oxen for draught is absent in the Middle
Valley. Oxen are therefore, not proposed at the outset, but encouragement
and training would be given to farmers to acquire these skills for land
preparation for maize and beans and weeding in cotton. It is unlikely that
oxen cultivation could ever be completely relied upon for land preparation
as timeliness,.particularly in planting cotton, is of the utmost importance
to achieve maximum yields. Machinery service organized initially by AVDA
would be available to the farmers to carry out all mechanized operations.
The Project management in cooperation with extension workers and farmers
would also draw up a program of operations for each settlement area in order
to ensure efficient utilization of equipment and facilitate the operation of
a pest control program.
11.       Training.  The AVDA training farm would continue to be the center
of Afar field training. The farm is presently organized by the AVDA staff
assisted by the UNDP/FAO Advisory Team. An Extension and Training Advisor
would be provided under the Project to assist with the training of settlers
and extension agents. Plots on the training farm would be assigned at the
beginning of the crop season to the Afar families chosen for settlement by
the Afar tribal councils. The families would work their plots through a full
crop cycle in a continuous field training exercise. Following the completion
of the harvest, they would be assigned to their permanent sites. The working
area of the training farm would thus vary from year to year depending upon
the number of families to be settled in the following year. Throughout the
training period farmers would be paid at the going wage rate for their work
on the farm. Besides field assistance and guidance there would be informal
discussions and demonstrations aimed at equipping the farmers with the knowl-
edge and skills to manage and work their farms in the next year. Training-
farm personnel will continue to advise farmers with field follow-up support.
The cropping pattern on the training farm will be 80 percent cotton, 15 per-
cent maize, and 5 percent beans, as in the settlement areas. The proportions
of mechanized and hand operations will be similar to that proposed for small-
holders outlined above. The training farm would make use of the Project's
machinery.
12.       The UNDP/FAO Awash Valley Advisory team cooperating with AVDA exten-
sionl and animal husbandry staff have established an experimental minimum
mechanization scheme for Afar settler training. Briefly, the scheme was set
up to teach Afar settlers techniques of farming and the use of draft animals
for basic food crop cultural practices including plowing, harrowing and cul-
tivation. Hand hoeing, weeding, thinning and harvesting are also included
in the training. Although the program is now operating, it has not com-
pleted one crop cycle and therefore it is too early to evaluate its effec-
tiveness.

13.       Settler Production.  Details of projected settler crop production
can be found in Annex 10. The three-crop package (80% cotton, 15% maize 5%
beans) on 800 hectares of new settlement land will at maturity yield 1,600
tons of seed cotton, 420 tons of maize and 60 tons of beans. These estimates
are based on crop yields projected to increase over a four year period as
follows:

Settlement Farm Hired Labor
14.       It is estimated that a settler family would provide half of the
total hand labor requirements of his 2.5 hectare operation. Cotton culti-
vation and harvesting would require hired labor.  On a per hectare basis,
40 days of field operations and 70% of harvesting will be by non-family
labor.  At full development there will be a 1,600 hectares of cotton yield-
ing at 2,500 kg/ha.  Hired labor requirements are detailed below:

Settlement Cooperatives
15.       At present AVDA staff has assisted the settlers in organizing a
cooperative which is limited to supplying ordinary consumer goods. Under
the revised plan the 40 family units will organize a cooperative society or
farmer's association to provide services and farm supplies. Each eight-fam-
ily block within the 40 family village will be represented on a settlers
committee by an elected block leader. At the beginning the committee will
be assisted by AVDA staff and the Training Specialist who will guide the
committee in crop planning and overall farm activities. After at least
one full season the settlers committee should be able to assume full plan-
ning responsibility with only normal field extension support from AVDA.
16.       The cooperative or association will be responsible for arranging
for the machinery and equipment required by the 100 hectare, 40 family unit.
This would consist of one tractor and a complete line of tillage equipment,
planters and trailers. The tractors for the 100 hectare units will be hired
from the AVDA, which would be responsible for repairs, maintenance and opera-
tion of the equipment. All work on settler units will be charged against the
settler's accounts.
17.       Produce sales at the end of the harvest season will be arranged
by the settler committee. Records of the proceeds, disbursements for pay-
ment of crop services credit for inputs and individual settler's account
will be kept by the cooperative.

REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
State Farms
A. State Farms Development Authority
1.        Government's economic policy has placed a special emphasis on agri-
cultural development, and has had a direct effect on the existing agrarian
structure of the Awash Valley. On February 4, 1975, Government undertook
the nationalization of large-scale commercial farms and their conversion
to state farms operated by the Ministry of Agriculture. With a few exceptions
this change from private to public ownership is now complete. All state
farms are now being administered by the State Farms Development Authority
within the Ministry of Agriculture (Chart, World Bank 16755). This authority
has established separate corporations to oversee development of agricultural
state farm enterprises in various parts of the country. Eight such corpora-
tions have been established to date, with the Awash Valley Corporation (AVC)
designated as the operator of all state farms in the Awash Valley.
2.        It is too early to evaluate the results of the nationalization
of large privately-owned and operated farms. The transfers of ownership and
the subsequent staffing and operation of about 88,000 hectares dispersed
among several hundred farms in all parts of the country has been a vast
undertaking. There were however several important and advantageous existing
factors which have contributed to the successful transfer of the production
potential of these on-going operations. For example, these farms were all
operational with equipment and farm machinery; most had established and
usually tested cropping patterns, and in many cases the existing management
and work force remained to help operate the farm. The original operators
of most of the valley concessionaire farms were retained by the Authority
to continue as managers of their former holdings. They provided the ex-
perienced managerial skills needed for profitable farm operations and for the
training of newly assigned personnel. Several former concessionaire operators
and field supervisory personnel eventually became involved in planning for
state farm staff training, implementation of farm operations, and general
supervision of state farm operations.
State Farms Development Authority - Central Services
3.        The State Farms Development Authority has established a compre-
hensive supporting organization to back up the individual corporations.
Under the Director of the Authority there are five technical sections plus



ANNEX 5
Page 2
one special agronomic research unit organized to provide overall technical
guidance to all agricultural corporations and through them to their state
farms. These are:
1.  Agricultural Engineering Section:
(a) Farm Power and Machinery
(b) Farm Structures
(c) Irrigation
2.   Planning and Programming Section:
(a) Project Preparation and Evaluation
(b) Statistics and Follow-ups
(c) Marketing Research and Coordination
3.   Plant Protection Section:
(a) Entomology
(b) Pathology
(c) Herbology
(d) Agronomic Research Coordination
4.   Financial Section:
(a) Budgets and Financial Analysis
(b) Internal Auditor
(c) Accounts
5.   Administration Section:
(a) General Service
(b) Personnel
(c) Property and Supplies
6.   Agronomic Research Coordination Unit (IAR)
Agricultural Corporations
4.        The organizational structure of the typical agricultural corporation
is shown on the attached chart. The corporation is headed by a General Manager
who is assisted by a number of supporting staff; the latter include:
(a) Administrative Assistant;
(b) Financial Manager;
(c) Commercial Manager;
(d) Market Information and Sales Officer;
(e) Purchasing Agent.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
5.        In most instances the Corporation oversees the development and
operation of several state farms. A single Farm Manager directly re-
sponsible to the General Manager is in overall charge of the development
of all the state farms. Individual farm managers supervise and operate
the individual farms; they are provided with the following services from a
single service pool:
(a) technical services to include major equipment repair
and maintenance;
(b) engineering assistance;
(c) personnel officers, labor relation officers and
general services officers;
(d) accounting services;
(e)  general stores services which provide
warehouses and storage space and procurement
of inputs, small tools and other production
requirements.
B. Project State Farms
6.        The Project would provide funds for land development, equipment and
construction of buildings on 4 new state farms to be established in the Project
area. Some 3,400 hectares on the Amibara area would be operated as two state
farms of 1,700 ha each. Also, 3,300 hectares in the Melka-Sadi area adjoining
the MAESCO farm would be developed as two 1,650 ha state farms. The State
Farms Development Authority would be responsible for staffing, equipping and
managing each of these 4 farms.
7.        As the State Farms Development Authority has a shortage of tech-
nically qualified staff in certain key areas, technical assistance would be
provided under the Project (see Annex 6) for the recruitment of specialized
staff to assist with the development of the state farms to be supported under
the Project, as well as with other state farms now being operated by the
Authority. These staff would include:
(a) a Farm Manager;
(b) an Agronomist/Entomologist; and
(c) an Agricultural Mechanical Supervisor.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
8.        The 3-4 year period required for construction of the weir and
the main canal for the Amibara section will provide time to prepare some of
the staff necessary for supervisory and technical positions at field opera-
tional levels. Thus present state farm supervisory staff will have an addi-
tional 3-4 years of management experience to apply to the new state farm
units. Also the State Farms Development Authority is preparing a training
plan for farm management staff whereby technically qualified agricultural
college graduates would be placed on operating farms working with experienced
management staff for on-the-job training.
Production
9.        Cotton would be the sole crop cultivated on all Project state farms.
Irrigated land would be phased into production over a four year period, be-
ginning in the fourth year of the Project as follows:
-----------------Project Year -------------------------
1      2      3       4       5       6       7       8

Cumulative Production       -       -      -    1,000   2,500  4,500   6,700   6,700
Yields of seed cotton are projected to reach 3.0 tons/ha in the fourth year of
production, increasing from 2.5 tons/ha in Year 1, to 2.6 tons in year 2, 2.8
tons in year 3, adn 3.0 tons in Year 4.
State Farm labor
10.       Labor tasks for field operations are spread over the full growing
season, a period of about 4-5 months. This work is paid on a daily basis
at Birr 2.00 per day and the work force is generally considered full-time.
The cotton picking operation is paid on piece work basis per kg of seed
cotton picked. Average costs for picking the full crop are approximately
Birr 230/ha. It is established that pickers on piece work average 20-25 kg
of seed cotton per day in high yield irrigated cotton. At this rate the 6,700
ha state farm crop yieling 3,000 kg/ha at full development should require
about 2,500 man-years of labor.

MAESCO and the Melka-Sadi Section
11.       The Melka-Sadi section of the Middle Awash lies upstream from
the Amibara section and is closest to the location of the proposed weir at the
head of the irrigation works. The Melka-Sadi Agricultural Estate Company
(MAESCO) was granted a lease for all 4,600 hectares in the Melka-Sadi sec-
tion along with the grants to other concessionaires in 1972. To date MAESCO
has not been nationalized, and it continues to operate the 1,300 hectares
of pump irrigated land it has already developed. It is expected, however,
that the existing 1,300 ha MAESCO farm will be taken over by Government and
run by them as a horticultural enterprise; the irrigation system on the farm
would be converted from pump to gravity irrigation under the Project. The
balance of the 3,300 ha originally leased to MAESCO will be developed as 2

1.        Under the first Amibara Irrigation Project credit, AVDA has
retained a consulting firm (Sir William Halcrow and Partners) to perform
the following duties:
(a) organize and execute all investigations and studies,
including employing specialized consultants whenever
necessary;
(b) prepare design drawings and contract documents for
all civil and on-farm works, including any addi-
tional studies or investigations not mentioned in
(a) above;
(c) prepare invitations to bid on all contracts, as well
as prequalify bidders if necessary; assist AVDA with
bid analysis; and make recommendations on award of
contracts;
(d) prepare specifications, bidding documents, and
contract forms including bid analysis for all
equipment and spare parts to be purchased under
the Project;
(e) supervise all construction and on-farm works and
recommend acceptance of completed works;
(f) establish and operate an operation and maintenance
organization for the Project and train counterpart
staff provided by AVDA; such responsibility would
include operation of earth moving equipment and
establishing a repair and maintenance workshop;
(g) assist AVDA in preparing reports and documents
related to the progress of construction and
financing of all works supervised by the con-
sultants, as required by IDA;
(h) certify all withdrawal applications from the

ANNEX 6
Page 2
(i) assist AVDA and the state farms in establishing
suitable agricultural, extension, and settlement
and training programs, and to this end should
employ agriculturalists, agronomists, extension
officers, training officers, settlement special-
ists and on-farm development specialists who
would work with and train Ethiopian counter-
parts (para 3);
(j) train all Ethiopian counterpart staff.
2.        The services described above would be completed by the consultants
in about 7 years (1976/77-1982/83). Investigations were completed in Spetember
1976. Final designs, design drawings and contract documents for the main
construction works were completed in December 1976, and construction of the
weir and the irrigation system is expected to be underway in September 1977.
The operation and maintenance organization would be established approximately
one year before the first delivery of water (mid-1979).
Personnel
3.        The consultants would provide (i) the Project Manager and all
necessary experts to staff the Project field office, and to carry out any
additional investigations and studies, (ii) staff for the key positions in the
operations and maintenance (O&M) organization until Ethiopian personal can
be trained, and (iii) an Agriculturalist, Agronomist, Extension and Train-
ing Officer, and On-Farm Development Specialist. Terms of reference for the
above staff are presented in Appendix 1. On arrival of each expert AVDA and
the State Farms Development Authority would appoint Ethiopian counterparts to
work with and be trained by the experts. The consultants' manpower require-
ments are estimated as follows:

Investigations and Studies
4.        During Project construction a study would be carried out by the
consultants, with assistance from AVDA, to determine the timing and specifi-
cations of a future tile drainage installation, including the installation
under the Project of observation wells and piezometers for monitoring the
groundwater levels. The terms of reference of the proposed study would be
agreed upon between IDA and the AVDA.

ETHIOPIA
REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
Water Supply
1.        The flow of the Awash River that would reach the diversion weir
would depend upon the discharges from the Koka Dam and power plants (con-
trolled by the Ethiopian Light and Power Authority, EELPA) and tributary
inflows as well as water diversions between the Koka Dam and the diversion
weir.
2.        Stream flow records from 1962 through 1974 were utilized to esti-
mate the Project water supply. Subsequent to the UNDP studies of 1962 and
the Italconsult Studies during 1966-69, additional and more detailed studies
of the water supply and demands in the Awash valley were made. In order
to assess the potentials of a dam in the lower Awash Valley at Tendaho,
Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners carried out a full Awash River basin study.
This work was further reviewed and the extended by Sir William Halcrow and
Partners in the feasibility report prepared in 1975 for the Angelele and
Bolhamo projects which are immediately downstream from Melka-Sadi - Amibara
Project. These studies take into consideration all developments in the val-
ley as well as estimated future developments, and analyze the tributory in-
flows below the Koka dam.
3.        With Sommissioning of Koka Dam in 1961 (having a reservoir capac-
ity of 1,680 mm ), the regime of the Awash River was changed by providing
increased dry season flow. The result was the immediate development of a
series of irrigation schemes in the valley. Such development continues to
expand. With constant rele ses of 30 m /sec, the estimated annual releases
from Koka reservoir (990 mm ) should be adequate to supply all present and
anticipated future needs until 1990. However, while the annual total re-
quirements could be met, tVe peak monthly irrigation requirements for May
and June would exceed 30 m /sec. It thus becomes essential to modify the
operating plan of releases from Koka dam if irrigation development is to
continue.
4.        Recognizing the need for modifications in the reservoir releases
from Koka Dam, AVDA and EELPA in 1972 established a Technical Committee to
discuss the manner in which this could be achieved. To date the meetings
have taken place only at infrequent and irregular intervals and little
progress has been made in reaching any conclusions. With the start of
construction on the Project the liaison between EELPA and AVDA on the Tech-
nical Committee for Investigation and Operation of Koka Dam would have to



ANNEX 9
Page 2
be improved. Further, to aid in correlating the irrigation needs and water
availability there should be: (a) a continuous survey of irrigated areas
throughout the Awash Valley to enable monthly crop-water requirements to
be assessed in advance; (b) an expansion of the hydrological measurement
activities of the Hydrology Section of AVDA; and (c) the establishment of
a monitoring system and, where practicable, the installation of additional
recording gages on all major river diversions to ensure efficient use of
the available flows. These activities could best be administered a within
AVDA which, in order to ensure an adequate water supply for the Project, would
enforce overall control of the flow of water in the Awash River on the basis
of quantified water rights for upstream users based on the forecasted level.
It would also maintain records of stream flow and diversions to predict when
low stream flow conditions would be likely to cause water shortages for the
Project. When such conditions are anticipated, AVDA would advise EELPA to
maintain adequate minimum daily releases from Koka Dam in accordance with
Project needs.
Water Demand
5.        The Penman method has been used to determine crop water require-
ments. In the Project area medium term meteorological data are available
from the Melka-Warer Research Station and Table 1 shows the calculation
of the monthly Penman estimates for this location. The crop factors used
for crop consumptive use calculations have been derived from a number of
lysimeter and other water balance studies in many parts of the world.
Ten stages in the crop growing season have been used and reflect the vary-
ing degree of cover attained by the crop, and also the variations in the
length of the crop growing season due to climatic or varietal differences.
All the crop factors start at a value of 0.4 which is the estimated coef-
ficient for a moist soil following a pre-planting irrigation. Crop con-
sumptive use factors are:
Growth Stage              Cotton              Maize           Sugar Cane

X                     .35                .38                 .50
For estimating the actual evapotranspiration the maximum degree of soil
moisture depletion was taken as 50%.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
6.        The values of effective rainfall are based on the procedure of
the USDA Soil Conservation Service as given in their technical bulletin
No. 21 which presents the average monthly effective rainfall in terms
of the mean monthly rainfall and the average monthly value of crop
consumptive value use. A field application of 70% and distribution ef-
ficiency of 70% were assumed making the overall efficiency 49%. On the
basis of these assumptions irrigation water requirements have been calcu-
lated on a monthly basis for two cropping patterns, single cotton and cot-
ton-maize-beans. Monthly data are presented in Table 2. The maximum water
requirements are established by single cotton cropping and the peak demand
is established in June when the maximum averagS temperature occurs. The
total annual diversson would be 92.7 million m for 10,300 ha of cotton
cropping or 9,000 m per cropped area. Subject to the provisions of reregu-
lation of Koka reservoir in future years as described above, the Project
water supplies are adequate.
Water Quality
7.        In early studies of the Project and the Awash basin it was assumed
that water diverted for the Melka-Sadi - Amibara Project would be similar to
that found in the river at Awash Station. This remains true if the water
is taken from the river above Melka-Sadi at the site now selected for the
diversion weir rather than below the confluence of the Kesam River which
discharges lower quality water into the Awash River. However, there is a
good probability that some loss of quality in water reaching the Project
diversion site has occurred since the earlier studies due to the increase
in irrigation between Koka Dam and Awash Station. For the present this
deterioration is probably small and would not seriously affect the Proj-
ect. The effect would be more pronounced during low flows in the river
when return flows from upstream irrigation projects and hot springs are a
substantial part of total flows. It would be prudent to establish a water
quality monitoring program as the Project goes into operation so that any
deterioration in water quality would be observed at an early date and cor-
rective measures instituted (such as providing additional releases from
Koka reservoir during critical periods of low-quality flows). Except for
these reservations, the quality of water is satisfactory for sustained irri-
gation under proper conditions of leaching and drainage.

Crop Production
1.        Cotton at present is the main crop in the Middle and Lower Awash
Valley. Ethiopia's total cotton crop in 1973-74 produced the equivalent of
30,000 tons of lint, and of this total 24,000 tons or 80% was produced in
the Awash Valley. Although concentration of production in a single crop
historically sensitive to world market condition can present definite risks,
careful evaluation of possible alternative high producing cash crops has re-
vealed no practical substitute for cotton in the Middle Awash. Experience
indicates that limited diversification can, however, be built around several
relatively low yielding food and oil crops, all agronomically well suited for
production in the valley. These crops are maize, haricot beans, sesame and
groundnuts. The present production patterns in the Valley along with the
results of extensive experimentation and trials at the Melka-Warer Research
Station have provided the major source of the information necessary to eval-
uate both the agronomic and economic feasibility of cotton mono-culture and
limited cereal and oil crop rotations. It should also be noted that live-
stock traditionally herded by the Afars could perhaps be a viable economic
addition to the settler's farm operation. If handled communally, fairly
large numbers of animal units could be accomodated by grazing in the higher
dry pastures adjoining the valley during the wet season, supported by sup-
plemental irrigated forage and fodder during the dry season.
Cotton
2.        Results of cotton trials at the Melka-Warer Station with varieties
now in general use in the valley have yielded as high as 60 quintals/ha with
minimal fertilization. Agronomists at the station insist that their experi-
ments with fertilizer have shown no appreciable yield increases over zero
applications on plots that have been producing cotton 5 and 6 consecutive
years. They agreed however that a minimal yearly application would contri-
bute to maintaining soil productivity. Project yields are projected to
reach a maximum of 30 quintal/ha on state farms and 25 quintal/ha on set-
tlements. The 60 quintals/ha achieved at the station indicate that there
is a good possibility of achieving 30 quintals in large mechanized opera-
tions under variable conditions. Evidence from ongoing operations also
shows that AVDA has recorded average yields as high as 35 quintals (1972/73)
on 800 hectares and concessionaire farms have equalled and exceeded this
yield in previous years.
3.        Results at the MAESCO farm where bananas and sweet (bell) pep-
pers are the major crops give further support to the conclusion that cotton



ANNEX 10
Page 2
is the crop most likely to produce best economic return. Bananas, despite
excellent experienced management skills at MAESCO, are producing well below
hoped for levels. These disappointing yields have been attributed to several
factors, the most serious of which is the 2-3 month (October, November and
December) period of relatively cool nights followed by strong sunlit days;
the rapid drying of the heavy night-time dew has caused serious cracking
and subsequent drying-out of the bananas leaves. Also, the constant strong
winds which sweep the valley at different periods of the year are another
serious natural constraint to full production.
4.        Pepper production at MAESCO is excellent, with yields up to 20
tons/ha. However, peppers require specialized production management skills,
a guaranteed high income market (MAESCO sells directly to northern European
countries) and a well organized rapid packing and shipping network to move
the peppers to market in perfect condition. Although the MAESCO organiza-
tion appears to be doing this despite many serious impediments, it would
be a mistake to attempt to replicate this operation on state farms and/or
settlements in view of the limited skills and experience of the persons who
will cultivate these areas.
Maize
5.        Results with maize at the research station have been disappoint-
ing. The staff believes that with varieties better suited to valley condi-
tions yields could reach 50-60 quintals/hectare. The variety now commonly
used, "white regular," was developed for highland rainfed areas and is pro-
ducing at about half the valley's potential. The station is conducting
trials with several imported hybrids developed in areas with similar irri-
gated lowland conditions, and is hoping to identify a high yield variety
which then can be used in an economically viable crop rotation with cotton.
Beans and Groundnuts
6.        Research station results with haricot bean trials have been ex-
cellent.  Mexican 142 and several other good canning varieties are yielding
up to 20 quintals/hectare. Groundnuts have also shown good results with
yields of as high as 40 quintals/hectare unshelled (obtained with no fer-
tilizer). There is a serious constraint to mechanized harvesting due to
the compaction of the valley soils, but this would not adversely affect the
labor intensive methods to be used by settlers in groundnut cropping.
Projected Crop Yields/State Farms and Settlement
7.        Yields for cotton and two food crops (maize and beans), will re-
quire 4 crop years to reach maximum average yields as shown in the table
below. Maximum state farm cotton yields are estimated at 30 quintal/ha
and yields on settlements at 25 quintal/ha. Compared to present Awash Val-
ley yields obtained under average field conditions, these are conservative



ANNEX 10
Page 3
levels and could easily be exceeded. Maize yields would reach 35 quintal/
ha, assuming use of seed varieties presently available. Introduction of
high yielding maize could raise this yield significantly.

Total Incremental Production
8.        Allowing for a gradual phase-in of the cultivated Project area,
the total incremental annual crop tonnage at full development (year 9) would
reach 20,000 metric tons per annum on state farms, and 1,600 metric tons per
annum in the settlements. Maize production in the settlements would reach
420 metric tons and beans 60 metric tons per annum.

Farm Budgets
1.        A budget for a state farm of around 1,700 ha is presented in Table
5; this budget is based on cultivation of cotton on the entire crop area.
The direct costs of production per hectare are presented in Table 1; in-
direct costs include interest on capital, fixed farm costs, building and
housing costs, maintenance of farm irrigation works, costs of farm manage-
ment and administration, and other charges such as the land/water charge,
land tax, and operations and maintenance charges (Table 5). At full devel-
opment (year 4), the net revenue per hectare would be Birr 218. Income tax
on state farms would be applied at a rate of 70% of net income.
2.        A typical farm budget for a smallholder 2.5 ha farm is shown in
Table 6. This budget is based on the assumption that the settler would cul-
tivate 80% cotton, 15% maize and 5% beans. The direct costs of production
are detailed in Tables 2, 3 and 4, and indirect costs (Table 6) include in-
terest on operating capital, fixed farm costs, operations and maintenance
charges, land/water charges, and land taxes. The budget shows that at full
development (year 4), the settler would have a net revenue of Birr 2,347 per
annum. From this it is expected that a recently announced income tax would
be deducted; this tax is applied at a rate of 10% on all incomes under
Birr 3,000, giving an estimated tax of Birr 235 in this instance. Income
net of taxes for the 2.5 ha settler farm would therefore be Birr 2,112
(Birr 845/ha).

REVISED AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        The Project would provide gravity irrigation at three locations
in the Amibara area.
(a) a 2,000 ha AVDA settlement scheme (of which 1,200 is already
developed and under pump irrigation) to be com-
pleted by the settlement of 320 Afar families on
the remaining 800 ha;
(b) the Melka-Warer Research Station (presently occu-
pying 300 ha);
(c) two new state farms of 1,700 ha each .
2.        The Project would also provide for gravity irrigation in the Melka-
Sadi area. It would provide for the gravity irrigation of a 3,300 ha area
adjoining the existing MAESCO farm; the area would be developed as two 1,650
ha state farms. The MAESCO farm itself would be converted from pump to
gravity irrigation.
3.        The Project would provide gravity irrigation for the total area of
10,300, of which 2,800 ha would be converted from pump to gravity irrigation.
For the purposes of this analysis only the benefits from the additional
undeveloped 7,500 ha area were taken into consideration. Savings resulting
from the conversion of 2,800 ha from pump irrigation to gravity irrigation
were added to the benefits.
4.        Cost of tile drainage was included after year 9 for 5,000 ha at
an average cost of Birr 1,075/ha (US$520/ha). The central ridge in the
Amibara area of about 2,500 ha consists mainly of lighter soil requiring
a minimal amount of deep drainage. The remaining 2,800 ha represents the
total area already developed for which no benefits were included in the
economic analysis.
5.        With the Project, flooding is expected to occur about once in
every ten years and to affect 1,500 ha in Amibara and 500 ha in Melka Sadi.
The effect would not normally be to destroy the whole year's crop as replant-
ing would be possible. Besides the agricultural losses, structural damage may
occur to dykes and canals. In the economic analysis losses from flooding
have been entered as an annual average cost applicable to the 7,500 ha of
new development as follows:



ANNEX 15

Replanting Cost                   Birr   840,000
Loss of Yield                            697,500
Structural Repairs                     1,610,000
Birr 3,147,000
or an average of Birr 315,000 p.a. over ten years.
6.        The main crop now grown in the area is cotton.  Under present and
expected price/yield conditions it is likely to remain the main crop in the
Project area. High value crops such as vegetables and bananas can be grown
in the area and are likely to be more profitable than cotton provided the
requisite marketing skills and outlets are available. For the purposes of
Project analysis, the conservative assumption has been made that only cotton
will be grown on 6,700 ha of state farms, and that the 800 ha in the settlement
area will be farmed by smallholders on 2.5 ha plots with a cropping pattern
of 80% cotton, 15% maize and 5% haricot beans. This analysis, therefore,
represents the minimum return possible from the Project.
7.         The price of cotton was taken at the projected price for 1980 in
1975 constant terms of US$0.58 per lb cif Liverpool, and adjusted by trans-
port and other costs to bring it down to a farmgate price. Farmgate prices
were used for the home consumed produce of maize and beans. A shadow rate
of exchange of Birr 2.70 = US$1.00 (as compared to the official rate of
Birr 2.07 = US$1.00) was used for all foreign exchange costs and benefits.
Unskilled farm labor was shadow priced at 50% of the standard wage rate.
8.        The economic rate of return based on the above analysis was esti-
mated at 13.0% over a fifty-year period. Project sensitivity to changes in
costs, yields and prices was tested as follows:
Change from basic
Rate of Return           Analysis

Yield/price down 20%             8.9%                 - 4.1%
Construction costs up 20%       11.1%                 - 1.9%
Benefits delayed one year       11.5%                 - 1.5%
