NIGERIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
MID-WESTERN STATE
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Federal Military Government (FMG) has requested Bank assistance
to finance an oil palm project in Mid-Western State. This report appraises a
nucleus estate/smallholder oil palm project for which a US$29.5 million loan
is proposed. Nigeria's agriculture is primarily domestic market oriented.
Output of staple foods, animal products, palm oil, cotton fibre and a subs-
tantial part of groundnut production - together accounting for about 90% of
agricultural production - is entirely consumed in the country. In 1973-74
agriculture contributed about 41% of value-added and provided employment for
around 70% of the labor force. However, agriculture is growing more slowly
than overall GDP, and its contribution to GDP is falling and is now 41%
compared with 65% in 1960.
ii.       The long-term strategy of FMG is to transform agriculture from its
present low technology semi-subsistence character to a modern, market oriented
sector with greater regional specialization. This will necessitate providing
incentives to encourage farmers to expand output and raise productivity and
ensuring that the necessary technology, inputs and infrastructure are avail-
able. The domestic market currently absorbs all of Nigeria's palm oil produc-
tion now estimated to be static at around 550,000 tons per annum. Demand
projections indicate that domestic consumption could reach 825,000 tons of
paim oil by 1985, and additional production of nearly 275,000 tons per annum
would be required by then if Nigeria is to avoid becoming a major importer.
About 125,000 ha of new plantings of high yielding oil palm would be needed
to meet the projected shortfall. The project described in this report aims
at contributing to the above objectives by (a) applying improved technology
through the use of high yielding material, husbandry practice and modern
processing facilities, (b) increasing rural employment and thus redistributing
income, and (c) expanding production to meet the increased demand for palm oil.
iii.      The project would be carried out over 9 years (1975-1983) and would
involve planting about 8,000 ha of nucleus estates and 8,000 ha of smallholdings
in the Sapele and Agbor area. The smallholder program would be implemented by
an oil palm division of the Tree Crop Unit (TCU), which was established under
the Second Cocoa Project (Loan 1045-UNI); grant/credit in cash and kind to meet
establishment and maintenance costs would be channelled to smallholders through
the TCU working in conjunction with the registered cooperatives; 299 km of
earth roads in the smallholder areas would be improved to all-weather truck-
able standards; Nigerian staff and the smallholders would receive technical
and management training at selected institutions. The existing Oil Palm
Company (OPC) would replant/new plant about 8,000 ha of nucleus estates, con-
struct two central mills, and establish a fruit collection system capable of
handling the total production from estates and smallholders.



- ii -
iv.       Under the Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA) which is a depart-
ment of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (FMANR),
a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (NEU) would be established, because of the
urgent need to strengthen the Ministry's capability of monitoring and evaluat-
ing the extensive agricultural development programs that are being planned.
The MEU would be primarily concerned with: (a) the financial and technical
monitoring of on-going projects; (b) evaluating their financial, economic,
and socioeconomic impact; and (c) providing assistance in the planning and
preparation of future development programs. The main tree crops involved
are cocoa, oil palm, and rubber and Benin in the Mid-Western State would be
a suitable base for staff concerned with monitoring these projects. FDA would
be the executing agency and within one year of the commencement of the projects
a team of specialists would be recruited to form the Tree Crop Section of the
YEU. As wild palm groves will continue to be a major source of Nigeria's
palm oil for many years, there is a need to examine ways of improving the
extraction of oil and kernels from this source and funds have been provided
for the field studies of small-scale processing systems by the Nigerian
Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR).
v.        Project costs over the nine-year development period (1975-1983)
are estimated at N 38.7 million (US$58.8 million). The Bank loan of US$29.5
million would finance 50% of total project costs; it would be equivalent to
all foreign exchange costs (US$21.7 million) and 21% (US$7.8 million) of
local costs. The remainder of the project costs would be financed by the
Federal Military Government (US$4.6 million or 8%), by the State Government
(US$15.9 million or 27%), by NAB (US$7.7 million or 13%), and by the small-
holders (US$1.1 million or 2%).
vi.       Vehicles, fertilizers, insecticides, polybags, tools, and wire
netting valued at about US$4.3 million would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines except for indi-
vidual contracts valued at under US$25,000. The oil mills--civil works and
equipment--valued at about US$8.4 million would be procured through a single
responsibility contract through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Contracts for buildings, office equipment, and some road improvements such
as bridges valued at about US$1.7 million are not suitable for international
competitive bidding because of their size and location. Contracts for
buildings and bridges would be procured through competitive bidding adver-
tised locally and in accordance with local procedures which are satisfactory
to the Bank. Contracts under US$25,000 and for office equipment would be
procured after inviting quotations from at least three suppliers. A major
part of project costs would be for smallholder labor, salaries, training and
the operating expenses of TCU, valued at about US$5.5 million, and for estate
labor, land acquisition, salaries and operating expenses of OPC's project
estates valued at about US$7.8 million, none of which would be suitable for
any form of competitive bidding. Road construction valued at US$0.2 million
would be done by force account. For the Tree Crop Section of MEU only con-
tracts for building and equipment valued at US$0.3 million are suitable for
competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures
which are acceptable to the Bank since the remaining costs valued at US$5.3
million are for salaries, operating expenses and consultancy services, none



- iii -
of which is suitable for competitive bidding. Similarly, equipment for the
small-scale processing trials is not suitable for competitive bidding since
different types of processing machinery must be tested and this equipment
valued at US$0.5 million and equipment for NIFOR's training center valued at
US$0.1 million would be procured through negotiated contracts. The services
of expatriate staff and consultants would be obtained on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a
15% preference or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower, when com-
paring bids with those of foreign manufacturers and a 7.5% preference for
domestic civil works contractors would apply.
vii.      At full maturity in 1990 the combined estate and smallholder
project would produce annually about 38,400 metric tons of palm oil for
domestic consumption and 8,700 metric tons of kernels for export. Valued at
the Bank's price forecast for palm oil in 1985 current terms (US$757 for palm
oil and US$504 for kernels), the annual net foreign exchange savings/earnings
are estimated at US$27 million.
viii.     Based on a fresh fruit bunch price of N 20 per ton, smallholder
net income from 2 ha of oil palm would start at N 70 (US$106) in the first
year of production, rising to N 298 (US$453) during the loan repayment period
and thereafter would average about N 370 (US$562) at maturity. The returns
per manday employed would rise rapidly from N 1.3 (US$2.0) in the first year
of production to an average of N 4.5 (US$6.8) during the years of loan repay-
ment and N 6.2 (US$9.4) thereafter. This compares favorably with a current
rural wage rate of N 0.7 per manday. In addition, smallholders income would
be augmented by bonuses from mill revenue surpluses.
ix.       During the establishment period the project would create 12,900
man-years of employment. At full maturity the estates would provide employ-
ment for about 900 workers. Based on an average farm size of 2 ha about
4,000 farmers would benefit. Thus with an average family size of 6-7
persons about 32,000 people would benefit.
x.        The estimated economic rate of return is 18.2% for the smallholder
component and 17.3% for the estate component.
xi.       On the basis of the assurances that were obtained during negotiations,
the project is suitable for a US$29.5 million Bank loan, for a period of 20
years including a five-year grace period on principal.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Federal Military Government of Nigeria (FMG) has requested a
Bank Loan to help finance the planting of high yielding oil palms in its
Mid-Western State. This report appraises a project that would establish 8,000
ha of nucleus estate and 8,000 ha of smallholder plantings as Phase 1 of a
program establishing 24,000 ha of high yielding palms.
1.02      The first Bank Group loan for agricultural development in Nigeria
was the Western State Cocoa Project (Loan 764-UNI) in 1971 which was followed
by a loan for the Second Cocoa Project (Loan 1045-UNI) in 1974. The Bank is
Executing Agency for the Nigerian Agricultural Bank Project financed by UNDP,
which became effective in March 1973. A rice project, three agricultural de-
velopment projects, and a livestock project have been approved by the Board
in December 1974, and an irrigation project and a rubber project have been
appraised and are being processed. The first cocoa project is proceeding
satisfactorily.
1.03      The project was identified in November 1972 and prepared by a Bank
mission in March 1973. This report is based on the findings of a Bank
appraisal mission, composed of Messrs. J. Bevan, M. Crowe, R. van der Lugt
(Bank), and A. Bergan, J. Bogaerts, Osman Farruk, C. Hartley and C. Redfern
(Consultants), which visited Nigeria in November/December 1973 to appraise
three palm oil projects in the Western, Mid-Western and East Central States.
Details of features common to all three projects are in a supplementary
report, entitled Supplementary Annexes to the Nigerian Oil Palm Projects
Appraisal Reports (474a-UNI).
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      General.  The 12-State Federal Republic of Nigeria covers about
930,000 kmZ and provisional results of a recent census indicate a population
of 80 million, growing at about 2.6% annually. About 41% of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), estimated at N 6.5 billion (US$9.9 billion) in 1973/74, is
generated in the agricultural sector which employs some 70% of the labor
force. In 1972, total domestic exports amounted to US$2.1 billion of which
petroleum represented about 82% (US$1.8 billion). The main agricultural
exports are cocoa and groundnut products. In 1972 all agricultural exports
were valued at US$290 million or 13% of all exports. Currently, the value of
food and beverage imports is estimated at the relatively low figure of about
US$2.6 per capita annually. Dairy products, wheat, and sugar are the principal
food imports.
2.02      Agricultural Sector.  Agriculture, including livestock, forestry
and fishing, is the most important sector in terms of output and employment;
provides all but a small proportion of the nation's supply of food; and is a
significant earner of foreign exchange. Nigeria's agriculture is primarily
domestic market oriented. Output of staple foods, animal products, palm oil,



cotton fiber, and a substantial part of groundnut production--together account-
ing for over 90% of agricultural production--is entirely consumed in the
country. However, agriculture is growing more slowly than overall GDP, and
its contribution to GDP is falling and now is 41% compared with about 46% in
1971 and about 65% in 1960. While agricultural production has been hampered
by short-term factors, such as drought in parts of the north in 1972/73 and
1973/74, the poor performance of the sector reflects agricultural and rural
development programs that generally are inadequate in terms of physical extent
and quality.
2.03      Because of Nigeria's wide range of ecological conditions agricul-
tural activity, while varied, is highly specialized by region and function.
Thus the rain forest zone, covering Western, Mid-Western, East Central, South
Eastern and River States, is characterized by relatively high rainfall and
cultivation of most of the tropical tree crops. Of the most important, cocoa
is dominant in Western State; oil palm, mostly wild, grows throughout but with
marked concentration in East Central and South Eastern States; and rubber is
most important in the Mid-Western State. Cassava, yams, and cocoyams are the
main food crops of the rain forest zone followed by maize and rice. The
middle belt of the country, which includes the Kwara and Benue Plateau States,
and the southern portions of the North Western, North Central, and North
Eastern States, constitutes an intermediate savannah zone (the Guinea Zone)
well-suited for arable agriculture. Sorghum and pulses are the principal
crops, but there are also sizeable acreages under root crops, groundnuts, and
cotton. The dry savannah zone (the Sudan Zone) of the far north, encompassing
Kano State and the northern parts of North Western, North Central and North
Eastern States, produces most of Nigeria's sorghum, millet, cowpeas, cotton,
and groundnuts. This northern area, unlike most of the rest of the country,
is tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis free and the main cattle raising area of
Nigeria.
2.04      The long-term strategy of FMG is to transform agriculture from its
present low technology semi-subsistence character to a modern, market oriented
sector with greater regional specialization. This will necessitate providing
incentives to encourage farmers to expand output and raise productivity and
ensuring that the necessary technology, inputs, and infrastructure are avail-
able to permit farmers to respond to such incentives. There are several
constraints to implementing this strategy and these include: transport and
distribution bottlenecks; inadequate machinery for planning, coordinating and
implementing a national policy for rural and agricultural development; insuf-
ficient experienced manpower particularly at senior management level; and
shortages of improved seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, credit and other farm
inputs. The project described in this report would remove these constraints
insofar as the oil palm subsector in the Mid-Western State is concerned.
2.05      Oil Palm Production.  Oil palm grows throughout Southern Nigeria
but the center of palm oil production is the three eastern States. Approxi-
mately 90% of production is from semi-wild oil palm groves operated by small-
holders. These groves cover about 2.5 million ha and produce around 2.5



- 3 -
tons of fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per ha which yield about 200 to 225 kg of
palm oil and around 135 kg of kernels. Total Nigerian production is estimated
at about 550,000 tons of oil and 300,000 tons of kernels. Exports of palm
oil, which were valued at N 22 million in 1966, are now being displaced by
domestic demand. Demand projections indicate that domestic consumption could
reach 825,000 tons by 1985 and thus require production of an additional 275,000
tons per annum by that time if Nigeria is to avoid importing palm oil. About
125,000 ha of new plantings of high yielding oil palms would be needed to meet
the projected shortfall. The three oil palm projects in Western, Mid-Western,
and East Central States that have been appraised by the Bank (see para. 1.03)
would produce about 100,000 tons of palm oil when at full maturity in 1990.
2.06      Institutions.  The main institutions involved in the project would
be the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR), the Oil Palm
Company (OPC), and the cooperatives (see Annex 1).
III. THE PROJECT AREAS
3.01      There are two project areas proposed (see map 10964 (R)):
(i) The Sapele area which consists of: (a) a nucleus estate of 2,800
ha at Mosogar bounded to the northwest by the Jamiesan River and
to the northeast by the Sapoba Forest Reserve; (b) a smallholders'
zone lying north of the Ethiope and Benin Rivers and bounded by
the Ologbo, Sapoba and Usonigbe Forest Reserves; and (c) an
existing estate, at Ajagbodudu, bounded to the north and west by
Ologbo Forest Reserve and to the south partly by the Benin River.
(ii)  The Agbor area which consists of:  (a) a nucleus estate of 2,800
ha northwest of Nsukwa; and (b) a smallholders' zone lying west
and southwest of the nucleus estate and reaching as far as the
Usonigbe Forest Reserve.
3.02      Climate.  Mean annual rainfall at Sapele is 2,397 mm (94.1 in).
There is a marked dry season from mid-November to early March and mean annual
water deficits are estimated between 280 and 300 mm. Rainfall at Nsukwa is
estimated at 2,000 mm (80 in) the water deficit at 350 mm. In the Agbor area
water deficits are estimated between 290 and 350 mm. Annual sunshine in both
areas is estimated at 1,800 hours, and mean annual temperature lies between
26° and 27°C.
3.03      Vegetation.  Both project areas have considerably varied vegetation.
The Mosogar estate consists predominantly of old untapped rubber and bush
fallows at various stages of regrowth with scattered cultivation, and some
high secondary forest. The adjoining smallholder areas have the same type
of vegetation but in addition also appreciable areas of palm groves. The
Nsukwa estate contains some old rubber but is largely old fallows with some



-4-
scattered food crop cultivation. The adjoining smallholder areas contain a
considerable amount of old rubber and lie in a zone well known for its food
crop production. Eupatorium odoratum 1/ is present everywhere.
3.04      Topography.  The Sapele area is largely flat with occasional swamps
but most of it is not subject to flooding. The Agbor area is also largely
flat or gently undulating and drained by tributaries of the Ethiope River.
3.05      Soils.  Typically soils are of great depth free draining with clay
content increasing with profile depth. They are classed into soil series
according to their clay content and the best series for oil palm cultivation
are well represented in both areas. Furthermore there are some excessively
sandy soils and through the selection process (see para 6.04) these areas
would be excluded.
3.06      Population.  The project areas are located in the most densely
populated regions of the State and would contain populations of approximately
160,000 (Sapele area) and 260,000 (Agbor area) respectively. 2/  The average
family size is between 6 to 7, and some 80% of households are engaged in
agriculture. 3/ There is considerable employment on existing estates, in
towns, and in factories processing timber and rubber, but labor availability
in these densely populated rural areas is no serious problem.
3.07      Land Tenure.  Generally land is vested in the various communities
with any transactions being under the direct control of the head of the
community in consultation with the chiefs and elders. Land may be given
(though unrecorded) by the community to an individual as his personal and
disposable property. Alternatively, land may be given by the community to
a family, 4/ under the provision that the head of the family may transfer
it outside the family only with the consent and sanction of the community
elders. Although title to land is generally unrecorded, family and individual
rights are usually well known and accepted within the community. In general
the traditional system provides adequate security of tenure for the planting
of permanent crops by natives of a community, though not necessarily for
outsiders. There is increasing tendency towards individual ownership in some
1/   A noxious weed of comparatively recent introduction to Nigeria which
adversely affects oil palm establishment.
2/   The Sapele area is about 800 km2 with a density of ibout 200/km2 (Urhobo
West Division) and the Agbor area is about 1,050 km with an even higher
density (250/km2 in Ika division).

areas and in these tenancy of land belonging to absentees is common. Under
the project, however, the aim would be, through the selection process (para
6.04), to restrict participation to smallholders who are directly engaged
in farming, and assurances to this effect were obtained.
3.08      The Public Lands Requisition law provides for the acquisition by
Government of any land for public use. Such acquisition may be by voluntary
transfer or by compulsory acquisition with payment of reasonable compensation.
In general compulsory acquisition takes place through gazetting and requires
little time. The State usually gives land to other government entities under
lease agreements. It would be a condition of effectiveness that the Oil Palm
Company (OPC) had taken possession under a 99-year lease of all lands acquired
by the State for conveyance to OPC to enable it to develop the project estates.
Smallholders would plant their oil palms on land now owned by them or for
which they have rights of usufruct.
3.09      Farming Systems in the Project Area.  The size of smallholder farms
in the area varies considerably, but according to a recent Government survey
the average area cultivated per farming household is between 3 and 4 ha. Most
families plant about 1 ha of food crops, mainly maize, yam and cassava. The
remainder consists largely of rubber, much of which, however, is no longer
productive. Arable farming is based on bush-fallow rotation of typically 6 to
8 years, including a fallow period of 4 years. Oil palm has been planted by a
number of farmers in the Sapele area, and some have quite substantial acreages,
the fruit from which is processed by the Ajagbodudu Estate mill. In the Agbor
area there is more emphasis on food crop production with an active trade to
the urban markets of Agbor and Warri.
3.10      Communications.  A good network of hard-top and earth roads serves
the project areas, although most roads need upgrading (para 4.07 and Annex 4).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project area is well suited to oil palm, labor is not a constraint
and an oil palm project comprising nucleus estates and smallholder outgrowers
is feasible. Linking a nucleus estate with smallholder development offers
advantages in the spheres of employment, extension, and processing. The employ-
ment opportunities on the nucleus estates would provide a regular source of
income for members of the surrounding smallholder community. The technical
experience gained by members of the smallholder community working in the
estates--under well supervised conditions--should, through the process of
diffusion, serve as a valuable extension factor in the smallholder planting
sector of the project. To attain the high level of efficiency possible in
a large central mill, a continuous and adequate supply of ffb is needed.



- 6 -
With regular supplies from a nucleus estate, the risk of large variations in
mill throughput due to fluctuations in output from smallholdings is consider-
ably reduced.
4.02      The project, involving planting some 16,000 ha of oil palm, would
be carried out over nine years (1975 through 1983) and be Phase I of a program
scheduled to plant about 24,000 ha of oil palm during the period 1975 through
1986.
4.03      The project would comprise:
Smallholders:
(a) creating an oil palm division and two regional units within
the Tree Crop Unit (TCU) established under the Second Cocoa
Project;
(b) planting about 8,000 ha of oil palm on smallholdings;
(c) improving about 299 km of earth roads to facilitate all-
weather collection of ffb from smallholders;
(d) operating a grant/credit scheme for smallholders;
(e) training staff and smallholders at selected institutions
and through in-service courses;
Estates:
(f) new planting/replanting about 8,000 ha of nucleus estates
to be operated by the Oil Palm Company (OPC);
(g) the construction and operation of two palm oil mills by
OPC to process estate and smallholder production;
(h) establishing a fruit collection system to be operated by
OPC for estate and smallholder production;
Evaluation and Research
(i) establishing under the Federal Department of Agriculture
a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) with a Tree
Crop Section at Benin; and
(j) initiating field studies of small-scale processing for
wild palm grove production.



B. Detailed Features
4.04      Details of the phasing of the project planting program are at
Annex 2.
Smallholders
4.05      Tree Crop Unit (TCU).  TCU is being headquartered in Benin under
the Second Cocoa Project. 1/ Details of TCU's structure are given in paras
6.02-6.06 and in Annex 3. Under the project an Oil Palm Division would be
established under TCU, which would have regional units at Sapele and Agbor
and which would be responsible for appraising smallholder applications for
credits and grants and for supervising technical and financial services
involved in the field establishment and post maturity stages.
4.06      Smallholder Planting.  Some 4,000 ha would be planted in the Sapele
area, and 4,000 ha would be planted in the Agbor area. Smallholdings would
be within about a 25 km range of the central mills. To facilitate ffb collec-
tion, plantings would be restricted to areas within 600 meters of a road usable
by 7-ton trucks all year round. Details of planting and maintenance procedures
are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 1).
4.07      Road Improvement.  No major realignment of roads is anticipated
but paved and earth roads need upgrading. The fruit collection road network
(shown on map 10964 R) is 451 km (106 km paved roads and 345 km earth roads). 2/
The 76 km of paved roads would be upgraded (filling potholes, clearing ditches,
reshaping shoulders, and some resurfacing) by the Ministry of Works and Trans-
port (MWT). This work is estimated to cost N 114,000 (US$175,000); this
amount is not included in the project costs, as it would form part of MWT's
routine expenditure in 1976, 1977 and 1978. The cost of improving 299 km
of earthroads is included under the project and would be carried out by a
road unit within TCU. MWT would become responsible for the maintenance of
all fruit collection roads once they have been upgraded. Annual maintenance
costs are estimated at N 100,000 (US$152,000). Details are in Annex 4.
Assurances were obtained that in the project area MWT would improve the paved
roads, and would take over and properly maintain all fruit collection roads
once they have been upgraded.
4.08      Grant and Credit Scheme.  Producer prices for palm oil destined
for the export market have been maintained well below world prices since the
Second World War, and Marketing Board surpluses generated in this way have
been used in other sectors of the economy (para 7.04). Consequently, until
the very recent disappearance of palm oil surplus to domestic needs there has
been very little incentive for farmers to plant even high yielding improved
1/   Loan 1045-UNI.
2/   30 km paved roads and 46 km earth roads need no improvement.



oil palms, and the industry has stagnated. In the early 1960s an oil palm
rehabilitation scheme was introduced in the Eastern Region (now East-Central,
Rivers, and South-Eastern States) under which the problem of incentives was
overcome by providing smallholders with grants consisting of cash payments,
planting material and other farm inputs for new planting/replanting oil palm.
Under the project somewhat different arrangements would be used to reflect
currently much higher palm oil prices and grants in kind and credits in cash
would be provided to farmers. Combined with fair producer prices (see paras
4.16, 7.07 and 7.09) this should provide adequate incentives for farmers to
plant oil palms that take nearly four years to come into bearing and produce
revenue.
4.09      The project would provide grants and credits to smallholders planting,
or replanting, a minimum of 1 ha and a maximum of 10 ha. One hectare is the
smallest unit that is considered practical to administer under the project;
while at maturity more than 10 ha would require the average extended farm
family to hire labor for its oil palm and food crop cultivation. Partici-
pating smallholders would be required to be members of a registered coopera-
tive society. The FMG with the assistance of FAO is instituting a major
program for the development of farmers cooperatives. In view of this there
should be no problem in finding sufficient numbers of farmers who are members
of registered cooperatives. Project farmers would be required to sign agree-
ments with TCU and their cooperative relating to the amount and use of grant/
credit. Assurances were obtained that these arrangements would be employed
and that the terms of the agreements would be acceptable to the Bank.
4.10      The total costs of clearing, planting and maintaining oil palms
until they enter into production four years later are estimated in constant
1974 terms at about N 330/ha. TCU would distribute: (a) as a grant, and
in kind, palm seedlings, cover crop seed, wire netting, fertilizer and
chemicals to a value of about N 170/ha; and (b) as credit, in cash, N 100/ha
for payment of labor (see Supplementary Annexes, Supplement 10). The credit
would bear interest at 9.5% and have a term of 13 years from planting including
7 years grace during which interest would be capitalized. The smallholder
would contribute the balance of about N 60/ha in the form of labor and hand
tools. Monthly repayments would be calculated on a per-ha basis and deducted
from the proceeds of each smallholder's ffb sales. In constant 1974 terms
monthly repayments by the smallholder would amount to N 3.00 per ha (interest
at 9.5%) and the cooperative would repay to TCU N 2.50 monthly (interest at
7.5%). The loan agreement between TCU, the cooperative, and the smallholder
would include an undertaking by the smallholder to sell his ffb to the central
processing mill. See paras 4.17, 5.07 and 6.06.
4.11      Training.  Technical training would be provided for Senior Officers,
Nursery Staff, Field Staff and Smallholders. A training schedule and cost
estimates are given in Annex 5, Table 8. Where training facilities are not
available staff would be trained elsewhere in West Africa and for some more
senior officers possibly in the Far East. Funding for the latter possibility
is included in project costs.



- 9 -
4.12      Senior Officers (Agriculture Officer (AO) or above) would be given
6 months training in planting techniques and management on large-scale oil
palm development schemes or commercial estates using appropriate husbandry
standards. Agricultural Assistants (AA) designated to supervise nurseries
would receive special training for twelve months in nursery techniques so as
to cover a complete schedule of nursery operations from the germinated seed
stage to field planting. Field staff (AgriculturaLl Assistants) would be given
a 2-3 months intensive course in modern planting techniques at the Nigerian
Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) followed by 2-3 months practical
training in the supervision of field operations on existing estates. In addi-
tion, all field staff would be trained in smallholder appraisal and grant/
credit supervision procedures. Smallholder training would be developed on a
group activity basis and would include (a) outlining application/appraisal
procedures and conditions of loan agreements, (b) demonstration of specific
planting practices, and (c) short courses of 1 to 2 day duration.
Estates
4.13      The estates component of the project would be carried out by the
Oil Palm Company (OPC). The organization and management of OPC is described
briefly in paras 6.07 through 6.09 and in more detail in Annex 3.
4.14      Planting Program.  OPC would first establish two new estates of
2,800 ha each at Nsukwa and Mosogar and then replant 2,240 ha on Ajagbodudu
Estate (see map 10964R). Arrangements for the acquisition of land for the
estates are described in para 3.08. Details of the planting program are set
out in Annex 2. The project provides for infrastructure and housing needed
at the new estates. Labor is not a constraint and new land would be cleared
by hand, using chain saws. Eupatorium weed would be eradicated after clearing
and before establishing the cover cop. NIFOR would provide oil palm seeds
which would be of wilt-tolerant varieties, if required. O4C would establish
a nursery on each estate, and fertilizers would be applied at rates recom-
mended by NIFOR following foliar analysis. Details of planting and mainte-
nance procedures are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 1).
4.15      Palm Oil Processing Mills.  Until 1981, production from Ajagbodudu
estate and the project would be processed at the existing mill at Ajagbodudu.
Since the capacity of this mill cannot be expanded, and its life is limited,
two new mills would be constructed to process production from 1982 onwards.
At full maturity in 1990 smallholder and estate production is estimated at
115,000 tons of ffb a year in the Sapele area and 72,000 tons in the Agbor
area. The build-up in required mill capacity would be as follows:
1982     1983      1984     1985 onwards
…----    (tons of ffb per hour)--------
Sapele area                     10       20        20           30
Agbor area                      10       10        20            20



- 10 -
Although sites have not been finally selected, the mill in the Sapele area
would be constructed between Ajagbodudu and Mosogar estates, probably along
the Jamiesan river; in the Agbor area the mill would be near the Nsukwa estate,
probably along the river Omu. The costs of the two new mills are included
under the project except for the expansion of the mill in the Sapele Area to
30 tons/hour by 1985 which would be financed from retained earnings. OPC
would undertake to engage consultants acceptable to the State and the Bank
to prepare the design and tender specifications for the new palm oil mill.
Assurances to this effect were obtained. The undertaking would also be
incorporated in the subsidiary loan agreement between the State and OPC.
4.16      Confirmation by TCU and the Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit (see para 4.19) that OPC mill development proposals
were in line with the project's overall production program would be a condi-
tion of disbursement for investments in the mill and fruit collection systems
(para 4.18). In addition, assurances were obtained that OPC would adopt a
pricing formula for the purchase of ffb from smallholders determined, in
accordance with principles acceptable to the Bank, by a Price Policy Committee,
which would be established not later than 1980, and which would comprise
representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture, the Registrar
of cooperatives, OPC, TCU, Marketing Board, Farms Management Board, NPMC, and
the Smallholders. See Annex 3.
4.17      TCU would be responsible for ensuring that an acceptable percentage
(to be agreed with OPC) of the estimated production of smallholders' ffb would
be delivered to the mills. Any financial losses incurred by OPC mills as a
result of deliveries falling below this figure would be made good to OPC by
the State Government. Assurances to this effect were obtained.
4.18      Fruit Collection System.  At full maturity in 1990 annual small-
holders' production would be about 80,000 tons, half from the Agbor area and
half from the Sapele area. During the peak month about 400 tons of ffb would
have to be collected each day. In both areas the participating smallholders
would be within about 25 km of the central mills. The maximum distance that
smallholders would have to carry bunches to a roadside pick-up point would
be about 600 meters. The bunches would be heaped in nets on the road side
to await collection, and the smallholders would be informed well in advance
of the timetable for the delivery of nets and the subsequent fruit collection.
The bunches would be loaded on to trucks by rear mounted cranes fitted with
scales that would register the weight of the smallholder's fruit at the
pick-up point. The smallholder would be given a receipt showing the weight
of the bunches collected, the grade and the price. At full maturity about
107,000 metric tons of ffb would be produced at the project nucleus estates.
During the peak month about 535 tons would have to be collected each day from
these estates. The fruit collection system on the estates would essentially
be the same as that used for smallholders, using nets and cranes with built-
in scales to weigh the fruit bunches of individual harvesting teams. For
details see Annex 4.



- 1 1 -
Evaluation and Research
4.19      Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA) - Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit. In view of the extensive federally financed agricultural develop-
ment programs there is an urgent need to strengthen the Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (FMANR) capability for monitoring and
evaluating such programs. A Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) would be
established in FDA, which is a department of FMANR. The Tree Crop Section,
which would deal mainly with cocoa, oil palm and rubber, would be located in
Benin and its establishment forms part of this project (see paras 6.10-6.17).
4.20      Field Studies of Small-Scale Processing in Wild Palm Groves.  As
wild palm groves will continue to be a major source of Nigeria's palm oil for
many years, there is an urgent need to examine ways of improving the extraction
of oil and kernels from this source. Field studies of small-scale processing
systems geared to meet the requirements of wild grove production would be
initiated. These studies would be implemented by the existing NIFOR/UNDP
team. Some equipment would also be provided to NIFOR under the project to
enable it to perform its training duties under the project (see Annex 5,
Table 18 and Supplementary Annexes, Supplement 6).

5.02      The estimates are based on prices ruling at January 1, 1974.  They
include indirect taxes and duties amounting to about N600,000 (US$910,000).
Physical contingencies comprise 12% of the cost of civil works for the oil
mills and 5% of other costs. Price contingencies calculated over base costs
and physical contingencies allow for: compounded increase in the costs of:
(a) civil works, buildings, and houses, of 18% in 1974, 15% in 1975, and 12%
annually thereafter; (b) vehicles, office and mill equipment, non-labor farm
inputs of 14% in 1974, 11% in 1975 and 7-1/2% annually thereafter; and (c)
labor, salaries, operating cost and consultancy services and training, of 7%
annually.
Financing Arrangements
5.03      The financing plan has been discussed and agreed with the Federal
and State Governments and takes account of FMG's decision that each State
will be responsible for the balance of project costs. However, FMG will finance
the balance of the evaluation and research component since this is of national
interest. The financing plan (see also Annex 6) is summarized in the follow-
ing table.

5.04      After appraisal by the Bank of the proposed project, OPC made an appli-
cation to NAB for a loan to help develop the nucleus estate component of the pro-
ject.  In March 1974 NAB's board approved a N 5.34 million loan to OPC which to-



- 14 -
gether with an equal amount from the Mid-Western State Government would allow
OPC to develop its estate component. The significant differences between the
purpose of the NAB loan and the Bank's appraisal are: (a) smallholder com-
ponent was not taken into account; (b) mill investment and fruit collection
based on estate requirements only; (c) Ajagbodudu Estate replanting not in-
cluded; and (d) different contingency calculations. NAB does not wish to
finance 50% of OPC project costs, although it is willing to consider financing
of the replanting of Ajagbodudu at a later stage. Consequently, NAB's pre-
sent loan agreement with OPC has been taken into account for N 5.06 million
US$7.7 million) 1/ (see para 5.06 and Annex 6), the remaining OPC requirements
being provided by the Bank and the Mid-Western State Governments.
5.05      The Bank loan of US$29.5 million would finance 50% of total project
costs; it would be equivalent to all foreign exchange costs (US$21.7 million)
and 21% (US$7.8 million) of local costs. The loan would be for a period of
20 years, including a five-year grace period on repayment of principal. From
the Bank loan, US$24.9 million would be onlent to the State Government on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, and the balance (US$4.6 million)
would be used by FMG to fund the Tree Crop Section of MEU, the field studies,
and NIFOR equipment. The remaining project costs would be financed by FMG
(US$4.6 million), NAB (US$7.7 million), the State Government (US$15.9 million),
and smallholders (US$1.1 million).
5.06      The NAB loan of US$7.7 million to OPC is at 5%.  The State Government
would onlend part of the Bank loan (US$18.5 million) and its own contribution 2/
(US$11.0 million) to OPC at a rate not less than the Bank's lending rate 3/ for
a period of 20 years including nine-year grace for payment of principal. The
State Government would use the remainder of the Bank loan (US$6.4 million) and
its own contribution (US$4.9 million) to finance TCU (US$5.9 million) and grants
(US$3.4 million) and credits (US$2.0 million).   Credits made to smallholders
would be channeled through the cooperatives which in consideration for their
guaranteeing smallholders' loans would receive a 2% interest spread (see para
4.10).
5.07      Assurances were obtained that the terms and conditions of the sub-
sidiary loan agreement between FMG and the State Government would be accept-
able to the Bank; and also that the terms and conditions of the loan agreement
between the State Government and OPC would be acceptable to the Bank. Sign-
ing of these subsidiary loan agreements would be a condition of effectiveness.
Assurances were also obtained that the terms and conditions of the loan agree-
ment between TCU, the cooperatives, and smallholders would be acceptable to
the Bank. It was agreed that from the date of the ending of loan negotiations
retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 would be made mainly for employment
of key personnel and for nurseries.
1/   NAB's loan includes N 285,000 for maintenance of plantings after maturity
which are not included in project costs.
2/   N 5.06 million (US$7.7 million) already committed by the State in
conjunction with NAB's loan to OPC.
3/   For calculating purposes an onlending rate to OPC of 9% was assumed.

Procurement
5.08      Vehicles, fertilizers, insecticides, polybags, tools, and wire net-
ting valued at about US$4.3 million would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines except for indi-
vidual contracts valued at under US$25,000. The oil mills-civil works and
equipment--valued at about US$8.4 million would be procured through a single
responsibility contract through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Con-
tracts for buildings, office equipment, and some road improvements such as
bridges valued at about US$1.7 million are not suitable for international
competitive bidding because of their size and location. Contracts for build-
ings and bridges would be procured through competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with local procedures which are satisfactory to the
Bank. Contracts under US$25,000 and for office equipment would be procured
after inviting quotations from at least three suppliers. A major part of
project costs would be for smallholder labor, salaries, training and the
operating expenses of TCU, valued at about US$5.5 million, and for estate
labor, land acquisition, salaries and operating expenses of OPC's project
estates valued at about US$7.8 million, none of which would be suitable for
any form of competitive bidding. Road construction valued at US$0.2 million
would be done by force account. For the Tree Crop Section of MEU only contracts
for building and equipment valued at US$0.3 million are suitable for competitive
bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank since the remaining costs valued at US$5.3 million are
for salaries, operating expenses and consultancy services, none of which is
suitable for competitive bidding. Similarly, equipment for the small-scale
processing trials is not suitable for competitive bidding since different types
of processing machinery must be tested and this equipment valued at US$0.5
million and equipment for NIFOR's training center valued at US$0.1 million
would be procured through negotiated contracts. The services of expatriate
staff and consultants would be obtained on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference
or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower, when comparing bids with
those of foreign manufacturers and a 7.5% preference for domestic civil works
contractors would apply.
Disbursement
5.09      The Bank loan would be disbursed over nine years from 1975 through
1983 (see also Annex 6) to cover:
(i) 75% of grants and credits to smallholders, totalling
N 1.6 million (US$2.4 million);
(ii)  40% of TCU's costs, totalling N 1.0 million (US$1.6 million);
(iii) 50% of the costs OPC's estate development, totalling N 3.6
million (US$5.4 million);
(iv)  50% of OPC's investment in the palm oil mills and fruit
collection, totalling N 3.0 million (US$4.6 million);



- 16 -
(v) 50% of the cost of the Tree Crop Section of MEU, totalling
N 1.8 million (US$2.8 million); and
(vi) 50% of the costs of the field studies for small-scale
processing, and equipment needed at NIFOR training center,
totalling N 0.2 million (US$0.3 million).
An unallocated amount of N 8.2 million (US$12.4 million) would cover contin-
gencies on the above items. Any surplus loan funds after completion of the
project would be cancelled.
5.10      Disbursements of the Bank loan would be against import documentation,
contracts, and certified records of expenditure. For disbursements made against
certified records of expenditure, documentation would not be submitted for
review but would be retained by TCU, OPC and the Tree Crop Section of NEU
for scrutiny by Bank supervision missions.
5.11      In order to achieve a prompt and efficient flow of funds the follow-
ing procedures would be used: TCU would prepare reimbursement claims under
the signature of its General Manager and Controller of Finance. These docu-
ments would be countersigned by the State Ministry of Finance who would submit
them to the Federal Ministry of Finance for onward transhission to the Bank.
OPC would prepare reimbursement claims under the signatures of its manager
and chief accountant. An addendum would be added to the application for
reimbursement specifically stating how much NAB had disbursed to OPC.
Accounts and Audits
5.12      TCU would prepare annual budgets using cost estimates in this report
as a base, amended where necessary to reflect changes in costs and project
development policies. Such budgets would be submitted to the Steering Com-
mittee for approval. TCU would thereafter establish, on a monthly basis
cash flow statements indicating costs, revenues and additional capital
requirements. Such monthly statements would be submitted to the Steering
Committee for monitoring but project management would be authorized to operate
on such monthly budgets unless officially informed to the contrary by the
Chairman of the Steering Committee.
5.13      On the basis of the approved TCU budget, the State Government would
make annual budget allocations to cover its own contribution to project costs
as well as any additional funds required to bridge the gap between expenditure
and disbursement of the Bank loan. Assurances were obtained from the State
Government that a project bank account would be opened with a bank of their
choice, and that TCU would have full access to funds within the limitations
of the approved annual budget. It would be a condition of loan effectiveness
that such account had been established and funded.
5.14      OPC, the Tree Crop Section of MEU, and TCU would:  (i) keep records
adequate to reflect, in accordance with consistently maintained sound account-
ing practices, their operations and financial position; (ii) have their accounts
audited by a firm of auditors acceptable to the Bank; (iii) submit copies of



- 17 -
their audited accounts and the auditors' reports thereon to the Bank within
four months of the end of each financial year; (iv) cause the reports of the
auditors to be of such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably have
requested; and (v) furnish such other information concerning their accounts
as the Bank may reasonably have required.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
6.01      Project implemerntation would directly involve three organizations:
(a) the Tree Crop Unit (TCU), (b) the Oil Palm Company Ltd. (OPC) and (c) the
proposed Federal Department of Agriculture's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
(MEU).
The Tree Crop Unit
6.02      General.  TCU would be responsible for the smallholder program.
The unit would have a high degree of financial and administrative autonomy
and would be a component of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
(MANR). A Steering Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MANR,
and comprised of representatives of relevant Government agencies would be
responsible for determining TCU policy and approving development/operational
programs and budgets. Details of the TCU's structure and operational proce-
dures are given in Annex 3. A consulting firm acceptable to Government and
the Bank would be engaged to set up a system of mechanized accounts that
would meet the needs of the smallholder project and assurances to this effect
were obtained.
6.03      Management Structure and Staffing.  The structure of TCU is outlined
in the Chart attached to Annex 3. For these projects TCU would have an oil
palm division headquartered in Benin, with two regional units in Sapele and
Agbor. TCU would be staffed primarily with personnel now employed by MANR
or recruited especially for the purpose in Nigeria. However, the technical
and financial complexity of the project will demand well qualified and experi-
enced staff (see Annex 3, para 7), and if suitably qualified Nigerians were
not available to fill the TCU senior management posts, staff for these posts
would be recruited internationally. Assurances were obtained that TCU and
its Steering Committee (established under the Second Cocoa Project) would be
maintained in a form satisfactory to the Bank; that TCU would be adequately
staffed at all times; and that TCU's senior management positions would be
filled by qualified persons acceptable to the Bank and upon terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank.
6.04      Operational Procedures.  Notices calling for applications from
smallholders and giving details of the scheme would be publicized through
such media as local newspapers, radio and public administration offices.
To facilitate the efficient employment of the field staff, particularly in
the year of planting when the heaviest intensity of farm visits is required,
a system of zonal development would be used. Thus in any given year appli-
cations for participation would be restricted to specific zones within the



- 18 -
project area. Any shortfall in applications from a primary zone could be
catered for by having an adjacent reserve zone from which applications could
be requested but only accepted in the event of there being a shortfall in
the primary zone. Applications would be called at the beginning of January
of the year preceding the year of planting and the closing date would be the
end of March in the same year. On receipt of the application, the smallhold-
ings would be inspected by TCU staff to obtain details of vegetation, topo-
graphy, soil type, size of holding, the composition of the family labor force
available, and, in consultation with the cooperatives, the credit status of
the farmer. Applications would be approved by a Planting Authorization
Committee (PAC) composed of the TCU General Manager as chairman, the Control-
ler of Field Operation, the Controller of Finance and a representative of the
cooperative societies.
6.05      TCU staff would provide technical supervision and advice and ensure
in particular that: (i) if Eupatorium infestation covered more than 30% of
the area, the weeds were cleared before an application was approved; (ii) all
old palm trees were felled before new planting/replanting; and (iii) in order
to prevent encroachment into the root systems area of the young palms, no
intercropping would be permitted in the new plantings/replantings of palms.
Assurances were obtained that maintenance of suitable husbandry standards
including those specified above would be a condition of smallholder partici-
pation in the project.
6.06      Purchase of Smallholder ffb.  Every two weeks the mill would provide
TCU with a schedule of ffb purchased, and amounts due to smallholders, and
credit the TCU account with the appropriate funds. TCU, after deducting loan
repayments due to the State Government, would pay the balance due to each
cooperative in respect of its members. The cooperatives after deducting the
interest spread would distribute the balance to its members (see para 4.10).
The cooperatives would guarantee the repayment of the loan by their members.
The Oil Palm Company (OPC)
6.07      General.  The Oil Palm Company Ltd. (OPC) is a private limited
liability company, formed under the Companies Decree 1968, and registered on
April 14, 1972. All its shares are owned by Government or Government nominees.
The organization and management of OPC is summarized below and set out in
further detail in Annex 3.
6.08      The OPC was formed to manage Ajagbodudu Estate, 1/ purchased from
PAMOL (Unilever) in November 1971, and the estates, formerly operated by the
Mid-West Development Corporation, which were taken over in April 1972. The
assets include a processing mill on Ajagbodudu Estate and two small mills
serving the other estates. The estates total some 5,360 ha. The head office
is on Ajagbodudu Estate. In addition, Ajagbodudu and the other estates have

their own offices which maintain accounting and statistical records. OPC has
a sound accounting and budgeting system. The accounts are audited by a Lagos
firm of chartered accountants. The Board of Directors consists of two re-
presentatives of the State Ministry of Agriculture (one of whom is chairman),
one representative from each of the Ministries of Planning, Finance, and
Forestry, and one representative from the Marketing Board.
6.09      Management and Staffing.  The senior management comprises:
(a) General Manager; (b) Estate Manager, who is also responsible for the
processing mill; (c) Chief Accountant; and (d) Company Secretary. The great
majority of OPC's management and staff were trained by PAMOL, whose operating
methods continue to be used. Although the present management structure and
staffing are basically sound, the expansion of activities under the project
would call for some strengthening and some changes. The proposed organization
is summarized in a Chart attached to Annex 3. The main changes would be:
(a) the appointment of two additional Estate Managers for the new estates;
(b) the appointment of two Oil Mill Engineers, who would manage the new mills
and the fruit collection system, and would be directly responsible to the
General Manager. The new positions would be filled by international recruit-
ment, if necessary. Assurances were obtained that OPC's Estate Managers and
Oil Mill Engineers would have qualifications and experience and be appointed
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, and that no change in appoint-
ment to the position of its General Manager and Chief Accountant would be
made without prior consultation with the Bank.
Federal Department of Agriculture's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
6.10      Under the Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA), which is a depart-
ment of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, a Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit (MEU) would be established. The MEU would be primarily
concerned with: (a) the financial and technical monitoring of ongoing projects;
(b) evaluating their financial, economic and socioeconomic impact; and (c)
providing assistance in the planning and preparation of future development
programs.
6.11      The main tree crop projects involve cocoa, oil palm, and rubber,
and Benin in the Mid-Western State would be a suitable base for staff concerned
with monitoring these projects. FDA would be the executing agency and assur-
ances were obtained that within one year of the date of effectiveness a team
of specialists would be recruited to form the Tree Crop Section of the Monitor-
ing and Evaluation Unit (MEU). 1/ Assurances were also obtained that the
senior specialist staff of the Tree Crop Section of MEU would have qualifi-
cations acceptable to FMG and the Bank and would be employed upon terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
6.12      The specialist staff of the Tree Crop Section of MEU would work in
close conjunction with the appropriate Federal research institutions and
1/   More details on MEU are in the supplementary Annexes (Supplement 4).



- 20 -
university faculties. Consultants acceptable to FMG and the Bank would
periodically be used to cover specific fields of activity such as research,
business management, processing engineering and project preparation and
assurances to this effect were obtained. The Tree Crop Section of MEU would
prepare progress reports for submission to Federal and State Governments, and,
where appropriate, external financing agencies.
6.13      The financial control system being used in projects would be examined
by the Tree Crop Section of MEU at least every six-months with particular
attention to the timing and procedures used in procurement; disbursement
control; grant/credit accounting; produce price formulation; and the control
of credit repayments. Technical evaluation would concentrate on assessing
the standards being attained in nurseries, field planting, maintenance,
harvesting/tapping, produce collection, and processing. To facilitate objec-
tive monitoring it will be necessary to establish an agreed system for quanti-
tative assessment of work done in relation to the main field practices.
Inspection and field supervisory staff must apply the same criteria if the
analysis of inspection data and the recommendations arising therefrom are to
serve as effective instruments of management.
6.14      Continuous evaluation of the economic and socioeconomic impact of
the projects would be carried out in conjunction with institutions such as
the Nigerian Institute for Social and Economic Research (NISER). In addition
to measuring the financial/economic benefits accruing to the participating
farmers and companies, assessments would be made of changes in employment
levels, business activity, consumption patterns, participation in education
and other economic and socio-economic indicators of community well being.
6.15      The Tree Crop Section of MEU would assist in the planning and prepa-
ration of future development programs by providing project management units
and oil palm companies with the basic support services required such as
(a) providing detailed guidelines for project preparation, (b) ensuring that
services required from other institutions are made available for project
preparation, and (c) attending Steering Committee and Board meetings.
6.16      The Nigerian specialist staff required to monitor the tree crop
projects would need to be given opportunities to receive advanced training
in selected fields of study. This would include their being attached to
specific institutions in neighboring West African countries and the Far East
for periods ranging from 3 to 4 months.
6.17      The costs of the Tree Crop Section of MEU (Annex 5, Table 17) are
estimated at N 5.5 million (US$8.4 million) over the nine-year development
period (1975-1983). Annual costs would amount to about N 0.61 million (US$0.93
million), but since the Tree Crop Section is responsible for all tree crops
(oil palm, cocoa, and rubber) it is estimated that only 50% of costs should
be charged to oil palm development. Taking this into account, and the fact
that at this juncture three oil palm projects have been appraised (para 1.03),
the average annual costs for each project would be about N 100,000 (US$152,000).
However, the main advantage of the Tree Crop Section of MEU would be its
institution building impact.

VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARMER BENEFITS,
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS TO GOVERNMENT
Yields and Production
7.01      Nucleus estate and smallholder oil palms would begin yielding in the
fourth year after planting. At full maturity the nucleus estates are expected
to yield 12.5 tons per ha except for Nsukwa estate which is estimated to yield
only 11.3 tons per ha. Smallholder yields are estimated lower at 10 tons per
ha reflecting anticipated lower field maintenance standards. Oil to ffb
extraction rates are assumed to rise from 16% in the first year of harvesting
reaching 22% at full maturity; the weight of kernels is estimated at 5% of
ffb. These yield estimates and extraction levels are generally in line with
those experienced with equivalent planting material under similar ecological
conditions in West Africa.
7.02      At full maturity in 1990 the project would produce annually about
38,400 tons of palm oil and 8,700 tons of palm kernels. The nucleus estates
would produce about 54% of total output and project smallholders the balance.
See Annex 7.
Markets and Prices
7.03      In 1970, production of palm oil in Nigeria was estimated to be
about 490,000 tons of which all but 9,000 tons was consumed in the domestic
market.  This is in marked contrast to earlier years when exports were consi-
derable; for example, in 1960 production was 545,000 tons and exports 189,000
tons. Based on an expected population growth rate sf almost 3% per annum,
a projected per capita income growth of 3% per annum and an income elasticity
coefficient for palm oil of 0.5. household consumption of raw oil should
increase at roughly 4.5% per annum until 1980, reaching a total of 690,000
tons in 1980, or about 8.8 kg per capita. During the early 1980s per capita
consumpticn can be expected to level off, and domestic consumption should
increase at about 3.25%0 per annum. This would result in a projected domestic
consumpticn about 810,000 tons by 1985. When the total estimated demand for
palm oil -rom socal processors, such as manufacturers of margarine and soap,
is added, the aggregate domestic demand in Nigeria is expected to be around
700,000 tons in 1980, and 825,000 tons in 1985. The projections indicate
that by 1985, and without a major oil palm development program, there will be
a shortfall of around 275,000 tons of palm oil that will have to be supplied
through imports.
7.04      The Mid-Western State Marketing Board (MWSMB) is authorized, under
current legislation, to purchase all palm oil and kernels offered for sale.
This is a legacy frcm times when Nigeria was a major exporter of palm oil
and of kernelsc Under the old arrangement MWSMB bought whatever oil was
surplus to domestic requirements and exported this through the Nigerian
Produce Marketing Company (NPMC). The amounts of oil available for export
in the Mid-Western State have d,eclined rapidly in recent years and are now
nonexistent.  As there is almrnst no domestic market for palm kernels or for



- 22 -
palm kernel products--palm kernel oil and cake--the great bulk of these con-
tinue to be exported through the medium of MWSMB and NPMC. As the Marketing
Board functioned in the past as much as a taxation mechanism as a price
stabilization agency, it has jealously guarded its rights to purchase palm
oil surplus to domestic needs. In particular it has tended to treat the
production from oil palm estates as being in the latter category. In recent
years, however, it has permitted estates to sell oil on the domestic market
although it would appear to retain the power to purchase their oil. Given
this situation assurances were obtained that OPC would be permitted to sell
its palm oil produced under the project freely on the domestic market. This
assurance is required to ensure that OPC and its associated smallholders would
receive full market value for their production.
7.05      Domestic prices of palm oil have risen considerably during the last
few vears. Thus the average wholesale price of special grade oil in Ibadan
rose from about N 160 per ton in 1971 to about N 200 per ton in 1972 and about
N 240 in 1973. Significant seasonal price variations result in average
December-January prices of palm oil being nearly 50% higher than the average
April-May prices. Because of the increase in prices for palm oil, smallholders
have also obtained higher prices for their ffb, although it should be remembered
that presently smallholdings have very low yields.
7.06      The Marketing Board purchases virtually all palm kernels offered
for sale and until recently farmers received about N 47 per ton; however,
FMG announced that the price for the 1974/75 period would be N 135/ton.
Kernels were normally exported unprocessed but in recent years investments
in kernel crushing operations in Nigeria have considerably increased. The
project would sell kernels ex-millgate either for export or for sale to local
crushers.
7.07      In calculating the project's benefits, a value for palm oil equiv-
alent to an import substitution price for oil has been used. This is based
on the Bank's projected world price of US$495 per metric ton cif Europe in
1980. Palm kernels have been valued at an export parity price of N 120 per
ton based on the Bank's world price forecast of US$330 per metric ton cif
Europe in 1980 (see Annex 8).
Farmer Benefits
7.08      It is expected that most farm families in the project area would
be able to plant and maintain 2 ha of oil palm without a significant reduction
in their current farming activities. On such a typical planting of 2 ha all
developed at one time, production would begin in the fourth year from planting
and full bearing would be reached in the eighth year. Over the four-year
establishment period the farmer would receive a gross return 1/ from the cash
element of the grant/credit equal to about N 0.60 per manday worked; the
current unofficial farm wage rate is about N 0.70. A farm budget is given
in Annex 9.
1/   Gross return is return to management, labor, land and capital.



- 23 -
7.09      Assuming a farmgate price of N 20.0 per ton of ffb, the gross
return (in constant 1974 terms) from 2 ha would start at N 70.0 in the first
year of production (Year 4), rising to N 298.0 during the farmer's loan
repayment period (Years 7-12) and thereafter would average about N 370,0 in
maturity. These returns compare favorably with those obtainable from alter-
native tree or food crops, even where improved management and planting mate-
rial are used. After establishment a 2-ha planting would require between
50 and 70 mandays a year for maintenance and harvesting, and gross returns
per manday would rise rapidly from N 1.3 in the year of first production
(Year 4) to an average of N 4.5 during Years 7-12 of loan repayment and
N 6.2 thereafter.
7.10      Official data on smallholder farm incomes is sketchy.  However,
gross returns on existing smallholdings are estimated to be in the region of
N 200 to N 300 per year including N 100 - N 200 value of foodcrops consumed
by the household. Thus, under the project a minimum planting of 1 ha of oil
palm capable of generating a gross margin of N 185 per year, when mature (see
Annex 9), would represent a very substantial increment to farm incomes in the
area.
7.11      Participating smallholders would receive a bonus when the mill's
receipts for palm products exceeded the full cost of fruit collection, pro-
cessing and financial charges for the smallholder component of mill through-
put. The bonus would be distributed half-yearly through the cooperative
societies according to smallholders' fruit sales to the mill over the period.
With the likely increase of palm oil prices in Nigeria over the project period
these smallholder bonuses are expected to be substantial.
Financial Returns to OPC
7.12      The projected OPC cash flow is at Annex 10, and is expressed in
constant (1974) terms. The effects of inflation on both inflow and outflow
have been calculated using the price contingencies described in para 5.02 for
project costs, a 7% compounded rate for other costs, and the Bank's interna-
tional inflation index for the value of benefits.
7.13      The annual cash balance during the project period 1975-1983 fluctuates
but averages about N 140,000 in constant terms and about N 360,000 in current
terms. Accordingly, no liquidity problems are expected and any deficits and
temporary seasonal shortfalls should be readily covered by normal overdraft
facilities or retained earnings. After 1984, when loan repayment begins,
there is a rapidly increasing positive net cash flow in each year. This
rises in constant terms from N 2.0 million in 1985 to N 5.0 million in 1990
and in current terms from N 5.8 million to N 17.6 million. These figures
take no account, however, of company tax, dividends or bonus payments to
smallholders, none of which can be meaningfully estimated at this range
because of difficulties in forecasting future levels of taxation, price
trends, and OPC policy with respect to new capital development projects. The
repayment period of the loan, however, makes allowance for these factors and
the cover for debt service is considered adequate in the early years of
amortization, and ample afterwards.



- 24 -
Financial Implications for the State Government
7.14      The State Government's involvement in the project is threefold (a)
it holds 100% equity in OPC which should be highly profitable (see para 7.13)
with a cumulative surplus in current terms of about N 150 million 1/ generated
by 1994 the final year of loan repayment, (b) it subsidizes the smallholder
scheme by providing grants during the oil palm establishment phase, ferti-
lizer subsidies, and the normal extension services that apply to small farmer
agricultural activities throughout Nigeria, and (c) it lends and onlends funds
to OPC, which should give it some interest income. Through this scheme (See
also Annex 11) it is estimated that during the development period, the State
Government would have to meet annual cash deficits in current terms ranging
from N 400,000 (US$600,000) to N 2.6 million (US$3.9 million). During the
repayment period the State Government would first have annual surpluses up to
N 100,000 (US$150,000), but later would have to meet annual cash deficits
increasing to N 500,000 (US$760,000). This is due to the fact that repayments
of the Bank loan and in current terms increasing overhead costs will outweight
the repayments of OPC overtime. By 1994 (last year of loan repayments) deficits
would have accumulated to N 11.9 million (US$18.1 million). The State would
receive no direct revenue contribution from smallholder oil palm production
as there would be no Marketing Board price differential or produce sales tax,
consequently the costs of this scheme would be defrayed against general State
revenues. Federal policy with respect to the distribution of mineral oil
revenues basically aims at meeting overall financial deficiencies in State
revenues that are considered justifiable and would include any incurred as a
;result of the smallholder oil palm project. On the other hand, the State
would be in receipt of substantial dividends from OPC (see para 7.13).
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The direct benefits from the project would be the increase generated
in palm oil and kernel production which is estimated at 38,400 tons of palm
oil and 8,700 tons of kernels annually at maturity in 1990 and thereafter.
The economic rate of return is estimated at 18.2% for the smallholder compo-
nent and 17.3% for the estate component of the project. Assumptions used in
computing the rate of return are given in Annex 12. Project life is taken
as 30 years. Costs are detailed in Annex 5, yields in Annex 7, and prices
in Annex 8. Labor costs are shadow priced at 65% to reflect its average
opportunity cost in the project area and foreign exchange is shadow priced
at N 1.00 = US$1.27 compared with the official exchange rate of N 1.00 =
US$1.52 (a premium of 20%). If labor and foreign exchange are now shadow
priced, the rate of return is estimated at 15.5% for the smallholder compo-
nent and 14.5% for the estate component.
8.02      As is usual when project benefits occur after a long development
period, the rate of return is relatively insensitive to changes in costs and
1/   Prior to allowance for depreciation and reserves, and payment of taxes,
dividends and bonuses to smallholders.



- 25 -
benefits (Annex 12, Table 3). A 10% increase in cost accompanied by a 10%
decrease in benefits gives rates of return of 15.3% and 14.4% for smallholders
and estates respectively. A 20% increase in costs and a simultaneous 20%
decrease in benefits reduces the rates to 12.5% and 11.5%.
8.03      Project palm oil production would substitute for imports that other-
wise would be required and kernels or kernel oil would be exported. Treating
palm oil production as foreign exchange savings and kernel production as
foreign exchange earnings, and using the Bank's price forecast in current
1985 terms (for palm oil US$757 per metric ton and for kernels US$504 per
metric ton) annual net foreign exchange earnings/savings at full maturity
(1990 onwards) would be about US$27 million.
8.04      The project would sustain and develop an industry that at full
maturity (1990 onwards) would generate annually incremental net economic
benefits of N 8.0 million (US$12.2 million) in constant 1974 prices. During
the establishment period the project would create 12,900 man-years of employ-
ment (6,200 man-years for smallholder field establishment and 6,700 man-years
for estate field establishment). At full maturity the estates would employ
about 900 laborers and about 4,000 smallholders would participate in the
project. Assuming average family size of 6-7, some 32,000 people in total
would benefit from the project.
8.05      The project has a number of largely unquantifiable benefits.  In
particular, it would demonstrate the feasibility of a well-supervised agri-
cultural scheme. It would form and strengthen an agricultural extension
service which would be able to handle further phases of the oil palm program
or use its experience for diversification into other crops. The cooperatives
would be strengthened through their participation in the project both organi-
zationally and financially. The institutional framework established under
the project should ultimately facilitate the provision of credit not only
for oil palm planting but also for other crops grown by the farmers. The
improvement of roads under the project would benefit not just project farmers
but the whole farm community of project areas through such effects as more
public transportation, easier access for farm products to markets, greater
availability of goods and services to project area and lower transport costs.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      Among the assurances obtained were the following principal points:
(a) the project would confine the grant/credit scheme to small-
holders planting, or replanting, a minimum of 1 ha and a
maximum of 10 ha; smallholders would also be required to be
members of a registered cooperative society (para 4.09);
(b) OPC would adopt a pricing formula for purchases of ffb from
smallholders determined, in accordance with principles
acceptable to the Bank, by the State Price Policy Committee,
which would be established not later than 1980 (para 4.16);



- 26 -
(c)  any financial losses incurred by the mills as a result of
smallholder failing to deliver their produce to any of the
palm oil mills under the project up to annual targets agreed
between TCU and OPC, would be made good to OPC by the State
Government (para 4.17);
(d)  smallholders would sign a loan agreement with TCU and their
cooperative, and the terms and conditions of this loan
agreement would be satisfactory to the Bank (paras 4.09,
4.10, and 5.07);
(e) the terms and conditions of the subsidiary loan agreement
between FMG and the State Government would be acceptable
to the Bank; and the terms and conditions of the subsidiary
loan agreement between the State Government and OPC would
also be acceptable to the Bank (para 5.07);
(f)  the State shall maintain TCU and its Steering Committee
in a form satisfactory to the Bank and shall keep TCU
adequately staffed at all times (para 6.03);
(g)  senior management positions of TCU would be filled by
qualified persons acceptable to the Government and the
Banxk and they would be employed upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para 6.03);
(h)  OPC's Estate Managers and Oil Mill Engineers would have
qualifications and experience and be appointed on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank; OPC shall not make
a change in appointment to the position of its General Manager
and Chief Accountant without prior consultation with the Bank
(para 6.09);
(i)  within one year of the date of effectiveness a team of
specialists would be recruited to form the Tree Crop Section
of the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) (para 6.11);
(j)  MEU's specialists and consultants should be acceptable to
the Bank and would be employed upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (paras 6.11 and 6.12); and
(k)  OPC would be permitted to sell its palm oil produced under
the project freely on the domestic market (para 7.04).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(a)  OPC had taken possession under a 99-year lease of all lands
acquired by the State for conveyance to OPC to enable it to
develop the project estates (para 3.08);



- 27 -
(b) subsidiary loan agreements acceptable to the Bank had been
signed between FMG and the State Government, and the State
Government and OPC (para 5.07); and
(c) the State Government had established and funded a project
account (para 5.13).
9.03      A condition of loan disbursement for investment in the mills and
fruit collection system would be that confirmation had been received from
TCU and the Tree Crop Section of MEU that OPC's mill development proposals
were in line with the project's overall production program (para 4.16).
9.04      It was agreed that from the date of ending of loan negotiations
retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 would be made mainly for employ-
ment of key personnel and for nurseries (para 5.07).

NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
MID-WESTERN STATE
State Institutions 1/
1.        Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).  The Ministry
is responsible for planning and executing agricultural programs within the
State. In the past, in the absence of effective planning and coordinating
at the Federal level, each State planned its own development, seldom looking
beyond its borders. Little or no consideration was then given to comparative
economic advantage as seen from a country-wide basis and hence no regional
specialization could develop. But ecological zones, water catchment areas,
drainage basins and natural forest stands were part of the natural environment
before state boundaries were formed. State plans therefore do not necessarily
reflect the best allocation of resources for the nation as a whole. There
was and still is unnecessary duplication of efforts and the effectiveness of
scarce resources (mainly trained manpower since at present funds from mineral
oil are available in ample surplus) is therefore reduced. However, FMG and
the States recognize this problem and are taking steps to improve machinery
for planning and coordinating agricultural development on a country-wide
basis. The proposed Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit (details are in the Supplementary Annexes - Supplement 4) is especially
designed to further-this as far as tree crops are concerned.
2.        There are adequate numbers of experienced staff in the Ministry
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, but as a whole the Ministry does not
appear very strong. Especially with a cocoa project (Loan 1045-UNI), this
project, and a rubber project appraised in September/October 1974, the Ministry
needs to look very carefully at its manpower and future manpower requirements
if it is not to promote development in a certain agricultural field at the
expense of development in other agricultural fields.
3.        The Cooperative Movement will play an important role in the project.
Only members of cooperatives would be allowed to participate in the project,
and credit facilities would be provided through TCU in conjunction with the
cooperatives. A loan agreement would be signed between the farmer, TCU and
the cooperative. Experience gained by the cooperatives in channeling credit
to the farmers for oil palm development would establish a sound basis for
providing seasonal credit to farmers both for oil palm and other crops.

Nigerian Oil Palm Projects Appraisal Reports (Supplement 3).

4.        The Mid-Western State Cooperative Movement was part of the Western
Region Cooperative Movement before the foundation of the Mid-Western State.
It suffered from the separation and especially from the civil disturbances.
However the cooperative movement is progressively recovering and, although
still rather young, appears to be capable of continuing its healthy growth.
5.        The cooperative movement consists of primary societies (more than
900 with around 35,000 members), secondary unions (more than 20) and two
apex organizations - the Mid-Western Nigeria Cooperative Federation Ltd.
(MWNCF) for marketing and the Mid-Western Nigeria Cooperative Central Finan-
cing Society Ltd. (CFS) for credit. The movement is regulated by the
Cooperative Societies Division of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
6.        The primary societies, functioning through Produce Marketing Unions,
act as agents of the Marketing Board. They are engaged in the marketing of
cocoa, palm kernels and cotton, and also rubber although rubber does not come
under the jurisdiction of the Marketing Board. There was no single multi-
purpose cooperative society until 1966 when the Cooperative Societies Division
launched a campaign to promote them, and at present there are 305 multipurpose
primary societies and nine unions with about 10,000 members. This type of
cooperative became very popular in rural areas and is best suited to further
the purposes of the project. The cooperative situation in Mid-Western State
is summarized below:

7.        The Mid-Western Nigeria Cooperative Central Financing Society Ltd.
(CFS), was established in 1966 with the aim to service the credit needs of
the cooperative movement. Subscribed capital stands at N 40,000 and annual
turnover at about N 100,000. Until recently arrears amounted to 30% of the



ANNEX 1
Page 3
loan portfolio, but this has now been reduced to 15%. 1/ Government wants
CFS to play a more important role, and a capital mobilization scheme has been
launched. The ultimate goal is to convert CFS into a Cooperative Bank of
M4id-Western Nigeria.
8.        Another apex organization of the cooperative movement is the Mid-
Western Nigeria Cooperative Federation Ltd. (IMWNCF), which was established
in 1964. It is engaged in the marketing, transporting and exporting of the
products of its members (primary societies, operating through their unions),
and in the buying in bulk of farm inputs and consumption goods, MWNCF can
guarantee loans advanced against expected production, but experience with this
form of credit has been unsatisfactory and very few guarantees are given.
9.        The Cooperative Societies Division of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry regulates the Cooperative Movement. It is headed by the Registrar
of Cooperatives and it has headquarters in Benin. There are four assistant
registrars who are in charge of: marketing, credit, training and development,
and planning. There are five circle offices, which provide services to and
control over the unions and societies. 2/
10.       Legal steps required to form a cooperative are minimal.  After an
application has been approved, the cooperative society becomes an unregistered
society; it can be fully registered after supervision proved that the society
is healthy. Of the 945 cooperatives (para 6), 608 are formally registered
and 337 are unregistered.
11.       Members in a primary society are at present required to pay an
entrance fee of N 6, but payment can be spread over three years.
12.       The cooperative movement is satisfactorily established in Mid-Western
State. With the aid of the TCU, cooperatives will be able to participate
in the chanelling of credit and the distribution of payments for fruit collec-
ted. The cooperatives would also guarantee the repayment of loans, and an
interest spread would be provided to cover the risk.
13.       State Marketing Board.  Details on the Marketing Boards and the
Mlid-Western State Marketing Board are given in the Supplementary Annexes
(Supplement 12).
14.       The State Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT), is responsible for
the building and maintenance of roads. Under the project, earth roads would
be built and upgraded by a road unit under TCU, but subsequent maintenance
would be the responsibility of MWT (for Road Program see Annex 4).

15.       The Oil Palm Company Ltd. (OPC) was established in 1971 and re-
gistered on April 14, 1972, when the State Government took over Cowan estate 1/
from PAMOL (Unilever). In April 1972, OPC also took over all oil palm planta-
tions formally operated by the Mid-Western Development Corporation. Under
the project, OPC would establish and manage the estates, the central palm oil
mills, and the fruit collection system. For more details see Annex 3.

has already established some nurseries and will replant a small area of its
estate, 162 ha in 1974 and 259 ha in 1975.
3.        The project is phase 1 of a program ultimately scheduled to plant
over 24,000 ha of oil palm. The project encompasses 15,840 ha and
Ajagbodudu's own replantings involve about 420 ha. In phase 2 of the program
another 8,000 ha of smallholder plantings will be established.

NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
MID-WESTERN STATE
Organization and Management
1.        Project implementation would directly involve three organizations,
namely:
The proposed Tree Crop Unit (TCU) - which would be responsible for
implementing the new planting/replanting program for smallholders;
The Oil Palm Company Ltd (OPC) - which would be responsible for
new planting/replanting the nucleus estates, constructing and
operating centrai processing mills, and establishing a smallholder
fruit collection system; and
The proposed Federal Department of Agriculture's - Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (MEU) 1/ - a section of which would be
responsible for monitoring and evaluating progress in tree crop
projects and assisting in planning future development programs
for the sector.
A. Tree Crop Unit (TCU)
General Objectives
2.        A Tree Crop Unit (TCU) established under the second Cocoa Project 2/
would be responsible for implementing programs involving the new planting/
replanting of cocoa, oil palm, and rubber. The TCU would have a high degree
of financial and administrative autonomy and would report to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR). A Steering Committee comprised of
representatives of relevant Government agencies would be responsible for
determining TCU policy and approving development/operations programs and
budgets. A consulting firm acceptable to Government and the Bank would be
engaged to set up a system of mechanized accounts that meets the needs of the
smallholder project. The same firm would be asked to advise on the type and
venues for training the staff required to operate the system.
1/   For details on MEU, see Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 4).
2/   Loan 1045-UNI, and appraisal report 282a-UNI.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
3.        TCU headquarters would be in Benin.  An oil palm division would be
established under TCU, which would have Regional Units at Sapele and Agbor.
TCU would be staffed primarily with personnel either seconded from MANR or
recruited elsewhere in Nigeria. It must, however, be emphasized that the
technical and financial direction of the tree crop projects will require well
qualified and experienced staff. TCU would be responsible for appraising
new planting/replanting applications and providing the technical and
financial services involved in the field establishment and post maturity
stages. The planting techniques and standards to be followed by TCU would
be those agreed with the proposed Tree Crop Section of the Federal Department
of Agriculture's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) and the relevant
Federal Research Institutions.
The Steering Committee - Its Composition and Functions
4.        The Steering Committee would be comprised of the following:
i) Chairman - Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources;
ii) Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance or his
representative;
iii)   A senior representative of the Cooperative Division or the
Cooperative Financing Society;
iv)   A senior representative of the Ministry of Economic Develop-
ment and Reconstruction;
v)   A senior representative of the Oil Palm Company Limited;
vi)   A representative of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture;
vii)   The General Manager of TCU;
viii)   The Controller of Agricultural Services;
ix)   The Head of TCU's Oil Palm Division - who would be secretary
for oil palm meetings.
The Chairman would be authorized to co-opt up to three additional nonvoting
members to the Committee and during the road improvement period, a repre-
sentative of the Ministry of Works and Transport would be so co-opted. A
quorum would require 6 voting members and in the event of a tie, the Chair-
man would have a casting vote.
5.        The Committee would meet quarterly, and its principal functions
would be to:



ANNEX 3
Page 3
i) determine policy;
ii)   appoint the General Manager, Controller of Field Operations and the
Controller of Finance, for which Bank agreement would be required;
iii)   review the organizational structure (see Charts attached to
this Annex) of the TCU, including terms of staff employment;
iv)   approve the annual development/operational programs and budgets;
v)   review quarterly progress reports and approve any program
amendments; and
vi)   approve the annual report and accounts.
Management Structure and Staffing
6.        Management Structure.  The basic management structure is outlined
in the Charts attached to this Annex, the main divisions of function being:
i)   headquarters staff directing and supervising the technical
and financial services being operated by the Regional Units;
liaising closely with the Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit of the Federal Department of Agriculture
in evaluating ongoing and planning future programs, establishing
training programs for staff and farmers;
ii)   financial control, including budget preparation, control of
smallholder grant/credit and fruit payment accounts, internal
audit and general administration;
iii)   the Regional Unit staff responsible for the distribution and
subsequent appraisal of applications, supervision of grant/
credit services, providing extension and other services to
the farmers.
When OPC's central processing m'll establishes a fruit collection system, the
Regional Unit staff will need to Liaise closely with the mill to ensure that
the smallholders both understand and utilize the system. Deductions for loan
repayments would be made from the value of fruit purchases. TCU's Controller
of Finance would be responsible for calculating: (a) the loan repayments due
to the State Government; (b) the balance to be passed on to the Cooperatives;
and (c) the part of that balance to be distributed to the individual producers
in payment for fruit sold to the central mill.
7.        Staffing.  The project's technical and financial direction would
require suitably qualified and experienced staff, recruited internationally
if necessary. Middle level technical and administrative positions would be
filled by professional or senior technical grade officers recruited from



ANNEX 3
Page 4
within the State or from other States in Nigeria. Lower level field and
administrative staff would be recruited from existing Government agencies or
the private sector. Details of the numbers and phasing of professional and
technical staff requirements are given in Annex 5, Tables 5 and 6.
8.        The General Manager - the chief executive of TCU would be delegated
full responsibility for implementing the new planting/replanting program.
He would be directly responsible through the Controller of Agricultural Services
to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture. The person appointed
should have a professional qualification in agriculture and at least 10 years
experience, 5 of which should have been in a senior administrative position.
9.        The Controller of Field Operations - would be responsible for organ-
izing and directing the technical aspects of the program, including nursery
work, appraisal of applications, supervision of planting and maintenance in
the immature and mature stages. He would also be responsible for organizing
in-service training for all levels of field staff. The person appointed
should have had at least 8 years experience of tree crop planting (oil palm,
cocoa or rubber), preferably at a senior management level with a commercial
organization.
10.       The Controller of Finance - would be responsible for the general
administration of the TCU and all project financial controls and procedures.
This man would need to be a well qualified accountant with at least 8 years
experience at senior management level preferably in agro-industry.
11.       Head of Oil Palm Division - would be responsible for implementing
the technical appraisal and supervision of all field operations. He would
need to be very experienced in modern oil palm planting techniques with at
least five years at a senior field management level.
12.       Regional Unit Managers of the Oil Palm Division - would be in
charge of the field operations at regional level and should be Senior
Agricultural Officers (SAO) with about 3 years experience at that level.
Preference would be given to SAO's who had experience of modern oil palm
planting techniques, but in any event, these officers would be given in-
service training courses at NIFOR. Other professional, technical and admin-
istrative staff of the Regional Units would mainly be recruited from Govern-
ment services or directly from tertiary/secondary level educational institu-
tions. In order to equip such staff with the specialized techniques required
for implementing this project, appropriate in-service training would be
given at selected institutions.
Operational Procedures
13.       Operational procedures are described in the Supplementary Annexes
(Supplement 9) and the grant/credit procedures are detailed in Supplement 10.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Training
14.       Technical training at all levels will comprise a very important
sector of project activity. To ensure an effective start-up in 1975, inten-
sive training in selected spheres such- as nursery and field planting tech-
niques will need to be started as soon as possible. The type of training
involved can be divided into four basic categories: Senior Officers, Nur-
sery Staff, Field Staff, and Farmer Training. A schedule and estimate of
the cost of training are given in Annex 5, Table 8. More details in the
Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 11).
B. The Oil Palm Company (OPC)
General
15.       The Oil Palm Company Ltd. (OPC) is a private limited liability
company, formed under the Companies Decree 1968, and registered on April 14,
1972. All its shares are owned by Government or Government nominees; its
designation as a private company means that transfers of shares are restricted
and that any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or deben-
tures of the company is prohibited. OPC's shares are presently held direct
by the State Government. It is proposed, however, to transfer them to the
Nigerian Economic Welfare Services Ltd. (NEWS), which was formed in 1971 to
act as a holding company for all Government-owned companies. Details of the
arrangements are still being worked out, but, as both companies are wholly
owned by Government, there are unlikely to be any policy changes of signifi-
cance for the proposed project.
16.       The OPC was formed to manage Cowan Estate, 1/ which was purchased
from PAMOL (Unilever) in November 1971, and the estates formerly operated
by the Mid-Western Development Corporation, which were taken over in April,
1972. The assets include a large processing mill on Ajagbodudu Estate and
two small mills serving the other estates. The total area under OPC management
is now as follows:
ha
Ajagbodudu Estate      2,660
Ewohimi Estate           790
Igueben Estate           820
Ubuluku Estate           690
Adwukwai Estate          400
Total             5,360
1/   Cowan Estate was subsequently referred to as Ajagbodudu Estate.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
17.       The condition of the estates varies.  Ajagbodudu Estate was planted
from 1936 to 1940 with old selected seedlings. Wilt disease reduced the plant-
ing density from 60 to 40 trees per acre, and the yield is now about 7.5 tons
of ffb per ha. Field maintenance and harvesting standards are satisfactory
and it is expected that production could be maintained at its present level
for a further six to eight years. The other estates were planted from 1953
to 1967 in the region east of Benin, where climatic conditions are marginal
for oil palm. Maintenance has been neglected for years, and severe damage
has been caused by rodents and disease. It is doubtful whether these estates
could be profitably rehabilitated; further expansion in these areas is not
recommended.
Management - Present Position
18.       The Board of Directors consists of two representatives of the State
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, one of whom is chairman, one
representative from each of the Ministries of Planning, Finance, and Forestry,
and one representative from the Marketing Board.
The senior management comprises:
(a) General Manager;
(b) Estate Manager, who is also responsible for the processing
mill;
(c)  Chief Accountant,; ar,d
(d) Company Secretary.
The head office is located on Ajagbodudu Estate. In addition, Ajagbodudu and
the other estates each have their own administrative office which maintains
accounting and statistical records.
19.       At Ajagbodudu Estate, the Estate Manager supervises field and oil
mill operations. He has under him: a Field Manager who is responsible for
harvesting, maintenance, and the preparation of new projects including nursery
supervision; a Processing Manager for the oil mill, who also organizes the
collection of fruit from the estate and surrounding smallholders; and an
Estate Engineer who is responsible for the maintenance of equipment in all
the mills and on all the estates. A contract with PAMOL provides for periodic
visits to the Ajagbodudu mill by experienced expatriate engineers and for
assistance in the procurement of spare parts. Ajagbodudu Estate has an
adequate workshop and carpentry shop. The two other groups of estates at
Igueben and Ubuluku are run by a Field Manager based at Igueben. The great
majority of OPC's management and staff were trained by PAMOL, whose operating
methods continue to be used.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
Management - Proposed Arrangements
20.       Although the present management structure and staffing are basically
sound, the expansion of activities under the project would call for some
strengthening and some changes. The proposed organization is summarized in
the Chart attached to this Annex.
The main changes would be;
(a) the appointment of two additional Estate Managers, for the new
estates at Nsukwa and Mosogar;
(b)  the appointment of w-w  O1l Mill Engineers, who would manage
the new mills and -he fruit collection system; they would
be responsible to the General Manager, not to the Estate
Managers.
The positions referred to above wou` bdc filled by international recruitment.
Whilst it is hoped that at least cr  of the Estate Managers could be recruited
from amongst present Nigerian management, provision has been made in the costs
for expatriate salaries for all the posts for up to five years to ensure that
adequate finance is available.
New Oil Mills and Fruit Collection System
21.       It is proposed that twc new oil mills would be established by 1982
to process production from estates and smallholdlirgs. The existing oil mill
at Ajagbodudu would be worn out at this time and would not be rebuilt. OPC
would engage consultants to prepare the design and tender specifications for
these central mills. The fruit collection scheme would be organized in close
coordination with TCU cn the lines. outlined in Annex 4.  2. Transport Manager,
under the Oil Mill Engineer, would be responsible for organizing fruit col-
lection and recording deliveries by individual smallholders as weighed and
graded at the farm gate. This information would be transmitted to TCU for
payment to farmers after deducting loan repayment. Ajagtodudu Estate already
collects fruit from surrounding smallholders but the system would need to
be improved considerably before incorporation into the project's collection
scheme.
22.       Under the subsidiary loan agreement with the Mid-Western State
Government OPC would undertake to construct and operate a central mill and
fruit collection system capable of handling the production of the areas re-
planted under the smallholder component of the proiect. Prior to any funds
being channelled to OPC for mill and fruit collection development, TCU and
the Tree Crop Section of MEU would confirm that OPC's proposals were in line
with the crop production schedules of TCU's planting program.
23.       When purchasing fruit from smallholders, the central mill would
adopt an agreed pricing formula as determined by the State Price Formulation
Committee (see below). OPC would also channel the cash due on fruit pur-



ANNEX 3
Page 8
chases to TCU where deductions for loan repayments would be made prior to
handing over the balance to the cooperatives for distribution to the farmers.
24.       On the other hand, TCU would be responsible for seeing that an
acceptable percentage (to be agreed) of the projected crop production levels
are attained and that the smallholders participating in the program sell their
fruits to the central mill. This latter factor should be covered by the loan
agreement between the smallholder and TCU. However, in the event of it
proving difficult for TCU to take over the management of defaulting smallholder
plantings, any financial losses by the central mill that could be clearly
demonstrated as having resulted from smallholder crop shortfalls would have
to be made good from State Government funds. It must, however, be emphasized
that the underwriting of such losses by Government would not be permitted to
be used as a means for OPC to cover up inefficiency on the part of its central
mill management.
Accounts and Audit
25.       OPC has a sound accounting system which is adequately maintained.
In addition, detailed budgets are prepared each year. The accounts are
audited by a Lagos firm of chartered accountants. A summary of the latest
available audited accounts is set out in Table 1.
C. Price Policy Committee and Fresh Fruit Price Calculation
Price Policy Committee
26.       A Price Policy Committee would be appointed and would comprise:
(a) Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Finance - Chairman;
(b) Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources;
(c) Registrar of the Cooperative Societies or his representative;
(d) General Manager of OPC or a senior representative;
(e) General Manager of TCU - Secretary;
(f) Representative of the Mid-Western State Marketing Board;
(g) Two representatives of smallholders;
(h) Representative of NPMC; and
(i) Representative of Mid-Western Farms Management Board.



ANNEX 3
Page 9
The Committee would determine a purchasing price formula which the OPC would
be obliged to apply in calculating the price it would pay for ffb. Using
this formula OPC from month to month, or other suitable time span, would
announce a price to be paid for ffb. Any departure from this formula would
be referred back to the Committee prior to implementation.
Price Calculation
27.       The price paid per ton of ffb would be determined from the revenue
received for the palm oil and kernels produced from a ton of ffb after allow-
ing for the costs of fruit collection and processing, including depreciation
taxes and financial charges. The financial charges would be adequate to
provide a reasonable return on the required capital investment, which return
would be sufficient to cover interest charges, and margins for building up
reserves and paying dividends to the OPC's shareholders. The return on
capital would be measured on the basis of a percentage of net revalued fixed
assets plus a reasonable allowance for working capital; this percentage would
be agreed by the price policy committee within a suggested 10% - 15% range.
Depreciation on fixed assets would be taken on a straight line basis for
shortlived assets, such as those used for fruit collection; for longer lived
assets, such as the mill, it is suggested that a more appropriate basis would
be an allocation over output processed compared to the estimated processing
capacity of the mills over their estimated remaining useful life. Having
deducted these costs, calculated on a cost/ton basis, from the revenue
received from the sale of one ton of produce, the price per ton of products
net of all costs is known. This would be the base price.
28.       Applying the appropriate extraction rate of products to bunches
to this base price, the price per ton of ffb can be calculated. Extraction
rates applied would be related to the mill's previous three months processing
results. Having determined an ffb purchase price discount rates would need
to be determined in order to take account of different grades of fruit.
Further details are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 12).
29.       Any profits in excess of the agreed return on capital would be
distributed to the smallholders in the form of a cash bonus at the end of,
say, each half-year. The amount paid to the individual smallholders being
proportional to the quantity of fruit sold to the company over the period
concerned.

NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
MID-WESTERN STATE
Establishing Processing Facilities, Fruit Collection System and a Road Network
A. Processing Facilities, Phasing and Costs
1.        At full maturity in 1990 project output is estimated at 103,000 tons
of ffb in the Sapele area and 71 ,640 tons of ffb in the Agbor area. However,
in the Sapele area OPC has already replanted a small part of its existing
Ajagbodudu Estate. Ajagbodudu Estate also collects fruit from existing small-
holders around its estate and it is assumed that this policy will continue.
At full maturity annual production of Ajagbodudu's own replantings will be
around 5,260 tons and output of existing smallholders around Ajagbodudu is
assumed to remain constant at 6,650 tons of ffb. Table 1 gives details of
production and also shows project production as a percentage of overall pro-
duction that will be processed in the mills.
2.        Total production of ffb is therefore estimated at 114,910 tons of
ffb in the Sapele area and 71,640 tons in the Agbor area. Maximum monthly
peak production is estimated at 12.5% of annual production. This is based
on a study of Ajagbodudu's production history (see Table 2). Peak production
at full development is therefore estimated at 14,370 tons of ffb in the Sapele
area and 8,995 tons in the Agbor area. Assuming 500 working hours in a month,
mill capacity required would be about 29.0 tons/hour in the Sapele area and
18.0 tons/hour in the Agbor area. An ultimate capacity of 30 tons/hour in
the Sapele area and 20 tons/hour in the Agbor area is proposed. The main
figures are summarized below:
Sapele Area    Agbor Area
Tons of ffb                                  114,910         71,640
Peak production (tons/month)                  14,370          8,955
Capacity required (tons/hour)                     29              18
Capacity proposed (tons/hour)                     30              20
Capacity utilization (percent)                    96             90
Since this project is the first phase of a larger program, it could be
necessary to increase the capacity of the mills in the next phase of the
program and therefore mills should be designed so as to allow for expansion.
3.        As the capacity of the existing mill at Ajagbodudu cannot be expanded
and the usefulness of this mill will be almost finished by the time the project



ANNEX 4
Page 2
plantings start to yield, two new mills would be constructed to process project
production from 1982 onwards. Phasing of mill capacity (details are in Table
3) is as follows:
1982     1983      1984      1985
-------(tons of ffb/hr)---------
Sapele area                    10       20        20        30
Agbor area                     10       10        20        20
4.        Until 1981 production from the Sapele area will be processed in
the existing mill at Ajagbodudu. This means that the rehabilitation program
for that mill will have to be continued (replacement of the sterilizers and
of the steam boilers). Furthermore, the replacement of two of the four hy-
draulic presses by a continuous screw press must be considered as well as the
installation of a new centrifugal sludge separator. It is assumed that project
production in the Agbor area in 1980 (2,520 ton) and 1981 (8,300 ton) will be
either processed in OPC's pioneer mills or sold to other local processors.
5.        No final sites for mills have been selected, but in the Sapele
area the new mill will be constructed between Ajagbodudu Estate and Mosogar
Estate, probably along the Jamieson river. In the Agbor area the mill will
be near the Nsukwa Estate, probably along the river Omu. When selecting
mill sites, it is essential to ensure a reliable and adequate supply of water
as well as a good access road for fruit- delivery and the evacuation of
products.
6.        Estimates of mill investment costs are given in Table 3 and are
based on an analysis of (a) the Okitipupa mill contract between Speichim and
the Western State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and (b) the
Iliinvi Oil Mill contract between Usine de Wecker and the Sonadar, in Dahomey.
These cost figures reflect investment costs in mills to be commissioned in
mid 1973. In order to reflect end 1973/beginning 1974 prices in project costs,
the cost of equipment has been increased by 10% and the cost of civil works
by 12% (Annex 5, Table 15). 1/ Estimates of the operating costs of the mills
are given in Tables 4 and 5.
7.        Project costs include all costs, civil works, equipment and housing,
for the oil mill in the Agbor area and costs, civil works, equipment and
housing, necessary for the processing of 20 tons/hour in the oil mill in the
Sapele area. Expansion of this mill to 30 tons per hour by 1985 would be
financed from OPC's own funds.
1/   Half of 1973 Inflation rates, which were estimated at 20% for equipment
and 24% for .,vil works.

B. Fruit Collection System
8.        General.  At full maturity in 1990 1/ there would be about 186,550
tons of fruit bunches to be delivered to the central mills for processing.
During the peak period, production from smallholders would be about 400
tons/day 2/ and from estates (including the existing smallholders around
Ajagbodudu Estate) about 533 tons/day. Table 6 gives details.
9.        The fruit collection will be organized and managed by OPC.  One
unit will be responsible for all fruit collection. Smallholder and estate
fruit collection are essentially the same although there are differences in
procedures.
10.       Details on planning and organizing fruit collection systems are in
the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 8).
Smallholder Fruit Collection
11.       At full maturity in 1988, 1/ the total production of ffb from the
Mid-Western State smallholder project areas would be about 80,000 metric tons
annually. Half of this quantity comes from the Agbor area and the other
half from the Sapele area. During the peak month (assuming 12.5% of total
annual production) about 400 tons of ffb would have to be collected each day
(assuming 25 working days a month) from the smallholder areas. Fruit bunches
collected from the smallholders in the Sapele area would be delivered to the
existing mill at Ajagbodudu until 1981, thereafter all fruit would be delivered
to the new mill. In 1980 and 1981 production from the Agbor area could either
be sold in the local market or processed at the pioneer oil mills operated
by the OPC; by 1982 the new mill near the Nsukwa Estate would be in operation.
In both the Sapele and Agbor areas the participating smallholders would be
within a radius of about 25 km from the central mills. Given this situation,
a single stage system of fruit collection, using 7-ton tipper trucks with
rear-mounted hydraulic cranes with built-in weighing scales, is considered
suitable for the collection of fruit bunches from the smallholders.
12.       It is estimated that each tipper truck could make about 4 trips in
a 10-hour working day (night loading being considered impractical) and haul
about 28 metric tons of ffb. At this rate the total peak month requirements
are estimated at 17 trucks, 17 net delivery units and 680 nets. These esti-
mates include the necessary reserves. The equipment would be apportioned
equally between the Agbor and Sapele areas. The total cost of smallholder
fruit collection is given in Table 7.
1/   Smallholder plantings will be at full maturity in 1988; Mosogar and
Nsukwa estate will be at full maturity in 1987, but Ajagbodudu (replanted)
will be at full maturity in 1990.
2/   Based on monthly peak production (12.5% of annual production) and 25
working days/month.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Estate Fruit Collection
13.       At full maturity in 1990 1/ about 106,550 metric tons of ffb will
be produced at the Ajagbodudu, Mosogar and Nsukwa Estates.  Out of this, about
94,640 metric tons will be the output from project plantings, and the rest
will be the output from Ajagbodudu's own replanting program and existing small-
holders around Ajagbodudu Estate. Assuming that 12.5% of the total annual out-
put will be harvested during the peak month, and assuming 25 days a month,
about 375 metric tons of ffb from the Ajagbodudu and Mosogar Estates, includ-
ing own replantings and existing smallholders, and 160 metric tons from
the Nsukwa Estate would need to be collected each day during the peak months.
14.       The new mill in the Sapele area would be at a distance of about
19 km from Ajagbodudu Estate and 13 km from Mosogar Estate. The mill in the
Agbor area will be within a radius of about 12 km from Nsukwa Estate. It
is estimated that in a ten-hour working day, each truck would, on an
average, be able to make 5 trips from the estates to the mill and transport
35 ton. At this rate, in order to transport the peak harvest at maturity,
estate fruit collection would require 18 tipper trucks with hydraulic cranes
and built-in scales, 16 net delivery units and 640 nets. These estimates
include the necessary reserves. Fruit bunches collected from the Ajagbodudu
and Mosogar estates would be delivered to the existing mill at Ajabodudu
until 1981. The new mill in the Sapele area starts production in 1982; the
production from the Nsukwa estate could be sold to the local processors,
or could be processed at OPC's pioneer oil mills until the new mill in the
Agbor area starts its operations in 1982. The total cost of estate fruit
collection is given in Table 8.
C. Road Improvement Program 2/
Introduction
15.       The Mid-Western State has a well developed communication system,
consisting of about 9,000 km of roads, 160 km of navigable rivers, and
domestic air services provided by Nigerian Airways. The State has no
railways. The rivers, including the Benin river, play an important role
in transport, especially in the coastal area, where road construction is
inhibited by river deltas and swamps.
16.       The roadnet work consists of about 550 km of Federal "A" roads;
2,400 km of "B" roads; and 6,000 km of earth roads.
1/   See footnote 1, page 3.
2/   More details are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 7).



ANNEX 4
Page 5
Cost of Reconstruction
17.       The upgrading of earth roads to the standards discussed in the Sup-
plementary Annexes (Supplement 7) would be done by a construction team working
under the supervision of a road engineer and his staff. Costs, including
grading and labor, but excluding supervision and depreciation, are estimated
as follows:
(a) N 560/km for an existing earth road to truck standard.
(b) N 610/km for a new earth road to truck standard.
If depreciation is included, the above costs are respectively N 675 and
N 725.
Administration of the Construction Program
18.       The earth roads program would require experience and skills which
are in short supply in Nigeria. Neither the Ministry of Works and Transport
(MWT) nor the consultants in the State (whether local or foreign) appear to
have wide experience in building and maintaining all-weather earth roads.
However, the timber companies, which construct such roads for extraction
purposes, have personnel with adequate qualifications.
19.       A road engineer should be engaged to organize and supervise the
road construction program, assisted by two supervisors and two clerks. The
road engineer should have wide experience in the construction of low-cost,
all-weather earth roads and preferably be recruited from the timber exploiting
companies.
20.       The improvement of the 299 km of roads would be executed by a
construction team working under the supervision of the road engineer.
Construction time would be about 2-1/2 years. The equipment could, after
completion of the work, be handed over to the MWT on the understanding
that it would be used exclusively for the maintenance of the roads within
the project area. The repair of the bridges would be undertaken by the
local contractors.
The Road Network
21.       The road network needed for the 8,000 ha smallholder project is
shown on Map 10964R. It has been assumed planting will be confined to areas
that lie within 600 meters on each side of the collection road. It is
further assumed that only 12.5 ha per km of paved road and 20 ha per km
of earth road will be used for planting palm trees under the project.
22.       The total length of roads that need to be developed is shown
below:

277.6   173.6      451.2
23.       Based on the above assumption, the total hectarage of smallholder
plantings that could be developed along this road network is:
East
Paved roads                 90.4 km x 12.5 ha = 1,130 ha
Earth roads                187.2 km x 20.0 ha = 3,744 ha
Total                                          4,874 ha
West
Paved roads                 16.0 km x 12.5 ha =   200 ha
Earth roads               157.6 km x 20.0 ha = 3,152 ha

the State Government, OPC and NAB. Work document of that meeting adapted to other figures in this report. Differences however
are minimal.
2/ In March 1974 NAB's Board approved a loan to OPC of N 5,342,629.
3/ No Bank funds onlent through NAB.
7/ NAB costing included in its financing maintenance of a part of the estates at maturity X N 285,000. Since this is not
included in project costs this ameunt has been deducted of NAB's loan in the project financing plan.
Physical and price contingencies.
NAB undertook to consider further lending to MWSG for the replanting of Cowan estate.
7/ Under the NAB loan agreement already N 5.06 million committed for oil palm development by the State.

Yields on already established Ajagbodudu estate
1.        Average production (see Annex 4, Table 2) at Ajagbodudu estate over
the period 1958-1972, excluding years of uncertainty and disturbance (1967 to
1971 inclusive) was 20,534 long tons or 20,862 metric tons annually. However,
since years of neglect during the period of disturbances will have a lasting
effect on the plantation, future yields from Ajagbodudu's old plantings are
estimated at 7.5 metric tons/ha. Based on observations over the 12-month
period October 1972 - October 1973 the extraction rates of Ajagbodudu's old
plantings are as follows:
Oil extraction rate             13%
Kernel extraction rate            6.5%
Ajagbodudu's own replantings in 1974 and 1975 are estimated to give the same
yields and extraction rates as replantings under the project.
2.        Ajagbodudu Estate also collects and processes fruit from surrounding
existing smallholders. Over the years their production averaged 6,650 metric
tons annually. Extraction rates are the same as those observed for Ajagbodudu's
old plantings.

1.        For the purpose of this project the economic and financial prices
for palm oil and kernels have been calculated using the Bank's world market
price projections for 1980. The projections are as follows:

Palm Oil
3.        It has been assumed that without the proposed projects Nigeria
would be a net importer of palm oil by 1980. The projections indicate that
by 1985 the net deficit would be around 275,000 tons of palm oil and most of
this deficit would have to be supplied from Malaysia. The Ivory Coast would
be able to supply part of this deficit but it is unlikely that the cif price
would be much below the Malaysian price. It has further been assumed that
palm oil imported or produced by the project would be sold in or around the
large urban markets of Western Nigeria, such as Ibadan. Implicit in this
assumption is that the rural markets of Mid-Western State and urban markets
such as Benin would be fully supplied from alternative sources. It is probable,
however, that these areas would also be the markets for the project and this
would result in higher economic and financial millgate prices since (a) the
transport from port to the market would be higher, and (b) the transport from
the mill to the market would be less than projected with Ibadan as the market.
Hence the price estimates tend to be on the conservative side. Furthermore
projects would be in full production after 1985 and the forecasted price for
1985 in constant 1974 terms is substantially higher than the 1980 price.
Kernels
4.        For the purposes of the economic and financial millgate prices it
has been assumed that kernels will be exported at a projected, 1980, price
of US$330 per metric ton. The charges included are based on what is currently
expected to be the role of the Marketing Boards and NPMC, where the Mill can
bypass the Marketing Board and sell directly to NPMC and hence avoid any
Mlarketing Board commission.
5.        With the rapid expansion of kernel crushing industries from 2 mills
at present, with a combined crushing capacity of 110,000 tons per annum, to
about 7 - 9 mills with a capacity of 350 - 400,000 tons, provided all present-
ly projected investment programs materialize (nearly all jcint enterprises
with State participation), it is probable that a large proportion of kernels
would be processed locally and exported as kernel oil. In that case the
export price for kernel oil would be obtained and given efficiency in the
crushing operations the added value for Nigeria would be higher. Therefore
taking the export prices for kernels is again a conservative estimate.

NIGERIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
MID-WEST STATE
Calculation of the Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1.        The annual costs and benefits used in calculating the economic rate
of return to the project are given in Tables 1 and 2 and a summary of the
sensitivity analysis in Table 3.
(a) Project Life
The life of the project is assumed to be 30 years and no residual
value is attributed after that period. Planting would be completed
by the end of 1980 except for Ajagbodudu's replantings which would
be completed by 1982. Production would commence in 1980, and all
areas would be at full maturity by 1990;
(b) Project Costs
The costs are those shown in Annex 5 but with the following
adjustments:
(i) price contingencies are omitted;
(ii) identifiable taxes and duties are excluded, namely, import
duties on vehicles and equipment and certain farm inputs
and indirect taxes included in operating costs;
(iii) labor is shadow priced at 65% of the estimated financial
cost (smallholder labor 70 kobo and nursery and estate
labor N 1). The shadow wage rate reflects a weighted
average of economic wages in both peak and slack seasons;
(iv) the official foreign exchange rate does not reflect exactly
the domestic value of a unit of foreign exchange because
of taxes and subsidies. Therefore a shadow exchange rate
N 1 = $1.27 has been applied instead of the official rate of
N 1 = $1.52. This implies an estimated overvaluation of the
Naira of about 20%;
(v)  for the purpose of division of mill expenditure between
nucleus estate and smallholder projects, the respective
fruit production at full development has been taken as a
percentage of total fruit processed. This percentage
has been applied for division of mill investments.
(Annex 4, Table 1);



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(vi)  similarly for the division of mill recurrent expenditure
the same percentage as above--only calculated on annual
basis--has been used (Annex 4, Table 1);
(vii)  since the estate fruit collection also caters for existing
smallholders around Ajagbodudu Estate, project fruit production
has been taken as a percentage of total production collected
by the estate (Annex 4, Table 6) and this annual percentage
has been used to determine the division of estate fruit
collection costs (capital and recurrent expenditure);
(viii) the cost of the Tree Crop Section of the Federal Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit has been distributed between oil
palm, rubber and cocoa projects on the basis of 50%, 25%
and 25% respectively. Since there are three palm oil
projects, the 50% share has been apportioned between
projects and also between the smallholder and estate
components on the basis of ha planted;
(ix) physical contingencies (at 5% over all costs) have been
included during the project period (1975-1983).
(c) Benefits
(i) Yields and production estimates are given in Annex 7;
(ii)  economic prices have been based on the Bank's price
projections for palm oil kernels. The price projec-
tions are $495 per metric ton of palm oil in 1980
($300 in constant 1974 terms) and $330 per metric ton of
kernels in 1980 ($200 in constant 1974 terms). The economic
millgate prices for palm oil (N 232.0) and kernels (N 120.4)
are given in Annex 8;
(iii) the value of project palm oil is treated as foreign
exchange savings (import substitution) and the value of
kernels as foreign exchange earnings;
(iv)  only project production has been taken into account
and thus output from Ajagbodudu's old palms, pre-project
replantings (420 ha) and existing smallholders around
Ajagbodudu have not been included;
(v) no additional benefits due to road development are taken
into consideration;
(vi)  mills are commissioned in 1982, but fruit collected before
that year (1980, 1981), is either processed in Ajagbodudu's
existing mill, OPC's pioneer mills or sold on the market.
It is assumed that under these circumstances only 25% of
benefits will be realized.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
2.        Based on these assumptions the economic rate of return is 18.2%
for the smallholder component and 17.3% for the estate component. A 10%
increase in costs with benefits unchanged reduces the rate of return to 16.9%
and 16.0% respectively. As usual, where project benefits occur after a long
development period, the rate of return is relatively insensitive to changes
in costs and benefits (Table 3). Even in the case of costs increasing by 20%
and benefits decreasing by 20%, the economic rate of return is 12.5% for
the smallholder component and 11 .5% for the estate component.
3.        Without shadow pricing of labor and foreign exchange, the economic
rate of return is 15.5% for the smallholder component and 14.5% for the estate
component.
4.        The rate of return for the whole project combining the estate and
smallholder component is 17.7%.
