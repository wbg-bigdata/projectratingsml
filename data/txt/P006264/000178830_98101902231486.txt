INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELJOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIV-E DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL FOR
A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following repor-t and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$23.5
million to help finance a second education project in the North and
Northeast of Brazil.!/ The loan would have a term of 30 years, including
ten years of grace, with interest at 8% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, entitled "The Economic Position and
Prospects of Brazil"' (355a-1R), dated June 20, 1974, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on July 3, 197!l. Country data sheets are
attached as Annex I.
3.        The Brazilian economny continues to grow at the extremely
rapid pace, which began in 1968, with an estimated increase in GDP of
11.9% in 1973. The average rate of growth of 10.2% over the period
1967-73 has resulted in a 50% increase in per capita income, a 100%
increase in manufacturing output, and a 250% increase in merchandise
exports (in current dollars). During this period, with carefully
designed fiscal and monetary policies the Government has also been
successful in gradually reducing the rate of domestic inflation, though
in 1973 overheating developed, which was temporarily contained, but
which led to a fairly sharp increase in prices during the first half
of 1974, reflecting a very rapid increase in export and import prices
and a relaxation of price controls. The level of inflation in 1974 is
likely to be in the range of 30-35%, compared to under 20% per year in
1970-73.
1/  The states participating in the project are Alagoas, Amazonas,
Maranhao, Para, Paraiba, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe.
These will be referred henceforth as the project states.



- 2 -
The prolonged period of rapid growth of output and income
has been accompanied by major changes in both industrial and agricul-
tural sectors. Industry is being transformed from a sector with excess
capacity and a relatively marginal impact on employment into one in
which capacity limitations are becoming a constraint and where labor
absorption is accelerating. Increases in foreign and domestic demand
for and prices of major agricultural commodities have resulted in rapid
increase of land area devoted to production of crops such as soybeans
and sugar. The economic expansion had a beneficial impact on employment
and real wages during 1973. Industrial employment is estimated to have
increased by 8% in 1973. While increasing absorption of labor and
rising real wages encourage the belief that the lower income groups are
enjoying an increase in their incomes in real terms, it cannot yet be
said to what extent this will improve the skewed pattern of income
distribution in Brazil.
5.        The rapid expansion of the Brazilian economy over the 1968-72
period depended increasingly on the utilization of foreign savings. The
resource gap, which was 0.9% of GDP in 1968, grew steadily to 2.0% in
1972. Increases in domestic saving did not keep pace with the investment
requirements of a 10% average rate of GDP growth, as the investment rate
rose from 17.LX of GDP in 1968 to 21.1% in 1972. During this period the
growth of exports, while averaging 13% per year, was well below the 20%
growth of imports. However, this pattern of development was reversed
in 1973 as domestic savings, stimulated by Government-induced saving
schemes and facilitated by increasing export prices, are estimated to
have increased by 25.2% and reached 21.5% of GDP. For the first time
in many years this exceeded the growth of investment, so that during
1973 the resource gap narrowed from 2.0% to 1.1% of GDP. The narrowing
of the resource gap may not represent a trend, however, but may reflect
a lag between increased incomes due to improved terms of trade and
increases in consumption.
6.        Brazilts balance of payments performance in 1973 was re-
markable. There was a surplus on trade account, the deficit on
current account declined, private foreign investment increased
threefold, the debt structure underwent considerable inprovement, and
the capacity to import further strengthened as terms of trade continued
to evolve favorably. The inflow of foreign capital was mainly in the
form of financial credits and, as in the past few years, this capital
inflow exceeded the capital required, resulting in a US$2 billion
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which reached US$6i7 billion,
the equivalent of more than 11 months' imports, at the end offl973.
Concerned about the term structure of external debt, the authorities
extended the minimum maturity of financial credits to six, then eight
and ultimately to ten years. In January 1974, in view of the higher
import costs due to increased prices for oil and other products and
the uncertain condition of the world capital market, the authorities
repealed the requirement, imposed in September 1973, that recipients
of financial credits create a 40% reserve deposit. With the present
tightness in the market for long-term funds zand Brazil's very large
total capital requirements, Brazil decided in September 1974'to reduce
the minimum pemnitted terms for financial credits, from 10 years to 5
years.



- 3 -
7.        The increase in crude petroleum prices will have strong
direct and indirect consequences for the future growth of Brazil.
Oil imports now supply more than three-fourths of its requireplents,
and Brazil is now the largest oil importer of the developing nations.
The more than fourfold oil price increase will therefore have a sub-
stantial immediate impact on the balance of payments, adding some US$2
billion to the import bill and the current account deficit will
probably rise to about US$4.5 billion in 1974, as compared to US$1.3
billion in the previous year.
8.        In recent years, Brazil has become more closely integrated
into the world economy and its growth has become more dependent upon
and vulnerable to changes in the world economic situation. A slowdown
in the rate of growth of the world economy could have an adverse impact
on prices of Brazilian primary exports and on the rate of growth of its
exports of manufactures. In addition, disruption of world capital mar-
kets could affect the flow of loans and direct investment to Brazil.
In view of these uncertainties, it may not be possible to sustain the
Government's target rate of growth of 10% per annum. A growth path
with GDP increases tapering down to 8% by 1976 would result in an
annual average current account deficit of US$4,900 million (US$3,940
million in constant 1974 prices) over the 1974-79 period. Multilateral
lenders can expect to be called upon to play a more important role in
Brazil over the next few years, not only because the availability of
other sources on good terms may be somewhat less ample than in the past
but also because multilateral lenders could help to mobilize other
sources of financing and because the level of their activity is taken
by the financial community as a measure of the confidence these agencies
have in the economic management of the country. It is estimated that
the average annual net inflow of medium- and long-term capital (that is,
capital other than direct investments and financial credits) required
for the 1971-79 period will be almost US$1.5 billion, or over three times
the average for the 1969-73 period. While the official loan capital
needed to support Brazil's growth targets is substantial, the direct
import needs of most public investment projects are relatively low,
reflecting the ability of the domestic capital goods industry to compete
successfully under international competitive bidding and the low direct
foreign exchange component of many projects with strong social impact.
Hence, an appreciable part of official external financing should be made
available to cover domestic expenditures.
9.        By the end of 1973, Brazil's total external debt (public and
private) reached US$12.6 billion, of which over 60% or US$7.8 billion
was in the form of financial credits. Despite the large increases in
the level of indebtedness, Brazil's external liquidity profile at the
end of 1973 was better than at the end of 1967. While the debt service
ratio has been declining, the reserve level in terms of number of months
of imports has been increasing. Extension of the minimum term of financial
credits and virtual elimination of short-term credits has had a favorable
impact on debt structure. If an export growth rate of 21% per year in
dollar terms (compared to 31% for 1970-73) can be maintained over the



- 4 -
1973-79 period and if average maturities on new financial credits do not
fall below six years, the debt service ratio can be expected to decline
from 36% in 1973 to 31$ in 1979.   It should be noted that this debt
service ratio includes service on all public and private debt; the ratio
for public and publicly guaranteed debt alone would be very much lower.
Nonetheless, the fact remains that Brazil's external debt is large and
its debt service obligations are high. However, the very large foreign
exchange reserves accumulated over the past several years ensure that
Brazil will have the liquidity to meet its debt service obligations in the
short term, while the country's record of high caliber financial manage--
ment provides grounds for confidence in the maintenance of creditworthi--
ness over the longer run.
10.       There has been a remarkable broadening and deepening of the
country's productive base and of its infrastructure in recent years, as
well as a considerable strengthening of its external sector. However,
despite its recent growth and vast potential, Brazil is still a country
with a relatively low per capita income, about US$530 (Bank Atlas for
1972), a very unequal distribution of income, and extensive absolute
poverty. The Brazilian Government believes that the poverty and dualism
which afflict the country can be ameliorated only if high rates of
economic growth are sustained, permitting absorption of the economically
marginal population into the expanding modern sector.   Within the context
of rapid growth, the Government has committed itself to using the
considerable savings it generates for programs which transfer resources
from the more developed to the less developed regions of the country,
and some of which have a social orientation.   The programs fall into
two broad categories: regional development programs for the Northeast,
Amazon and Center-West designed to bring about a fuller utilization of
the country's land and natural resources, encourage expansion of the
agricultural frontier and promote industrialization of less developed
areas; and social development programs in public health and nutrition,
water and sewerage, low-income housing, education and social welfare,
instituted to broaden the distribution of and improve access to the
benefits of economic growth.
PART II - BANK (ROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
Bank Operations
11.       By September 30, 1974, Brazil had received 49 loans from the
Bank amounting to US$1,856.0 million, of which 31 had not been fully
disbursed. From FY65-69, disbursements averaged only US$10 million per
year, increasing to an average of US$136 million per year during FY70-74,
and reaching US$225 million in FY74. Disbursements will continue to
increase during the next few years. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans as of September 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.



12.       Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, when seven
loans were approved totalling US$437 million (including three large
loans to the steel industry). In FY73, six loans amounting to US$18707
million and, in 197a, three loans totalling US$242 million were approved.
This proposed loan for a second education project in the Northeast and
North is the first loan to Brazil presented to the Executive Directors
thus far in FY75. A proposed loan of US$110 million for a fifth highway
project is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors soon,
simultaneously with a proposed loan of US$175 million for a second railway
project. At an advanced stage of preparation are an integrated rural
development project in the Northeast state of Rio Grande do Norte, a
polder irrigation and agricultural development project in the lower Sao
Francisco Valley, and two projects in the next phase of the Government's
program for expanding the flat steel industry. We hope to present these
projects to the Executive Directors for consideration in FY75. We are
also working with the Brazilians on the preparation of a project to
improve the Port of Recife, an agricultural research program, a nutri-
tion project, a small- and medium-sized industry credit project, a
secondary and feeder road project, a railways rehabilitation and expan-
sion project with the Sao Paulo State Railway Company and a power dis-
tribution project for medium- and low-income urban households in the
Northeast.
13.       Brazil's public medium- and long-term externaldebt (excluding
financial credits) outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1973 totalled
US$h.8 billion. The Bank held, at the end of 1973, 13.3% of the medium-
and long-term debt outstanding; and the Bank's share of the service on
this debt was about 6.2%. If present trends continue as expected, the
Bank's share in total medium- and long-term debt outstanding would increase
to about 18% by 1979, while the share in debt service would increase
to about 15%.
IFC Operations
lb.       IFC has committed more financial resources to Brazil than to
any other country. Since 1957, IFC has made 25 commitments to Brazil,
totalling US$243.6 million, of which US$12.8 million has been repaid
and US$136.8 million sold. Of the balance of US$94.0 million, US$68.7
million represents loans and US$25.3 million equity. A summary of
IFC's investments up to September 30, 1974, is given in Annex II.
Lending Strategy
15.       In its lending to Brazil, the Bank has sought to help the
Government achieve several important objectives. One is the identifi-
cation and support of projects designed to increase productivity and
incomes in the lowest income segments of the population, to broaden
the economic opportunities open to those groups and to alleviate human
misery. Project preparation efforts in this area have been intensified,
and we hope to present an increasing number of loans with this objective,
in addition to this proposed education project. We are actively asso-
ciated with the preparation of new projects in the fields of nutrition,



water supply and sewerage, sites and services for urban housing and
rural development. A particular effort is being made to help Brazil
develop effective programs to increase the productivity of the small
farmer in the Northeast, the poorest section of the country. A staff
member has been stationed in Recife to work with the Government in
formulating, what we hope will be a series of integrated rural development
projects. Efforts in this field would be reinforced by a project in
preparation to support agricultural research in the Northeast and to
strengthen the federal mechanism for coordinating and supervising agri-
cultural research. Projects benefitting low income groups require much
time and staff effort to prepare, and the flow of such projects will
therefore be modest for some time to come.
16.       Institutional development and policy reform designed inter
alia to help ensure that public savings are used economically and that
an adequate volume of savings is available for applications in the
social sector, have been a second major objective in Bank lending to
Brazil. They play a particularly important role in our lending in the
transportation sector, especially railways.
17.       A third objective in Bank lending to Brazil, especially in
the Dower, steel and highway sectors, is to help provide necessary
long-term external capital. In this regard, the Bank seeks to play a
complementary role to that of other lenders, supplementing their re-
sources in individual operations and financing activities that they
are unwilling to finance. Brazil will continue to need a very large
volume of medium- and long-term capital inflows to sustain rapid
growth and achieve its employment creation and regional development
objectives.
18.       A fourth lending objective for the Bank has been to help
ease the foreign exchange constraint on Brazilian development by
supporting projects designed to increase Brazil's export capacity and,
where economical, to substitute domestic production for impcrts. Sup-
port of Brazil's steel industry, for example, is helping Brazil develop
self-sufficiency in a commodity which can be produced efficiently in
3razil owin- to the country's bountiful supply of high-grade iron ore
and the scale of its internal markets.
PART III - EDUCATION IN BRAZIL
Bank Qzroup Experience in the Education Sector
19.       The Bank's efforts to assist in the improvement of the
education sector in Brazil started in 1971, with a loan of US$8-4
million (Loan 755-BR) to support priority areas of the Brazilian



- 7 -
Education Reform of 1971. This loan assisted in the financing of the
expansion and improvement of 16 federal institutions for the training
of industrial and agricultural technicians at the secondary and post-
secondary levels. Implementation of the project is proceeding satis-
factorily and it is expected to be completed in 1975.
The Education Reform
20.       Before the enactment of the Education Reform Law of 1971,
the Brazilian education system was not designed to serve the socio-
economic needs of the country effectively. Traditionally, the education
system had been characterized by over-emphasis on academic subjects,
which resulted in serious constraints on the supply of adequately trained
manpower for the major sectors of the economy. The system contained wide
disparities in educational opportunities among the various states of the
country, due primarily to the lack of administrative and managerial
capacity of the governments of poorer states and the failure of the
Federal Government to provide adequate technical and financial assistance
to them. Finally, the system tended to favor the provision of education
facilitites in urban areas, with little emphasis on rural education.
The education system comprised four years of primary education, four
years of lower secondary education ("ginasio"'); three years of upper
secondary education ("colegio"'); and post-secondary education varying
in length from one to six years.
21.       The 1971 Education Reform Law, together with the recently
approved 1975-79 Education Development Plan, are aimed at correcting
the above-mentioned imbalances and at promoting qualitative improve-
ments and greater efficiency in the education system. They establish
major human resource development programs, including, inter alia:
(a) integration of the primary and lower secondary education
levels into a free and compulsory basic education cycle
of eight years;
(b) introduction of practical subjects in such areas as
industrial arts, agriculture and home economics at the
basic education level, and work-oriented courses at the
secondary level;
(c)  rationalization and improvement of education administra-
tion, supervision and planning at both federal and state
levels;
(d) development of new funding mechanisms and new criteria
for the optimum deployment of financial resources, in-
cluding the transfer of funds from the Federal Government
to the states and municipalities;
(e) expansion of agricultural education and adult literacy,
education and skill programs;



- 8-
(f) establishment of post-secondary technical programs; and
(g) experimentation with and more rapid introduction of
modern education technology.
As guidelines for the states in formulating their development programs,
the 1975-79 Plan establishes the following nationwide goals:
(a)  expansion of basic education enrollments from the current
84% to 100% of the 7-14 age group;i/
(b) expansion of secondary school facilities to increase the
enrollment ratio of the 15-17 age group from the current
18% to 30%; and
(c) raising of the literacy rate from the current 68% to 95%.
As noted below (para. 25), however, achievement of these goals is subject
to constraints on the pace with which the states can develop their educa-
tional systems.
22.       In addition to the implementation of the refonr of the formal
education system, the Federal Government, acting to further alleviate
the constraints on the supply of adequately trained manpower, is ener-
getically promoting non-formal education through such institutions as
MOBRAL (Brazilian Movement for Literacy), PIPMO (Iintensive Program for
Preparation of Industrial Labor) and SENAI (National Service for Indus-
trial Apprenticeship). These organizations have been operating in the
fields of vocational, technical and teacher training and in adult
literacy programs.
Education Planning and Administration
23.       Established by law in 1961, the Federal Council of Education
(consisting of 24 educators appointed for 6 year terms by the President
of the Republic) is the principal body for dieveloping overall education
policy in Brazil, including the drawing up of basic guidelines and
standards as well as criteria for the allocation of the federal educa--
tion funds to the different levels of education. The executive arm of
the Federal Council of Education is -the Ministry of Education and Cul-
ture, which has been given the major responsibility for ensuring that
state policies and practices are consistent with those laid down by the
Federal Council of Education, for allocating federal education funds to
the states and controlling their subsequent expenditures, for coordinating
education planning between federal and state levels, and for providing
technical assistance to the states for local planning and administration.
Thus , the Federal Government has the major responsibility for overall
education planning and policy formulation, and delegates to the states
the main responsibility for education administration, At the state level,
L/ Enrollment ratios cited in the text of this report exclude oveage
students, unlike the gross ratios shown in Annex I.



- 9 -
the acministration of the system, and the implementation of federal
policies depend to a great extent on the competence of the adninistra-
tive and managerial machinery of the individual states. Since there
have been substantial inequalities in the adninistrative, managerial
and financial resources of the various states of the country, the imple-
mentation of the reform has not proceeded at a uniform pace throughout
the country, with the poorer regions of the North and Northeast lagging
substantially behind the rest of Brazil.
24.       The Federal Government is aware of the administrative defi-
ciencies of the poorer states of the country, and in 1970 it reorganized
the Ministry of Education and created a National Planning Office, for the
purpose of strengthening the Ministryts capacity to assist these states
in implementing national education policies. The Ministry, however, has
not been able to accomplish this objective successfully; its assistance
to the states so far has been sporadic, due in part to a lack of qualified
staff. The Federal Government and the states now intend to strengthen
their planning units and establish a closer liaisn between the National
Planning Office and the states in order to bring about a better integration
of their planning efforts. The proposed project would provide technical
assistance to the Federal and State Governments in this respect.
25.      Although in the long rnn such institution-building efforts
should enable the poorer states to better iuiplement national educational
policies, in the short run these states will continue to lag behind the
rest of the country. In fact, the targets set by the 1975-79 Education
Development Plan are national, and the Federal Government is now in the
process of modifying them and rephasing their programs in accordance with the
states' needs and their ability to absorb new funds, given their human
and institutional constraints. Furthermore, the poorer states, in
carrying out the reform, are concentrating their limited human resources
in the more urbanized areas and leaving the educational development of
the rural areas principally to municipal authorities. However, the
Federal Government has adopted the objective of correcting these in-
equalities in educational opportunities and intends to act through
special rural education projects to help meet the education/training
needs of rural communities.  It should be possible for the authorities
to start to remedy the deficiencies in rural education at an early
date. Plannin.g of comprehensive investment programs in this area
will be facilitated by systematic studies included in the proposed
project, i.e., national school facility and mapping surveys, and an
assessment of the institutional, teacher training, non-formal training,
and cost requirements for properly implementing the education reform
in the North and Northeast, particularly in rural areas. The Government,
jointly with the Bank, would review at intervals of about one year,
the progress on the implementation of the reform in these regions (see
Section 4.07 and Schedule 2, Part D, of the draft Loan Agreement).
Education Finance
26.       The Federal Government bears the largest share of the cost of
education in the northern and northeastern states; its transfers cover
more than half of these states' expenditures on education (compared with
about 30% for the country as a whole), and more than three-fourths of
those of the municipalities in these states. Three federally established
revenue-sharing and transfer programs -- the Education Salary Fund,
the Participation Fund and the Special Fund -- are used in whole



- 10 -
or in Dart to effect these transfers for education. Total transfersl/
are distributed to the states according to a composite formula which
favors the more populous, less educationally advanced and poorer states.
By design, they involve a net transfer of resources to the northern
and northeastern states. In fact, these states, with about one-third
of the country's population, received more than half of the 1973 trans-
fers of federal funds to all states. For 1974, the Federal Government
expects to transfer about US$200 million to the project states, of
which US$L6 million (23%) would be used for education, while the states
would devote to education another US$38 million from their own resources
(14% of these resources). Notwithstanding the relatively larger amount
of federal transfers allocated to the project states, significant dis-
parities in education expenditures between the project states and the
rest of Brazil remain. Annual per capita education expenditures range
between US$4 and US$6 for these states, versus US$15 for the country as
a whole. The unsatisfactory position of the project states is reflected
in very low teacher salaries, a high proportion of unqualified teachers,
and lack of schools and teaching materials.
27.       Given the limited financial resources available to the project
states, financing the implementation of the education reform in these
states will require substantial further assistance by the Federal Govern-
ment. The overall cost implications of the reform for these states are
yet to be systematically determined.   However, the Federal Government
would inforn the B3ank in writing; that, as implicit in the 1975-79 Ed-
ucntioni Develoloment Plan, it will t3Xe whatever steps may he necessary,
to ensure that the northern and northeastern state governments possess
sufficient financial resources to implement the reform at a pace consist-
ent with the states' ability, in terms of administrative and human
resources, to absorb these funds (see draft Supplemental Letter on Eduoation
Financing.)
PART IV - THE PROJECT.
28.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project
in Brazil" (No.515a-13R , dated   October 29, 1974) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the proposed
project and loan are summarized in Annex III.
29   ~    The initial discussions with the Government on a possible com-
position of a second education project commenced in May 1973, when a
Bank mission agreed with the Government on the possible items to be in-
cluded in the proposed project for preparation and appraisal.   The project
was prepared by Federal and State education officials and appraised by the
1 / Excluding earmarked transfers for roads and power.



- 11 -
Bank in January/February 1974. Negotiations with the Government were
held in Washington-from September 23 to October 3, 1974.
Project Purpose
30.       In line with the Federal Government's development strategy,
the proposed project would assist the Government in its efforts to
help eight states of the North and Northeast to implement education
development programs. These states are among the poorest in the
country, with per capita incomes much below the average for the
country as a whole. While the main objective of the project is to
assist in the qualitative improvement of the Brazilian   education
system, it would also contribute to correcting the regional imbalance
in educational opportunities, particularly at the secondary level, which
has developed over the years. The project would help in improving the
educational planning and administrative capacities of the Federal and
State Governments and in alleviating the shortages of skilled labor in
the project states. It complements USAID assistance to other states
in implementing the education reform, and IDB support and Bank Loan
755-BR for technical and agricultural education.
Project Description
31.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) the construction, furnishing and equipping of 46 educa-
tional institutions in 8 states of the North and Northeast:
(i) ten basic level schools (grades 1-8);
(ii) five basic level common facilities centers for the
the teaching of practical subjects and science to
students in grades 5-8 in existing surrounding
satellite schools;
(iii)  nineteen secondary level schools (grades 9-11); and
(iv) twelve secondary level common facilities centers
for the teaching of work-oriented courses to
students in existing surrounding satellite secondary
schools;
(b) intensive training programs for about 2,200 teachers and
about 300 administrators to be required by the project
institutions and satellite schools;
(c) technical assistance -- comprising 20 man-years of
specialist services and 80 man-years of fellowships for
local staff -- in the areas of education planning,
curriculum development, rural education, school construc-
tion and education finance; and



- 12 -
(d) school facility and mapping, surveys and pre-investment
studies to assess (i) institutional, teacher training,
financial, and non-formal training requirements for
implementation of the education reform, particularly in
rural areas of the North and Northeast, and (ii) post-
secondary technician training requirements.
32.       The 46 proposed educational institutions would be located in
poor neighborhoods of the project states' capital cities and in isolated
middle-sized towns where there are severe shortages of education faci-
lities. The location in urban areas would allow for better monitoring
of the application of the new curriculum, introduced by the Education
Reform, the effectiveness of the teacher training programs, and
maintenance and logistic support.   The basic and secondary level schools
would have suitable facilities for implementing the new curriculum, and
the centers would provide the practical facilities required for the
teaching of practical and vocational subjects to about 65 surrounding
existing schools, now completely lacking the facilities needed for
adopting the new curriculum. The students from the satellite schools
would spend 7-8 hours per week in the center, and with proper scheduling
of classes the satellite schools should be able to increase their
enrollment about 30O. The basic education schools and centers would
have 9,310 student places and serve about 23,820 students because of
multiple shift use of the facilities. Although this represents only a
small fraction of total enrollment in basic education in the project
states (i.e., enrollment in basic education reached 2.2 million students
in 1971), the project institutions would have a significant demonstration
effect for future projects, since they would be among the first schools
to introduce qualitative improvements in basic education in these states.
The secondary schools and centers would provide 18,480 student places
and serve a total of about 47,700 students in multiple shifts. The
project would increase present enrollment in secondary educati-on in the
project states by about 25, and by 1980 it would provide about 1g of
the enrollment with the new curriculum.   The curriculum to be implemented
in the secondary schools would have a common program of general edication
and diversified work-oriented courses adapted to state manpower needs in
the areas of construction, commerce and industry. The Government hlas as-
sured that all project institutions would be used outside school hours by
other community groups and organizations for literacy courses and adult
training. programs (see Section 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
33.       The proposed project includes the financing of intensive in-
service training programs for teachers and administrators to be employed
in the project institutions and satellite schools. The teacher training
programs would consist of courses of 800-1,600 hours duration and
include refresher courses in the fields of agriculture, science, mathe-
matics, commerce, home economics and industrial arts. Courses for
administrators would include educational planning, school administration
and supervision and.curriculum development. These courses would be
conducted in collaboration with the state universities, and the operational
engineering centers provided under the Bank's first education project.
Within six months of the signing of the proposed Loan Agreement, the
Government would submit to the Bank a comprehensive staff develop-
ment plan, including incentives to retain full-time qualified



- 13-
staff in the project institutions (see Section .06 of the draft Loan
Agreement). The project also includes the financing of technical
assistance in the areas of education planning and management, education
finance, curriculum development, rural education and school construction.
The specialists, and their terms of reference would be acceptable to the
Bank, and they would work in close collaboration with the Federal Government
and participating states (see Section 3.02(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost Estimates and Financing
34.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$58.7 million
equivalent, and the foreign exchange component at US$6.7 million, or 11%
of the total project cost. Including contingencies, construction costs
make up 57% of the total cost; furniture and equipment, 27%; and teacher
training, technical assistance, pre-investment studies and project
administration, 16%. Contingencies were estimated at 35% of the basic
project cost for the 4-1/2 year project implementation period to cover
unforeseen physical factors as well as world inflation. Basic cost
estimates are expressed in September 197h U.S. dollars and include the
effects of petroleum price increases. The proposed Bank loan of
US$23.5 million would finance 40% of the total project cost (US$6.7
million of foreign exchange and US$16.8 million equivalent of local
costs). The Federal Government would finance another 40% of the total
project cost, and the state governments would finance the remaining 20%.
As noted in paragraph 8 above, the Bank financing of local expenditures
in Brazil is justified by the fact that external capital flows required
to support Brazil's high rate of--economic growth exceed the capital good
import needs of Brazilian public investment projects.
Project Entity
35.       PRODEM (Programa de Desenvolvimento do Ensino Medio), the
federal agency at the Ministry of Education responsible for the imple-
mentation of the Bank's first education project (Loan 755-BR), would
also be responsible for the proposed second project. This agency would
supervise project implementation, coordinate activities with the mini-
stries and states involved in the project, and provide liason with the
Bank. To fulfill these responsibilities, PRODEM has appointed a full-
time project manager, an architect, and an educator, to serve for the
second project in the headquarters office. PRODEa would also establish
regional offices in each state consisting of an architect and assistant
to supervise project implementation; the states would appoint counterparts
to these PRODEM staff.  PRODEM would provide the states with basic
information on procedures for properly carrying out the projeot and
would prepare the tenms of reference and bases for the selection of
architectural consultants, who would prepare tle design of the project
institutions in each state.



- 14 -
Suitable sites for most of the project institutions have already been
selected.  The Federal Government would sign subsidiary project agree-
ments with the project states so as to ensure proper project implemen-
tation (see Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement); the
effectiveness of such an agreement would be a condition precedent
to disbursement of loan proceeds in each state. The draft Subsidiary
Project Agreement is satisfactory.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment would be
awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines for procurement. However, Brazil has a competitive
local construction industry capable of carrying out the project and
not many foreign contractors are likely to participate. Furniture
and equipment would be grouped to form sizable bid packages for bulk
purchasing. Items that cannot be grouped into packages of at least
US$5,000 would be procured in accordance with Government's regular
procurement procedures, and would not exceed in aggregate the equiva-
lent of US$600,000 (corresponding to about 5% of the total cost of
furniture and equipment). Domestic manufacturers (whose bids contain
components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value
of the bids as defined in accordance with Brazilian Law) would be allowed
a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. price or the prevailing
tariff, whichever is lower.
37.       The proposed loan would finance 40% of total project expen-
ditures. However, this percentage would be reduced, if the cost of the
project increased, in order to assure the Bank's financial participation
in the project until its completion. Up to US$300,000 would be
disbursed to reimburse PRODEM for expenditures for professional services
and technical assistance incurred prior to the signina of the proposed
Loan Agreement. The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period
of 4-l/2 years, as indicated in Annex ITT.
PART 77 - LE(IAL INSThITMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federative Republic of
Brazil and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a draft resolution appro-ring the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. Features of the draft Loan
Agreement of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 25, 32, and
33.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.



PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
40.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-
(As of September 30, 1974)
There are now 29 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
h03/h74   Estreito Hydroelectric Project:  US$57 and US$39 million loans
of February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974. The project is almost completed. Equipment
costs were substantially below estimates, so disbursements pro-
ceeded more slowly than forecast. The original Closing Date
was April 1, 1971.
404       Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:  US$22.5 million loan of
February 27, 1965; Closing Date: December 31, 1974. The
project was completed in early 1971 (after a delay of about
18 months) except for the installation of equipment for an
associated transmission line. In March 1972, US$2.7 million
was cancelled from the remainde. of the loan.  Ordering and
the proposed delivery of this equipment have been delayed,
and the loan is now expected to be fully disbursed by
December 31, 197h, five years after the initial Closing Date.
The original Closing Date was December 31, 1969.
hh2       Jaguara Hydroelectric Project:  US$h9 million loan of March 15,
1966; Closing Date: December 31, 1974. All the generators
were commissioned during 1971 and the project has been completed.
Disbursements will extend up to the end of 1974 primarily because
equipment originally defective necessitated a postponement of the
last payments to suppliers. The original Closing Date was
April 30, 1971.
516       Livestock ProJect: US$hO million loan of September 23, 1967;
Closing Date: December 31, 197h. After initial delays due
to marketing and organizational difficulties, the livestock
credit program has been proceeding at a satisfactory rate.
Loan funds have now been completely committed, and the remain-
ing balance of US$205 million is expected to be disbursed by
the revised Closing Date of December 31, 1971. The original
Closing Date was December 31, 1973,
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weakness in project execution.



ANNEX II
Loan No.
565       Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:  US$22.3 million loan
of October 23, 196; Closing Date; March 31, 1975. Changes
in the project layout and design have increased substan-Lially
the local cost, which will be covered by ELETROERAS, without,
however, significantly affecting the economic justification
for the project. Construction work is on schedule and the
last unit was placed in service in early 1974.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project: US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1968; Closing Date: January 31, 1975.   The project
was delayed six months by spillway foundation difficulties.
This problem and price escalation greater than estimated in-
creased powerhouse construction cost by 72%, but, as the
original cost was very low, the resulting cost per kW of gen-
erating capacity is still attractive. No financial difficulty
is expected for the company as a result of' the overrans. The
project is now 90% completed and the first generating -nit was
tested in March 1974. The first three generating units are
expected to be in commercial operation by the end of 1971h azd.
the fourth unit by March l975.
656       Industry: US$25 million loan of February 16, 1970 to Banco
do Nordeste do Brasil      .    sin  Date: June 30   197
The loan has been fully committed. The Terminal Date for
submission of subprojects, originally June 30, 1972 and post-
poned to June 30, 1973, was postponed a second time to June 30,
1974 to give BNB an opportunity to submit subprojects in an
advanced stage of preparation. Slow utilizaticn ol" the loan
was due mainly to BNB's unusually btudensome security condi-
tions on subloans and its emphasis on larger-scale projects,
for which financing from other than World Bank funds has been
available.
676       Second Highway Construction Project:  US$100 imillion loan o.f
May 2=, 1970; ClosingDate:_ Jul 31, 1975;. Construction
works are underway and the overall quality of construction
and supervision is satisfactory.  There have, however, been
substantial cost iPcreases on some contracts, so -tnat the
total construction cost of the project is now estimated to
be above the appraisal estimate, excluding contingencies,
but still within the appraisal extimate including contingencies.
The execution of some contracts has been seriously delayed
by inclement weather conditions and project changes.  Disburse-
ments under the loan are behind the appraisal schedule, due to
a late start of the project, but have improved during the last
year. The original Closing Date was July 31, 1974.

Loan No.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of
May 25, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. Construction
work is proceeding on schedule. The cost of increased
excavation and concrete work resulting from poor rock
foundation is expected to be mostly offset by a reduction
in earth fill work.  A UJS$26 million overrun, caused by
equipment prices higher than estimated and additional
transmission facilities, was covered by a loan from a
commercial bank, but did not significantly affect the
economic justification for the project.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of
April 5, 1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. The construction
of the Salto Osorio hydroelectric plant is progressing satis-
factorily. Cost overrun of about US$8 million due to increased
equipment cost is foreseen but this does not significantly
affect the economic justification of the project. The con-
struction of the transmission system, delayed to allow a
reexamination of ELETROSUL's market, is proceeding as originally
defined.
755       Education Project:  US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975. Progress on the construction
and equipment of the project schools is now proceeding satis-
factorily. Although the project implementation is behind the
original schedule due to initial delays, disbursements under
the loan are expected to be completed by the Closing Date.
756       Santos Port Project:  US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971:
Closing Date: June 30, 1979. Because of other investments
in the Port of Santos and an increase in the cost estimate
of the Bank-financed project there, the execution of the Bank-
financed project has been delayed and its scope has been re-
viewed. The Bank and the Borrower have now agreed to postpone
construction of part of the container terminal, exclude from
the project the corn storage silo, simplify the rail access
to the left bank of the project, and reallocate the remaining
loan amount to a larger dredger and more extensive consultants'
services and training. The Closing Date of the loan has been
postponed from September 30, 1976 to June 30, 1979, in accor-
dance with the new schedule for completion of the project.
With the assistance of management consultants, satisfactory
progress has been made in improving port operations in Santos.
However, a satisfactory plan for the reorganization of the
National Department of Ports and Navigable Waterways has not
yet been completed, but is expected to be ready by the end
of 197h.

Loan No.
757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:   US$22 million loan of
June 21, 1971; Closing Date:   June 30, 1975.  The project
suffered initial delays caused by the State of Sao Paulo
not furnishing the required counterpart funds. The required
funds are now included in the state budget. The Government
has consolidated all the water and sewerage companies in the
state into a single company. A new agreement is expected to
be negotiated shortly with the new company.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:   US$15 million loan of
June 21, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The original
project design included the pumping of untreated sewage into
an area reservoir representing a major source ow water and
serving as an important recreational facility for the Sao
Paulo area. Earlier studies had shown that the reservoir
could absorb the organic pollution without damage for some
time. Area residents, however, objected to this solution
and subsequent technical review questioned the initial
judgment that no ecological harm would be caused. As a
result, the original design has been modified to exclude
the discharge of raw sewage and include a treatment facility.
Bidding procedures are in progress for other portions of the
project. In light of the lower costs associated with the
above solution, the loan amount has been reduced to US$12 mil-
lion. The Government has consolidated all the water and sew-
erage companies in the state into a single company. A new
agreement is expected to be negotiated with the new company
shortly.
786       Railway Project - MBR.: US$h6 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975. Implementation of the
project is generally satisfactory but behind schedule. Iron
ore traffic between the Aguas Claras mine and the Sepetiba
terminal has reached only about 60% the expected target to
date. Derailments on the central line and technical problems
at the MBR loading and unloading sites have curtailed some
traffic flows, but the major cause of the backlog is the
collapse of a bridge, interrupting MBR traffic for a month.
This accident was apparently triggered by an overload of the
freight cars. With improvements under way in track rehabi-
litation, bridge strengthening and siding lengthening, traffic
is expected to reach the target level this year.

787       MBR Iron Ore Project: US$50 million loan of Augut 25, 197>
Closing Date: December 31, 1976. The estimated cost of the
project has increased due to major design changes for the
port terminal and several investment additions to the project.
Target completion dates at the mine and terminal were met and
the first ship left Sepetiba Bay on November 26, 1973.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project:  US$64.5 million loan of February 8,
1972; Closing Date: July 1, 1975. The estimated cost is now
US$517 million, an increase of about 22% from the appraisal esti-
mate due to increases in local construction costs. The project
is now 45% complete and is prceeeding according to schedule.
812       USIMINAS Steel Expansion Project:   US$63 million loan of April 11,
1972; Closing Date: June 1, 1976. The estimated total project
cost is now US$681 million, an increase of about 19% from the
appraisal estimate due to application of higher safety margins
and to budget increases to take into account recent energy cost
increases. The project is 70% complete and may be about six
months behind the original estimate.
813       Third Highway Construction Project:   US$89 million loan of
April 11, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. Construction
works are nearly two-thirds completed, but are slightly behind
schedule; the estimated total contract cost is slightly above
the appraisal estimate. The feasibility studies and detailed
engineering financed under the loan were started later than
planned, but are now almost completed at a cost substantially
below the appraisal estimate. Disbursements are lagging behind
the appraisal forecast, but have improved during the last half
year and are now expected to be completed by the original Closing
Date of the loan.
828       COSIPA Steel Expansion Project:   US$64.5 million loan of June 14,
1972; Closing Date: January 15, 1977. The estimated total
project cost is now US$573 million an increase of about 20%
since appraisal due mainly to the introduction of safety margins
and budget increases to account for rising energy costs. This
will not significantly affect the economic justification of the
project. The project is now 45% complete and may be about
three months behind the original estimate.
829       Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project:   US$60 million loan of June 14,
1972; Closing Date September 30, 1979. The contract for the
civil works was awarded to an Italian-Brazilian consortium in
May 1973, and the project is proceeding according to schedule.

853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:  US$6.7 million loan of
July 24, 1972; Closing Date: December 1, 1978.  COLONE has
prepared revised farm development plans whose credit component,
to be financed by public financial institutions, will be signi-
ficantly higher than originally estimated, although still low
in comparison to other settlement projects. Adlinistrative
delays in the release of public funds for farm credit and COLONE
working, capital requirements and difficulties in recruiting
project staff have slowed project execution. Settlement, horever,
has now begun and the project should be completed in 1978 as
envisaged.
854       Fourth Highway Construction Project: US$51 million loan of
Aug7ust 4, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Construction
works are 37r completed and behind schedule; the estimated total
contract cost is slightly below the appraisal estimnate.
857       Grain Stora,-e Project:  US$30 million loan of September 27, 1972;
Closing7 Date: December 31, 1979. After some initial difficulties
with the appraisal of subprojects, the project is now well underway.
Durin,g, the first year of operation, 90 subprojects (totallingr US.$ll
million) were approved and another 94 (totallingT US$15 million)
are in the pipeline. The Bank and the Borrower have agreed on a
revised indexino system to ensure that sub-borrowers are charged
a positive real interest rate.
868       Interim Secand Livestock Project:  US$26 million loan of
December 19, 1972; Closinjp Date:  June 30, 1977. The Project
is proceedinr7 normally. The loan has been fully committed
and is expected to be disbursed as scheduled.
887       Power Distribution Project:  US$20 million loan of April 16,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. Pr-incipally due to dif-
ficulties encountered in preparing biddin:- documents and
delays in deliveries of equipment and materials, the project
is behind schedule.  The borrower intends to accelerate
procurement significantly this year and disbursements are
expected to be completed by the Closirin Date.

evaluation of the three bids submitted is underway. The
project is proceeding according to schedule.
92h       Agro-Industries Credit Project:  US$54 million loan of
August 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978. The loan
became effective on March 11, 1974. The demand for credit
is strong and the participating banks are expected to commit
project funds by October 1975.
There are now two Bank loans not yet effective:
1008      Paulo Afonso IV Hydroelectric Power Project:  US$81 million
loan of June 17, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1975. The
deadline for the loan documents to become effective is
December 16, 1974.
1009      Minas Gerais Water Supply Project:  US$36 million loan of
June 17, 1974: Closing Date: August 15, 1977. The Loan
Agreement was signed last June. The deadline for effective-
ness has been postponed from September 23, 1974 to
January 31, 1975.

Procurement
Arrangements:     Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment
will be awarded after international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement. However, Brazil has a local com-
petitive consutruction industry capable of carrying
out the project and not many foreign contractors
are likely to participate. Furniture and equipment
would be grouped to form sizable packages for bulk
purchasing. Items that cannot be grouped into
packages of at least US$5,000 would be procured
in accordance with the Government's regular pro-
curement procedures and would not exceed in
aggregate the equivalent of US$600,000 (corre-
sponding to about 5% of the total cost of furniture
and equipment). Domestic manufacturers of furni-
ture and equipment would be allowed a preferential

margin of' 15% of the c.i.f. price or thie prevailing
tariff, whichever is lower. PRODEM would be re-
sponsible for preparing and issuing tenders, evalu-
ating bids and awarding the contracts in consultation
with the Bank.
