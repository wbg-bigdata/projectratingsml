PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURMA
FORESTRY II EAST PEOU YOMKA PROJECT
(CREDIT 949-BA)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews lmplementation
of the Forestry II (East Pegu Yoms) Project in Burma, for which Credit
949-BA in the mount of US$35.0 million vws approved in August 1979.
The credit closing date was originally September 1985, but this was
extended to September 1986. The final disbursement was made on April
13, 1987. The undisbursed balance of US$10.1 million was cancelled at
that time.
The PCR wma prepared by the FAO/CP. An Overview, prepared by
the Asia Region, is based on the PCR, the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
No. 2564-BA, dated July 17, 1979, the President's Report (No. P-
2611-BA) dated July 24, 1979, the Credit Agreement dated September 21,
1979, and Bank supervision mission reports. The Project Performance
Audit Report (OED Report No. 4801, dated November 28, 1983) on the
preceding project--Burma Forestry I Project (Credit 493-BA) and repor-
ts relating to the ongoing Burma Wood Industries II Project (Credit
1444-BA) were also consulted.
The project has not been subjected to audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower on February 22,
1988 for their coiments. However, no coinents have been received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURMA
FORESTRY II EAST PEGU YOMA PROJECT
(CREDIT 949-BA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The project was to be the first phase of forestry and forest
industry development in the East Pegu Yoma and was expected to
increase teak and hardwood export revenues, increase the supply of
sawn hardwood to the domestic market, augment teak supplies through
compensatory plantations and select suitable fast growing species and
establish land clearing techniques for future large-scale plantation
of fast growing species. In the project area, increase in extraction
capacity, road construction. rehabilitation of existing hardwood saw-
mills and construction of aew hardwood sawmills were provided for.
Rehabilitation of Okkyin teak bawmill in Rangoon, improvement of rail
transport capacity for timber and technical assistance and overseas
training  for  extraction,   sawmilling   and  plantations  were  also
included.
Implementation Experience
Implementation was slower than anticipated mainly due to
delays in equipment procurement.   Disbursement had only reached about
602 of appraisal estimate at the original credit closing date. Credit
closing was extended by 12 months,  at  uhich  tlme 712 of the credit
amount had been disbursed, and the remainder was cancelled. Fuel
shortages were another principal reason for delays in implementation.
Results
Though there was some delay in project implementation mainly
due to delays in equipment procurement, the project was an overall
success. Most appraisal targets were equalled or exceeded. Short-
falls occurred in targets for production of nonteak hardwood logs and
sawnwood, mainly due to the inability to promote exports and inade-
quate sawmllling capacity, and for construction of all-weather and
extended logging season roads, mainly due to shortages of fuel and
road building materials. The economic rate of return (ERR) at comple-
tion is estimated at over 100X as anticipated at appraisal.
Sustainability
The Timber Corporation (TC), which was the principal Imple-
menting agency, was  considerably  strengthened  through the project.
Its efficiency was improved in part through decentralization of opera-
tions which permitted greater flexibility, and in part through
ImprovewAnt in logging and sawmilling infrastructure. The outlook for
sustainability appears good, at least over the assumed economic life



- iv -
of the several processing facilities provided which extends to 25
years in the case of the newly constructed hardwood sawmills.
FindinRs
The main lessons which emerge from the project's implementa-
tion experience are as follows:   (i) the economy-wide problem of for-
eign exchange scarcity, as evidenered by shortages of fuel and building
materials, which adversely affected project implementation and may
affect post-project maintenance activities, was underestimated at
appraisal; (ii) in view of the slow and cumbersome procurement proce-
dures in the country, more lead time should be allowed tor procurement
activities; (iii) the scope and timeframe for building up an export
market for nonteak hardwoods have proven to be overoptimistic as the
project failed to meet the nonteak hardwood export target envisaged at
appraisal; more work needs to be done to build up nonteak hardwood
e,v,rts; and (i%) in the plantation program, the effectiveness of tha
'aungya silvicultural  method,  using  landless  hill  people and thvs
eliminating shifting cultivation and the resultant loss of forest, was
established.
O.her points of interest are:
-    The low prices of  hardwood  (nonteak)  products in the local
market, together with high average milling costs per ton due
to low utilization of capacity and low conversion rates, have
led to a deterioration in financial viability of hardwood
production. Attempts should be made to increase the propor-
tion of export grade hardwood sold on the local market and to
price it accordingly.
-    The appraisal expectation  that  the sawmills constructed and
rehabilitated under the project will operate on double shift
has not yet materialized cue to insufficient power and non--
availability of trained operators, the latter factor at least
partly resulting from the reluctance of TC to close some of
the old sawmills and relocate labor, which is considered
politically undesirable.
-    Unlike Forestry I  Project  (Credit 493-BA), technical assis-
tance staff under Forestry II were recruited through a
specialized forestry consulting company and this arrangement
has proved effective.
-    Technical assistance  and  training  under  the  project have
considerably strengthened the TC's organizational structure
and performance and continued the process started under
Forestry I to decentralize the TC's logging and sawmilling
operations.
-    The Project Unit concept  worked well and facilitated ongoing
decentralization efforts.
-    Due to fuel shortages  and  a larger than anticipated availa-
bility of elephants, much greater reliance was placed during



- v -
project lIplemntation on an elephantlmechanical systcm of
extraction than on fully sechanised extraction envisaged at
appraisal.
While no major negative environmental effects of project
activities have been identified, the possibility of an insect
or disease attack In large-scale w'noculture lantations and
possible erosion problems in teak plantations should be kept
under review.

BURMA
FORESTRY II - EAST PECU YOKA PROJECT (CRECIT 949-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
1.        This overview is primarily based on the PCR for the Forestry II
Project (Cr. 949-BA) prepared by FAO/CP and presented to the Bank in November
1987. The PCR presents a detailed review of the project's performance and
impact and the Region agrees with the findings and conclusions of the PCi.
This overview is divided into two sectionss section A, which is based on the
PCZ, sumarizes the important aspects of project implementation and impact;
and section B, which utilizes information from documnts (listed in the
Preface) other than the PCI, complements and elaborates some parts of the PCR
relating to implementation issues and lessons learned.
A. Project Implementation and Implct
2.        Project Objectives and Components.  The project was designed *a the
first phase of forestry and forest industry developmnt in the East ftgu Yom.
to increase teak and hardwood export revenues; increase the supply of sawn
hardwood to the domestic market; augment teak supplies through compensatory
plantations; and select suitable fast-growing species and establish land
clearing techniques for future large-stale plantation establishment of fast
growing species. These objectives were to be achieved through: (a) invest-
ment in new, and rehabilitation of existing extraction equipment which would
increase annual eztraction capacity by about 290,000 hoppus (H) tons and
reduce teak log losses; (b) road construction to improve access to currently
inaccessible or poorly accessed forest areas; (c) upgrading mechanical mainte-
nance capacity in the project area; (d) rehabilitation of existing hardwood
sawmills and construction of new hardwood sawmills in the project area to
increase annual capacity and reduce timber wastage by improved equipment and
sawing techniques; (a) rehabilitation of Okkyin teak sawmill in Rangoon and
provision of minor spares to private teak sawmills; (f) investment in 29,500
acres of teak plantations; (g) investment in about 6,000 acres of large-scale
trial plantations for selection of appropriate fast groving species and the
development of lend clearing techniques; (h) upgrading of timber wagons and
locomotives to provide adequate unit-train timber transport capacity; and
(i) technical assistance for extraction, sawmilling and plantations and
overseaa training for personnel of the Timber Corporation (TC) and Forest
Departneat (FD) in manag_msnt, extra:tionq workshops, roads, finnce and
milling and marketing.
3.        Project Cost and Financing.  The project was to be implemented over
a 5-year period from 1979 to 1984. Total project cost was estimated at
K 578.9 million (US$86.4 million equivalent) with a 58S foreign exchange
component. Excluding taxes and duties, project cost was estimated at US$65.5



- vii -
million equivalent, of which IDA was to finance US$33.0 million (531 of
project costs), EEC US$8 million (122) for equipment, Government of Finland
US$1.4 million (21) for technical assistance, UYDP US$0.2 million (less than
1X) for overseas training and Government of Burma (GOB) the remaining US$20.9
million equivalent (32Z).
4.        Project Implementation.  Despite a good start, implementation of the
project was slow. By September 1985, the original credit closing date,
disbursement was only about 601 of the appraisal estimate. The credit closing
date was extended to September 1986 and final disburseesnt was made on
April 13, 1987. By then only 711 of the credit amount had been disburseds the
rest was cancelled. DeLays in equipmnt procurement and fuel shortages were
the principal reasons for slower than anticipated project implementation.
However, the project eventually achieved most of its targets (see Table 1).
5.        Chenges in Project Scop nd Design.  Changes introduced in project
during implementation were relatively minor. Of these, the significant change
was in harvesting and land clearing methods. At appraisal, mechanical
harvesting and land clearing was expected to be introduced on a larse scale.
Ho ever, during implementation, mechanical harvesting was reduced due to fuel
shortages and greater cost-effectiveness of combined elephant/mecbsnical
method of extraction. Moreover, use of power saw was discontinued after a
short trial period due to high operation and maintenance cost of these
machines and the scarcity of skilled operators. The use of crosscut saws was
found to be more economical and socially more acceptable. For plentations,
mechanical site preparation was tried on 75 acres but further trials were
postponed indefinitely due to high costs, fuel shortages and shortage of
suitable equipment and trained operators.
6.        Status of the Project at Completion.  The total project cost at
comp'etion was K 480 million (US$62.4 million equivalent) or 832 of the
appr&isal cost estimate in Kyat terms and 722 in dollar terms. Major factors
contrirtaing to lower costs were reduced procurement of logging and road
construction equipment and spare parts, reduced road construction and deletion
of the rehabilitation of private sawmills and local consultant components.
Costo in dollar terms were l ver than those in Kyat terms due to devaluation
of the Kyat by about 131 in the project implementation period.
7.        Despite the implemntation delay and shortfalls in some appraisal
targets, the project was an overall success. The re-estiuted economic rate
of return (EU) is very high (pare. 19). Significant increases in export
revenues, employment sod efficiency of sawmilling have resulted from the
project. The status of major individual components of the project at
completion is briefly discussed below and shown in Table 1.

s.        Estraction.  The extraction operation has been generally success-
ful. In the case of teak, log production exceeded appraisal targets in the
project implementation period (Table 1). However, hardwood log production,
which was mostly consumed domestically, has been lower than expected since
available sawmilling capacity was inadequate. As mentioned earlier (para. 5),
a significont feature was the much greater use of elephant/mechanical method
of extraction rather than mechanical logging envisaged at appraisal.
9.        Road Construction and Maintenance.  The projeet envisaged
improvement of road infrastructure to facilitate the mechanical extraction of
logs and reduce reliance on the river rafting system, thus reducing losses and
lowering costs. However, while construction of feeder roads (usable for 120
days a year) ezceeded appraisal targets, that of all-weather roads (usable for
at least 300 days a year) an.d extended logging sQason roads (usable for 150
days a year) considerably fell ,Fort of appraisal targets (Table 1). This was
due to the unforeseen fuel shorta1'. shortage of road building materials,
scarcity of skilled labor and reduc,  mechanical eztraction.
10.       Mechanical Equipnt Rehabilitation Aind Maintenance. As envisaged
at appraisal, new workshops were established wAd fully equipped to carry out



- ix -
the required maiatenance work and equipment was rehabilitated (Table 1). The
maintenance program and organization established under the project has been
working sacisfactorily and workmanship is of a high professional quality.
11.       Hardwood Sawmill Constrvction and Rehabilitation.  While rehabilita-
tion of 16 existing state sawmillai was accomplished early in the project, con-
struction of two new hardwood sawmills and their full operation were delayed
due to late and sporadic arrival of equipment, machinery and building
materials; insufficient electric power; and scarcity of trained operators.
The last two factors also account for non-introducrion of double shifts
envisag-d at appraisal for the new mills. Due to delays in construction of
new hardwood sawmills and non-introduction of double s*ift operation, sawn
hardwood supply to the domestic market was 15-20% lower than appraisal
expectations.  Moreovar, the quality of end-products of rehabilitated mills
has not improved significantly due mainly to poor sawmill design and green
lumber handling techniques.
12.       Okkyin Teak Mill Rehabilitation.  Though mill rehabilitation was
accomplished, the conversion rate (41X) remains low compared to that in
existing hardwood saw mills rehabilitated under the project (50-54X) and one
of the two new saw mills constructed under the project (601).  The quality of
end products also remains low.  The reasons for these are low quality of saw
logs received (even low quality teak logs have been exported leaving only vsry
poor quality logs for the teak mills), problems of log transfer, worn out head
rigs and wood flow patterns in resaw areas.  Like the twc new mills con-
structed under the project, the Okkyin mill has also not operated on a double
shift basis, as envisaged at appraisal, due to power problems and non-
availability of trained and experienced operators, the latter at least partly
resulting from the reluctance of TC to close some of the old sawmills and
relocate labor, which is considered politically undesi able.
13.       This project component had also included provIsioan of spare parts,
mainly circular saws, at cost, to 14 private (hire) saw mills operating under
contract for the TC. Due to the high cost of these spare parts, tha "hire"
mills preferred to continue working with the used state sawmill blades which
were available at lower cost. The reason for this is partly the low contract
price for milling which has not changed appreciably over the last seven
years.  Funds for the component were, therefore, not utilized.
14.       Plantation Progrm.  Both teak plantation and species trial
plantation acreages exceeded appraisal targets (Table 1). As envisaged at
appraisal, the major silvicultural method used was the well established
Taungya syste, employing the landless hill people who generally practice
shifting cultivation. They were given financial compensation and allowed to
use the land for subsistence crop production. The Taungya system, besides
achieving lower than anticipated cost of plantation establishment
(K 322/acre), had the advantage of settling the landless hill people who would
otherwise have continued the shifting cultivation practice, thus depleting
forest resources at an average of 2-3 acres per family per year. Each
plantation of 600-800 acres required some 400 workers (200 families) and
resulted in the saving of 400-600 acres from denudation and of 8-12 Mt of
recoverable wood per acre of plantation. Another significant achievement in



- x -
this component was the establishment of * teak seed orchard, which is expected
to provide quality seed for future plantations. The species trial plantations
have provided valuable information on appropriate silvicultural techniques,
spacing maodeLs and mixed stands which will help toriullate methods for estab-
lishment of future large-scale plantations. Besides the Taungya method,
mechanized methods for site preparation were also tested. However, as
mentioned earlier (para. 5), after mechanical preparation of one pilot area,
the experiment was discontinued since the available equipment did not have the
required handling characteristics and was not considered appropriate in view
of the prevailing fuel constraints.
15.       Rail Transport Rehabilitation.  The rehabilitation of log wagons and
locomotives was accomplished as anticipated at appraisal (Table 1) and helped
improve sawnwood and log transportation and reduce transportation costs.
16.       Technical Assistance and Trai3ins.  The technical assistL_ce and
overseas training components, financed by Covernment of Finland and UNDP/FAO
respectively, were implemented successfully. The technical assistance,
provided through a Finnish consultancy company, was satisfactory to COB. This
was in marked contrast to the disappointing experience with technical assis-
tance under Forestry I Project (Cr. 493-BA). Recruitment of all technical
assistance personnel through one company proved advantageous as it facilitated
coordination and comeunication. The impact of technical assistance and
training on project implementation and post-project continuation of activities
by trained personnel is considered to be substantial.
17.       Management and Bank Performance.  Throughout the project period,
management was of a high professional standard. Local and overseas training
is considered to have enhanced staff quality and helped sustain post-project
activities. Based on the experience gained under Forestry I project
(Cr. 493-BA), the project aimed at decentralizing the TC's logging and
sawmilling operations in the project area. Significant progress has been made
in this direction and the TC cocsiderably strengthened in its organizational
structure and performance. The perforwrnce of contractors and suppliers was
also satisfactory. However, considerable delays in the procurement of
materials and equipment occurred due to the cumbersome and slow procurement
procedures prevailing in the country. Preparation of unaudited and audited
reports als, suffered long delays due to work overloads in the TC, FD and
Central Auditor-General's office. IDA's supervision of the project was
generally satisfactory. Over the 7-year project period, a total of 12
supervision missions were carried out or approzimately two missions per
year. The frequency and skill mix of supervision missions were appropriate.
However, supervision missions had little success in resolving the issues of
low locaL timber prices (Government regulated) and the lack of efforts to
increse hardwood exports (see further pares. 21 and 23).
18.       Financil Viabiity.  Excluding costs and benefits from the Okkyin
teak sawmill (whic dis not located in the project area), rail transport
rehabilitation, teak plantation, technical assistance and overseas training
(grants), but including teak lo;s transferred to the Okkyin teak sawmill, the
estimated net income (after tax) of the East Pegu Yoma project is sufficient
to cover debt services and future replacement of equipmnt. Relative to



- xi -
appraisal estimates, the cash flow is less favorable due to: Mi) the higher
log and sawnwood production assumed in the 'without project' situation but
lower log and sawnwood production in the 'with project situation nad delayed
operation and high operating costs of the sawmills; (ii) a substantial duties
and taxes component in project investment and operating costs; and (iil) low
product prices for hardwoods (non-teak) (see further para. 21).
19.       Economic Imp.act.  The PCR reestimates in 1987 constant terms the
economic rate of return (ERR) for the East Pegu Yoma Project (over 100X),
Okkyin teak sawmill (over 50S), teak plantation (392) and the whole project,
excluding Okkyin teak sawmill, rail transport rehabilitation and technical
assistance and overseas training (over 1001). Compared to estimated
opportunity cost of capital of 102 in Burn, these are very attractive rates
of return. These ERR* are about the same as expected at appraisal except for
teak plantation which substantially exceeds the appraisal estimate of 142,
mainly due to about 401 higher acreage (Table 1).
B. Implementation Issues and Lessons Learned
20.       Though implementation issues were not serious enough to prevent the
project from being successful, they provide lessons for the design and imple-
mentation of similar projects in the future. These issues are discussed
below.
21.       Timber Pricing.  In early 1987, financial prices (Government-
determined) -ofVh-dwood logs and sawnwood in the local market were 25-50S of
the estimated economic prices, under the assumption that they could have been
converted to export grade. The divergence between financial and economic
prices has remained over the project period as financial prices have not been
adju,ted appreciably over this period. The low financial prices were a major
reason for the disinterestedness of private sawmills in the project component
for provision of spare parts (para. 13). The low product prices along with
high duties and taxes and high operating costs (mainly due to low conversion
rates), have also jeopardized the financial viability of sawmills (para. 18)
and will increasingly do so in future, if no price and quality adjustments
occur. The pricing issue is being addressed under Wood Industries II project
(Cr. 1444-BA). But 008 has not yet taken a decision to increase prices of
wood products.
22.       Kacroeconomic Issue.  The economy-wide problem of foreign exchange
scarcity was evidently underestimated at appraisal. The shortages of fuel and
building materials resulting from the foreign exchange problem considerably
affected the project and led to some design modifications (para. 5). The
post-project mainteance activities may also be adversely affected by the
continuis4 difficulty in obtaining spare parts.
23.       Hardwood Exports.  The project aimed to increase teak exports from
7,800 to 17,200 Ht p.a. and hardwood exports from less than 200 It to 35,000
St p.a. While teak exports have considerably exceeded apppraisal targets and
expected to stabilize at 38,000 It, hardwood exports were negligible and are
expected to stabilize at 6,000 It (logs only). The scope end time frame for
building up a hardwood export market have proven to be overoptimistic mowtly



- xii -
due to lack of quality improvements and to Governmnt's priority allocation of
resources to teak extractica Much more work needs to be done to build up
hardwood exports.
24.       Procurement.  Delay in tendering and procuring equipment, machinery
and building materials resulted in delays in construction of the two new hard-
wood mills and rehabilitation of the Okkyin teak mill. Procurement procedures
prevailing in the country were slow and cumbersom. The problem was aggra-
vated by the Government's unfamiliarity with the EEC tender rules for equip-
ment to be purchased under the EEC loan. In future projects, more lead time
should be allowed to deal with the complicated procurement procedures in the
country.
25.       Double Shift Operation.  At appraisal, it was itnticipated that the
two new hardwood sawmills and the rehabilitated Okkyin teak mill will operate
on double shift. However, this has not yet materialized due to insufficient
power and nonavailability of trained operators, the latter factor at least
partly resulting from the reluctance of TC to close some of the old sawmills
and relocate labor, which is considered politically undesirable. Thus higher
efficiency from double shift operation, at least in the new hardwood sawmills
which have a conversion rate of 60Z compared to only 50-54X for older mills,
has not been achieved and the sawnwood milling capacity and supply of sawnwood
in the domestic market continue to be inadequate.
26.       Forest Mester Plan.  Most of the forest inventory data is very old
and may not be reliable. Under the project, 008 was to prepare a program for
the development of a Forest Master Plan by December 31, 1980. However, this
had to be delayed pending the results of the National Forest Survey and
Inventory Project supported by FA0/IUDP. The inventory was expected to be
completed before the end of 1987. The completion of this inventory and
establishment of a forest management plan are high priorities.
27.       Environmental Issues.  No major negative environmental effects of
project activities have been identiffid. In fact, a positve environmental
impact of the project was brought about by the deployment of the hill people
in the Taungya plantation, eliminating shifting cultivation and the resultant
loss of forest, and replanting large areas of degraded reserve forests with
productive forests. However, some issues need further investigation under
future projects. The large tracts of land under monoculture plantations could
impose a future threat due to insect or disease attack and some concern has
also been eprcssed about possible erosion problems in teak plantatigns. A
significant feature of project implementation was the much greater raliance on
elephant/m_chanical syster of extraction than on fully mechanized extraction
envisaged at appraisal (para. 5). This was due to fuel shortages and a larger
than anticipated availability of elephants. While the mechanized system of
extraction along with use of road transport has undeniable economic advantages
over the elephant/float system in terms of reduced losses of logs in transit,
reduced tim between felling and milling and greater harvesting of non-teak
hardwoods, it can also have some negative environmental impact because
machinery damages the fore t more than elephants* To this extent, greater use
of elephants during projew implemntation had a positive environmental
imp$'Ž:t.



- xiii -
28.       However, *nviroumentalists have expressed concern that the use of
elephants in the fortfts is aggravating the decline in the total elephant
population in Burma._' Domsticated elephants do not breed very welL, and,
with a high proportion (estimated over 502) of the national herd in captivity,
this has a significant effect on the overall population dynamics.
Cnvironmentalists have suggested that elephant management should be reviewed
to determine, aong other things, ways in which the management of elephants in
captivity could be changed in order to encouragl,breedings and changes in the
capturing process which would reduce mortality.- Some work on this has been
done under an FAO project in Burma and further review deserves consideration.

BURMA
FORESTRY II (EAST PEGU YOIMA) - CR.949-BA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUNn
A. Introduction
1.1     The  Forestry  II - East Pegu Yoms Project for which Credit 949-BA
for USS35 million was approved on 9 August, 1979 and became effective on 20
December, 1979, was to be implemented over a five-year period. The project
complemented the Forestry I project, for which IDA had provided -a USS24
million credit In 1974. This second forestry project had been designed
mainly to increase teak and hardwood  <1, exports,  increase  the  domestic
market supply of sawn hardwood nd augment teak supplies through plantation
developent.
B. The ForestrY Sector
1.2      Climate  and  topography  have combined to give Burma a rich forest
cover containing many tree varieties. The forests of Burma cover about 96
million acres or 57% of the land area; of this soue 24 million acres are
reserved forest, half of which is teak reserve. Burma has eight forest
types, deciduous forest being the most Important, and there are over 120
com rcial hardwood tree species with teak, Kanyin, Pyinhado, Paduk and
Gurgin currently being the preferred species. Other forest types contain
bamboo and coniferous species. Currently about 35% of the  forest  resource
(15% of teak) is Inaccessible because of topography and security. Taungya
shiftint cultivation affects about 660,000 ac per year on  a 6-year  cycle,
however, controlled Taungya is used successfully to establish plantations
with the frmers intercropping between planted trees.
1.3     Burma has one of  the oldest  forest  departments  in  the  world
maging the forests. The first plantations were established prior to 1860;
the earlier plantations were for teak enrichment and have since reverted to
jungle status. Since 1962, about 2,000 ac of teak, 1,000 ac of Pyinhada and
3,000 ac of other species have been planted annually. Since 19690 some
20,000 ac of Eucalyptus have been planted for watitrshed protection nd
fuelwood. Until 1980 about 200,000 ac of plantations had been established,
50% of which was teak.
…-----------------------------------…
'1'      In this report, 'hardwood' refers to non-teak hardwood.



- 2 -
1.4     Although inventory data on forest stocking and yields  are  out  of
date, it is felt that the present rate of extraction can be sustained for
the next forty years. GOB has undertaken a forest inventory, the first
results of which are expected for the Pegu Yoma area during late 1987. In
1978, the annual output of teak was about 310,000 Ht, out of an AAC <,> of
400,000 Ht (300,000 Ht accessible areas). The annual teak output has been
substantially increased to 350,000 Ht in 1986 by reducing the girth at
breast height from 7' 6" to 6' 6'. Teak yield can also be increased for a
short period to eliminate a backlog of approximately 440,000 Ht of girdled,
unfelled trees. <2> The production of hardwood in 1978 was about 375,000 Ht
and increased to about 720,000 Ht in 1986, well within the range of 1.1
million Ht MAC.
1.5      The geography of Burma is dominated by the Irrawaddy River complex,
which drains two-thirds of the country, allowing access to many of the
forest areas and providing cheap, if slow, transport for rafting logs from
remote forest areas to Rangoon. Insurgency affects significant areas of
forests. Where insurgency has been controlled, for example in the project
area, rich natural forests are available for development.
1.6      The project area is located northeast of  Rangoon  on  the  eastern
slope of the Pegu-Yoma mountain range. The area extends from the Sitang
river in the east to the Pegu-Yoma Ridge in the west and from jus'L south  of
Pegu to north of Yamithin. It is roughly rectangular In shape, about 50 x
280 miles, centred around Toungou and measures about 140,000 squ&r. miles,
of which approximately 6,500 square miles (4 million acres) are reserve
forests. The topography of the project area ranges from gently undulating
hills along the foothills to ragged, steep terrain broken by many streams
and rivers. The elevatlon ranges from 400 to 2,000 ft. The soils in the area
are sandy loams with sery limited clay and laterite content making a poorly
structured base for ruad building. The climate is monsoonal with two
distinct seasons. The dry season lasts from November till April and has an
average monthly precipitation of 18 mm with a low0of 1 m in January, and an
average maximum temperature of 34 C, reaching 37;C in April. The wet season
from May to October has an average precipitation of 300 m   per  month  with
highs  of  833  m  in  July and August. The wet season temperature averages
around 30°C with a low maximum temperature of 29°C during August.
1.7      The climatic conditions are a predominant factor in the  extraction
process. Stumping (skidding) is done mostly in the wet and early dry season.
Green teak and hardwoods are transported in the dry season on feeder roads
to depots located along all-weather roads, for transportation in the wet
season to mills and distribution depots. The dry teak is floated along
streams t rivers for rafting.
1.8      The  project area has a transportation corridor running north-south
with the main Mandalay-Rangoon highway and railway. The Sitang River is also
an important transportation route for teak logs. East-west transportation is
negligible with about four access routes Into the forest at present. The
present project area population is about 2.5 million, with 10% living in the
c1l      Allowable annual cut.
(2>      Standing teak is girdled to kill it and allow natural drying while
standing. After three years, the teak is felled and skidded to
stream beds for floating/rafting to mills or depots.



-3-
urban areas of Pegu, Toungoo, Yadeshi, Lewe and Pyimnana; the rest  live  in
villages located mostly &long the transportation corridors, with some
scattered as far as the foothills. Although the forest areas are sparsely
populated, no problems have been encountered in obtaining labour for forest
operations.
1.9      The project area includes 6 of the 36 Divisions in Burma: north and
south Pyinmana; north and south Toungoo; and north and south Pegu. The area
has 20% of Burma's teak reserve forests and 17% of the reserved hardwood
forests; it contains about 20% of the standing teak and 21% of merchantable
hardwood inventories with over 4 ft girth at breast height (gbh). About half
of the reserve forests have never been felled for hardwood due to a lack of
road :nfrastructure. The area contains some 120 species of potentially
cornercial trees of which presently about 30 are utilised with a preference
for about 6 species.
C. PCR Information Source
1.10     Upon completion of the project, the Timber Corporation had  started
to gather data and information for the PCR preparation and an internal
document had been prepared summarizing the main project achievements. An
FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme mission visited the country in June
1987 to assist with the preparation of the draft. This report is based on
the findings of the mission and on project documents and reports prepared by
GOB  and  the  World  Bank  during  project   preparation,   appraisal   and
implementation.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification. Preparation and ADDraisal
2.1      The  Forestry  I  Project  (CR.493-BA),  signed  in  December 1974,
included Feasibility Studies for further forest development. These studies
identified a priority investment area in East Pegu Yoma, on the basis of
which GOB  prepared  a  project  Identification  report  in  1977,  covering
extraction, saw milling and plantation establishment for this area.
2.2      Project  preparation  was  undertaken  by  GOB  through  a  Project
Preparation Comuittee (PPC) comprising the Forestry Department (FO), the
Timber Corporation (TC) and the Ministry of Planning and Finance, supported
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Planning Department. An IDA and FAO/CP
mission visited Burma in May 1978 to assist the PPC with preparation work. A
further FAO/CP assistance mission in July 1978 reviewed preparation work of
Technical Annexes and provided an outline for the preparation of the final
report, which was completed in October 1978.



- 4 -
2.3      On receipt of the preparation report, an IDA mission appraised  the
project in December 1978 with no substantial changes in project concept and
design.
B. ProJect Description
2.4      The  project  which was to be implemented over a 5-year period from
1979 to 1984 In the East Pegu and Yoma districts pursued the following major
obJectives:
1) to I.gcrease teak and hardwood export revenues by increasing
projected teak log and sawnwood exports to 68,100 Nt and hardwood
exports to 42,400 Ht;
2) to increase the supply of sawn hardwood to the domestic market from
36,400 Ht to 105,300 Ht;
3) to augment teak supplies through compensatory plantations; and
4) to select suitable fast growing species and to establish land
clearing techniques for future large-scale plantation establishment
of fast growing species.
2.5      The project, was designed as the first phase of integrated forestry
and forest industry development in the area, and included the following
components:
a) setting up project units (PU) in the project area for extraction
and saw milling under the Timber Corporation (TC), and for
plantations under the Forestry Department (FO);
b) provision   of  new,  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  extraction
equipment which would increase annual extraction capacity by about
290,000 Nt and reduce teak log losses;
c) construction of roads to Improve access to currently Inaccessible
or poorly accessed forest areas;
d) upgrading the maintenance capacity for mechanical equipment in the
project area;
e) rehabilitation of existing hardwood saw mills and the construction
of new hardwood saw mills in the project area which would increase
existing annual capacity by about 21,000 Mt, add 24,000 Nt of new
single shift annual capacity and reduce timber wastage by improved
equipment and sawing techniques;
f) rehabilitation of the Okkyln teak saw mill in Rangoon, provision of
minor spares to other teak saw mills to provide teak saw milling
capacity to meet increased project output, and provision for minor
equipment to Timber Corporation Milling and Marketing Department;



g) planting 29,500 acres of teak;
h) large-scale trial plantations on about 6,000 acres for selection of
appropriate fast  growing  species  ard  the  development  of  land
clearing techniques;
1) upgrading 190 timber wagons and 5 locomotives on the Taungdwingyi-
Rangoon rail line to provide adequate unit-train timber transport
capacity to Rangoon;
J) provision of 16 man years technical assistance for extraction, saw
milling and plantations; and
k) provision of 137 man months for overseas and various local
training.
2.6      Project costs were estimated at US$66.4 million over a period of  5
years. TC and FO would be the main implementing agencies under the overall
coordination of NAF. The economic rate of return for the whole project was
estimated at over 100%.
C. Negotiations and Effectiveness
2.7      The Council of Ministers approved the Credit on 5 July,  1979,  and
the credit agreement was signed on 21 September, 1979. It was agreed at
negotiations,  that  the  credit  would  become  effective  whan   GOB   had
established the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and both the Timber
Corporation (TC) and Forestry Department (FD) Project Units (PU) had
appointed   Project   Directors  for  their  PUs, with  qualifications  and
experience acceptable to IDA. It was further stipulated that the EEC Special
Action Credit and Govermuent of Finland grant would have to be effective.
2.8      All  the above conditions were fulfilled in a timely manner and the
loan become effective on 20 December, 1979.
2.9      The tenure of the project was  for  five  years,  conmencing  from
FY79/8O to the end of September 1985, however, due to delays in procuremnt
and construction/rehabilitation of sawmills, the credit closing date was
extended for one year and IDA credit was closed on September 30, 1986. IDA
continue0 to disburse against eligible expenditure up to April 13, 1987 in
order to clear the disbursement backlog.



III.  IMPLEMENTATION
A. Start-uR
3.1      The project had a good start. Even prior to effectiveness, a number
of actions were initiated by GOO and the institutions involved, facilitating
tiely project start-up and subsequent implementation.
3.2      Under  the  project  two separate Project Units (PU) were to be set
up. The Timber Corporation was to set up one unit in the project area
responsible for extraction, sawmilling, road construction and maintenance.
This unit started activities in May 1980, i.e. the begilning of FY84/81.
3.3      The other PU was to be established by the Forestry Department  (FO)
and was responsible for the implementation of the plantation and species
trial components. This unit started Its activities immediately after credit
effectiveness, in December 1979.
B. Changes In Project
3.4      At appraisal, It was foreseen that mechanical harvesting  and  land
clearing would be a major component of the project and would be introduced
on a large scale. During project implementation, it was found necessary to
reduce the mechanical harvesting component mainly because of fuel shortages.
In addition, it was found that the combined elephant/mechanical method of
extraction was more cost effective. For this reason, less logging equipment
was acquired and the number of elephants Increased from 800 to 1,100 to
carry out all stumping. It was however necessary to increase the number of
wheeled loaders and 6.5 m ton trucks to achieve the set extraction targets.
3.5      It was also agreed with IDA to discontinue the-use  of  power  saws
after a short trial period because of the expense of operating and
maiftatsing these machines and the lack of skilled  operators.  The  use  of
crosso,. sms was found to be more economical and socially more acceptable.
3.6      One  sawmill location was changed from Kyungon to U Yin Daw because
of better site characteristics and improved access to road, rail and power
and proximity to a good labour source.
3.7      Mechanical  site preparation for plantations was tried on 75 ac but
further trials were postponed indefinitely because of high costs, fuel
shortages and lack of suitable equipment and trained operators.
3.8      The  all-weather  (Ai) road construction was not carried out to the
extent anticipated due to high cost of construction and reduced mechanical
extraction.



3.9      Provision of spare parts to private "hireu mills lid not take place
due to the comparatively high cost.
C. General ImDlementation Experience
3.10     Oespite a  good  start,  project  implementation  was  slower  than
anticipated  mainly  due  to delays In equipment procurement. With regard to
teak extraction, project implementation has been extremely successful
although mechanization was not introduced at the anticipated scale. Sawnwood
production  fell  short  of  expectations  mainly  due  to  delays  in   the
construction/rehabilitation  of  mills and the failure to introduce a double
shift operation. Hardwood extraction and production  targets  were  not  met
resulting   in   a   reduction  of  project  benefits  anticipated  at  full
development.
3.11     Throughout the project implementation period, and especially during
the last 2-3 years, project implementation suffered from diesel shortages.
Whereas the SAR anticipated a requirement of 1.6 million gallons per annum
at full development, in the last projecg year, total diesel allocation was
less than 1 million gallons.
3.12     The project substantially strengthened the  institutions  involved,
and   In   particular   assisted   the   TC  in  advancing  and  firming  up
decentralization efforts. Project management was generally satisfactory and
GOB support to the project was good throughout.
3.13     With  some  delay,  (see  Table 1) the project achieved most of Its
physical development targets as shown below:

0. Imp'ementation of Main ComPonents
Extractiun
3.14     Annual Timber production at full development was to  increase  from
130,000 Hoppis tons (Ht) to about 423,000 Ht. Of this, about 45,000 Nt would
be dry teak, 88,000 Ht green teak and the remaining 290,000 Ht commercial
hardwood.
3.15     It  was  foreseen  that  three  extraction systems would be used to
Increase the teak and hardwood production in the project area. The three
methods were:
i) Elephant/float - elephant extraction of dry girdled teak in steep,
remote areas to streams where it is floated in the wet season to
rivers for rafting to Rangoon.
ii) Elephant/mechanical  -  elephant extraction in the steeper areas to
skid or feeder roads from where the logs are forwarded to a central
loading area by skidders or hauled by light trucks to depots along
the all-weather roads.
iii) Mechanical - the use of mechanical logging  systems  using  crawler
tractors to bunch logs to be forwarded by skidders.
3.16     Mechanical logging was  intendedi to  decrease  the  dependence  on
animals  and to accelerate the reduction of teak 1inventory in the extraction
process. By adding the use of mechanical equipment to the logging system, it
was anticipated that the productivity per elephant would increase from 200
Ht to 350 Ht per year. Teak log production would increase from 60,000 Nt in
1979/80 to 132,500 Ht from 1981/82 onwards and hardwood log production was
to increase from 70,000 Ht in 1979/80 to 290,000 Nt  from  1982/83  onwards.
Increased teak productfon was to come from efforts to eliminate the backlog
of girdled unfelled teak and a temporary reduction in girth cutting limits.
Increased hardwood production was to be achieved through increased felling,
however; within the limits of the allowable annual cut.'
3.17     The extraction of logs was  accomplished  without  the  large-scale
introdueS1on  of  the  echanised  extraction system, as more elephants were
made ava4lable - 1,100 Instead of the estimated 800 - and the fuel shortage
becm   maore  critical. Equipment requirements were therefore lower and also
changes in the composition of the equipment component were necessary. Fewer
tractors were required, however, more front-end loaders were needed and more
6.5 m ton lorries were purchased. Twenty self-loading units were acquired
but the  units  were  found to be too light 'or the heavy logs. Sixty power
3aws were purchased but were found unsuitaole for the project due to
operational costs, lack of skilled operators and maintenance difficulties.
3.18     In  spite of  these  changes,  the  extraction  operation has been
generally successful and has, in the case of teak, actually achieved more
than the projected targets as shown below (sea also Tables 3 and 4):

3.19     Teak production was  higher  than  anticipated  and  peaked  during
1983/84 with 166,000 Ht extracted. Since then, due to the reduction of the
backlog of girdled teak and a resumption to logging 7' 60 gbh from the
reduced 6' 60 gbh used at the start of the project, production decreased o
96,56 lt in 1986/87. Production is estimated to stabilise at a constafvt
89,000 Ht from 1988/89 onwards.
3.20     Hardwood  log  production has been lower than expected since it had
to be adjusted to the available saw milling capacity.
3.21    At the beginning of the project, large inventories of hardwood logs
had   been   built   up  following  increased  logging  during  1979/80,  in
anticipation of early project start-up. These were only gradually reduced as
savilling capacity remained below expectations. Under normal circumstances,
some inventory is present at all stages of extraction operation, however,
logging targets were not adjusted quickly enough to take care of Inventories
in the system. Thanks to greater experience and better coordination, the
situation has shown gradual signs of improvement.

Road Construction
3.22     To  accomplish  the  intended  extraction  programme, the appraisal
report foresaw the need to enhance the road infrastructure. Three major road
designations were established:
a) All-weather roads (AWR) would be usable for at least 300 days per
year, would have log bridges and a minimum of 40 compacted
stone/laterite clay surfaces.
b) Extendri logging season roads (ELS) would have log bridges,
culverts and side drainage similar to the all-weather roads, but
with minimal surfacing, they wo:.ld be serviceable for only about
150 days per year.
c) Feeder roads, serviceable for 120 days and without bridges and only
minor culverts. These units generally have a one-year life span and
are mozIv constructed by the Extraction Department.
3.23     Constrv, > on  of  120  miles  of  all-w_atier  roads,  240 miles of
extended logging season roads and 1,900 miles of feeder roads were foreseen
at appraisal. In addition, 1,600 miles of roads would be maintained. This
basic infrastructure would facilitate the mechanical extraction of logs and
reduce reliance on the river rafting system, lowering costs due to smaller
inventories required. It would also reduce losses, as It has been estimated
that logs are in the river system for an average of three years during which
time average losses of 8% have been recorded.
3.24     Changes in the road construction programme have been  considerable.
This was mainly due to the unforeseen shortage of fuel supply, difficult
accessibility of road building material, and a scarcity of skilled labour.
Some 1,872 miles of roads were maintained and about 2,000 miles of feeder
roads have been built, 75% of which by the Extraction Department and the
remaining 25% by the Road Department. The increased feeder road system
reflects the greater use made of the 6.5 ton trucks to transport logs from
the jungle to depots. A summary of the road construction and maintenance
programme is given below (see also Table 1):
AWR, ELS and Feeder Road Construction
AWR         ELS           Maintenance         Feeder Roads
SAR           120         240              19600                1,900
Actual       18.5        45.5              1,872                2,005
3.25     To implement the road maintenance and construction  programme,  the
project procured equipment for two road building units in the project area.
No major changes were made in the equipment component. Two extra front-end
loaders were purchased to facilitate road material loading and hauling, and
two additional road rollers were provided for compaction. The project also
procured a rock crusher for the production of the required surfacing
material (see Table 2).



- 11 -
3.26    The rate of equipment utilisation has been  very  low  due  to  the
reduced  construction activities. Most of the time recorders show only 2,000
to 3,000 hours of equipment use after 4-5 years.
Mechanical Equipment Rehabilitation and Maintenance
3.27    The  SAR  foresaw  the  rehabilitation  of existing equipment which
still had an economic life of at least 5 years. In addition, the repair and
maintenance facilities in the project area were to be improved to secure
proper operatlin of the mechanical equipment. For this purpose, the existing
agency workshops and stores were to be upgraded, two additional ones were to
be constructed and a new central workshop and spare part store was to be
established. All workshops were established and supplied with tools,
equipment and spare parts as foreseen at appraisal and are now fully
equipped to carry out the required maintenance work.
3.28     Rehabilitation  of equipment took place over the project period and
totalled 167 units as foreseen at appraisal (see Table 1).
3.29    The maintenance programme and organization,  as  established  under
the project,  has  been working very satisfactorily and workmanship is of a
high professional quality. To sustain the operation it would, however, be
necessary to ensure the continuous supply of spare parts.
Rail Transport Rehabilitation
3.30    To  improve  sawnwood  and  log  transportation   and   to   reduce
transportation costs, the rehabilitation of 190 log wagons and repair of 5
locomotives were ircluded in the project. The Timber Corporation was to
purchase the required spare parts and provide them to the Burma Railways
Corporation which would carry out the repairs and be responsible for the
operation of unit trains. A total of USS1,427,000 had been allocated mainly
to provide spare parts for five locomotives, brakes and bearings for the
wagons.
l
3.31    BRC  carried out the required repairs and unit trains started their
scheduled service on the Taungdwingyi-Pyiruna-Rangoon  line  in  1981  (see
Table 7). Over the project period, a total of 194,000 Nt of logs were
transported. <1> Savings viz-a-viz road transport, were  calculated  to  be
K350 per ton or approximately K68 million (USS10 million) over the project
period.-

Hardwood Sawmill Construction and Rehabilitation
3.32     In order  to  increase  the  production  and  quality  of domestic
sawnwood as well as to improve the teak saw milling capacity, the project
foresaw the construction of two new hardwood saw mills as well as the
rehabilitation of 16 state saw mills and the provision of spare parts to
private (hire) mills.
3.33     Two  new saw mills were to be constructed with a 12,000 Nt capacity
each, increasing to 24,000 Ht on a two-shift basis. The saw mill complexes
had been designed allowing for future expansion to 20,000 Ht per shift and
the addition of air drying areas, dry kilns, dried lumber storage and a
moulding  mill. Construction of both mills was to comence In FY81/82 and to
be completed by FY82/83.
3.34     Due to late  and  sporadic  arrival  of  equipment,  machinery  and
building material, the first mill at Payagalay started operation In January
1983 and full production of 12,000 Ht was only reached by FY84/85, due to
insufficient electric power and a lack of trained operators. The Improved
design and equipment of this mill has resulted In the achievement of a
conversion factor close to 60% compared to only 50-54% for older mills.
3.35     The  second  mIll tzo be constructed at U Yin Daw (para 3.6) was not
completed until March 1986 and could not comence operations until early
1987 due to the lack of a transformer. However, operations had to cease
iediately thereafter as a storm caused severe damge to the mill building.
It is now expected that the sawing can recomence by August 1987.
3.36    As  indicated, it was anticipated that both new mills would operate
on double shifting and were to reach full capacity of 24,000 Ht by FY83/84.
Due to insufficient night-time power and a lack of trained operators, this
will not, however, be possible In the foreseeable future.
3.37     The rehabilitation of 16 existing state sawmills  was  accomplished
early in the project (1981/82) resulting in increased production, reaching a
maximum output of 113,000 tons in 1982/83 or 117% of projections. Production
dropped off mainly due to fuel constraints and has stabilised at 100,000 Ht.
During the project period a total of 682,500 Ht (109% of SAR) were produced
and conversion factors have remained constant at around 50-54%. End-product
quality, however, has not significantly improved due mainly to old and poor
saw mill design and green lumber handling techniques.



- 13 -
3.38     The project foresaw the provision of spare parts,  mainly  circular
saws, at cost, to 14 private (hire) saw mills operating under contract for
the Tiuber Corporation. Due to the high costs  of  these  spare  parts,  the
'hire' mills preferred to continue working with the used state saw mill
blades which were available at lower cost. The reason for this is partly the
low contract price for milling which has not changed appreciably over the
last seven years. Furthermore, spare part requirements decreased due to  the
closure  of  some  of  the less efficient private mills. For this reason the
component has not been utilised and funds have been '-eallocated.
Okkyin Teak Mill Rehabilitation
3.39     Although  not located in the project area, the project included the
rehabilitation of the Okkyin mill as its improvement was expected to have a
considerable impact on the export possibilities of teak sawnwood. After
project effectiveness, a saw milling expert drew up a rehabilitation plan
(1979/80) which recommended the installation of seven new band resaws and
sawnwood handling equipment. In addition, the mill's road infrastructure was
to be improved, new timber storage sheds and saw mill workshops to be built
and the main mill building was to be partly converted to accommodate the
improved   lumber   flow.   The   rehabilitation  was  expected  to  enhance
productivity from an estimated 20,000 Mt (27% of original design capacity)
to 50,000 Ht (67% of design capacity) per shift and to increase conversion
and product quality. Total cost of rehabilitation was estimated to be USS4.6
million.
3.40     Rehabilitation  of the mill commenced during 1982 and was completed
in 1985 resulting in a total expenditure of about USS3.7 million. It
succeeded in increasing throughput capacity which reached a maximum of
55,500 Ht in 1983/84 and has since dropped to 36,800 Ht in 1986/87, with a
projected production of 39,000 Ht from 1988/89 onwards. Although maximum
capacity is now 50,000 Nt, to maintain this rate of production would be
difficult with the problems of log transfer, worn out head rigs and wood
flow patterns in resaw areas. Another constraint is the quality of saw logs
received. Even low quality logs have been exported (40,000 Nt or 232% of
SAR), leaving only very poor quality logs for the teak mills. These and
other variables have been major factors In the low conversion return (41%)
and lower than expected quality. The Okkyin mill was scheduled to operate on
a double shift basis, however, this Is not expected to materialise in the
near future because of power problems and non-availability of trained and
experienced operators.
3.41     Some consideration  could  be  given  to relocating this mill to a
hardwood producing area and reconstructing as a hardwood mill when the other
teak mills in Rangoon reach full production capacity.
Plantation Prowrme
3.42     The  project  was  to  establish 29,500 acres of teak plantation in
order to expand the future resource base and to reduce dependency on natural
regeneration. At full development, the teak plantation programe was planned
to provide an allowable annual cut (AMC) of about 450,000 Nt, equal to the
existing AAC of teak in the whole of Burma. The teak plantations were to be
distributed evenly over the whole project area and the major silvicultural
ethod to be used would be the well established Taungya system, using the
landless hill people who generally practise shifting cultivation.

3.43     In addition, provision was made  for  the  establishment  of  6,100
acres of trial plantations for fast growing species and also to establish an
experiment with species mixes, spacing densities and mechanical preparation
of plantation sites which would be located at the two extremes of the
project area.
3.44     Furthermore, this component also provided for  tractors  and  other
machinery to establish and maintain plantations, for the construction of
field offices and residential compounds, and also for the provision of local
building materials for the Taungya villagers.
3.45     Teak  plantations.   The  Forestry Oepartment started operations in
September 1979 and completed the activity as foreseen during FY84/85. As
shown below, a larger area than anticipated at appraisal has been planted to
teak although the FD was only reimbursed by the project up to the appraisal
cost. The additional finance required was provided by FO from own resources
(see also Tables 8 and 15).

3.46     As anticipated, the landless hill  people  have  been  employed  to
establish  and  maintain  the  plantation  sites.  They were given financial
compensation and allowed to use the land for subsistence crop production.
Besides   resulting   in   lower   than   anticipated  costs  of  plantation
establishment (K322/acre), the use of the Taungya system had the advantage
of settling the landless hill people who would otherwise have continued the
shifting cultivation practice, thus depleting forest resources at an average
of 2-3 acres per family per year. Each plantation of 600-800 acres required
some 400 workers (200 fmilies) and resulted in the saving of 400-600 acres
from denudation and of 8 to 12 Ht of recoverable wood per acre of
plantation.
3.47     Other benefits derived from the teak  plantation  programme, which
were not anticipated at appraisal, were the reduced loss of marketable
trees, potential pole sales from the first two thinnings and post and log
sales from the third and fourth thinnings (see Table 16 and Attachment I).
Furthermore, a teak seed orchard was established to obtain a superior seed
source from selected (plus) trees. This orchard is expected to have an
appreciable  impact  on  the  availability  of  quality  seed   for   future
plantations.
3.48     The  benefits  of large-area monoculture plantations should however
be carefully monitored for environmental effects such as possible erosion or
potential insect or disease epidemics.

FY79/80 and planting was successfully completed in FY84/85, achieving 113%
of the appraisal target as shown below (see also Table 8).

3.50     The  programne was executed in cooperation with the Forest Research
Institute, planting mostly indigenous fast grnwinn rnuueroial species with
the aim of testing appropriate silvicultural techniques, spacing models and
mixed stands. These trials have provided valuable information and are
helping to formulate methods for the implementation of future large-scale
plantations. However, no conclusive data are yet available on which future
species mix or spacing can be based.
3.51     It was foreseen that, besides the use of the Taungya method for the
establishment of plantations, also mechanised ethods would be tested for
site preparation. However, only one pilot area has been mechanically
prepared. It was found that the available equipment did not have the
required handling characteristics and was not appropriate in view of the
prevailing fuel constraints. The experiment was therefore discontinued.
Office and Comnunication Facilities
3.52     In   order   to   provide   the  necessary  accommodation  for  the
decentralised  administration  of  the  project  under  the  PU  (TC),   the
construction of one administrative building, the extension of the existing
headquarters in Toungoo, housing for senior staff and upgrading of the
facilities in the six agency offices was foreseen. In addition, offices and
Staff hmsirng were to he orovided for the  two  new  %a&  mills  constructed
under the project. Also, the FO Project Unit was to he provided with office
facilities and staff quarters.
3.53     The TC administrative offices and quarters were constructed  during
1980/81 and the remaining buildings were mainly completed by 1985/86. The FO
building programme was completed during the project period with major works
during 1979/80 and 1981/82. Out of a planned 669 units, only 273 were
constructed. This was considered to be sufficient for project needs as some
buildings were transferred fro, other divisions.
3.54     In order to facilitate com unicatlons, the SAR foresaw the purchase
of radio transmitters. The TC procured 8 sets and Installed two 100 watt
units in Rangoon for use by the Timber Corporation and the Project Unit. The
Toungoo and Pyirmana offices were provided with 25 watt units. The remaining
four 25 watt units were sent to other projects where comunication
difficulties were more critical.

Technical Assistance and Train1nq
3.55    The  appraisal  report  identified  the  need  for managerial  and
technical level assistance and training to improve the utilisation of new
and existing equipment and make future development in the area self-
sustained. The total cost of the project's technical assistance and overseas
training component had been estimated at US$2 million of which USS0.4
million would be in local currency. Foreign exchange costs of about USSO.2
million were earmarked to cover 137 man-months of overseas training for TC
and FO personnel. These funds were provided as a grant under an UNDP/FAO
project (see Table 9).
3.56    After  the  appointment  of  a  technical  assistahce  coordinator,
responsible to the project steering committee (PSC), the training programme
was successfully launched and a total of 42 people were sent abroad under
the external training progra  e.
3.57    Sixteen  man-years  of expatriate consultancy assistance, amounting
to USS1.4 million, were provided within the framework of the project under a
grant agreement between GOB and the Government of the Republic of Finland.
Out of these, assistance to TC amounted to 13.5 man-years in the fields of
workshop engineering, mechanic training, as well as logging and saw milling
engineering. Timber  Corporation  management  received  further   technical
assistance to improve management accounting and the management information
system. The Forestry Department utilised a total of 2 man-years in the
fields of silviculture and land clearing operations.
3.58    The  actual  TC  consultancy  appointments,  starting and finishing
dates are listed below:

3.59    The expatriate technical assistance was provided through a  Finnish
corisultancy  company  to  the  entire  satisfaction  of  GOB.  It has proven
advantageous to recruit all technical assistance personnel through one
company thus facilitating communication and coordination. Benefits from both
the training and technical assistance progra_es were  substantial.  Project
start-up and implementation has been facilitated, the quality of existing
manpower enhanced and an additional cadre of well trained personnel built up
to secure proper continuation of activities even after the closure of the
project.

E. ProJect Costs. Financino and Disbursement
ProJect Costs
3.6C     Total project costs  were  estimated  at  K578.9  million  (USS86.4
million) including foreign exchange costs of K140 million (US$20.9 million)
and duties and taxes of K105.9 million (US$15.8 million). Excluding
technical assistance and training, about K495.1 million and K70.4 million
were estimated for TC and FD respectively. Tables 10 and 11 present actual
project expenditures and a comparison between project cost estimates at
appraisal and actual costs. Actual project costs were K480 million, or 83%
of the appraisal cost estimates. Major factors contributing to lower costs
were mainly reduced procurement of logging and road construction equipment
and spare parts, reduced road construction and maintenance, deletion of the
rehabilitation of private sawmills and local consultant components, and non-
utilisation of the unspecified fund provided to meet physical and price
contingencies. The low procurement of equipment resulted In direct savings
on duties and taxes of about K35 million (USS4.5 million). Total savings in
the project were about K115 million (USS15 million). In terms of US dollars,
project costs were 62.4 million, or 72% of the project costs estimated at
appraisal. Project costs were much lower due to the above reasons and the
devaluation of the Kyat by about 13% during the project implementation
period.
Financing and Disbursement
3.61     Total  external financing was estimated at USS44.6 million to cover
100X foreign exchange costs (excluding reserve procurement of US$5.1 million
which would be procured locally and financed by GOB), or 68% of total
project costs net of taxes and duties. The appraised and actual financing is
shown In Table 12.
3.62     The  actual total external financing was US$32.5 million, or 79% of
total project costs net of taxes and duties (USS40.9 million). GOB's
contribution was US$29.9 million, or 48% of total project costs, which was
higher than appraisal estimates (24%). IDA and EEC financing was only 71%
and 68% respectively of the total estimated credits, while the grant from
Finland was 43% higher than the estimates and the grant from UNOP was fully
util1sed.
3.63     IDA's  disbursements  were  slow  during  the  early  years  of the
project, while EEC's disbursements lagged two years behind schedule. Delays
In  the  procurement  of  equiprent  and the recruitment of consultants were
major reasons. Total disbursements as of 30 June, 1987 were as shown below:

/  Insignifi cant.
F. ComPliance with Covenants
3.64     GOB  complied  with  most  covenants  in a timely manner. Only with
regard to the preparation of unaudited and audited reports (Section 4.01C of
Development Credit Agreement) delays of over 2 years were encountered.
According to Section 4.04, GOB was to prepare a programme for the
development of a Forest Master Plan by 31 December, 1980 and promptly
thereafter discuss the contents of the programme with IDA. The preparation
of such a Master Plan, however, had to be delayed pending the results of a
Forest Inventory Project under FAO. The inventory is now expected to be
completed in fall 1987 and only then a new management plan can be
established.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
A. Intended Impact
4.1      The  project aimed to increase teak exports from 7,800 to 17,200 Nt
per annum and hardwood exports from less than 200 Ht to 35,000 Ht per annum.
In addition, the supply of sawn hardwood to the local market was to increase
from approximately 35,000 to 105,000 Nt per annum. Compensatory teak
plantations of approximately 29,500 ac would be established to reduce
dependency on natural regeneration and augment future teak supply. Trials
with fast growing species and mechanical land clearing would provide the
required experience for the selection of suitable species and for future
large-scale plantation establishment.



- 19 -
4.2      It  was  anticipated  that  about  1,700  landless  farmers   would
participate In plantation establishment and maintenance under Taungya
cultivation. This would increase the annual income of each Tauhgya family
from K1600 per year to K3000.
B. Incremental Exports
4.3      Teak wood production increased from the estimated 80,000 Ht in  the
'without project' situation to 128,000 Ht in 1985/86 with a maximum of
165,900 Ht in 1983/84. In 1986/87, production decreased drastically and is
expected to stabilse at 89,000 Ht due to the decline in the standing dry
teak inventory as the MAC is being reduced in view of the return to the
original diameter cutting limits of 7 ft 6 inches gbh.
4.4      Of  this  total  teak production, already in the first project year
21,000 Ht were exported, exports increased to 53,700 Ht in FY84/85 and
subsequently levelled off at 38,000 Ht in FY88/89.
4.5      Teak  export  revenues  at the annual extraction level of 89,000 Ht
are estimated at about K260 million (USS40 million)  per  annum  at  present
prices, of which K210 million (USS32.5 million) or 80% would be from the
export of 30,000 Ht logs, and KS0 million (USS6.5 million) or 20% from the
export of  8,000  Ht  sawnwood.  This represents an annual Incre.nta. teak
export revenue of about K95 million (US$15.5 million) over the assumed
export revenues of K139 million (USS14.6 million) from 7,800 Ht logs and
13,500 Ht sawnwood in the 'without project' situation.
4.6      Hardwood production increased in the early stages of the project to
a maximum of 186,500 Ht in 1982/83 and stabilised around 160,000 Ht (Table
14). Although the SAR anticipated that approximately 35,000 Ht would be
exported annually, exports were negligible. Annual incremental hardwood
export revenues at the annual extraction level of 160,000 are estimated to
be marginal at only K13 million per annum (USS2 million), derived mainly
from the export of 6,000 Ht logs. In this respect, the project failed to
achieve its impact on export revenues.
C. Sawnwood Production
4.7      Sawn hardwood supply to the domestic market increased substantially
as a result of the project, however, it never achieved SAR projections.
Already in 1980/81, sawnwood out-turn reached 76,700 Ht and peaked in
1982/83 with 89,100 Ht (see Table 5). The main reason for the persistent
shortfall of about 15% in supply of sawnwood can be attributed to the delays
in the construction of new mills and postponed double shift operation.
Therefore the supply of sawnwood in the country rnains critical.



- 20 -
IX  Pan"'A _    '. _w<;uction
4.8      The  establishmernt  of         pl Fitit'`icns  progressed  better  than
anticipated, and exceeded the 29,50W c pl is.nd to be planted by about
11,000   ac.  ine  imaintenance  of  these  il;^u- -ons  require  substantial
financial and manpower resources  (Tables  vS  and  16)  but  Government  is
committed to provide the rei7uired 1ro'A. a for the continuation of the
programme.
4.9      At this stage, it  is  too  early  to  assess  the  impact  of  the
plantation   programme   in   full.  However, the  plantations  which  were
established at the beginning of the project show already promising financial
results. A pilot sales operation of the poles of the first thinning was
succesfully carried out in 1986/87 and resulted in the sale of 5,000 Nt
valued about K6.5 million (US$1 million).
E. Trial Plantations
4.10     The trial plantations have provided valuable  information  and  are
helping   to  formulate  the  methods  of  implementing  future  large-scale
plantations. However, no final data are available yet. Mechanical land
preparation has been discontinued.
F. Technolocical Chances in Logaing and Milling
4.11     The project provided for the incorporation of mechanical extraction
and iransportation of logs to reduce losses and the reliance on animal
power. These technological changes were not completely achieved, partly due
to fuel shortages and a larger than anticipated availability of elephants.
Thus a greater than expected use was made of the elephant/mechanical system,
using small 6.5 ton lorries to transport logs to depot areas.
4.12     The  use  of  self-loading  equipment was not successful due to the
lightness of the units. The project also encountered problems with the road
building   programme,   limiting   the   need  for  the  more  sophisticated
technological concepts proposed in the extraction process.
4.13     The improvement of sawuilling technology  through  construction  of
new mills achieved the goals set and the conversion went up from average 51%
in the old mills to 61% in the new mills.



- 21 -
G. Environmental Effects
4.14     The major environmental impact of the project was brought about  by
the deployment of the hill peonle in the Taungya plantation, eliminating
shifting cultivation and the  resu tant  loss  of  forest.  Large  areas  of
degraded reserve forests have been replanted with productive forests.
However, the large tracts of land under monoculture could impose a future
threat due to insect or disease attack and some concern has also been
expressed about possible erosion problems in the teak plantations.
4.15     No lasting negative environmental effect could be identified  as  a
result of project activities.
H. Employment
4.16     The Incremental employment provided by the project was expected  to
amunt to 3,000 posts. Due to the lesser than anticipated employment under
the forest component, additional posts created are now estimated to be 2,200
- 2,400.
4.17     The  land  preparation,  planting  and  plantation  maintenance was
expected to provide employment on a more permanent basis for about 1,700
Taungya  farmers  in  the  various  areas. The response to this approach was
better than foreseen and over 2,000 are presently engaged in these
activities.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND OEVELOPMENT
A.  Implementino Aoencies
5.1      s  all  extraction and plantation activities were to take place in
reserved forest areas, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) was
given   responsibility   for   project   implementation,   except   for  the
rehabilitation of the rolling stock to be carried out by BRC.
5.2      Under MAF, the Timber Corporation carried out the extraction,  road
building   and  saw  milling  components,  whilst  the  Foreistry  Oepartment
implemented the teak plantation ond trial component. As foreseen at
appraisal, a Project Steering Comittee (PSC) was set up to coordinate
activities mong these agencies and with other agencies and Ministries as
required.



- 22 -
5.3      For the purpose of project implementation, the  Timber  Corporation
established a Project Unit (PU) within Its headquarters in Toungoo. As
foreseen, the PU (TC) had six Department Heads, viz. Extraction, Roads,
Workshops, Milling and Marketing, Finance and Accounts, and Internal Audit.
All Departments, sections and agencies were established as designed and only
minor staffing problems were encountered throughout implementation.
5.4      The Forestry Department also established a PU with its headquarters
In Toungoo to execute  the  p'antation  and  species  trial  components.  As
foreseen, plantat;ons were established and handed over by the PU to the FD
after a period of five years.
5.5      Throughwut  the  project  period,  management   was   of   a   high
professional standard and on a continuous basis. Furthermore, staff quality
of the TC and FO was enhanced at managerial and operational level through
local and overseas training. All this has greatly contributed to the
continuing success of the project.
5.6      Based on the experience gained under Forestry I, the project  aimed
at decentralising the Timber Corporation's logging and district sawmilling
operations in the project area. Within the framework of the decentralised
project, however, strong coordination was required which had been carried
out by the Project Coordinating Comittee.
5.7      Coordination  between  the  various  departments/agencies  improved
considerably and resulted in more streamlined operations. The supply of logs
to end-users was executed in a more systematic way and logging was adjusted
to processing capacities and inventories which had been building up at the
end of each logging season.
5.8      Through the project, especially the  Timber  Corporation  has  been
considerably strengthened in its organizational structure and performence
and has taken a considerable step ahead in further decentralising its
operations. Within the overall framework of the Timber Corporation, the PU
(TC) operated successfully in an autonomous way throughout the project
period.
8. Contractors and Suppliers
5.9      The  performance  of  contractors  and  suppliers  was   considered
satisfactory. Minor delays and deviations from specifications occurred in
many Instances, but did not affect project lmplementation as a  whole.  Only
in the case of the U Yin Daw sawmill did the slow supply of roofing material
delay the completion of the building.
5.10     Considerable delays in the procurement of  material  and  equipment
occurred, especially at the beginning of the project, due to the cumbersome
and slow procurement procedures prevailing in the country. The problem was
further aggravated in the case of equipment to be purchased under the EEC
loan, as procurement had to be carried out under EEC tender rules,  limiting
also the number of suppliers to EEC member countries.



- 23 -
C. RePorting and Accounting
5.11     Quarterly and annual reports were  prepared  in  time,  within  two
months after the end of each fiscal year. Special accounts were prepared in
line with IDA's required  format  and  maintained  properly  by  the  Timber
Corporation and Forestry Department. However, the preparation of unaudited
and audited reports suffered long delays due to work overloads in the TC, FD
and Central Auditor-General's office. The unaudit2d reports were completed
between 8-25 months after the end of each fiscal year, while the audited
reports were completed 12-29 months after the end of each fiscal year.
VI. IDA PERFORMANCE
6.1      The basic concept of the project, i.e. to enhance teak and hardwo-d
exports and the supply of sawnwood to the local market through the
improvement   of   logging  and  sawmilling  infrastructure  facilities  and
equipment,  was  sound.  Also,  the  need  to  establish  large-scale   teak
plantations and carry out species trials had been well identified.
6.2      Certain  assumptions  which  at the time of appraisal were based on
sound judgement, however, turned out to be too optimistic. Thus the
significant  change  from  an  extraction system largely depending on animal
power to a mechanised one, did not take place on a large scale partly due to
fuel constraints which were not foreseen at appraisal. Also the scope and
time frame for' building up a hardwood export market have proven to be over-
optimistic mostly due to lack of quality considerations and partly due to
Government's priority allocation of resources to teak extraction.
6.3      Supervision of the project from IDA 'was regular and mostly by staff
from headquarters. Over the 7-year project period, a total of 12 supervision
missions were carried out. In general, the period between missions did not
exceed 7 months. One large gap, however, occurred between May 1980 and March
1981 which might have contributed to slower than expected ordering of
equipment.
6.4      Overall,   IDA's   supervisory   effort  was  satisfactory  and  of
sufficient cStinuity, however, more attention should have been giqvn to the
issue of low local timber prices and the lack of efforts to enhance hardwood
exports.

VII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Financial Analysis
Extraction and Hardwood Sawmills
7.1      Actual  and estimated operating income statements were prepared for
the 16 State-rehabilitated hardwood sawmills, 14 hired private hardwood
sawmills, two new hard nod sawmills and a consolidated income statement for
the project (East Pegu Yoma) as shown in Tables 17-21. Sawnwood production,
sale volumes and prices are given in Tables 5 and 6.
7.2      The  hardwood sawmills have been operating on a one-shift basis and
their out-turns have been low, ranging between 50% and 53%. For both the
State and hired private sawmills, about 90% of the sawnwood was sold to
mainly Government agencies and some private individuals. The remaining 10%
was transferred for local sales at the Timber Corporation's selling depot
located outside the project area. For the two new harlwood sawmills about
one-third of sawnwood was for local sale, two-thirds for transfer and only
100 Ht for annual export. Present prices of sawn hardwood for local sale and
transfer are low and estimated at K967/Ht and K985/Ht respectively.
Operating costs have been high and accounted for about 80-90% of the total
operating revenues mainly because of low out-turns. Due to low prices for
local sales and transfer and high operating costs, the estimated operating
incomes over the project period were low, but satisfactory with an average
of K7.4 million per year for the State sawmills and K4 million per year  for
the hired private sawmills, except for the operating income of the new
sawmill which was estimated to generate only KO.6 million per year. However,
under GOB's heavy taxation <1> levied on the Timber Corporation's operations
which is as high as 50% of the operating Incomes, the estimated net income
after taxes for all sawmills was reduced by 50% to about K3.8 million, K2
million and KO.3 million respectively.
7.3      The financial analysis of the East Pegu Yoma Project excludes costs
and benefits from the Okkyin teak sawmill, wagon rehabilitation (BRC), teak
plantation (FO), technical assistance and overseas training (grant from UNOP
and GOF) but includes teak logs transferred to the Okkyin teak sawmill. The
estimated net income of the project, after tV., Is satisfactory and averaged
about K79 million annually over the project period which is sufficient to
cover debt services and future replacement of equipment (Table 24). The high
net Income of the project is contributed mainly by the sale of logs which
generate about 80% of the total project revenues, of which about 65% is from
teak log export, 12% from local sales and transfer of teak logs and 3% from
hardwood log export and local sales. Tables 22 and 23 present the actual and
estimated sources and applications of funds and balance sheet summary of the
project which indicate a satisfactory financial status. Current ratio has
<1'      See relevant Tables 17-19 and 21. Including export produce
equalization fund, commodity and service taxes and state's
contribution.

remalned high between 3.1 to 6.9 times during FY80/81 to 87/88 and is
expected to continue due to the high log inventory during April and May of
each year which is the peak logging season. Debt service coverage ratio is
high and estimated to be about 20 times over the project period.
7.4      The calculations of the internal rates of return  (IRR)  have  been
carried  out in 1987 constant prices. The past project Investment costs were
adjusted to 1987 prices by GOP deflator factors. All equipment replacements
are based on an assumed economic life of 7.5 years. Extraction and
saweilling costs are based on the 1987 estimated unit costs. The estimated
86/87 prices of logs and sawnwood are based on actual FY85/86 prices (Table
20). The IRR, calculated over 30 years (Table 24), is re-estimated at 9K
compared   with   14%   estimated   at  appraisal.  Major  negative  factors
contributing to a lower IRR are the higher log and sawnwood production
assumed  in  the  'Without  project'  situation  but  lower log and sawnwood
production in the 'with project' situation and delayed  operation  and  high
operating costs of the sawmills.
Okkyin Teak Sawmill Rehabilitation
7.5      Tables 25 and 26 present the income statement  and  calculation  of
IRR for the Okkyin teak sawmill. The sawmill has been operating on a one-
shift basis with throughputs between 35,000 - 55,000 Ht per year during
FY80/81 - 86/87 and is expected to stabilise at 39,000 Ht per year in
FY87/88  and  thereafter,  with  a  low  average  out-turn  of  about   40%.
Approximately 20X of total sawnwood is for local sales, 65% for export and
the remaining 15X for transfer to other Timber Corporation selling depots
for local sales. The operating ratio (before taxes) is satisfactory
averaging between 50-65%. The operating income before taxes averages about
K30.8 million per annum over the project period and the net income (after
taxes) is estimated at K5.4 million per annum. The re-estimated IRR,
calculated in 1987 constant prices over 15 years, is reasonable at 12X.
B. Economic Analysis
7.6      A re-estimation of the economic  rate  of  return  (ERR)  has  been
carried out for the East Pegu Yoma Project, the Okkyin teak sawmill, the
teak plantaion and the whole project on the basis of 1987 constant prices.
The past project investment costs, net of duties and taxes, were adjusted to
1987 constant prices by using GOP deflator factors. Foreign exchange costs
were valued at the official exchange rate of USS1 * K6.5 and local costs
were converted into border prices by the standard conversion factor (SCF) of
0.80. Costs of extraction and sawmilling are based on current 1987 prices,
as actual prices for earlier project years were not available. The financial
unit costs were then adjusted to economic costs by using SCF and several
specific  conversion  factors  (CF)  as  shown  in  the   relevant   tables.
Replacement of equipment is based on the assumed economic life of 7.5 years.
The  economic  prices  for  export   sales   are   based   on   the   actual
average/weighted average f.o.b., Rangoon projected for 1987, while economic
prices for local sales including transferred log and sawnwood are based on
the world price projected. for 1987 by the World Bank for similar timber, as
shown in Table 27. The assumed, actual and projected log and sawnwood
production and sale volumes in the without and with project situations are
presented in Tables 3 to 6.



- 26 -
7.7      The  analysis  periods  based  on  the  assumed  economic  life  of
buildings and production cycle vary from 10 years for the existing hardwood
sawmills, 15 years for the Okkyin teak sawmill, 25 years for the newly
constructed hardwood sawmills to 65 years for teak plantations. However,
since the discount value beyond Year 50 is insignificant, the analysis of
the teak plantation has been carried out over 40 years excluding the final
benefit from log production during Years 60-65. Tables 28 to 31 present cost
and benefit streams for the individual components and the East Pegu Yoma
Project. The results of ERRs are summarised below:
ERR (X)

2/ Excluding benefits from Taungya and final teak log
production (Years 60-65).
7.8      The re-estimatea ERRs  are  all  very  favourable  compared  to  an
estimated opportunity cost of capital of 10%. Factors contributing to higher
ERRs are significant incremental log and sawnwood production during the
early project period (Years 1 to 6) and reduced project costs. Since the ERR
of the teak plantation alone is high, it is unnecessary to carry out
separate analyses which include benefits from Taungya and final teak log
production. Costs of technical assistance and overseas training were also
small, and were therefore excluded from the analysis.
VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
8.1      The project aimed at the development of  an  integrated  system  of
extraction, saw milling and marketing to secure an increase in teak and
hardwood export revenues and enhance the local market supply of sawn wood.
Teak and trial plantations were to be established to secure and broaden the
teak production base and develop the supply of other hardwoods. Although
with  some  delay,  the  project  achieved  most of Its physical development
targets.
8.2      Hardwood extraction fell short of expectations  due  to  the  lower
than expected saw mill capacity and the lack of hardwood log exports. The
distance of the road construction sites from 2vailable road building and
surfacing material and the fuel supply constraint impeded the planned
construction of AW and ELS roads. Constraints in tendering and procuring



- 27 -
equipment,   machinery   and   building  materials  resulted  in  delays  in
construction of the two new hardwood mills and the rehabilitation of the
Okkyin teak mill.
8.3      Under  the project, decentralised logging and sawmilling operations
had been established thus allowing for greater flexibility. Within the
overall TC operation, project management was given more independence;
financial autonomy, however, remained limited. Following the success of the
decentralisation   efforts,  TC  is  now  comintted  to  decentralising  its
operations on a nationwide basis.
8.4      During the project period, extraction  of  teak  and  hardwood  was
considerably enhanced, from about 80,000 Ht and 85,000 Ht to about 160,000
Ht and 186,000 Ht. respectively. This incremental extraction has also
significantly augmented export revenues from teak, from K166 million (USS26
million) per annum to K260 million (USS40 million) per annum. The project
has also improved sawmilling capacities and conversion factors, but has
failed to have an impact on the quality of sawnwood. It only partly achieved
its objective to enhance the availability of sawnwood for the local market
as the supply increased only to about 85,000 Ht per annum against SAR
estimates of 105,300 Ht; the project did not manage to promote hardwood
exports.
8.5      A  greater  than  estimated  average  of   teak   plantations   was
established, potential production of poles and posts was estimated at 1.48
million Ht and 2.43 million Ht of logs over the production cycle. Two
thousand landless farmers have also benefitted from the plantation programme
and Taungya cultivation has provided higher annual income at about K5,000
per family compared with about K3,000 estimated at appraisal.
8.6      Total  project costs were only K480 million (USS62.4 million or 83%
of appraisal estimate), due mainly to a reduction in procurement of logging,
workshops and road building equipment and spare parts as well as a reduced
road building programme.
8.7      Because of low out-turn which directly caused high sawmilling costs
and the prevailing low prices for local sales and transfers, the operating
incomes uefore taxes of all sawmills have been low, but satisfactory
averaging between K4 million and K7.4 million per annum, except for the
newly cbnstructed hardwood sawmills which generated only about KO.6 million
per annuu. Moreover, under GOB's heavy taxation, the net Incomes after taxes
of a,l sawmills were reduced by 50%. Due mainly to the considerable increase
in teak log sales and exports, the estimated net incomes of the East Pegu
Yoma ProJect are satisfactory and, with an average of K79 million per annum,
are sufficient to cover all investments, debt service and future equipment
replacement.
8.8      The re-estimated IRRs are 9% for the East Pegu Yoma Project and 12%
for the Okkyin's teak sawmill. Major negative factors contributing to the
lower IRRs are the higher log and sawnwood production assumed In the
'without projectm situation as well as delayed construction and high
operating costs of the sawmills. The re-estimated ERRs, however, are very
favourable ranging from 39% for the teak plantations, over 50% of the Okkyin
teak sawmill to over 100% for the East Pegu Yoma Project and the whole
proJect.

Lessons Learned
8.9      From the  experience  gained  during  project  implementation,  the
following  lessons  could  be  learned  for the design and Implementation of
similar projects in the future:
a) The project's approach to  integrate  logging  and  sawmilling  has
resulted in more streamlined operations and in a better adjustment
of supply to demand.
b) The establishment of Project Units has proven to be a well  working
concept,  enhancing  flexibility  and  further  promoting  on-going
decentralization efforts.
c) The interdependance of different technical activities,  within  the
same unit provided a strong staff motivation to work towards the
common goals and resulted in a good staff orale. The  success  of
the project can be greatly attributed to these factors.
d) At  appraisal  more  attention should have been given to the soc10
economic implications of the intended large-scale introduction of a
fully mechanised logging system.
e) More detailed information on the availability of road building
material and transport distances Involved should have been sought
at appraisal.
f) Already   at  appraisal,  diesel  availability  was  precarious.  A
scenario,  assuming   further   restrictions   should   have   been
elaborated.
g) The introduction of double shift sawmilling was impeded by the
reluctance of TC to close some of the old saw mills and relocate
labour, which is considered politically undesirable.
h) Hardwood exports were not given the required attention. More
promotional work and quality improvement will be required.
1) More attention should also have been given to sawnwood pricing. The
Timber Corporation should urgently review the local sales and
transfer prices to reflect sawmilling costs and ensure that
sufficient incomes are generated to cover investnent. debt service
as well as future equipment replacement.
j) More lead time should have been allowed for tender formulation and
ordering of equipment given the complicated procedures in the
country.
