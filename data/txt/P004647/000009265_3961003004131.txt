MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE METROPOLITAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND ENEP'Y EFFICIENCY PROJECT
1.        I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
xecommendation on   a proposed  loan  to  the Metropolitan  Electricity
Authority, with the guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand, for US$109.0
million equivalent to help finance a Distribution System and Energy
Efficiency Project. Ths proposed loan would be for 17 years including four
years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.        Bakground.  The electric power sector in Thailand is served by
three utilities: (a) the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
(EGAT) which is responsible for generation and bulk power transmission; (b)
the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MUA) which is responsible for power
distribution in Metropolitan Bangkok; and (c) the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA) which is responsible for powtr distribution in the rest of
Thailand. The Bank's involvement in the Thai power sector has so far been
with EGAT and PEA only.
3.        Since 1987, Thailand has been experiencing an economic boom, with
GDP growth averaging 9X per annum. The outlook is for continued robust
growth over the next several years. The rapid economic growth has resulted
In a concomitant growth in power demand, averaging 152 p.a. in the past
three years. Demand for electricity is forecast to continue to grow at a
rate of about 8X p.a. through the 1990s. All three utilities are faced
with the task of meeting the rapid demand growth; MNA specifically, faces
the challenge of meeting the intensive power needs of the country's
principal administrative, commercial and industrial center of Bangkok,
where infrastructure is already under heavy strain.
4.        To meet the rapidly increasing demand for power, the Government's
sector strategy calls for: (a) a substantially increased program of
investments in the power sector; (b) involvement of the private sector in
funding part of the large power sector investments; (c) pricing of
electricity close to long run marginal cost; (d) a strong thrust towards
energy conservation; and (e) an increased emphasis on environmentally sound
and sustainable development.
5.        The  Government  has  taken  several  actions   towards  the
privatization of EGAT, notably the passing of an amendment to the EGAT Act
*          allowing EGAT to establish subsidiary companies, a portion of which would
later be sold to the public. EGAT has already created a subsidiary company
and is proceeding with the necessary next steps for future listing of the
company on the Stock Exchange. EGAT also expects to finalize contracts for
purchase of about 300 MW of power from private power producers by the end
of 1994. To facilitate private sector participation in MEA's operations,
the National Legislative Assembly has voted to amend the MUA Act to enable
MNA to establish subsidiary companies in such areas as maintenance,
construction and meter reading; a part of these companies could
subsequently be sold to the private sector. NUA will soon be urdertaking a
study to identify and evaluate possibilities to privatize specific segments



- 2-
of its operations which are not part of its core businet    which could be
operated more effectively by the private sector.  KEA as.  recognizes the
growing importance of environmental and safety aspects in the design of a
distribution system that would be supplying an increasingly congested area
of the country.   The proposed project Includes a study on enhancing
environmental and safety considerations in system design and operation.
6.        On the snvironmental front, the Government has recently passod a
new Act, the 'T"ihancement and Conservation of National Environmental
Quality Act,' which vests greater powers and responsibilities with the
National Environmental Board and recognizes the role of NGOs in
environmental management. The Act also establishes a Central Environmental
Fund for concessional financing of environment-related activities proposed
by private and public proponents. In the field of energy conservation, the
Government has recently passed the Energy Policy Council Act, which creates
a high-power Energy Policy Council to oversee and guide all energy-related
activities, and the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, which legislates
several energy conservation measures and establishes an Energy Conservation
Fund financed out of surcharges on petroleum and electricity.   The
Government has also approved a five-year Demand-Side-Management Master Plan
for implementation by the three Thai utilities, EGAT, MEA and PEA.
Successful implementation of this plan would lay the foundation for
efficient utilization of electricity in the country.  The Bank has been
actively engaged in the development of this plan and has been instrumental
in securing funds from the Global Environmental Facility in support of the
Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency* component of the proposed
project. This component was appraised in December 1'92.
7.       Rationale  for Bank  Involvement.    The proposed project  is
consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy, which has given
priority to lending for the energy and infrastructure sectors. Through its
sustained involvement over a number of years, the Bank has contributed
significantly to the development of a sound program of investments and
policies in the energy sector in Thailand. Not only has the Bank helped
finance the substantial investments required in the power sector. but Bank
advice and assistance have helped the Government address issues such as:
least-cost investment programs; energy pricing; and increasing emphasis on
environmental aspects.   Over the years, the Bank has helped in the
development of EGAT and PEA as competent, well-managed and financially
sound entities. Through its involvement with the Thai power sector, the
Bank has helped the Government formulate strategies to privatize specific
utility operations, and has worked with EGAT to prepare for its
corporatization and privatization. The proposed project would extend the
Bank's relationship to the remaining utility in the power sector. It would
contribute towards the funding of NEA's substantial 5-year investment
program, and enable the Bank to assist MEA with achieving its financial
targets, privatization objectives, and environmental and safety goals. The
Bank's involvement with all three power utilities is particularly important
at this stage as it would facilitate coordinating the joint efforts
expected of all three utilities in Thailand's Demand-Side-Management
Program.
8.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project
are: (a) to improve and expand the distribution system of NEA in order to
meet the expected rapid Increase in demand; (b) to sustain the efficiency
of MEA's operations in the face of a rapid increase in the scope and
complexity of its business; (c) to strengthen the utility's financial and



management information systems; (d) to irvestigate opportunities for
privatization of some of MEA's activities; (e) to incorporate increased
levels of safety and environmental acceptability in the utility's design
and operations practices; and (f) to introduce demand-side management
including the promotior of electricity energy efficiency in the Thai power
sector.
9.        Project Description.  The proposed project would h&ve two major
components:
I. Distribution System Improvement and Expansion, which would
cover FY1993 commitments for the expansion of MEAis distribution
system and would comprise: (1) construction of subtransmission
and distribution facilities including: (a) 230/69 kV transmission
substations and transmission lines; (b) 115 kV, 69 kV and 24 kV
transmission and distribution substations and associated lines;
(c) conversion from overhead to underground distribution in
heavily congested areas; and (d) miscellaneous equipment and
materials; and (2) three studies regarding: (a) formulation of
strategies for privatization of some of MEA's activities; (b)
design and implementation of subsystems in the integrate4
financial   and   management   infcrmation   system;   and   (c)
environmental and safety considerations in system design.
1I.  Prootion of Electricity Energy Efficienc. formulated with
the assistance of a UNDP-funded PRIF Study and supported by the
Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This would include the Five
Year Demand-Side-Management Plan, amounting to US$189 million,
approved by the Government for implementation by the Demand-Side
Management Organization being set up within EGAT. The savings
targets for the component are 1,427 GWh of electricity per annum
and 238 MW by the end of 1997. The component, which is described
in detail in Memorandum of the Director (MOD) number 11543-TH,
would have a four-pronged approach: (a) provision of user and
manufacturer incentives and consumer education to influence
practices and attitudes toward energy efficient technologies; (b)
development of efficiency standards to exercise control and
monitor efficiency improvements; (c) development and promulgation
of building and appliance codes to allow the enforcement of
minimum standards; and (4) continued pursuit of technological
improvements and their adaptation to Thai conditions.
Specifically, the component would consist of the following
elements: (a) creation of an organizational unit within EGAT to
plan, develop and implement a broad menu of DSM programs across
all sectors, along with providing for the required staff training
and capability building; (b) development and implementation of
technological  and  market  intervention  strategies  in  the
residential, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy of
Thailand; (c) development of funding and financial mechanisms for
assuring market acceptance of the various energy efficiency
programs; (d) development and promulgation of necessary Codes and
Standards to support higher levels of equipment efficiency in all
sectors; (e) establishment of testing laboratories and the
associated processes of equipment testing and ratings; (f)



- 4 -
development of project evaluation and monitoring systems
including sector - specific evaluation and monituring protocols;
(g) development and training of Energy Service Companies and DS5
Program lontractors in the public and private sectors; (h)
integration  of  supply-side  and  demand-side  planning  and
incorporation of environmental externalities in the electricity
planning process; (i) development of a Direct Utility Load
Control program; and (j) undertaking special studies as needed to
maintain awareness of emerging technologies with relevance to the
Thailand environment.
10.       Total financing required for MEA's investment program over the
period 1992-96 is estimated at about US$1,600 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$850 million.   Total financing required for the
project (i.e., FY1993 investment commitments) is US$549.6 million with a
foreign component of US$288.6 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$109.0
million -would finance 201 of the total project financing required and 38X
of the foreign expenditures.   Retroactive financing of up to US$10.9
million would be provided for project related expenditures incurred after
April 10, 1992. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.   A timetable of key
processing events and st.atus of Bank Group operations in Thailand are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10705-
TH, dated April 2, 1993 is '.eing distributed separately.
11.       Prolect Implementation.  KEA will be responsible for implementing
the project. MEA has in the past liplemented several large distribution
projects, including some financed by the Asian Development Bank. The Bank
loan proceeds would be disbursed against the cost of:   (a) equipment,
materials and civil works procured under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) procedures; (b) materials and equipment procured through LCB, local
or international shopping; and (c) consulting services.
12.       Project Sustainability. The necessary conditions exist to ensure
the financial and institutional sustainability of the project; the
framework, including the project drsign and relevant organizational
structure, is in place. The provisions for cost recovery are adequate to
ensure the project's operational sustainability. MEA is a well-run state
enterprise which has managed similar operations throughout its 34 year
history.   Project sustainability for the Electricity Energy Efficiency
component would be ensured through the adoption of a comprehensive and
integrated approach in program design and the policy commitment from
Government.
13.       Agreed Actions.  The main areas in which agreement has been
reached are: (a) annual Bank review of MEA's investment plans; (b)
financial covenants for KEA, including the requirement that it (i) achieve
a 251 self-financing ratio (and that tariffs would be increased as
necessary to meet this covenant); (ii) maintain a debt/equity ratio not
exceeding 1.5/1 and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 times; and (c)
comply with the Bank's environmental guidelines as appropriate for the
project.

14.       Environmental ImRlications.  The project is not expected to have
any significant adverse impact on the environment.  Line and substation
designs would follow internationally-accepted safety practices which have a
proven record in Thailand.   The lines vould be routed along existing
infrastructure, including existing rights-of-way and in many cases on
existing supports, and are not expected to intrude into environmentally
sensitive areas.   Moreover, the project provides for identification and
subsequent implementation of measures to improve design and operational
safety and enhance environmental acceptability. Three of the subprojects
involve conversion of overhead to underground systems in highly congosted
areas. The Environmental Impact Analyses of the components that would be
financed by the proposed Bank loan have been reviewed at appraisal and
found to be satisfactory.
15.       The Electricity Energy Efficiency component of the project would
make a positive contribution to the global environment by reducing the
emission of green-house gases by deferring or eliminating the need to build
fossil fuel- fired power plants.
16.       Benefits.    The continuing growth  in  electricity  demand  in
Metropolitan Bangkok has made it imperative for REA to expand and upgrade
its system to deliver power to new customers while maintaining system
reliability, service quality and distribution losses at optimwu levels.
The implementation of the project would help ensure the country's continued
economic growth by facilitating the development of its principal
administrative, commercial and industrial center of Bangkok. The project
would promote safety and environmental consciousness in system design and
operation.  It would also provide for the investigation of opportunities
for privatization of some of MEA's operations, and would strengthen MEA's
financial and management information systems.   Further, the Electricity
Energy Efficiency component of the project would introduce demand-side
management and the promotion of electricity energy efficiency in the Thai
power sector.   This activity would, over the years, eontribute to more
efficient utilization of the country's energy resources. The proposed DSM
component would result in: (a) building of institutional capability in the
Thai electric power sector and the energy-related private sector to deliver
cost-effective energy services throughout the economy; (b) development,
manufacture and adoption of energy-efficient equipment and processes within
the country; (c) demonstration effect for utilities of other developing
countries; and (d) reduction in emissions of green-house gases in a cost
effective manner.
17.       Risks.    The  Distribution  System  Improvement  and  Expansion
component of the project does not face any significant risks.  The detailed
planning and design of the distribution system expansion has already been
carried out.   Land for the new substations and right of ways for the
transmission lines are already available. Given MEA's experience and track
record, the risk of implementation delays (which could affect progress of
industrial and comnercial development in the metropolis) is minimal. The
risk of load growth not materlalizing as forecast is a'so minimal, given
the development potential of the area. Adjustments in investments could be
readily made should variations in demand projections so dictate.
Furthermore, the project returns are robust enough to maintain its economic



- 6 -
viability at slower than anticipated growth '.n energy sales, or higher than
estimated capital costs.
18.       The Electricity Energy Efficiency component of the project faces
three main categories of risk: institutional, technological, and market.
If the DSK organization is not adequately staffed, the savings targets are
at risk. However, the commitment of EGAT and the DS4 subcommittee will
mitigate much of this risk. There is a degree of technological risik in the
lighting area, because of the high ambient air temperatures in Thailand.
Testing will be conducted to identify any potential problems related to the
higher temperatures. In addition, although the lack of effective operation
and maintenance practices could result in the degradation of equipment
performance and efficiency, the project provides for training and
assistance in this area. Finally, the project risks some lack of interest
in the DSM programs.   If the market does not respond to the incentives
offered, the savings' targets may not be achieved.   To mitigate this,
program incentives will be tailored to meet individual customers' neads.
19.       In addition to financial incentives to overcome market barriers,
the programs include design features that address other significant
barriers: (a) marketing to increase public awareness; (b) training  to
increase professional expertise; (c) technical assistance to facilitate
customer participation;  and (d) steps to assure quality control.   By
working with international DSM professionals, it would be possible to adapt
international  experience  to  the  Thai  situation.    By monitoring  and
evaluation on an on-going basis, timely adjustments could be wade to
improve program performance.
20.       Reconendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agrsement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
