TO THIE FXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSEN
CdEDIT T-O THE  SISAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAiN
FOR A RECONSTRUJCTION PROJECT FOR THE CYCLONE DAMAGED COASTAL AREAS
OF EAST PAKISTAN
1.         I subm.t the following report and recomnmendation on a procosed
credit inn an amnount in - arious currencies equivalent to US $25 million to the
Islanic Republic o, Pakistan to assist in financing reconstruction works in
the cyc'lone danaged areas of East Pakistan.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.         The cyclone w'iich struck East Pakistan on November 12' 1970,
caused unprecedented loss of life and property damage.  Several Bank missions
were in Fast Pakistan at the time, and thus were able to assist the Govern-
ment immediately in making a preliminary assessment of the damage.  On
November 13 iir. Picciotto, of the Special Projects Department, gave the
Executive Directors an oral report on the cyclone and on reconstruction needs.
On that occasion l: said that I thought IDA should be prepared to provide
assistance to meet, some of the costs of reconstruction. Meanwhile the
authorities in East Pakistan, in consultation with our staff, had begun inten-
sive efforts to formTulate a reconstruction project suitable for IDA financing.
On December 7 a report entitled "Pakistan:  A Reconstruction Program for the
",rclone Damaged A,reas of East Pakistan" was distributed to the Executive
Directors for their information (SecYI,70-5lj2).  That program, totalling Rs.
60o million (US$180 mlllion equivalent), was prepared by the Government of
Easit Pakistan withl assistance from the Bank Group's staff.  The project for
wh-ich I now propose a credit of US$25 million equivalent would help finance
an essential part of the Government's overall reconstruction program and
would complement relief efforts which are already underway.
3.         Negotiations were held in Dacca on December 14 through 17, 1970.  The
Association's negotiating team was headed.by Mr. MeLmoth. The Borrower was rep-
resented by a tean headed by Mir. A.M.S. Ahmed (Chairman, Planning and Develop-
ment Board, Government of East Pakistan) and 14r. Zafar Iqbal (Joint Secretary
of the Economic Coordination and External Assistance Division, Government of
Pakistan).
Lh.        The Association has made thirty-seven development credits to Pakistan,
totalling US$476.2 million (net of cancellations). Twelve credits are fully
disbursed. The Bank has made thirty-one loans in Pakistan, totalling US$633-4
million (net of cancellations), of which eighteen are fully disbursed.  The

5.       In my report on the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Project in Pakistan
(dated June 3, 1970; distributed to the Executive Directors as II1A/R 70-104),
I referred to the slow rate of disbursement of some loans and credits.
Disbursements under the Dacca and Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage
Projects (Credits Nos0 41 and 42-PAK) and the first three Education Projects
(Credits Nos. 149, 5C and 87-PAK) are still slower than expected. Under the
East Pakistan Highway Project (Credit Noo 53-PAK), which was revised earlier
this year (IDA/R.70-.18), a further attempt is being made to obtain acceptable
tenders. Under -5he second West Pakistan Highway Project (Loan No. 578-PAK)
the tenders receivecd for a major part of the project were so far in excess
of the estimates that the project authorities, in consultation with our staff,
are considering a major revision of the project.
6.       For a number of other projects, disbursements have been slower than
originally forecast due to problems encountered in project implementation,
but in most of these cases disbursements are now in accordance with revised
forecasts, io e., Karachi Port Development (Loan No. 376-PAK), Karachi
Electric Supply (Loan No. 488-PAK), and Lahore Water Supply (Credit No0 106-PAK).
Of the latest three PICIC loans (Nos. 421, 509 and 590-PAK), about US $14
million remain undiszbursed but the bulk of this amount (US $11,9 million)
is accounted for by the third (No. 590-PAK), which was made in March 1969.
7.       Most other loans and credits are being disbursed on or close to
schedule. There are several caAes where, from the nature of the project and
of the Bank's contribution to its financing, it was known from the outset that
disbursements would be spread over many years (e.g., the Indus Basin and
Tarbela Multi-purpose loans Nos. 266 and 548-PAK).  Finally, I note that
almost two-thirds of the total undisbursed amount is accounted for by projects
approved during the last two years; these projects are now being implemented,
and disbursements in most cases are in accordance with agreed schedules.
8.       IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling about US
.2 1.6 million, net of cancellations, The value of outstanding commitments,
net of repayments, cancellations and sales of loans, is about US $15.9
million.  IFC is pr/sently considering applications for investments in a
diesel engine assembly company and in a project for fertilizer production.
9.       Several new projects have been appraised and reports are under
preparation. These include proposed IDA credits for East Pakistan Consulting
Services (up to US $5 million, with participation by UNDP possible), Second
Phase East Pakistan Foodgrain Storage (US $5-10 million, jointly with US $10
million credit from Sweden), East Pakistan Tea Processing and Irrigation (us $lo
million; joint financing with UK possible), Dacca Southwest Flood Protection
and Irrigation (US $34 million), Second Phase Lahore Water and Sewerage
(US $5 million; joint financing with Sweden in equal amount likely), and EPWAPDA
Tubewells (US $12 million; possibilities of joint financing being explored);
they also include possible Bank loans for PICIC (US $30 million) and KESC -
Karachi Power Distribution (US $10 million),



PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
10.      Borrower:                           Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiary:                       Province of East Pakistan
Amount:                            Equivalent in various currencies
of US $25 million.
Purposes                           To assist in the reconstruction
of the cyclone damaged coastal
areas of East Pakistan.
Amortization:                      In 50 years, including 10 years
grace, through semi-annual install-
ments of ½q of 1% from April 15,
1981 through October 15, 1990 and
19$ from April 15, 1991 to October
15 2020.
Service Charges                    3/4 of 1% per annum.
Relending Terms:                   Islamic Republic of Pakistan will
relend to the Province of East
Pakistan on the same financial
terms as those of the Credit ex-
cept that relending will be in the
currency of the Borrower.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Reconstruction Project for the
Cyclone Damaged Coastal Areas of East Pakistan" (No. PS-3a), dated Decem-
ber 30, 1970, is attached.
12.       The proposed project would consist of selected sub-projects in
the following categories of the Government of Pakistan's Reconstruction
Program:  (i) technical assistance for sub-project preparation, evaluation
and execution; (ii) deep wells, shallow wells and tanks for fresh water
supply; (iii) repair of coastal exnbanrkments; (iv) rural infrastructure,
i.e., roads, irrigation channels, drainage works and multi-purpose rural
development centers to serve as storm shelters; (v) `ishing boats and
equipment;  (vi) water transport equipment and landing facilities;  and
(vii) other programs (such as agricultural supplies, telecommunications and
an improved cyclone warning system).
13.       A Reconstruction Board for Cyclone-Affected Atreas, unlder the
chairmanship of the Governor of the Province, has been established by
Presidential Order to plan, coordinate and supervise the reconstruction
work. A senior Reconstruction Program Actiinistrator, serving as Secretary
and Chief Executive Officer of the Reconstruction Board, will monitor cEnd



sucervise the execution of all reconstruction sub-projects in the field;  it
is expected that w-is po0ition will be filled shortly and in any case before
the proposed credit is signed.  The physical execution of all projects will
be the responsibility of the various departments and agencies of the Central
and Provincial Goverriments.
lL4.      The proposed credit would mainly help iinance civil works and equip-
ment for the rehabilitation of critically needed facilities which were damaged
during, the cyclone, as well as longer-term rehabilitation and cyclone protec-
tion works. Provision has also been made in the proposed credit for financing
the technical assistance necessary for preparation, evaluation and execution
of sub-projects.  Each sub-project submitted by the Reconstruction Program
Adbministrator to the Association for financing will be appraised by the Bank
Group's staff befcre proceeds of the proposed credit can be utilized. All
relevant aspects of each sub-project (e.g., definition, cost and justifica-
tion, organizational arrangements, employment of consultants, procurement and
disburserent procedures, etc.) will be established by Subsidiary Agreements,
as provided, in Section 2.01 of the draft Project Agreement. This procedure
is necessary in order to permit appropriate coordination between the assistance
from the Association and that provided by the Government of Pakistan and other
external sources, bilateral and multilateral, for the Reconstruction Program.
15.       Under each of the sub-projects the proceeds of the proposed
credit would be disbursed to cover all foreign exchange costs and half of
the local currency expenditures. It is expected that the aggregate cost of
all sub-projects would be about US $35 million, i.e., the proposed credit of
US $25 million would cover about 71 percent of total expenditures on the
project. The Goverrment of Pakistan would cover the balance. The foreign
exchange component of these expenditures is presently estimated at about
US $15 million, so that the credit would finance about US $10 million of
local currency expenditures. I consider this justified under the very ex-
ceptional circumstances of this credit.
16.       The prcposed credit is expected to be disbursed over the next 18
nonths.  The Government intends to execute as much of the reconstruction work
as possible before the beginning of the next monsoon in June. However, some
of the reconstruction work will have to be carried out during the succeeding
dry season (N'ovember 1971 through May 1972).  In view of the urgency of the
major proJect elements it may frequently not be desirable or practicable to
follow the usual Bank/IDA procurement procedures.  For example, some of the
urgently needed equipment may have to be obtained from the most expeditious
sources, including local distributors; similarly, civil works contracts will
often need to be negotiated with contractors already established in the area.
However, the procedures to be agreed for each sub-project will ensure that
procurement will be efficient and economical.
17.       The Audlitor General of Pakistan will audit the Reconstruction Fund
provided for in Section 3.01(b)of the draft Development Credit Agreement.
It was also agreed during negotiations that an external auditor would be em-
ployed, under defined terms of reference, for the certification of all with-
drawal applications pricr to disbursement by IDA (Section 2.09 of the draft
Project Agreement;).

18.       It is not feasible to calculate the econorv`c rate of returr -cr the
proposed reconstruction project.  However, the experience .ained fro-- r-con-
struction in other countries indicates that the types of rehabilit:t lcn .nd
reconstruction works which would be included in the project yield hi.m econom;ic .
returns.
PART 1V - L_ IA-L INSTRUI4ITS ANT AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic 7?epublic
of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Pro-
vince of East Pakistan and the Association, the recoemendation of thc. Com-
mittee provided for ir. Article V, Section I (d) of the Artic'es of ,greement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Ececutive Directors separately.  The draft Developmen't Credit lgreement.
(Section 1.02g) and the draft Project Agreement (Section 2.01) provide ror
Subsidiary Agreements which will delineate the specific sub-projects.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       An economic report dated July 17, 1970,  on "Current Econoriic
Position and Prospects of' Pakistan" (SA-15a) was distributed to the Fxecutive
Directors on July 28, 1970 (R70-150). A basic data sheet is attached.
21.       East Pakistan, with a per capita income well below US $100, is one
of the poorest regions in the world today.  In essence, its economic problem.
lies in the fact that growth of regional product has barely exceeded, and ma'?
have remained below, the 3 percent annual increase in population.  Living
standards, therefore, have certainly not improved in the 'sixties and ma  t,have
deteriorated.
22.       Achievem)ient of a significant acceleration of economic -rowht;h in East
Pakistan is among the most important challenges facecl by Pakistan today.  The
key to growth in East Pakistan is in agricu'ture:  60 percent of -ross re-iona]
product is generated in this sector;  about 90 percent of the 73 million popu-
lation is rural;  and over 80 percent of the population is employed in ajricul-
ture, largely in subsistence farming.  Development of agriculture is not easy,
because of each year's cycle of floodircf fol-lowed by drought.  IMoreover, farxis
are Tnall and highly fragmented;  average farm size was 3.5 acres accordin( to
the 1960 agricultural census, but recent studies sui-est that the averace has
since diminished to about 2.4 acres.  The possibility of extendiung the cu>-
tivable area is li.ited, and population pressure is increasing rapidlo-.
Population density now amounts to roughly 2,100 people per square mi]e of cul-
tivated land.
23.       Of necessittv the maTin tharust of agr-icultural development in East
Pakistan must be to increase yields per acre.  Unless agricult;urll proulict.cn
is increased, East Pakistan, by 1975, will need tc import five  million tons ol
foodgrain per year just to maintain the low level of nutrition that exists at
present.  A strategy is now evolving that holds hope for aricuituraJ develop-
ment in East Pakistan: improved rice varieties h2ve been developed; an
institutional pattern for the rapid introduction of irri_ation is evolvin.-;



and farm.ers are riaakng increasing use of sophisticated agricultural inputs
suchj as chemical fertilizers and pesticides.  Concurrent with these improve-
ments in farring practices, the authorities are initiating irrigation-cum-
flood control projects with a 3-5 year gestation period and undertaking the
studies necessary for longer range development.
24.       Even before July 1, 1970, the beginning of Pakistan's Fourth Five-
Year Development. Plan (1970-75), economic growth was affected adversely by
uncertairties regarding the outcome of elections, which had originally been
scheduled for October of this year.  The elections, which were held earlier
this month, resulted in significant victories for the Awami League in East
Pakistan and for the People's Party in West Pakistan.  Of greatest importance
is the absolute majority achieved by the Awami League, led by Sheikh I4ujib-ur-
rlhnan., in the Constituent Assembly which will begin its deliberations in
J.>auary. The two major parties must complete the task of framing a new con-
stitution before -he end of May 1971, but it is still too early to say how a
new goverrment, working under that new constitution, will approach the country's
developmernt problems.
25.       During the last two years the primary objective of the present
administration under President Yahya Khan has been the creation of a climate
conducive to orderly re-establishment of democratic government. This has
meant some delay in taking steps needed to improve the management of the
economy and to achieve important objectives of the Fourth Plan, such as in-
creased domestic resource mobilization (which would permit an expansion of
development outlays, especially in East Pakistan), improved resource alloca-
tion (to be broug:ht about largely by a rationalization of fiscal policy and
the exchange rate system) and accelerated export development (by providing
appropriate incentives to producers and exporters).
26.       Clearlyr, East Pakistan needs a substantial expansion of investment
in agriculture, water and human resources. Critical to this effort will be
the achievement of an expanding domestic contribution to investment which
would, inter alia, involve some transfer of resources from the West Wing.
UJnortunately, the 1970/71 budget, drafted against the uncertainties oL last
June, provided for only marginal increases in taxation, which are insu.fficient
to support any large expansion of development spending in East Pakistan.
27.       In addition to increased domestic resources, sizeable increases in
foreign assistance to East Pakistan are needed if long term development op-
portunities are to be realized. This requirement will be the major subject
of discussion at the next meeting of the Pakistan Consortium which is tenta-
tivelf scheduled for Mlarch 1971. In the meantime, urgently needed reconstruc-
tion efforts cannot wait, and in these extraordinary circumstances I have no
hesitation in re!commending that we lend our immediate support to these efforts
through the proposed credit.
PLAT VI - COIPLIANCE IITH ARTICLES OF AGREM4ENT
28.       I Lni satisfied that the proposed Reconstruction Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
