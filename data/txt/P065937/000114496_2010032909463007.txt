SCHEDULE 3
Amortization Schedule
1.
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn 
as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by 
the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying: (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as 
of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 
Payment Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies.
Installment Share
Payment Date
(Expressed as a %)
On each February 15 and August 15
Beginning February 15, 2009
through August 15, 2016
6.25% 
2.
If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:
(a)
To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.
(b)
Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in 
Page  20
the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the 
Original Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all 
remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after 
such date, such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.
3.
(a)
Withdrawals made within two months prior to any Principal Payment Date 
shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any 
Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the 
date of withdrawal.
(b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such 
sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 
4.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the 
Loan to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that 
shall be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate 
that reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank 
under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank 
so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate 
component of the Screen Rate.
5.
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

(a)
All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or Colombians, 
will be treated equally and, particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder 
or group of bidders for bid evaluation purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit 
their bids by hand or through the post office or private mailing services. There shall 
not be any requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder's registration in 
any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar entity, whether in Colombia or 
elsewhere, or to appoint a representative domiciled in Colombia, unless and until such 
bidder is awarded the corresponding contract.
(b)
Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their 
representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and place for 
the opening meeting shall be set forth in the bidding documents. Bid opening shall 
coincide with, or take place promptly after, the final date and time of the period for 
bid submission stipulated in the bidding documents.
(c)
Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the 
responsive bidder who meets appropriate technical and financial standards of 
capability and whose bid has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid. Such 
determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the specifications, conditions 
and evaluation criteria stipulated in the bidding documents. If any factor additional 
to the amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such 
factor or factors and the quantified manner on which they will be applied for purposes 
of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely stipulated in the bidding 
documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and comparison, the only bid amount or 
amounts to be used as a factor shall be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the 
corresponding bid, including correction of arithmetic errors.
(d)
The provisions of paragraph 2.46 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, 
more specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the persons 
officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating the bids while they 
are performing their official duties, without the corresponding bidder's written 
authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not be required to provide such authorization

conditions of the draft Subproject Agreement and the rest of the bidding documents for 
such Subproject, including the corresponding POI, shall describe the construction or 
rehabilitation works to be undertaken, in connection with the Water Utility in 
question, by the corresponding Constructor/Operator. Each Constructor/Operator: (a) 
shall be selected, for such Subproject, on the basis of national competitive bidding 
procedures in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.3, 3.4 and 3.13 (a) of 
the Guidelines; and (b)  shall be responsible for the execution of part or all of the 
corresponding works in its role as  constructor. Each Constructor/Operator in question 
shall start performing under the corresponding Subproject Agreement by discharging its 
responsibilities as operator of then current water system. Once the construction phase 
commences the two types of responsibilities (as constructor and as operator) will 
overlap until a point in time in which, by  the acceptance by the corresponding 
Participating Municipality of all the works to be executed by the 
Constructor/Operator, and without prejudice to any subsisting legal responsibility as 
constructor for the works so executed, the Constructor/Operator in question will 
return to one single role, that of operator. Subsequently, at any point in time, and 
subject to the provisions of the applicable Subproject Agreement and POI, and the then 
current circumstances, if the Constructor/Operator in question, as operator, 
determines that there is need for additional works, then, subject to the decision of 
the Participating Municipality in question, the additional works shall be procured in

SCHEDULE 5
Implementation Program
1.
Introduction
The core and principal purpose of the Project is the carrying out of Subprojects 
in Participating Municipalities: (a) in the Caribbean Region; and (b) in regions of 
the Borrower’ s territories other than the Caribbean Region, and the increased 
provision of financial support to said Subprojects from financial sources other than, 
and as an alternative to, the Borrower’s or, to some extent, the Municipality (ies)’ 
in question. The provisions of this Schedule shall provide the framework for certain 
activities related to the Subproject cycle, from identification to execution, and 
shall apply to all Subprojects, with the exception of those provisions concerning or 
referring exclusively to the Loan or Loan proceeds, which shall apply only to 
Subprojects in the Caribbean Region. 
2.
Subprojects
Each Subproject in a Participating Municipality will consist in the execution of 
civil works and the acquisition and installation of equipment, both for water supply 
and sanitation purposes, and the management and operation of the corresponding 
facilities, all of which shall be financed with a combination of funds provided from 
different sources, which may vary for every Subproject and will consist of one or more 
of the following, as the case may be:
(a)
a contribution from the Borrower to the cost of said infrastructure 
investments in the Subproject in question, to the extent the investments in question  
cannot be fully financed by the private sector under (b) (i) because the Tariff levels 
will not be sufficient to recover the cost of the private sector investments in 
question;
(b)
(i)  the investment funds committed by every Operator of Subprojects  in 
Medium Size Municipalities or by some or all of the Constructor/Operators of  
Subprojects in Small Municipalities, under the corresponding Subproject Agreement, 
which funds said Operators or Constructor/Operators, as the case may be, expect to  
recover  from the income to be earned as managers of the Water Utility in question; 
and (ii) the contributions committed by the corresponding Participating Municipality 
or Municipalities under the corresponding Subproject Agreement, for each fiscal year 
during the agreed term for the carrying out of said Subproject, derived from: (A) a 
given portion of such Municipality’s or Municipalities’ Law 60 Income; or (B) other 
Page  25
alternative source or sources available to the Municipality or Municipalities in 
question.
3.
Eligibility Criteria
The following eligibility criteria shall be met by every Municipality wishing to 
become a Participating Municipality. The General Director of Water and Basic 
Sanitation of MED, as provided for in the Manual, will decide on each petition 
received in order to determine whether the Municipalities in question (individually or 
grouped) qualify as a Small Municipality or Medium Size Municipality. Since the 
participation of Municipalities in the Project will be demand driven, based on the 
premise of first come, first served, while the funds available will be limited, there 
will be a need for establishing a ranking order. Said order shall be determined by the 
date stipulated under the corresponding Technical Assistance Agreement to begin, in 
accordance with the terms of the agreement in question, the activities provided for 
under said agreement. Every Technical Assistance Agreement to be entered into shall be 
drafted following the Model for that type of agreement to be accepted for purposes of 
compliance with the effectiveness condition stipulated under paragraph (c) of Section 
7.01 of this Loan Agreement. Any material change in said model or departure from its 
provisions shall require the prior approval of the Bank.  All other decisions in 
connection with the acceptance or rejection of a given Municipality shall be made by 
MED’s General Director of Water and Basic Sanitation, as provided for in the Manual.

commonly referred to as "condominial approach"; and (II) the 
methodology applied in Colombia commonly known as "asas" 
(alcantarillados sin arrastre de sólidos); (B) will have excluded 
any possibility of resettlement for each member of the Population 
involved, caused by the Subproject in question; and (C) will have 
required that works be carried out in accordance with the

such Municipality or Municipalities fail to fulfill their 
commitments under said agreement or somehow terminate or rescind 
said agreement or cause the termination of rescission thereof; (B) 
the Tariff for the said provision of services shall be brought to 
levels that will ensure the coverage of, at least, administration, 
operation and  maintenance costs and will further reach, if not

expansion costs; (C) an amount equivalent to a certain and 
specific percentage of the Law 60 Income corresponding to the 
Municipality or to each of the Municipalities in question, ranging 
from 8% to 20%, shall be provided by such Municipality(ies) either 
from such Municipality’(ies’) Law 60 Income or other specific 
municipal resources; (D) the Mayor(s) of the corresponding 
Municipality(ies) shall carry out a campaign aimed at informing

of engineering and financial consultants shall be hired by the Participating 
Municipality in question to prepare, respectively, the POI and the financial 
projections, both for the corresponding Water Utility to be privatized. The PIU, in 
cooperation with the authorities of the Participating Municipality in question, will 
incorporate the investment and financial data produced with the technical assistance 
into the corresponding draft Subproject Agreement to be entered into between the 
Borrower and/or the Participating Municipality and the selected Operator or 
Constructor/Operator in question. For that purpose, the PIU shall use the 
corresponding Model to the maximum extent possible, as well as the model bidding 
documents approved by the Bank so as to be used in the bidding process that will be 
followed in order to select the corresponding Operator or Constructor/Operator, as the 
case may be, a bidding process that will require, as well, the approval of the Bank in 
respect of Parts A.1 and A.2 of the Project in conformity with the provisions of Part 
D.2 (a) and (c) of Section I of Schedule 4 hereto. 
The investment to be made in the Subproject by the selected Operator or 
Constructor/Operator will depend on the rate levels of the Adjusted Tariff of the 
Participating Municipality in question, since the basic principle of the Subproject 
contract is that the investment commitment of the Operator or Constructor/Operator 
shall be compatible with the level of income to be earned under the Adjusted Tariff 
from the users of the water and sewerage services in question.
The proceeds of the Loan allocated to each Participating Municipality will be 
determined on the basis of the financial model utilized during the preparation of the 
Subproject in question, subject to the degree of progress achieved by the Municipality 
in question in the preparation of such Subproject and the availability of Loan 
proceeds. If the amount of Loan proceeds requested by the winning bidder during the 
bidding process to select an Operator for such Project is not available, the amount to 
be provided will at least ensure the sustainability of the Subproject. The proceeds in 
question shall not be transferred to said Operator, but rather used to finance the 
works considered of high priority by said Operator to the extent approved by the 
authorities of the Participating Municipality in question and by the PIU.

specific purpose of defraying expenditures eligible for financing under the Loan and 
incurred in the carrying out of Parts B, C and D of the Project, which include 
technical assistance services to be provided in connection with the preparation and 
execution of Subprojects under the Project. In no case may proceeds from the Special 
Account be deposited in the said Designated Account if such proceeds to be deposited 
exceed the amount that would be necessary to maintain in the said Designated Account 
funds sufficient to cover no more than Project expenditures under said Parts of the 
Project expected to be incurred during the thirty consecutive calendar days 
immediately after such deposit shall be made.
In the case of unexpected situations that, in the Bank’s opinion, impede, or 
otherwise create significant delays in the aforesaid flow of funds procedures, the 
Bank may undertake to make direct payments with Loan proceeds to providers of goods or 
services under the Project (other than Part A.3 thereof), or to the Borrower so as to 
reimburse Borrower’s payments to such providers.
