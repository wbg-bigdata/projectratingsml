PROJECT COMPL TION REPORT
GUYANA - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1106/CREDIT 544-GUA
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Education
Project, for which Loan 1106 and Credit 544-GUA were approved on April 15,
1975, in the sum of US$12.0 million (Loan US$8.0 million and Credit US$4.0
million). The original Closing Date was June 30, 1980 (extended to
December 31, 1983) and the final disbursement was made on April 25, 1984.
The Loan Agreement (Loan 1106) was amended on June 8, 1983 and this resulted
in the cancellation of US$1.0 million of the Loan.
The PCR was prepared by a UNESCO team in June 1984, and wa:- 7ased
on: (a) the findings of a UNESCO completion mission which was carried out
from March 3-6, 1984; (b) the study of records, reports and other data in
Bank files that relate to this project, and (c) a review of the Borrower's
completion Report which was prepared by the Project Unit.
The project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department. Copies of the project completion report were sent to the
Government for comment in September 1984. No comments have been received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUYANA - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1106/CREDIT 544-GUA)
HIGHLIGHTS
Project Objectives and Content
A loan of US$8 million and a credit of US$4 million to assist in
financing the Second Education Project in Guyana were approved and signed in
May 1975. Total project costs were estimated at US$18.9 million.
The project would assist the Government of Guyana to improve sec-
ondary education and strengthen agricultural education and training. The
project aimed at: (i) improving the relevance of the education system to the
needs of the economy and local communities; (ii) meeting specific manpower
requirements in priority sectors of the economy, particularly in agriculture,
to support the economic development strategy and; (iii) increasing the pro-
ductivity of the workforce and developing greater self-reliance among workers
(para. 1.2).
The secondary education part of the project consisted of:
(i) establishing and building seven four-year community high schools which
will replace the 'tops- of primary schools; (ii) converting ten existing
secondary schools into multilateral type schools similar to those established
under the first project; and (iii) expanding and rebuilding the secondary
teacher training college (para. 1.3 [i]).
The agricultural education and training part aimed at expanding
both formal and non-formal training opportunities for farmers, rural resi-
dents, extension workers, animal health technicians and other types of agri-
cultural technicians (para. 1.3 ti]).
The technical assistance component aimed at providing specialist
services and a fellowship program to support the implementation and operation
of the above project components (para. 1.3 [ii]).
The project included also a study to assess the effectiveness of
the vocational and technical education and training system (para. 1.3 [iii]).
Project Implementation and Outcomes
During the implementation period, the project underwent some
changes in content and scope. Annex 1 gives summarized information on the
objectives, proposed and implemented components and project outcomes.
The main changes in the secondary education component concerned the
reduction in the number of institutions built, the need to rehabilitate five



existing secondary schools and to provide equipment and textbooks to non-
project schools. Except for the deletion of the Rural Training Centers, the
agricultural part was implemented as foreseen. The Technical Assistance
component was fully implemented and fellowships were increased. No changes
were introduced in the study component (para. 1.4).
Managerial, technical and financial problems led inevitably to long
delays in implementing the project, which in turn increased by 52% the total
cost of the Project in terms of local currency (paras. 2.3, 3.2-3.3).
Conclusions
Given the high priority accorded to the Guyana rural sector and to
the training of the related middle level technicians, the agricultural insti-
tutions of the project received during the implementation period the needed
support from the Government (paras. 2.1-2.2). They were adequately built and
equipped (paras. 2.12, 2.13, 2.16 and 2.17).
This part of the project significantly contributed to the develop-
ment of the sector by: (i) responding to Government policy to supply most of
the demand of Agricultural technicians and teachers (para. 4.17), and
(ii) firmly establishing a Caribbean regional institution (REPAHA) jointly
operated by the participating countries which, if successful, can be used as
a model to be replicated in the Region (para. 4.20).
The secondary education part of the project, had a slow implementa-
tion start up because of the long time taken to procure the architects servi-
ces for the design of the concerned institutions (para. 2.7). A consequence
of the long delays involved was the high cost escalation coupled with finan-
cial constraints of the Government which, in turn, led to reduce the scope of
this part of the project (para. 1.4). In spite of the said reduction the
final costs were higher than foreseen in the Appraisal due to the cost esca-
lation (paras. 3.2-3.3).
Although this part of the project has not significantly contributed
to the expansion of secondary education, it has encouraged innovations of
structure and organization of schools. At the same time they have estab-
lished model Community High Schools in terms of the facilities required to
implement their program. For the Project Institutions to be successful and
to achieve the Project objectives, it is necessary that the Ministry of
Education allocates sufficient financial resources to operate the vocational
and science facilities provided (paras. 4.2, 4.3 and 5.1).
In the view of the World Bank-the project was only partially
successful. While project objectives related to strengthening agricultural
education and training were generally met, the same was not true of those
objectives aimed at improving secondary education. In the latter case the
new facilities of the eight secondary schools were not yet in operation at
the time of the completion mission, thus an assessment of concrete educa-
tional outcomes was not feasible. Furthermore, the projected enrollment for



- vi -
the teacher training college had not yet materialized. Finally, while the
results of the technical assistance program were generally positive, the
effectiveness of the fellowship component was inconclusive and the usefulness
of the study on the effectiveness of vocational and technical education was
questionable. These mixed results are attributable to a combination of
factors that relate to: the long project implementation period, the
Borrower's financial constralts which adversely affected the time provislon
of counterpart funds, weaknesses in the Borrower's managerial capacity, and a
project design that became too complex with the inclusion of multiple
components.



L Bacground and Content of the Project
Project Generation
1.1    The Bank Group assistance to education was discussed with the Government In
September 1973 on the basis of the Unesco Project Identification Report of January
1973. In February 1974, the Government submitted a formal request to the Bank
which led to the Preparation of the Project by the Government wlth Unesco
assistance'l. The proposal was appraised in May/June 1974, approved In April 1975 and
became effective in July of the same year. The estimated cost of the Project was US$
18.9 million of which US$ 12 million were the Bank-Group support.
Project Description
Objectives
1.2    As stated at Appraisal, the project would support the priority areas of the
Government's education development strategy as defined in the Second Development
Plan (1972-1976) and aimed at:
(i)   improving the relevance of the education system to the needs of the
economy and the local communities;
(ii)   meeting t;e specific manpower requirements in priority sectors of the
economy, in particular the agricultural sector; and
(iii) increasing the productivity of the workforce and developing greater
self-reliance among workers.
Components
1.3    The project content at Appraisal consisted of:
(i)   construction, furnishing and equipping of seven community high schools,
extensions to ten multilateral secondary schools, one secondary teachers'
training college, an extension to the Guyana School of Agriculture, one
Agricultural training, extension and communication centre, six rural training
centres and one regional animal health training centre;
(ii)  provision of technical assistance comprising seven man/years of
specialist services and 57 man/years of fellowships to support implementation
and operation of the above project items; and
(iii)  a study to assess the effectiveness of the vocational and technical
education and training system in meeting the country's socio-economic
objectives and manpower needs.
Amendment
1.4    At the end of 1982, the implementation of the project was about four years
behind schedule. This situation was the result of organization and management
1/    The Government decided to strengthen the Teachers Training College instead
of the Faculty of Education as recommended by the Unesco Identification
Report and to develop community high schools in place of the recommended
intermediate secondary schools.

problems as well as financial constraints of the Borrower coupled with the escalation
of costs. Therefore on 11 November 1982 the Government formally requested the Bank
Group to amend the project as follows:
(i)  reduce the project to facilities already under construction-/ and to
delete the ruraL training centres, construction of which had not yet started;
(ii) distribute furniture and equipment already procured to secondary
schools other than those under construction and procure English language
textbooks;
(iii) rehabilitate the five secondary schools to which extension of practical
facilities were attached; and
(iv) increase the fellowships programme to train Government officials in a
number of professional areas.
1.5    On 8 June 1983 the Government request was agreed by the Association and the
Bank. As a consequence the project content was redesigned, as shown in Annex 2, and
an amount of one million US$ was cancelled, reducing the Bank Group's support t US$
11 million.
Covenants
1.6    The Project Agreement included several covenants which were partially or
totally implemented as shown in Annex 5.
IL Project Management and Implementation
Management
2.1    The Project was executed by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
established for the First Project under the Ministry of Education (MOE). To take
advantage of the experience gained in the First Project, the key personnel and services
were retained. Until 1976 the two projects had to be managed simultaneously,
therefore, additional staff, including a cost controller, was required.
2.2    Because of the agricultural component, one liaison officer was appointed from
the MOA and one from the Guyana School of Agriculture.
2.3    Management of the Project was affected by the following problems:
(i)   the PIU was not vested with sufficient decision-making power to carry
out the tasks ef ficiently and expeditiously.  Rather it played the role of
intermediary between the Government and the Bank; and
(ii)  in addition to delays in appointing new staff, there was a large staff
turnover among key persoinel resulting in changes of approach and inevitably
incurring further delays.

secondary schools, one secondary teacher training college, the extension of the
Guyana School of Agriculture, the Agricultural Extension, In-Service Training
and Communication Centre, the Regional Educational Programme for Animal

Bank Performance
2.4    While under implementation, the project was visited by 17 Bank supervision
missions which represent an average of two visits per year. Because of total
stagnation of work in 1981, the project was not visited by any supervision mission. It
seems that given the complexity of this project, the staffing of some missions may
have been inadequate as about 40% of them had only one staff member. Fortunately
these missions were generally complemented by the Project technical assistance staff
available.
2.5    As documented ir the Aides Memoire, the missions not only continually
monitored and advised on aUl aspects of the project but actually worked with officials
from the Government agencies concerned to help them to prepare plans, schedules and
guidelines to expedite the project and minimize the effects of lost time. Unfortunately
this did not prevent delays and cost escalation.
2.6    The Bank acted with flexibility and understanding in the search for solutions to
the problems faced during much of the life of the project, such as agreeing to the use
of loan funds to import critical building materials, pay expenses of student fellows
stranded abroad, rehabilitate schools to which extensions were added, purchase English
language textbooks, and Science laboratory equipment.
Implenmentation of Physical Facilities
2.7    Compared with Appraisal estimates (Annex 10), the civil works component had
a slow beginning and long implementation period, due mainly to the length of time
taken to appoint consultant architects, the shortage of counterpart funds and the
foreign exchange constraints to importing construction materials.
Professional Services
2.8    The Govemment insisted on Guyanese professionals to provide the consultancy
services. After more than two years of negotiations about work conditions -and fees,
14 local consultant firms were appointed to prepare designs and structural, civil,
electrical and sanitary engineering drawings, as well as quantity surveying. Except for
one firm, architects were unable to supervise the civil works, therefore, the PIU and
their clerks on site, carried this out. Management consultants supervision increased
substantially at the end of the project, following the agreement on the urgent
rehabilitation of existing schools expanded under the project.  In addition, the
management consultants role covered technical assistance to contractors, help in the
preparation of construction schedules, plans for the procurement of materials, and
construction manuals for future projects. This arrangement proved satisfactory.
Design
2.9    For designing the Civil Works the consultant firms were given copies of the
schedule of accommodation and of the  Master Plan which contain educational
specifications drawn from the experience obtained during the implementation and
operation of the First Project. The MOE and the MOA were involved in day-to-day
consultations to expedite the preparation of plans, working drawings and contract
documents. Construction drawings are traditional but sound.
2.10   Although Appraisal areas have been generally followed, (see Annexes 12 and
13), circulation areas are not well resolved and there are student supervision and
building security problems.  The requirements of the fire authorities, though
necessarily stringent with timber superstructures, have not beer. economically met.
EFC/14



- 4-
2.11   Abnormal room  heights have necessitated the suspension of fluorescent
fittings on steel chains, in order to achieve acceptable lighting levels. None of the
workshops can be safely utilized because the electric and also gas services dropping
from above on timber battens have deficiencies in their installation which require
improvement. In the design of secondary schools it is evident that the architect was
concerned with the creation of complicated forms rather than a simple economical and
modest type of building.
2.12   These buildings and those of the Teachers' Training College are in marked
contrast with the teaching, residential and cormmunal facilities provided at the
agricultural complex. These designs are simple and economical and the staff and
students are weLl pleased and thus maintain the buiLdings in excellent condition.
Double bunks are not popular in the bedrooms but fortunately there is ample space for
single beds. The kitchens, with their stainless steel fittings, are not in use because
there is no gas or electricity yet. Cooking is being done outside on wood fires and
emergency charcoal stoves have been built in an ancilliary room. Some mistakes in
basic design might have been avoided if the Master Plan had been strictLy adhered to
and the drawings carefully checked against the specifications by exoerienced school
facilities planners.
Construction
2.13   The supply of materials and even local hardwoods, was erratic. In order to
secure building materials, the purchase of cement, steel, hardware and paint was put
in the hands of a Government corporation, and ultimately the Bank agreed to pay
overseas suppliers for these commodities direct from loan/credit funds. It has been
difficult for contractors to achieve the necessary standards due to the shortage of
skilled operatives in the construction industry who had emigrated. The competency of
the contractors combined with supervision of the PIU and the Clerks of Works
produced a satisfactory level of workmanship.
2.14   Contracts for project components were signed between May and September
1979. Letters of award to contractors included a new condition: the compulsory
incorporation of a management consultant firm. Due to disagreement of a contractor
about the new condition, the Government revoked contract awards of the Teachers'
Training College, extensions to the agricultural complex and a community secondary
school; construction was executed under force account. These civil works were
excluded from Bank financing due to misprocurement.
Sites and Services
2.15   Sites were generally well located but because the land is below median high
tide level, an elaborate system of conduits and drains was necessary :o cope with
surface water during the rainy seasons. Sugar cane waste was oft-n used as "fill" thus
increasing foundation costs. Termite infestation was worse in such "fill" areas and
pest control costs rose. Permanent water and electricity supplies are not yet availab. e
at any of the new sites. It is expected that water at least will be available for the
opening of the new institutions.
Furniture
2.16   It had been hoped to provide much of the furniture from local sources but
owing to the lack of suitable seasoned hardwood and standard desigas, the industry was
not prepared to commit itself to the sizeable quantities involved.  Except for
REPAHA, bids had to be called for twice before contracts were awarded to two
EFC/14



overseas firms and one local manufacturer. When the project was amended the Bank
agreed that the surplus fumiture should be allocated to non-project secondary
institutions. Meanwhile it is being stored in empty buildings owned by the MOE.
Knock-down items are being assembled by students and teachers. The furniture is
suitably robust and of good design.
Books and Equipment
2.17   Procurement of books and equipment was carried out in two stages. At the
first stage contracts were awarded to six overseas firms from three countries. All
books were delivered to the Guyana School of Agriculture, the Teachers' Training
College and the MOE Supervisor of School Libraries. Equipment which has not yet
been delivered is stored in Government accommodation, which may not be suitable for
long periods of storage duc to humidity. Distribution will be undertaken by the MOE
at the start of the 1984-85 school year.
2.18   At the second stage, the Bank agreed to allocate loan funds for the
procurement of additional textbooks, science equipment and materials for the new
Materials Resource Centre and for existing secondary schools (see paragraph 1.1).
Contracts for these were awarded to Eng!ish firms and delivery was expected during
May 1984.
Maintenance
2.19   The Government now has no budget for maintenance and rehabilitation.
Schools have been informed that funds must be subscribed by parents and raised by
their own. Such funds are inadequate to meet the needs.
Implementation of the Technical Assistance Component
General
2.20   This component, designed to assist the governmental agencies to implement
the project, consisted of:
(a)   Specialists. Approximately eight man/years to assist in: (i) drawing up
a new education law and programming reform measures; (ii) preparing
curricula for technical and agricultural institutes; (iii) developing the rural
training centres and the Agricultural Extension In-Service Training and
Communication Centre; and (iv) carrying out a study assessing the effectivness
of vocational and technical education and training.
(b)   Fellowships.  Originally 57 man/years were allocated. In 1983, an
additional 65 man/years were allocated as part of the Project Amendment
which made a total of 122 man/years (see paragraph 1.4 and Annex 2).
Specialist Services
2.21   The original eight man/years of specialists were fully implemented between
1975 and 1979 although reallocation of man/years among the project institutions was
made. This assistance was further increased by four man/years provided by the CFTC
and the UNDP (see Annex 6).
2.22   To provide these services, the Government signed an agreement with Unesco
in August 1976. However, only four man/years were implemented by this Agency,
because the Government decided to hire Guyanese specialists on Government terms.
EFC/14



-6 -
2.23   Specialist services were, in general, well executed.- However, they met with
two major drawbacks: (i) they were completed too far in advance of the completion of
the Project institutions thereby losing effectiveness; and (ii) shortage of qualified
personnel prevented the nomination of local counterparts for necessary follow-up.
Fellowships
2.24   Of the  122 man/years allocated, an estimated  106 man/years were
implemented in two successive programmes:
(i)   the first one was carried out by the PIU and the Civil Service Ministry.
The latter was responsible for recruiting candidates, setting up the list to be
approved by the Government and the Bank, and selecting overseas universities.
Implementation began effectively in 1976 and was completed by 1980. The
duration of t-he scholarships ranged from three months to two years each and
the level ranged from certificate to university levels. Due to cost escalation,
only 43 man/years of the 57 original man/years were implemented;
(ii)  the second programme was the result of the Government's request
(paragraph 1.4) to extend the project support to other fellows studying abrc-ad.
In March 1983, the Government signed an agreement with the Latin American
Scholarship Programme of American Universities (LASPAU) for the
identification of suitable candidates, monitoring and reporting on their
performances. The Government took measures to ensure their return to
Guyana on completion of their studies. Of the original 63 fellows identified to
receive support, 52 received either full or partial funding from the Project.
Eleven fellows chose to continue their studies at their own expense.
2.25   According to the Civil Service Ministry, the majority of the scholars of the
first phase returned to the country after graduation, but most of them were assigned
to sectors other than those for which they were trained.  This situation adversely
affected the educational purposes of the Project's fellowships programme. In the
second phase only 16 fellows had returned as of December 31, 1983. The others are
expected back in June 1984.
The Effectiveness Study
2.26   The study was carried out by a special team appointed by the Government and
supported as follows: two manlyears by the project and one extra man/year by the
CFTC (see Annex 6).  The report, published in May 1979, made the following
recommendations, two of which, (i) and (iv), are going to be implemented as part of
the rationalization of the educational system to be undertaken by the MOE:
(i)   establish a national training commission to deal with technical
education and training;
(ii)  improve the physical facilities of the GTI and the Guyana National
Service for the training of technicians and craftsmen;
(iii) establish a new technical training complex for technicians, instructors
and teachers; and
(iv)  redesign the syllabus of the CHS and multilateral schools to enable
their graduates to enter technical institutions and apprenticeship programmes.

By the time the report was published, the manpower and training situation in the
country had changed so much that the results were not relevant to the prevailing
conditions and some of the recommendations were beyond the financial means of the
country.
L Proiect Costs and Financing
Project Cost
3.1    At Appraisal (see Annex 9), the estimated total project cost was G$ 37.74
million and the actual cost was G$ 57.2 million. The table below gives project
estimated expenditure by category.

3.2   In spite of the reduction in scope of the project (see paragraph 1.4), the actual
cost was some 52% above the Appraisal estimate in terms of G$. In terms of US$, the
actual project cost was 19.38 million, against the 18.90 forecast which meant an
overrun of 2.5%. The difference of overrun cost expressed in G$ and US$ is due to
devaluation of GS during implementation. High cost escalation and inflation rate,
coupled with about five years of delay in project implementation, have proved to be
the prime reasons for the cost overrun.
Note:l/ Including estimated additional expenditure required up to the closing date.
EFC/14



-8-
3.3    The variations between Appraisal and actual costs in terms of Guyanese
dollars were mainly caused by delays in initiation of professional services and civil
works and the extended period of implementation. Other causes included:
(i)   the actual cost of civil work amounted to 69% of the tola: project cost
and exceeded Appraisal estimates by 40%; a large proportion of this difference
is due to the significant increases of building materials and labour costs;
(ii)  the actual cost of professional fees went from 2.43 to 4.09 G$ million
which represents an overrun of 68%; the mpajor increase must be due to the
unforeseen appointment of the local firm of management consultants for the
rehabilitation of the five schools to be extended, when fees would be at least
twice that applying to new buildings; this firm also undertook the planning,
supervision and management of the civil works on behalf of the PIU which
would normally have undertaken this work had the necessary qualified staff
been available;
(iii) estimated total expenditure for furniture and equipment, representing
20% of the total project cost, was 11.3 million G$ or 62% above Appraisal
estimates; this is due to the large quantity of furniture which had to be
imported and the cost escalation involved in the latest (1984) procurement of
equipment and textbooks;
(iv)  the technical assistance programme, including the Effectiveness Study
represents 8.3% of the total project cost as against an estimated 4.2% at
Appraisal; the actual estimated technical assistance cost was 4.74 million G$
which is a 200% overrun; the main reason for this increase was the additional
programme of 65 man/years of fellowships, (see paragraph 2.19) and;
(v)   the cost increase of 55% in project administration can be accounted for
by the fact that the project was extended five years beyond Appraisal
estimates.
Unit Costs
3.4    A comparative analysis of planned and constructed areas and estimated costs
per square foot and per student place is given below:
Appraisal Actual   Final as %  Remarks
~~of Appraisal
Average area per student         64.5       64.1   nil        Annex 12

Average cost per student place    5,155.0   14,416.5  279.6   289.0
3.5    As expected, the average area per student was under control, but the
estimated actual costs per square foot and per student place are about two to three
times higher than the original estimates, which reflect the increases already discussed
above. Variations of costs per square foot as shown in Annex 13, range from 63.8 to
188.i. The lowest figure relates to REPAHA which was built on schedule before the
dramatic cost escalation and the highest figure quoted corresponds to the GSA item
which required highly specialized equipment. Due to the transportation cost to the
remote site of St. Ignatius. the construction was exceptionally expensive, reaching
424.2 G$ per square foot.

physical facilities divided by student places, presented in Annex 13, footnote

Project Financing
3.6    The project's external financing of US$ 12 million was secured from the World
Bank group through a loan (I 106-GUA) of US$ eight miL' on and a credit (544-GUA) of
USS four million.   The table below depicts the estimated Appraisal and actual
expenditures in terms of G$ by category and source of financing.

3.7    Bank support, estimated at 64%  at Appraisal, was reduced to 57% at
completion, due to the cancellation of US$ one million, (see paragraph 1.5). On the
other hand, the Government financing increased from 36% to 43% at completion,
mainly because civil works expenditure on some institutions was excluded from Bank
financing (see paragraph 2.13).
Disbursements Schedule
3.8    Actual disbursement started over one year behind Appraisal and due to delays
in implementation the rate of withdrawing proceeds was slow (see Annex 11). Indeed at
the original closing date (30 June 1980) only 17 per cent of Appraisal estimates were
disbursed. Moreover, by May 1984 only about 88 per cent of the amended loan/credit
(11 million) were disbursed. The category which lags well behind schedule with 24 per
cent undisbursed funds, is physical facilities.

IV. Operation of Proiect Institutions
4.1    Several working groups were established within the project components to deal
with educational aspects such as curricula, teacher training, textbooks, examinations,
etc., to be used in the project institutions and thus comply with some of the covenants
of the Agreement (see Annex 5).
Community High Schools
4.2    None of the three schools is actually operating. They will open for the next
school year in September 1984. There is no doubt that the enrolment target of 1,920
students, established in the Project Amendment (see Annex 2), will easily be met.
However, as stated in the Appraisal, the quantitative contribution of the project
schools to the expansion of lower secondary education, will be very sma'l as the places
provided will be used mostly to replace existing enrolment in the secondary section of
the primary schools ("tops"). Moreover only three of the originally appraised seven
schools remained a part of the Project.
4.3    The expected performance of these schools can be inferred from the current
experience of the country. In 1981/82, there were 30 community high schools with a
total enrolment of 11,503 students. Enrolment demand is not as steady as in other
secondary schools and has decreased since 1978/79.  Teachers, particularly in
vocational subjects, are scarce. There is also a lack of science teachers. Since 1982,
the MOE has allocated no financing for schools to buy consumable materials for
workshops and farms. To overcome this, schools have to organized their - wn fund-
raising activities in the community, therefore, practical work experience for students
is very limited.
4.4   In order to monitor the development of community high schools, the MOE
carried out three tracer studies for the graduates of years 1977, 1978 and 1979.
Unfortunately, only two schools had graduates in those years, and similar studies were
not extended to the "tops" of primary education, therefore care should be exercised in
interpreting or generalizing these results summarized below (see also Annex 3). The
results are: (i) more than 50 per cent of the graduates are still unemployed two years
after graduation; (ii) the majority of students did not have any work-study experience
and the majority of those who had profited, were in jobs unrelated to their field of
training; (iii) only one per cent of graduates were self-employed; (iv) the rate of
employment after two years of graduation, decreases from the first to the third study
group; (v) relatives and acquaintances rather than 'work-study attachments' were the
first source of employment; (vi) most of the employed are working in a field unrelated
to their previous training at school; (vii) about 20 per cent of the graduates have
undertaken further training mostly related to their previous training or to their 'work-
study attachments'; (viii) employers in general, stated that although the graduates
were inadequately trained for work, they had positive attitudes towards it; and (ix)
they admitted that the community high school certificate is not fully recognized as
guaranteeing proficiency. In spite of the above results, no follow-up actions have
taken place.
4.5    The recurrent annual unit cost is difficult to estimate given the prevailing
conditions. In 1980/81, the calculated unit cost was G$ 551.831/, equivalent to US$
196.211!, and as teachers' salaries have almost doubled since, the present cost would
be estimated at around G$ 1,100, equivalent to US$ 295Z/ which is higher than the
estimated cost in seven Caribbean countries (see 1982 Education Sector Studies).
1/    Ministry of Education, A Digest of Education Statistics, 1980/81, page 20.
2/    Exchange rates 1980/81 = 2.81; 1984 = 3.75. The project unit report estimates
the unif cost at US$ 490.26 which in the Mission's view is too high.

Multilateral Schools
4.6    Five existing secondary schools were converted into multilateral schools by
adding physical facilities, furniture and equipment. None of these new facilities is in
operation. In one case (North Georgetown), the extensions are partially used as
administration offices. All five are under the rehabilitation part of the project which
has not yet been completed. It is foreseen that all buildings will open by September
1984. Although no plans have been made to accommodate the additional enrolment of
about 800, there is no doubt that the target established in the Project Amendment will
be achieved.
4.7    The multilateral schools will have the necessary facilities to implement the
multilateral programme in terms of space and equipment, but will also face the same
financial constraints as the community high schools.
4.8    As concerns recurrent cost, as explained in paragraph 4.5 above the unit cost
would be around US$ 295, the same as for community high schools.
Secondary Teachers' Training College
4.9   In 1983 the college for training secondary school teachers moved into the
partially completed new building. All classrooms are being utilized, but workshops and
laboratories are not yet complete.  At present the college runs a three-year
programme which includes teaching practice in schools. Entrance requirements are
the same as those for the university. From a total of 15 teachers, seven have been
trained under the Technical Assistance component of this project.
4.10   The problem besetting the college, is lack of demand for places. In line with
the Appraisal Report, the college has a capacity of 450 students, to produce 150
teachers per annum. However, the present enrolment is 53 students, distributed in
five different specialities. In 1982 there was no intake at the college. As can be seen
in Annex 4, since 1976, enrolment has never exceeded 120 students. With the present
enrolment, the student/teacher ratio is 3.5 students per teacher. If the 50 science
teachers on in-service training are taken into account, the ratio is 7:1.
4.11   Reasons advanced for the low demand are: (i) compared to other economic
sectors, teachers pay is low; (ii) the low status of the profession; (iii) the same
entrance requirements as the University; and (iv) the small supply of secondary school
graduates (517 in 1981) who can meet the entrance requirements of the first year of
all post-secondary education institutions.
4.12   As all students receive a subsidy while at college of about G$ 700 (G$ 150 for
residents in Georgetown), they must sign a guarantee to work for at least three years
with the MOE. There is no systematic follow-up of graduates, but the principal of the
college affirms that all graduates comply with the bond but leave the profession and
the country afterwards.
4.13   The college has reached an agreement with the Carnegie School of Home
Economics and the National School of Arts to train teachers in these subjects, but no
agreement has yet been reached with the corresponding institutions to train teachers
for industrial arts and agriculture. Consequently, there are no pre-service training
programmes in these subjects.

4.14   In the college, but 'functioning as an independent unit, there is an in-service
teacher training programme. The trainees are teachers from community high schools
and the "tops" of primary schools. Enrolment figures are as follows.
Subject        1979      1980      1981       1982      1983
Home economics 26         17        20         9         17
Industrial arts   10      20         9        42          -
Agriculture      9         8         4         8          4
Enrolment in this programme is based on the yearly appointment of vocational
teachers, which in turn depends on the availability of candidates (paragraph 4.13).
4.15   Since 1982 the college has been operating an in-service training programme
for 50 science and mathematics teachers.  The trainees attend classes two days a
week and work three days in schools. The duration of the programme is two years for
primary and three years for secondary school teachers.
4.16   The recurrent unit cost in 1981 is reported to be G$ 2,122.42. Taking into
consideration last year's salary increase, it could be estimated today at about G$
4,200, equivalent to US$ 1,120, which is low compared with other institutions of post-
secondary education (see paragraph 4.19).
The Guyana School of Agriculture
4.17   The new boarding facilities helped the GSA to increase enrolment from 128 to
195 in 1983. The expected enrolment of 216, including a larger proportion of female
students, will be reached for the academic year 1984/85. About one third of this
enrolment will consist of certificate students. Once this enrolment is reached, the
proposed annual output of 105 graduates will be achieved. This output will help to
compensate the technician attrition rate which is partially due to migration to other
sectors or abroad and to meet the needs of the sector.
4.18   According to the 1982 figures, there are 12 full-time and 20 part-time staff at
the GSA. The present ratio of about 12 students per teacher is acceptable. The full-
time staff qualifications vary from diploma to B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees. Given the
qualifications of the teaching staff and the satisfactory equipment at the school, the
quality of training is good. The administrative staff for operating the school and the
school farms!! are sufficient. When the new facilities come into operation, the
present staff resources will suffice.
4.19   The GSA recurrent budget and per capita cost of training was evaluated over
the last four years and is shown below:

Source: The GSA.
Given the relatively small size of the school and the specialized field of training, the
above cost of training is acceptable.
The REPAHA
4.20   This diploma level institution started operating in the new facilities in
1978/79. Currently 46 students (including 10 females in the second year) are enrolled,
representing 11 Caribbean countries. Enrolment has decreased by about 20 per cent
during the last two years because of the financial constraints of the countries
participating. Up to the 1982 academic year, the output of the REPAHA was 186
animal health assistants (AHAs) of both sexes coming from 16 countries in the area
(Annex 7). The output average of 31 graduates per year corresponds approximateLy to
the planned objective of 36 per annum. The needs to be met in the five years to come
are of the same magnitude as those estimated by the participating countries visited by
an Evaluation Mission in 19821iI. Moreover it should be emphasized that the number of
veterinary doctors in the area is still very small and an increase will inevitably lead to
new demands on the AHAs.
4.21   At present, only one full-time local teacher, one local co-manager and one
international manager are in their posts. The latter will be leaving in December 1984
when UNDP support endsV/. There is therefore, an urgent need to appoint local
qualified full-time teachers to fill the still vacant posts. The other teaching staff is
composed of 23 part-time specialists (or the equivalent of four full-time staff)
originating from the participating countries, international agencies (PAHO, IICA) and
Guyanese agencies.A ratio of about ten students per teacher is acceptable.
4.22   Up till now, the training staff have generally been highly qualified and this has
led to a high standard of teaching. In this connection, all the countries visited during
the evaluation mission expressed their satisfaction regarding the quality of training.
The administrative staff and teaching assistants comprise 27 members including the
co-manager.   Training sessions, specialized courses and refresher courses for
veterinarians and AHAs f rom the Caribbean region, have been organized by the
REPAHA.

2/     First Phase: January 1976 to December 1980 - US$ 1.2 million.
Second Phase: January 1981 to December 1984 - US$ 0.7 million.
EFC/14

4.23   The recurrent budget of the REPAHA is provided jointly by the contribution of
the Government of Guyana and the participating countries through students' fees and
fixed costs calculated following a participation formula. At present these costs are
almost entirely paid for by Guyana. The students' fees for 1983/84 were fixed at G$
10,750 (US$ 2,870) per student.  The unit cost is roughly equivalent to the GSA
training cost in 1982 (paragraph 4.19 above) and could be considered reasonable.
4.24   In spite of the achievements and the wish of the countries to continue and
expand the fields of training, the REPAHA is facing the following administrative and
educational problems and constraints:
Of the 17 participating countries, only:
(i)   nine countries have committed themselves to the continuation of
REPAHA;
(ii)  six countries have paid the fixed costs;
(iii) 12 countries have signed Phase II whose objectives are given in Annex 8;
each signatory commits itself to support REPAHA when international support
is withdrawn;
(iv)  eight countries have signed the legal document which, once ratified by
CARICOM enables the REPAHA to become autonomous and to be provided
with sufficient income to cover the school's expenses. The Government of
Guyana, which already contributes heavily to the Centre, has shown some
concern for its future as the REPAHA will have to become reliant on its own
resources.
4.25   One other problem is that staff and students have no dining facilities in the
compound because it was planned that REPAHA would be built near the GSA in order
to share these and other facilities. This additional demand was taken into account in
designing the GSA facilities which are consequently under-utilized in the latter and in
need of construction at REPAHA.
The Agricultural Extension In-Service Training
and Communication Centre (AEITCC)
4.26   The AEITCC has just been completed. The MOA recently held a meeting
during which they planned all the details including final completion, furnishing and
installation of equipment. The Centre has been placed under the control of the
Extension and Education Division, MOA. A curriculum unit was created to ensure the
quality of future training programmes. The centre would train about 400agricultural
staff annually, on short courses of about one/two weeks with emphasis on extension
techniques, advanced agricultural technology, job-related improvement, management
and administration. The first ten-day training session was planned to start in April
1984 for regional extension officers.
4.27   The recurrent budget for 1984 was G$ 100,000. When the necessary number of
staff are nominated and the centre is fully operational, the budget will have to be
increased to meet expenses.

V. Conclusions and Recommendations
5.1    The Project assisted the country in improving secondary education and
strengthening agricultural education and training. Concerning secondary education,
the project institutions have the necessary facilities to make education relevant.
However, the Government faces difficulties in providing adequate operational
resources to accomplish such objectives. The Government is well aware of the
situation and has started a process to rationalize the optimal utilization of already
scarce resources. The agricultural institutions assisted by the project have been
adequately built and equipped and their operation will respond to the policy of the
Government particularly regarding the country's need for qualified middle-level
technicians and agricultural educators.
Conclusions
Project Design
5.2    The Project proved to include too many components involving dif ferent
Govemment agencies, which resulted in a complex design that was difficult for the
PIU to implement.
Project Implementation
5.3    Major factors which adversely affected the implementation of the Project,
included the following:
fi)   long  decision  making  procedures including delays in procuring
consultancy services.
(ii)  financial constraints of the country including low cash flow.
(iii)  inadequate staffing of the PIU to deal with all the various components.
(iv)  shortage of control of the Technical Assistance component.
5.4    Three tracer studies were completed for the graduates of two pilot-CHS
(1977-1979). The results of the studies showed that the majority of the graduates
found difficult to get employment and most of them had to continue their education or
training. The Borrower learned the process for conducting tracer studies and copies of
the studies were submitted to the Bank. Unfortunately the Borrower has not been able
to continue tracer studies for other graduates.
5.5    Project costs exceeded appraisal estimates mainly because of the cost
escalation due to the long period required to implement the Project.
Operation of Project Institutions
5.6    Although it is difficult to assess the outcomes of the multilateral schools, the
CHS and the TTC because they are not fully operational, present practice indicates
that performance of these institutions will be hindered unless the necessary means to
operate the physical facilities are provided.
5.7    The demand of the secondary school teachers in the country cannot be met as
long as the intake at the TTC is as low as at present.
5.8    The effectiveness of the Agricultural Project Institutions will not be reached
if the problems of staffing and recurrent resources are not adequately resolved by the
MOA.

Recommandations
For the Bank
5.9    At the identification stage complex Project designs should be avoided in
countries with weak managerial capability such as Guyana.
5.10   New and innovative project components, such as community high schools,
which by their very nature undergo changes and modifivations that may affect the
outcomes of the project and impair the effectiveness of other inputs, need additional
project support. To this end, a component to assist the Borrower to carry out those
activities necessary to conceptualize, design and implement the said innovations
should be included. The Bank might share some of the costs involved by providing
development assistance as part of the supervision missions.
5.11   Project components with a heavy proportion of vocational, technical and
science education and intended for large-scale implementation should be examined for
the long-term cost implications of workshops, laboratories and farms, and if necessary,
alternative financing proposed.
S.12  In order to improve Project implementation in countries like Guyana (see para.
5.9), the PIIJ should be strengthened through adequate staffing, and Technical
Assistance including a coordinating commission with representatives from the agencies
concerned.
For the Government
5.13   To provide teaching materials and inputs for vocational and science subjects,
the Government may have to resort to differentiated and scaled contributions of
parents to schools according to household income.
5.14   To increase the intake to the TTC, the Government may take two measures: (i)
lower the entrance requirements in relation to other post secondary institutions, and
(ii) increase the aumber of "O" level graduates by upgrading the three Project CHS to
offer a five year secondary education to those students from other CHS who passed
the secundary school proficiency examination.
5.15   The Report of the Study on Vocational and Technical Education and Training
system should be implemented and periodically updated. As for agriculture, a more in-
depth study on manpower education and training is needed.
5.16   Most of the graduates of the project agricultural schools go on to further
studies in the country or abroad and middle-level technician needs are not met. It is
therefore suggested that a minimum of field experience (two/three years) be required
as a prerequisite for university entrance as applied at the GSA specialized training.
5.17   A manager and an assistant should quickly be appointed to the AEITCC in
order to organize the centre, to set up the programme of work and establish the
resources required if the centre's operation is not to be impaired.
5.18   The large proportion of part-time teaching staff is a major problem at the
REPAHA. In order to maintain the good level of training and to ensure future
stability, it is recommended to the Advisory Board that more full-time staff be
appointed.
EFC/14



-17 -
5.19   Given the financial difficulties faced by the participating countries, it is
recommended that the Advisory Board seek bilateral or multilateral assistance to
provide full-time teachers and the needed additional facilities. The success of such a
regional institution will encourage CARICOM countries to establish similar
institutions.
5.20   As the RTCs have been deleted, advantage should be taken of the existing
Extension and Marketing Centres (EMCs) which were not funded by the project but
whose objectives are similar to those of the RTCs. In order to improve the training of
farmers, the Division of Extension and Education should be closely involved in
establishing a medium-term extension and training programme for the utilization of
the EMCs with the full support of the AEITCC.
5.21   Projects fellowships plans should clearly establish where the candidates
studying abroad wilL work upon returning to the country in order to make effective
contribution to Projects Institutions.
5.22   Priority should be given in the Project schools to correct the installations for
electricity and gas, coming from above.
5.23   [t is necessary to carry out a programme of maintenance for the Project
school buildings. It is thus essential, as matter of urgency, to:
(i)   identify the necessary repairs under three headings - immediate, within
two years, and within five years;
(ii) institute a rolling programme of repairs and rehabilitation; and
(iii) set aside the necessary funds.
It would seem that the PIU, wh se life must now extend to the final commissioning of
the current project, should thereafter be the agency entirely suitable to prepare
estimates and implement the rolling programme. To properly fulfil this role, the PIU
must be strengthened by the appointment of a qualified architect. Neglected buildings
earn no respect and do not fulfil their proper functions.
