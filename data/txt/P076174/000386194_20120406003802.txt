1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Indonesia’s “Big Bang? decentralization in 2001 (through Laws 22 and 25 of 1999) led to a fundamental
shift in governance and service delivery in the country, as part of the wide-ranging reforms of the post-
Suharto era. Whereas previously Indonesia had been administered largely as a centralized state,
decentralization gave responsibility for basic service delivery and most government functions (except
areas such as defense, international relations, and national economic and monetary affairs) to over 440
district and city level governments (kabupaten and kota, respectively) across the archipelago. As part of
this process, a number of central government departments in the provinces were disbanded. Some 2
million out of 3.4 million central civil servants, as well as some 16,000 facilities, were transferred to the
provinces and district governments. Law 25/99 mandated the concomitant sharing of central government
revenues with sub-national governments: at the time of project appraisal in 2004, for example, at least 25
percent of total national revenues were channeled to the sub-national level through the general allocation
grant (DAU), which represented 70 percent of district revenues.

This major shift in responsibilities and resources presented serious implementation challenges at the
district level across Indonesia. Although the basic national-level legal and procedural frameworks for
decentralization were largely in place, many district governments had limited capacities to effectively
implement the new arrangements, and to deliver on their newly expanded roles and responsibilities.
Governance and corruption-related issues presented a major concern. District budgets were opaque, with
little transparency or public consultation in their development, nor in how expenditures were made in
relation to approved budgets. Projects requiring construction or purchase of goods often offered
opportunities for civil servants to supplement their low wages through kickbacks from contractors.

Development partners in Indonesia, including the World Bank, thus had decentralization as a major
priority for support. The Partnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia, supported by UNDP, World
Bank and ADB, was a mechanism for donors to coordinate efforts on governance reform activities in the
country. In January 2005, the World Bank, DFID, UNDP, ADB and the Government of Netherlands
established a multi-donor trust fund to support decentralization. The Decentralization Support Facility
(DSF) was set up to help donors harmonize their local government programs, and to support an overall
government vision for implementing decentralization.

It was in this context that the Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Project (ILGRP) was approved by
the Bank in June 2005, following an extensive period of project preparation with the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) beginning in late 2001. The project directly supported the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia that was in place at the time of project preparation and approval. The CAS
had the main objective of assisting GOI with poverty reduction in the medium and long term through
improving the investment climate, making service delivery more responsive to the needs of the poor, and
strengthening governance including through effective implementation of decentralization and greater
local government accountability.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project development objective was to pilot support to district (kabupaten) governments in improving
transparency, accountability and public participatory practices and in undertaking reforms in financial
management and procurement. In so doing, the project brought cross-cutting reform elements together,
including more pro-poor budget allocations, to demonstrate and test reform implementation at the district



                                                     1
level. The project also provided incentives in the form of incremental poverty-targeted investment funds
to districts that completed a predefined set of minimum reforms, to finance priority rural infrastructure
identified in each district’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Plan (PRSAP).

The project’s key performance indicators (KPIs), as listed in the project appraisal document (PAD), were:
 Extent to which recommendations from consultations/public hearings are incorporated into district
   plans and regulations (perda);
 Greater public availability of information;
 Twelve district budgets show increases in poverty targeted expenditures by the end-of-project (EOP);
 Economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for project-funded infrastructure >15%;
 Greater than 12 participating district governments practicing accepted standards of procurement as
   verified by audits and studies by EOP;
 Greater than 12 participating district governments practicing sound financial management as verified
   by audits and studies by EOP; and
 Percentage increase in stakeholder satisfaction with government service delivery.

In addition, the project’s results framework identified ten output indicators associated with specific
components of the project.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The project restructuring, approved by the Bank’s Executive Directors in September 2009, did not involve
any modification of the PDO as stated in the PAD. It should be noted, however, that the PDO as stated in
the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was substantially similar, but not identical, to the PDO stated
in the PAD. The PDO in the DCA was subsequently revised in the Amendment to the DCA as part of
project restructuring, so that it became fully consistent with the PDO in the PAD.

Project restructuring also did not involve modification of the indicators per se. However, the targets
associated with three of the seven outcome/impact indicators, and seven of the ten output indicators, were
revised downwards as part of the restructuring, due to the slow fulfillment of reform requirements and
sub-project investments relative to the targets originally set in the PAD. The assessment at the midterm
review was that providing more intensive and focused support to a smaller number of districts would
yield better and more sustainable outcomes (and more value as a pilot project) than trying to expand
project involvement to more districts. Table 1 summarizes the revisions made to the targets; in some cases
the statement of the indicator is abridged to facilitate comparison of the original and revised targets.

The format of the results framework presented in the PAD (and to a certain extent also, the project
restructuring paper), did not adequately distinguish between the KPIs themselves, and the corresponding
targets set for each KPI. The list of KPIs in Section 1.2 above includes some KPIs phrased as indicators
(e.g. “Greater public availability of information?) but with no clear targets set. Some other KPIs were
phrased in a way that conflates the indicator with the target (e.g. “Twelve district budgets show increases
in poverty targeted expenditures…?). This rendered the quality of the original results framework less than
satisfactory. In addition, the indicators specified in the DCA, and the Amendment to the DCA that
accompanied project restructuring, were not identical with those in the PAD and the project restructuring
paper, respectively. It appears that the DCA and its Amendment provided greater specificity in terms of
how certain targets for the indicators were to be achieved with respect to the project implementation
timeline. Monitoring and reporting against the indicators in the project ISRs was consistent with the
indicators and targets presented in the PAD, and subsequently in the project restructuring paper.

 1.4 Main Beneficiaries

 The project’s main beneficiaries were the populations, district governments, and civil society
 organizations in the participating districts. The immediate focus of much of the project activities and
 investments were the participating district governments—including government officials and elected
 representatives—given the governance reforms, infrastructure sub-project investments, capacity building
 and institutional strengthening supported by the project. Local civil society (e.g. community-based
 organizations, local universities, and journalists) were also to benefit from project capacity building
 activities. The project also targeted national and provincial government officials with improved capacity
 in supervising, monitoring and coordinating project-related reforms in the districts.

 The ultimate beneficiaries were to be poor households in participating districts, from the direct impact of
 increased pro-poor budget allocations, and project-financed infrastructure. More broadly, all citizens in
 participating districts were to benefit indirectly from the enhanced governance and improved local
 investment climate, with greater transparency, more efficient use of public resources, and reductions in
 corruption and in the overall cost of doing business. Local contractors and businesses were to benefit in
 particular from less corrupt procurement and permitting processes.

 1.5 Original Components

 The project had three components:

 Component A: Local Governance Reform (USD 1.3 million) to continue supporting kabupatens
 (districts) that had participated in project preparation (batch 1, approximately 15 districts) and met project
 entry requirements, to undertake more advanced reforms to meet the minimum pre-investment and
 investment requirements stipulated in the project’s Local Governance Reform Framework.
 Simultaneously, starting in the second year of project implementation, about 25 additional districts (batch


                                                       3
2) were to be selected to participate in the project and assisted over a period of 18 to 24 months, in
meeting the minimum pre-investment requirements. Sub-components included:
    A1. Reform of the District Planning and Budgeting Process, focused on the enhancement of
          participation and on strengthening links with local pro-poor priorities;
    A2. Reform of District Budget Implementation and Financial Management and Reporting,
          improving local procurement and financial management practices; and
    A3. Strengthening Accountability Mechanisms, increasing information disclosure and cross-district
          networking.

Component B: Poverty Targeted Investments (USD 31.2 million) to provide incremental financing to
approximately 15 (batch 1) districts for pro-poor development expenditures identified and prioritized
through an enhanced planning process linked to the development of the district PRSAPs. Investment
funds for the batch 2 districts were to come from a subsequent project, the design of which was to be
informed by the experience and lessons coming out of this project.

As described in the PAD, this component financed sub-project investments in participating districts, for
the construction, rehabilitation or upgrading of infrastructure. Eligible sub-sectors (summarized in Table 2
of the PAD) included water supply and sanitation, energy supply, transportation, irrigation and flood
protection, and community buildings/facilities.

Component C: Implementation Support (USD 13.6 million) to fund specialized technical, facilitation
and monitoring support for the activities in components A and B at the district, regional and national
levels. Sub-components included:
    C1. General Facilitation and Specialized Technical Assistance to provide facilitation and technical
          assistance to the districts;
    C2. Capacity Building and Institutional Training to provide for training to district staff and other
          local stakeholders to institute governance reforms; and
    C3. Monitoring, Evaluation and Studies/Surveys to support the overall monitoring and evaluation
          framework for the project, and to finance studies on local governance.

1.6 Revised Components

The project restructuring maintained the three basic project components, as listed in Section 1.5 above.
However, a number of significant changes were made to the project, which affected the scope and
implementation of all project components. These are described in Section 1.7 below.

1.7 Other significant changes

The following significant changes were made to the project at restructuring, as described in the project
restructuring paper:

Reduction in number of participating districts: The project was limited to the initial core of 14
districts (batch 1), and did not add 26 additional districts (batch 2), as had been envisioned in the PAD.
(See Annex 2 for a list of the 14 core districts in batch 1.)

Simplification of the project’s Local Governance Reform Framework: Six specific reforms were
dropped – including one in the area of procurement and four in the area of financial management. Annex
2 includes a summary of the original Local Governance Reform Framework, as well as the changes made
and rationale for these changes at the time of project restructuring.




                                                     4
Reallocation of project funds to reward performing districts: Funds for sub-project investments in
non-performing districts, and funds from the unused portion of the DFID grant for Component C (in the
amount of GBP 2.265 million), were reallocated for additional sub-project investments in performing
districts.

Realignment of technical assistance support to the districts: Consultant positions at the national and
regional levels were reduced in view of the reduction in the number of participating districts, with
regional consultants located in two, instead of three, regions.

Extension of the project closing date: The project closing date was extended by 24 months, to
September 30, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis. The PAD and other documents related to project preparation reflected
a well-grounded understanding of the issues related to governance reforms at the district level, which was
broadly shared by GOI and the Bank. The Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS) undertaken
during project preparation covered 177 districts, including the 60 districts initially identified for project
participation. GDS assessed stakeholder perceptions on themes including participation, effectiveness and
efficiency, transparency, the rule of law, responsiveness, accountability and conflict management. Several
important factors were also identified as being crucial for the success of sub-national governance reforms,
including more active civil society, higher levels of public participation and political awareness, and
reform-minded sub-national governments.

The Bank’s task team noted that existing projects on decentralization in Indonesia focused mostly on
capacity building, technical assistance, and improved service delivery. The project accordingly
emphasized broader cross-sectoral reforms (on transparency, participation, financial management and
procurement), and included a component for infrastructure investments linked to poverty alleviation. The
project design also took into account other Bank projects related to decentralized governance in Indonesia,
including the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), the Urban Poverty Project (UPP) and the Urban
Sector Development Reforms Program (USDRP), as well as Bank projects related to community-driven
development and governance in Brazil, India and Mexico.

Assessment of Project Design. In retrospect, the project design was ambitious, and reflected overly high
expectations, on the parts of both GOI and the Bank, of what could be realistically achieved with the
districts, given implementation capacities at the central and district levels. This can be seen in terms of
what the project expected participating districts to achieve, and the timeframe for doing so. The project’s
Local Governance Reform Framework (see Annex 2) consisted of a long list of over three dozen reform
requirements for participating districts, in the areas of transparency and participation, PRSAPs, financial
management, and procurement. The approved project design entailed a phased approach, with the
fulfillment of reform requirements by participating districts structured into four phases: entry (to
participate in the project), pre-investment (prior to the release of funds for sub-project investments), and
Year 1 and Year 2 sub-project investments. Six of these requirements were subsequently dropped during
project restructuring (see Annex 2); the reasons given included that some of these requirements were no
longer valid, no longer relevant, or simply too difficult for the districts to achieve.

The project design was scaled back during the restructuring, and focused on fewer regions and districts
than originally planned. The expectation during preparation was that a new GOI on-granting mechanism



                                                     5
for sub-national governments would become effective during implementation in order to allow for a
scaling up of the project reforms to additional districts. The project design also assumed that the second
batch of around 40 districts would undertake the specified reforms without the incentive of sub-project
investment funds. This phased approach assumed that a “snowball? effect would emerge, with the initial
encouragement of innovation among reform-minded districts leading to the broad dissemination of best
practices, and ultimately to the scaling-up of the project’s reforms nationally. At the time of project
closure, this scaling-up had not occurred, and indeed the project restructuring dropped all plans to expand
the project activities beyond the core first batch of 14 districts. With hindsight, these assumptions made
during project preparation turned out to be overly optimistic.

Government Commitment and Stakeholder Participation. Given the overall context for decentralization as
described in Section 1.1 above, there was significant appetite among all parties—the central government,
the district governments, development partners, and civil society organizations—to undertake projects
and activities in support of decentralization. Significant efforts were made by the Bank during project
preparation to consult and ensure coherence with the ongoing programs of GOI agencies, the districts
themselves, and other development partners—including ADB, DFID, the Ford Foundation, GTZ,
UNICEF, and USAID. A succession of field visits to candidate districts resulted in the shortlisting of the
first batch of less than 20 districts (out of the original 60) according to selection criteria that included the
level of poverty (with a preference for poorer districts), willingness and commitment on the part of the
district government, and geographical clustering within selected provinces. The basic response to limited
understanding and capacities at the district level was to provide more “socialization? and facilitation
support for the districts. The PHRD grant obtained during project preparation allowed for the recruitment
of district-level facilitators (F-kab) who facilitated activities such as multi-stakeholder forums and the
development of PRSAPs at the district level. In this regard, commencing reform-related activities during
the project preparation phase helped to increase the likelihood of successful project implementation.

Assessment of Risks. A comprehensive risk assessment was undertaken as part of project preparation.
Procurement and financial management aspects at the district level were identified as being high risk,
particularly in relation to the sub-project investments (Component B). Specific risks related to local
governance reforms (Component A) were mostly rated as Substantial or Modest, with the overall project
risk rated as Substantial. Two specific risks identified in the PAD turned out to be particularly relevant
during project implementation – that the procurement and mobilization of project staff would be
inefficient and delayed (substantial risk), and that capacity building activities would not be delivered in a
timely manner (modest risk). With hindsight, the risk mitigation measures identified – the project
procurement plan prepared prior to negotiations, and the recruitment of regional consultants, respectively
– were insufficient (see also Section 2.2 below).

2.2 Implementation

Factors at the Level of GOI Overall. Loan negotiations were delayed as the existing GOI regulatory
framework did not support on-granting of funds to districts with limited fiscal capacities. The intended
project design was for the sub-project investment funds to be managed and utilized by the districts as part
of their APBD (i.e. as on-budget funds), which was consistent with the project objectives to strengthen
planning and budgeting at the district level. As this turned out not to be possible due to GOI regulations,
sub-project funds were instead channeled to the districts through the tugas pembantuan (co-
management/task assistance) mechanism. This had additional implications for project implementation, as
the assets constructed with sub-project funds were considered to belong to the central government, and
had to be formally transferred to the districts following completion.

Another key factor that affected project implementation was the continued evolution of the overall system
of decentralized governance in Indonesia, following its initial implementation in 2001. Prior to project


                                                       6
 approval, the decentralization laws were revised in September 2004 with the passage of Laws 32 and 33
 of 2004. Key changes introduced by these laws included the direct election of district heads (bupati),
 review of district budgets by the province on behalf of the central government, a greater role for the
 province in monitoring district performance, and new requirements for local borrowing. During the years
 of project implementation, additional laws and regulations on decentralization were introduced (see Table
 2 below for selected examples). District governments in Indonesia were thus operating in an environment
 in which the legal and regulatory framework regularly introduced new demands and requirements. As can
 be seen in Table 2, the ILGRP Local Governance Reform Framework was largely consistent with the
 laws and regulations that were subsequently introduced. Districts participating in the project were thus
 better able to comply with the new laws and regulations, because of the project.

  Table 2. Laws and Regulations Introduced During Project Implementation, and Relationship with
  ILGRP Reforms
 Reform Area      Law/Regulation                      Relationship with ILGRP Reforms
Poverty          Perpres 54/2005   Districts required to develop district-level poverty reduction strategies
reduction                          (SPKD). Through ILGRP, participating districts had developed
strategies/plans                   detailed poverty reduction strategies and action plans (PRSAPs),
                                   which guided sub-project investments. District PRSAPs, prepared
                                   several years before, formed the basis of the new SPKDs.
Transparency     Law 14/2008       Districts encouraged to increase transparency in governance. ILGRP
                                   districts had been supported in introducing local regulations (perda)
                                   on transparency and participation, and were thus leaders in applying
                                   principles of transparency in district governance.
Financial        Permendagri       ILGRP reforms on financial management were fully consistent with
management       13/2006           this directive of the Minister of Home Affairs.
Procurement      Perpres 54/2010,  ILGRP reforms on procurement were consistent with the requirements
of goods and     which superseded of this presidential decree, including the establishment of procurement
services         Keppres 80/2003   units at the district level, and the requirement for all procurement
                                   officials at the district level to have professional certification.

 Factors at the Level of the Implementing Agency. One main factor that created difficulties for project
 implementation can be termed as management or administrative issues due to limited capacity on the part
 of the implementing agency – the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) – and at the National Project
 Secretariat (NPS), which came under the purview of MOHA. One issue was related to the work units
 (satker) at the NPS. Delays resulted from MOHA not appointing these work units on time, including the
 procurement and financial management teams of the NPS. Another issue was related to procurement,
 where limited capacity on consultant procurement at MOHA resulted in slow and unsatisfactory selection
 of consultants, including the NMCs who were intended to support NPS. A further set of issues was related
 to financial management where consultants and facilitators experienced delays in receiving payments,
 contract renewals were often late, and reimbursements for travel to the districts were slow, with no
 provision of cash advances for travel expenses.

 The major impact of these project management and administrative issues at MOHA and NPS was limited
 facilitation and support for participating districts. The project design anticipated having 110 project staff
 supporting project implementation, with half of these based at the district level. However, the issues that
 emerged with regard to putting these staff in place meant that districts did not receive the intensive
 support that had been planned. Redoubled efforts on the part of MOHA and NPS beginning in 2008 did
 enable the successful conclusion of the project by 2011, according to the targets modified through project
 restructuring. It is arguable, however, that the final number of participating districts would have been




                                                      7
higher, with a higher quality of reforms achieved, had implementation support to these districts been
better.

Project Restructuring. The first three years of project implementation, from 2006 to 2009, saw serious
delays that spanned all three project components. Progress in Component A, on local governance reforms
in participating districts, was slow relative to the planned schedule. It was only at the time of the MTR, in
the third year of project implementation, that a total of 11 districts had fulfilled the third phase (“Year 1?)
of required reforms. Progress on Component B was better than anticipated in terms of the number of
investment sub-projects implemented in participating districts, but these too experienced delays as sub-
project proposals were not verified in a timely manner by the NPS, and the slow flow of investment funds
to the districts resulted in these funds being carried over from 2006 to 2007, and then to 2008. Poor
progress on Component C impeded the implementation of other project components. Implementation
progress, project management, financial management and procurement were all rated “moderately
unsatisfactory? in the three ISRs undertaken in January 2008, June 2008, and January 2009.

The project was thus restructured in September 2009, following the Mid-term Review (MTR) earlier that
same year. The MTR recommended project restructuring to reduce the number of participating districts,
and concomitantly the number of project staff, to levels that were more realistic given the delays and
limited progress up to 2009. By extending the project’s closing date, scoping down the targets for
governance reforms, and focusing on fewer districts, project restructuring allowed the project to get back
on track and to start registering satisfactory performance at subsequent supervisions. The key changes
made as part of the project restructuring are described in sections 1.3 and 1.7 above.

Other Factors. A discussion of factors at the district level that contributed to the successful
implementation of local governance reforms is contained in Section 6 below, on lessons learned.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The PAD envisioned that the project M&E system would provide continuous learning and
feedback from a combination of internal monitoring, external monitoring and independent evaluation. For
internal monitoring, a management information system (MIS) would enable data to be collected and
entered at the district level, stored in a master database, and accessible at national and district levels.
District governments, RMCs and F-kabs were all to submit monthly reports to the NPS. Within each
district, F-kabs were also to use special activity feedback forms to obtain stakeholder feedback, with the
PAD also stating the intent to use these feedback forms on a longitudinal basis from one year to the next.
For external monitoring and independent evaluation, a project M&E secretariat at BAPPENAS was to
manage several activities, including annual reviews of poverty strategies and budget planning, an
economic evaluation of sub-project investments, assessments of procurement and financial reforms,
qualitative studies of governance reforms, and mid-term and final project evaluations. As already
mentioned in Section 1.3 above, the project’s results framework and indicators therein were less than
satisfactory, which constituted a weakness in the project’s M&E design.

Implementation. The implementation of project M&E fell substantially short of that intended in the
project design. This can be attributed principally to the project management and administration
difficulties described in Section 2.2 above. The M&E specialist was only recruited in late 2008, the
complaints handling specialist was terminated due to poor performance and then not replaced, and the
MIS specialist position was never filled. These positions were subsequently eliminated as part of project
restructuring by mutual agreement between GOI and the Bank following the MTR. The MIS was never
fully operationalized, while regular and systematic submission and analysis of monthly reports from the
districts was not achieved – there were neither proper incentives for compliant reporting nor sanctions for
lack of compliance. External M&E through BAPPENAS, which had a separate management structure and


                                                      8
budget allocation for these activities, were generally comprehensive. The external M&E reports –
including on the mid-term and final evaluations – are rich in information and detail.

Utilization. The shortcomings in design and implementation (including staffing) of M&E compromised
its value when it came to utilization. Rather than improving the management and implementation of the
project, the sophisticated and layered M&E design in this project appears to have placed an additional
burden on project execution. BAPPENAS’ final evaluation report argues that separating the internal and
external monitoring functions rendered M&E less effective. Coordination and follow-up between NPS
and the M&E secretariat at BAPPENAS was weak throughout the project. Despite the good quality of the
external M&E reports, their findings on implementation problems in the field did not spur specific
meetings or actions to resolve these, and so did not influence subsequent project implementation as had
been intended in the project design. Yet, even if there had been a single, integrated project M&E function,
the question still remains as to what would have been the right balance between designing comprehensive
M&E, and being realistic about capacity limitations to undertake such M&E and to act on its findings.

One particular shortcoming in project M&E merits separate mention here, due to its impact on the
assessment of project outcomes in this ICR. The final administration of the GDS did not take place
because of project management issues. Following project restructuring, reconciliation and recalculation of
the balance of the project budget available for the final GDS was not done promptly enough to enable the
procurement of a contractor in time. The lack of final GDS findings, which would have included a survey
of governance reforms in districts not participating in the project, thus limited the assessment of project
outcomes in this ICR. Without this final GDS, there is no readily available quantitative data or evidence
(apart from some qualitative or anecdotal information, see Section 3.3 below) from non-participating
districts to assess if the project itself actually had a significant impact on governance reforms in
participating districts, and the extent of such impact.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards. Three safeguard policies were triggered during project preparation: Environmental
Assessment, Indigenous Peoples, and Involuntary Resettlement. As described in the PAD, frameworks on
environment, indigenous peoples, and land acquisition and resettlement were developed as part of the
project’s Safeguards Framework, and included in the Project Operational Manual, which also offered
detailed guidance on implementation. Safeguards monitoring during project implementation focused
primarily on the execution of the multiple sub-project investments in participating districts. Safeguards
reviews undertaken regularly throughout project supervision found that the project design and framework
for safeguards were sound, and that there were no serious negative impacts from the sub-project
investments. Minor safeguards issues identified during field visits to sub-project sites (e.g. erosion-prone
slopes at a roads sub-project) were documented in aide-memoires and followed up by both the GOI/NPS
and Bank teams. Although good practices with regard to social safeguards were not formally part of the
Local Governance Reform Framework, the project offered the potential opportunity to develop capacity at
the district level on safeguards. The weaknesses in project implementation, however, meant that this
opportunity was not realized.

Financial Management. Project financial management (FM) performance was rated moderately
unsatisfactory prior to project restructuring, but subsequently improved and was found to be generally
good. As noted in Section 2.2 above: prior to project restructuring, FM issues were mainly related to
difficulties and delays in GOI level budgeting and appointment of work units (satkers), and payments for
consultants. Quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMRs) were often late, due to delays in receiving
underlying reports from participating districts. Following project restructuring, these FM issues were
largely addressed, and satisfactory FMRs were submitted in a timely manner. By the time of project
closure, the FY07, 08, 09, and 10 audit reports had all been received on time, with the auditors providing


                                                     9
unqualified opinions on the financial statements. However, the Bank task team noted that some follow-up
actions on the findings from previous years’ audits were still outstanding. These were mainly related to
improvements to internal controls for project management and also at the district level.

Procurement. Procurement performance of the project had been rated moderately unsatisfactory for most
of the period prior to project restructuring. This was due to the procurement issues for project
management and implementation (for example, recruitment of the national and regional consultants, and
for project M&E functions) as described in Section 2.2 above. There were no major procurement issues
that arose from sub-projects, although four formal complaints on sub-project procurement were received
and resolved, as described in Section 2.3 above.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The possibility of Additional Financing for ILGRP was discussed by GOI and the Bank during 2010, but
was not pursued. This was at least in part due to the recognition by both GOI and the Bank that: (i) the
scope and extent of the project’s governance reforms had been highly ambitious; (ii) the record of
achievement and sustainability of these reforms in participating districts has been mixed (see Section 3
below); (iii) project implementation by GOI had proven to be challenging, and thus (iv) any future
expansion to additional districts would require a reassessment of the implementation approach. At the
same time, the issues and needs relating to decentralization in Indonesia remain largely as they were at the
time of project appraisal (as described in Section 1.1 above) – the more than 400 districts across Indonesia
have significant devolved roles and responsibilities, but most have limited capacities. Levels of
transparency and public participation are low, and corruption remains a serious concern. Another Bank
project that is currently under implementation in Indonesia, on decentralization at the district level, is the
Local Government and Decentralization Project (LGDP) – see Section 3.5 for more information. The
planned PforR project will follow up directly on the district-level governance reforms supported by the
project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives. The PDO is assessed as highly relevant as it sought to directly strengthen governance at the
district level, as part of Indonesia’s system of decentralized governance that continues to evolve. Effective
implementation of decentralization reforms that began with the “Big Bang? in 2001 is an explicit aim of
GOI, and a particular priority for MOHA. The PDO was consistent with the CAS at the time of project
preparation, which sought to strengthen governance through effective implementation of decentralization
and greater local government accountability, as well as with the current CPS for FY2009-2012, which
focuses on investing in Indonesia’s institutions, including through cross-cutting engagements on sub-
national government institutions and systems.

Design. The project design was highly relevant to the agenda of decentralization at the district level in
Indonesia. Component A of the project focused on key aspects of district-level governance, including
transparency, public participation, planning and budgeting, financial management, and procurement.
These aspects are procedural/process-related or administrative in nature, but are essential to good
governance in any context. Component B of the project, on poverty-targeted investments in the
infrastructure sub-sectors, provided an important incentive for participating districts, and also contributed
to GOI and Bank objectives to reduce poverty in Indonesia. The use of a Specific Investment Loan (SIL)
as the lending instrument was also the most relevant choice for the project design. The PAD describes
how alternative instruments were considered and rejected: “adjustment lending? was rejected because of



                                                     10
the need to provide intensive facilitation and capacity building at the district level, as well as funding for
sub-project investments; an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was rejected as it would have required a
commitment to a longer-term program when the intent of the project was to pilot and test support for
district governance reforms.

Implementation. Despite the challenges encountered and initial delays, the implementation of project
activities was directly relevant to the needs and priorities of GOI and participating districts. As illustrated
in Table 2 in Section 2.2 above, the reforms supported by the project – in particular through the project’s
Local Governance Reform Framework – remained relevant for participating districts, even as the overall
system of decentralized governance continued to evolve with new laws and regulations over the years.
The 262 investment sub-projects implemented in the infrastructure sub-sectors (see also Annex 2) were of
high benefit to local communities. With hindsight, however, project implementation would have been
even more relevant and effective if the engagement of consultants to provide the planned facilitation and
support had proceeded smoothly, and if ongoing M&E findings had been brought to bear more closely on
project execution.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO – to pilot support to district governments in improving transparency, accountability and public
participatory practices and in undertaking reforms in financial management and procurement – is assessed
to have been achieved, based on the outcome/impact indicators specified in the project’s results
framework. As described in Section F of the Data Sheet, targets were met for all of the following
indicators: public consultations on local budgets and regulations were undertaken in at least 12 districts;
district budgets and procurement plans were publicly announced in at least 12 districts; more than ten
districts were found to have acceptable standards of both financial management and procurement; and
stakeholder satisfaction with government service delivery increased from 60 percent in 2006 to 82 percent
by the time the project ended in 2011. Only one indicator, on increases in poverty-targeted expenditures,
failed to meet the target of 10 districts, with only 4 districts (Bandung, Bulukumba, Kebumen and
Bolaang Mongondow) showing an increase between 2008 and 2010.

The outcomes achieved by the project can be seen to have been causally linked to the output indicators for
Component A on local governance reform – the specific outputs related to public participation, pro-poor
planning and expenditures, and financial management and procurement contributed directly to the
outcome indicators in those areas. The poverty-targeted investments in Component B contributed to the
overall PDO outcome, in that project funding for these sub-projects was an important incentive for
participating district governments to undertake the governance reforms of Component A. The facilitation
and technical assistance outputs of Component C also contributed to the achievement of the reforms of
Component A. Annex 2 provides more information on the outputs achieved by each project component,
and the associated output indicators.

The specification of the outcome indicators and targets in the results framework presented in the PAD
(and to a certain extent also, the project restructuring paper), was in some respects less than satisfactory.
First, two outcome/impact indicators were phrased vaguely without specific quantitative targets: “Extent
to which recommendations from consultations/public hearings are incorporated…?, and “Greater public
availability of information…?. Second, another outcome/impact indicator cannot be seen to have
contributed to the PDO directly: “EIRR for project-funded infrastructure? (in any case, investment sub-
projects achieved an average EIRR of 24.6%, exceeding the target of at least 15%). On balance, however,
these do not affect the overall conclusion that the PDO was achieved.

It should also be pointed out that if the wording of the PDO is read in the strict sense, which was simply
to “pilot? (i.e. to test or to initiate) the provision of “support? on governance reforms in participating


                                                      11
districts – then the project can certainly be said to have achieved the PDO, regardless of the degree of
success of actual reforms in the participating districts. But surely any objective assessment of the project
should also examine the extent to which the intended reforms were effective or successful in participating
districts. Based on the outcome indicators discussed above, this ICR concludes that the extent of actual
reforms realized in participating districts does support the view that the PDO was achieved.

Beyond the results framework itself, perhaps one of the most telling indicators of improved financial
management at the district level would be the outcomes of annual audits of the districts by BPK,
Indonesia’s supreme audit institution. In 2009, one district, Tanah Datar, received an unqualified audit
opinion. Most districts have been receiving qualified audit opinions, mostly due to poor asset
management. Yet, this represents an improvement over earlier years of the project where some districts
had audit results with adverse opinions or disclaimers of opinion. While improved audit results cannot be
attributed entirely to the project, it would be fair to say that the general trend of improvement was in part
due to project-supported reforms in district FM and procurement practices.

There was also insufficient evidence to assess if the project was indeed responsible for improvements in
governance reforms in participating districts, or if some districts would have undertaken some of these
reforms on their own anyway. As described in Section 2.2 and Table 2, the overall system of
decentralized governance in Indonesia has continued to evolve, with new laws and regulations issued
from year to year. Participating districts were selected in part due to their “reform-mindedness?, which
was a pre-existing condition prior to the project. The lack of a final Governance and Decentralization
Survey, as noted in Section 2.3 above, means that definitive conclusions cannot be drawn here. But there
is some evidence of governance reforms taking place at the district level more generally. For instance, in
its issue of Aug 17-23, 2009, Tempo, an influential weekly news magazine in Indonesia, included two
participating districts in its list of nine “star districts? from across the country, for their innovations in
governance to improve public services. Four other ILGRP participating districts were also cited by the
magazine. But the fact remains that seven other “star districts? identified by Tempo were not in fact
project participants.

3.3 Efficiency

More than two-thirds of the project’s expenditure, $31.9 million out of a total project cost of $46.3
million, was spent on sub-project investments in the infrastructure sub-sectors under Component B of the
project. The PAD itself did not provide figures for net present value (NPV) or EIRR for Component B
because the programmatic and demand-driven nature of the project design, where sub-projects were not
defined or identified ex-ante, did not allow for detailed cost-benefit calculations during project
preparation. Annex 2 summarizes the actual outputs delivered, and Annex 3 discusses the net benefits and
economic returns from these sub-project investments. Based on EIRRs that ranged between 20 percent
and 31 percent from a sample of completed sub-projects (see Annex 3 for more information), the sub-
project investments can be assessed to have been efficient and cost-effective overall, generating net
benefits in the range of those seen in similar investments in small-scale rural infrastructure in Indonesia.

It should also be mentioned, however, that both the GOI and Bank teams involved in implementation
support for the project found the sub-projects to be administratively burdensome to supervise. Although
the number of participating districts ended up being lower than originally planned, the final number of
262 sub-projects was far higher than the 93 or so anticipated in the PAD. In line with the project design
and as provided for in the project operations manual, participating districts were required to prepare and
submit documentation on each proposed sub-project to the NPS for approval, including a detailed
engineering design, activity/work plan, environmental and social safeguards, and analysis of net benefits.
Monitoring of sub-project execution included reviewing procurement processes, following up on
engineering and safeguard issues, and checking for adequate engineering quality and final completion. It


                                                     12
was this experience that significantly influenced the design of an output-based approach – which involves
verifying outputs rather than supervising execution – for similar district-level infrastructure investments
under the LGDP project (see also Section 3.5).

The project overall fell significantly short of the level of efficiency targeted in the PAD. For example,
among the output indicators in the project’s results framework, it was expected that 40 districts would
meet the basic project entry requirements, and that 32 districts would have taken steps on local
regulations related to public consultation and access to information, and also implemented action plans
for reforms in financial management and procurement. With project restructuring, these targets were
reduced to between 10 and 14 districts, and were largely achieved. As envisioned in the PAD, most of the
expenditures for implementing the governance reforms of Component A were covered by participating
districts, but some $8.2 million was ultimately spent through Component C to support the implementation
of components A and B of the project. In other words, the project ended up spending almost two-thirds as
much as originally intended for implementation support, for work in only one-third the planned number
of districts. More generally, is a sum of $8.2 million to pilot governance reforms in 14 districts – or about
$600,000 per district – over a planned period of three years which ended up being extended to five years,
reasonably cost-effective? Given the ambitious agenda for governance reforms, the answer is probably
yes. But this is unlikely to represent a model that can be feasibly scaled up to the almost 500 districts
across Indonesia.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome of the project is rated as being moderately satisfactory. The project’s objectives and
design were highly relevant to the decentralization agenda in Indonesia. Despite the challenges and delays
with project implementation, on balance implementation was relevant to the needs and priorities of GOI
and participating districts, in terms of the governance reforms supported and the poverty-targeted sub-
project investments that were funded. The PDO was achieved, and participating districts implemented
various governance reforms. The completion of 262 sub-project investments was cost-effective in
delivering a range of net benefits for local beneficiaries. Taken together, all these elements would suggest
a satisfactory rating for project outcomes. However, the project’s final achievements were scaled back
through project restructuring, mainly due to a combination of an overly ambitious project design and
weak implementation prior to restructuring. This meant that the project’s overall efficiency was lower
than planned, with project funds utilized to deliver outcomes in a smaller set of districts.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Institutional Strengthening of District Governments

As mentioned above, by supporting district governments in undertaking governance reforms, the project
contributed directly to strengthening district-level government institutions, particularly in the annual
planning and budgeting process, financial management, and procurement. The various reforms specified
in the Local Governance Reform Framework (see Annex 2) strengthened the effectiveness of district
government operations, thus also helping to improve service delivery to local residents. With the project’s
support, participating districts also undertook various innovations in governance and institutional
arrangements. For example, the district of Lebak established its Commission on Transparency and
Participation (KTP), with independent commissioners. Solok district established an independent
complaints handling unit, and a centralized procurement unit. During Capacity Building workshops, the
districts exchanged experiences, best practices and lessons learnt.



                                                     13
A related Bank project that is currently under implementation in Indonesia is the Local Government and
Decentralization Project (LGDP), through which the Bank continues to support decentralization in
Indonesia at the district level. LGDP focuses on the accountability and reporting of the central
government’s Specific Allocation Grants (DAK) to pilot districts, in the infrastructure sub-sectors. DAK
funds are a significant component of overall GOI transfers to district governments, and LGDP thus seeks
to strengthen the institutional arrangements related to a key fiscal transfer mechanism in Indonesia. The
experience of ILGRP implementation had a significant influence on the LGDP project design, which
utilizes an output-based approach to reimburse GOI based on verified, eligible outputs in the LGDP pilot
districts. The Local Government and Decentralization Project took lessons directly from ILGRP and
incorporated them into the project’s design.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The overall risk to the development outcome is rated as moderate. The main element of this risk is the
issue of sustainability of governance reforms in participating districts, should districts “backslide? by
weakening reforms or even abandon some reforms altogether. There is a real risk of this happening. The
experience with non-performing districts during project implementation, which led to the reduction in the
number of participating districts, shows how difficult implementing and sustaining governance reforms
can be. On the other hand, the overall context of decentralized governance in Indonesia is conducive to
reform: there is commitment to the reform agenda at the highest levels of the central government, the
legislative and regulatory frameworks for decentralization both require and encourage districts to improve
governance, district heads and other elected officials do face electoral pressures to perform well in their
duties, and civil society and community level demands and expectations for better governance continue to
grow. Moreover, in those cases where there is local legislation (perda) on a particular reform, or a central
government law or regulation requiring compliance, the likelihood that the relevant reforms will be
sustained is higher. Section 6 considers some of the lessons learned from the project, including the key
factors that enable successful reforms to take place.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank team preparing the project worked through the three-year period of project preparation,
undertaking several background studies and engaging in extensive consultations, including with
development partners and potential participating districts. All this was done in close collaboration with
GOI, where BAPPENAS was the main counterpart agency. In general, the Bank’s efforts in project
preparation showed adequate thoroughness and due diligence with regard to the project design, including
consideration of potential risks related to project implementation. Yet, the Bank clearly underestimated
the capacity limitations at GOI – and in particular at the executing agency, MOHA – which led to the
subsequent problems and delays during project implementation. The Bank’s task team was probably also
being overly ambitious first with the entire set of governance reforms supported by the project, with the
added complexity of the sub-project investments. We should ask if the project design set up the districts
and GOI to succeed, or if instead there was a significant likelihood that project restructuring to scope
down the project’s targets was going to be necessary eventually. This ICR concludes that the Bank could
quite reasonably have expected project implementation to have been successful, but that the downside


                                                    14
risks were also not appreciated fully. For this reason, the Bank’s preparation performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory, instead of satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was challenging as the project was being implemented in 14 districts across 9 provinces.
Supervision of project implementation by the Bank team was close and careful. Missions were undertaken
regularly, as often as twice a year at some points. These included field visits to participating districts
where all aspects of project implementation, including both governance reforms and execution of sub-
project investments, were reviewed. Field visits together with NPS staff and in coordination with district
governments, RMC and F-kabs, where available, were the norm. The supervision effort was largely
performed by the Bank’s office in Jakarta, allowing for long mission durations that covered all project
aspects comprehensively. Implementation issues were clearly identified and documented in Aide-
Memoires, which contained long and clear lists of items that required time-bound follow-up actions.
There was some sentiment on the part of GOI, expressed in its own project completion report, that the
Bank’s close supervision amounted to micromanagement, but this was probably unavoidable given the
delays encountered in project implementation.

The decision to restructure the project was a critical one, and is judged here to have been the correct and
appropriate response to the problems and delays encountered with project implementation. By extending
the project’s closing date, reducing the number of participating districts, and scoping down the targets for
governance reforms, project restructuring allowed the project to get back on track and to start registering
satisfactory performance at subsequent supervisions. Restructuring was also key to the project’s
successful conclusion, thereby ultimately avoiding an overall unsatisfactory rating in this ICR. Perhaps
the only question that could be raised in this regard is whether restructuring could have been undertaken
earlier, thus also enabling project completion sooner. The mid-term review was only undertaken in early
2009, when the project was originally scheduled to close later that same year; despite delays in
implementation, earlier action on the part of the Bank during 2008 may have been more effective than
waiting until 2009.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

On balance, the Bank’s performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. Efforts during project preparation
and supervision were careful and thorough overall, including through project restructuring. As described
in the sections above, the Bank fulfilled its roles in preparation and supervision as well as may be
reasonably expected, given the circumstances and constraints faced, while also maintaining a positive and
constructive relationship with GOI and participating district governments. However, the shortcomings
and complexity in project design mean that the overall rating is moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government of Indonesia’s overall commitment to the success of decentralization is well reflected in
the continued evolution of the legal and regulatory framework for decentralization. There was also clearly
commitment and interest from GOI, and in particular from BAPPENAS, during the period of project
preparation. However, evidence of broad-based and high level support for the project’s objective across
GOI agencies is questionable, especially given the fact that the project’s National Steering Committee


                                                    15
(comprised of high level representatives from various GOI ministries and agencies) never met in person
throughout the years of project preparation and implementation. Although working level meetings and
coordination took place as needed, the attention, guidance and support of a high level committee would
have contributed to more effective project implementation. For these reasons, government performance is
rated as moderately satisfactory instead of satisfactory.

Since the participating district governments were not the borrower (in this case, GOI), their performance
is more closely related to project objectives and outcomes. In this respect, the participating district
governments deserve recognition for their achievements in implementing the Local Governance Reform
Framework and executing the sub-project investments. Participating districts undertook successive phases
of reform as required by the Framework, at times even without the technical assistance and facilitation
that had been promised by the project due to delays in the recruitment of consultants. In addition, they
completed all 262 sub-project investments, which far exceeded initial expectations. However, it should
also be recognized that there were a number of non-performing districts that ended up being excluded
from continued involvement in the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Ministry of Home Affairs and NPS, which came under MOHA’s purview, generally performed
unsatisfactorily up to the time of project restructuring. The difficulties that began with the delay in
fulfilling effectiveness conditions were compounded by subsequent delays in project implementation.
These difficulties spanned a number of areas, including overall project management, procurement of
NMCs, RMCs and F-kabs, and project financial management. The underlying causes were partly systemic
(such as when funding for sub-projects could not be provided through the on-granting mechanism), and
partly administrative due to lack of capacity at MOHA, as described in earlier sections of this ICR. It
should be noted that the administrative difficulties experienced under ILGRP are regularly encountered in
project implementation by other GOI agencies as well.

Leading up to the MTR and following the project’s restructuring, the NPS became increasingly proactive
in managing the project. Due recognition should be given to the redoubled efforts of MOHA and NPS,
from 2008 onwards, to address many of issues with project implementation. Through these efforts and
following project restructuring, the project got back on track and subsequently avoided further delays.
Project implementation improved significantly and became generally satisfactory through to project
closure. Separately, the performance of the M&E secretariat at BAPPENAS was satisfactory overall, in
terms of the M&E outputs produced and their quality. What was somewhat lacking was closer integration
of M&E findings into the actual management of the project.

Overall, the performance of the implementing agencies is rated moderately satisfactory. Despite the
satisfactory performance registered after project restructuring, the fact remains that performance during
initial implementation fell below expectations.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

On balance, the overall rating of borrower performance is moderately satisfactory. This is in recognition
of the significant outcomes delivered at the district level by participating district governments, in terms of
governance reforms and the sub-project investments, and thus the overall project outcome which is rated
moderately satisfactory. Despite the initially unsatisfactory performance of the implementing agency, this
overall rating of moderately satisfactory also recognizes the efforts made to turn around implementation,
which became satisfactory after project restructuring.

6. Lessons Learned

There are two main categories of lessons learned from this project: one category is lessons on supporting
governance reforms at the district level, and the other category is on project design and management.
These lessons are collectively derived from the project’s final evaluation report, GOI’s project completion
report, and the Bank’s task team.

(a) Lessons on district-level governance reforms

An enabling external environment is necessary for governance reforms at the district level. A necessary
but not sufficient condition for successful governance reforms at the district level is the existence of an
enabling external environment within which districts can then undertake their reforms. Several key
ingredients have been identified as contributing to such an enabling environment. One is the existence of
an adequate legal and regulatory framework. In the context of Indonesia, this refers specifically to the
framework of national laws and regulations related to decentralization, which specifies the roles and
responsibilities of the districts as well as the resources given to the districts to discharge these functions.
Another ingredient is the availability of capacity building and technical assistance to the districts. This
can take various forms, such as offering training to district civil servants on specific topic areas, or
providing technical guidance materials on implementing certain reforms. A third ingredient, and one that
was a particularly important part of the project design, is the provision of specific incentives to undertake
reforms. In the case of ILGRP, this incentive was in the form of funds for sub-project investments, and
was structured in such a way as to become available following a district’s achievement of specified
reforms.

Successful district-level governance reforms require strong district leadership and dynamic and engaged
civil society. Several internal factors at the district level were also identified as being crucial for
implementing successful reform. One key success factor is high-level leadership: in the case of the project,
this meant having a bupati (district head) who is not only supportive of reforms, but who actually sets the
tone and champions reforms. A second factor is the existence of change agents who can help to facilitate
and motivate action towards the necessary changes. In the case of ILGRP, this role was played in part by
the F-kabs, but a key lesson is that these can and should also be internal to the district government – in
other words, there should be advocates of change also within the district-level bureaucracy or cadre of
civil servants. A third success factor would be the existence of a vibrant civil society at the district level,
which constitutes a source of demand for governance reforms within the district. This can consist of
various elements: community groups formed at the village or other local levels, civil society groups or
associations, and actively interested free media organizations.

(b) Lessons on project design and management

Realistic project scope and goals increase the likelihood of project success. A major lesson related to
project design which has been discussed earlier in this ICR, and which has wide general application, is to
be realistic in what a project can reasonably achieve and to avoid being overly ambitious. In the case of
this project, realism would have entailed a less ambitious Local Governance Reform Framework, and a
smaller number of target districts than originally planned with a narrower geographical distribution.

Separating responsibility for M&E from the implementing agency reduces the likelihood of M&E uptake
and utilization. A second general lesson relates to the placement of the monitoring and evaluation
function of the project. The project design provided for a very comprehensive set of M&E activities to be
executed by BAPPENAS, an agency separate from MOHA, which was responsible for executing all other
parts of the project. The intention of separating this M&E function was ostensibly to increase the
independence and objectivity of M&E findings. The effect, however, was to isolate part of the M&E


                                                      17
function, reducing the uptake of M&E results into subsequent project management and decision-making.
An alternative M&E design could have been to include regular M&E activities within the purview of the
main executing agency, while reserving only a few key reports such as the mid-term and final evaluations
for a separate, independent agency.

Alignment with the borrower’s regular planning and budgeting cycle is important for smooth
implementation. Several important lessons that are specific to project implementation in Indonesia can
also be learned. One lesson that is generally applicable to any project to be implemented with GOI is the
importance of ensuring consistency, if not synchrony, with GOI’s annual planning and budgeting cycle. A
contributory factor to the delays in project implementation was the project’s year-to-year implementation
schedule, which necessitated revisions to district-level DIPAs (annual budget documents) in order to
include the funds for sub-project investments. DIPA revisions are a slow, time consuming process.

Reliance on a governmental transfer mechanism that has not yet been operationalized is likely to raise
difficulties for project implementation. A second generally applicable lesson for projects working with
sub-national governments in Indonesia is not to underestimate the issue of on-granting of funds. During
project preparation, and indeed for most of the period of project implementation, the requisite national
legislation and framework for on-granting to sub-national governments was not operational. In the case of
this project, this resulted in the use of the tugas pembantuan mechanism to transfer sub-project
investment funds to the district, which in turn necessitated a cumbersome process of asset transfers to the
district governments for completed sub-projects.

Project design is more likely to remain relevant if it adequately anticipates future evolution of the system
in which it operates. A final lesson for projects that focus on decentralization is the importance of
ensuring broad consistency with the evolving framework for decentralization in Indonesia. As discussed
in Section 2.2, this was not a problem for this project, in that the specific governance reforms supported
by the project were designed in line with GOI’s overall plans. The introduction of new laws and
regulations related to decentralization (see Table 2) were consistent with the project’s reforms and in fact
made it easier for participating districts to comply.

Component A: Local Governance Reform: This component was to assist districts in undertaking the
reforms stipulated in the project’s Local Governance Reform Framework (see Table 5 below), according
to the phased approach for project entry, pre-investment and Year 1 and Year 2 investments. There were
to be a total of 40 participating districts, with approximately 16 in batch 1, and the remainder in batch 2 to
follow as the project progressed. Due to the problems encountered in project implementation, and as part
of the project restructuring, the scope of this component was scaled back to encompass only 14 districts
from batch 1.

There were five output indicators for this component in the project’s results framework. The original
targets for all five indicators, as specified in the PAD, were scaled back as part of project restructuring.
Outputs were almost fully achieved with respect to the revised targets set during restructuring, and are
described below. It should be noted, however, that these fell significantly short of the original targets in
the PAD for the number of districts in which these would be achieved (see Table 1, and also Section F.(b)
in the Data Sheet for details). Yet, the impacts of the reforms achieved in the remaining participating
districts have been tangible and measurable beyond the specific output indicators specified in the results
framework. In fact, the entire Local Governance Reform Framework can be considered to have specified
and delivered a raft of project “outputs? in participating districts, under this project component. Although
there were some modest changes to the Framework itself during project restructuring (see Annex 2),
achievement of the reforms specified in the Framework was closely monitored during project
implementation, and was largely achieved in at least 10 participating districts.

By the time of project closure, all 14 districts had effective local regulations (perda) on public
consultation and access to information. Concomitantly, the survey undertaken in participating districts as
part of the project’s final evaluation found that over 83 percent of community respondents found it easy to
access public documents on planning and budgeting, and that more than 90 percent of draft local
regulations underwent a process of public consultation as part of the local legislative process.


                                                     20
All 14 participating districts also developed poverty reduction strategies and action plans (PRSAPs)
which, at the time of project closure, had already run their course over the PRSAP planning periods in
question. These have subsequently been incorporated into the current versions of the respective district-
levels work programs on poverty reduction (SPKDs). The actual impact of the PRSAPs, however, has
been mixed, as evidenced by the fact that PRSAPs were reflected in annual budget allocations in only
four districts.

Action plans for the reform of financial management (FM), and of procurement, were implemented in ten
districts as targeted. The project final evaluation found evidence of FM reform implementation in all ten
districts in terms of approval processes for budget variations/revisions and for unplanned expenditures,
and in the publication of district expenditure reports. Likewise, procurement reform was evidenced in
terms of the publication of procurement documents, qualifications of procurement personnel, and the
publication of sanctions applied.

Component B: Poverty Targeted Investments: This component was to provide incremental financing
to participating districts in batch 1 for pro-poor development expenditures identified and prioritized
through planning processes linked to the district PRSAPs. As described in the PAD, this component
financed sub-project investments in participating districts, for the construction, rehabilitation or upgrading
of infrastructure. The size of each sub-project investment was subject to a ceiling determined by the
location of the district (with higher limits for more remote districts) and the district’s population. Eligible
sub-sectors (summarized in Table 2 of the PAD) included water supply and sanitation, energy supply,
transportation, irrigation and flood protection, and community buildings/facilities.

The project supported 262 sub-projects in 14 participating districts. Table 4 above summarizes the sub-
projects by district and sub-sector. Almost half of the sub-projects were for roads, while just under one-
third were for irrigation. A small number of sub-projects were for post-earthquake rehabilitation of school
buildings in Bantul. Overall, sub-projects rehabilitated or constructed a total of 491 kilometers of roads,
30 meters of bridges, 81 kilometers of irrigation canals, 204 kilometers of pipes for clean water supply

with 109 public taps and 185 public hydrants, and 90 classrooms and 28 activity spaces at 18 schools. A
full listing with details of all sub-projects is available in the Profile Sub Proyek publication produced by
the NPS. Annex 3 analyzes the expenditures and economic returns from these sub-project investments.

The sole output indicator in the project’s results framework for this component was the number of
supported sub-projects that followed proper technical, financial and procurement procedures. Close
monitoring during project implementation by both the NPS and Bank teams ensured that issues related to
the sub-projects, including technical/engineering matters and procurement, were identified and resolved
with participating districts as needed. The final achievement of 262 sub-projects far exceeded the target of
96 sub-projects originally set in the PAD.

Component C: Implementation Support: This component was to fund specialized technical, facilitation
and monitoring support for the activities in components A and B at the district, regional and national
levels. It also included project M&E activities. This was the project component that was most affected by
the implementation delays and difficulties with recruitment of consultants at the national, regional and
district levels, who were meant to provide the planned facilitation and support to participating districts.
There was thus a knock-on effect that delayed the implementation of the other two project components.

There were four output indicators for this component specified in the project’s results framework. The
targets for two of these four indicators were scaled back as part of the project restructuring, enabling the
outputs to be fully achieved with respect to the revised targets. As was the case with the output indicators
for Component A, these revised targets fell significantly short of the original targets in the PAD. Thus, 14
participating districts (instead of 40) received capacity development assistance in the core governance
reform areas, while a total of 42 staff (instead of 110) were available at the national, regional and district
levels to support project implementation. In addition, the project’s M&E function was in place and
provided various reports and analyses of the project progress (see Section 2.3 for more information).
Finally, all project-related complaints received were handled satisfactorily and resolved, with only four
complaints formally received, all of which were in relation to sub-project procurement matters.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Review of economic and financial analysis undertaken at appraisal

The economic and financial analysis at appraisal consisted of two main elements: the expected benefits of
improved governance and accountability arising from the proposed governance reforms in participating
districts, and the benefits of the sub-project investments in the infrastructure sub-sectors. As stated in the
PAD, the project effectively intended to generate two different sets of economic benefits, the former
through Components A and C, and the latter from Component B.

Although this analysis in the PAD was described as being a cost-benefit analysis, it did not the expected
benefits in monetary terms. The PAD therefore did not provide figures for the project’s net present value
(NPV) or economic internal rate of return (EIRR). This was firstly because the benefits of improved
governance were held to be non-quantifiable. Second, quantifiable economic benefits were expected to
accrue mainly as a result of sub-project investments, but the programmatic and demand-driven nature of
the project design, where sub-projects were not identified ex-ante, did not allow for detailed cost-benefit
calculations during project preparation. However, the PAD noted that experience from similar projects in
Indonesia at the district and local levels indicated that demand-driven projects involving community
participation are both cost-effective and economically viable.

The PAD included a qualitative description of expected project benefits from improved governance in the
participating districts, as a result of the implementation of the project’s Local Governance Reform
Framework (see Annex 2 for more details). Specifically, the reforms in financial management and in
procurement were expected to bring these districts onto a long-term path towards more effective public
financial management, including areas such as budget formulation and execution, revenue collection, and
accountability for public expenditure. Important benefits were also to be derived from the participation of
local communities in sub-project planning and execution, improving the allocative efficiency of
investments and increasing the sense of ownership among sub-project beneficiaries.

A third element of the economic and financial analysis presented in the PAD was an analysis of the
expected impact of the project on the fiscal situations of GOI and the participating districts. The analysis
noted that participating districts had accumulated sizeable surpluses and recorded a relatively strong
overall fiscal position in 2001 and 2002. Yet, these districts also relied heavily on central government
transfers for more than 90 percent of their revenues, and had very limited own-source revenues.
Furthermore, districts also spent most of their revenues on recurrent expenditures, especially for civil
servant wages/salaries. Overall, project funding would not have had a significant fiscal impact at the
macroeconomic level, representing only 0.017 percent of national government expenditure in 2004. At the
district level, sub-project investment funds were expected to range between 1.1 percent and 5.1 percent of
district budgets in 2002, representing between 5 percent and 18 percent of development expenditures. The
PAD also assessed that districts would be able to meet longer-term operations and maintenance
expenditures for the sub-project infrastructure, without causing deterioration in their finances.

The following analysis undertaken as part of this ICR focuses on the economic returns from Component
B, sub-project investments. Consistent with the reasoning given in the PAD, this ICR also assumes that
the benefits from components A and C, from improved local governance, are non-quantifiable – or at
least, not readily quantifiable. The impact of the funding from sub-projects on district government
finances is also taken to be limited, as per the analysis in the PAD – there has been no significant
deterioration in sub-national government finances in Indonesia in recent years.

Cost-benefit analysis of sub-project investments (Component B)

Sub-project Costs
Project expenditures for Component B – sub-project investments in the infrastructure sub-sectors in
participating districts – totaled IDR 315.9 billion, or approximately $33.8 million. This total is based on
project funds of IDR 287.2 billion provided to participating districts and a further estimated 10 percent in
matching funds (IDR 28.7 billion) provided by the districts themselves. These expenditures are
summarized by district in Table 5 below. As part of project restructuring, districts that had performed well
in undertaking governance reforms (notably Solok, Tanah Datar, Kebumen and Bulukumba) received
additional investment funds reallocated from non-performing districts (Bandung, Ngawi, Gowa, Takalar
and Bolaang Mongondow). A summary of the numbers and types of sub-project investments, by district,
is given in Table 4 in Annex 2.

Sub-project Benefits
The main benefits arising from the sub-projects in the roads sub-sector and bridges sub-sector were:
    Transport cost savings from reduced fuel consumption and maintenance costs;
    Time savings from smoother road travel;
    Gains from better market access for goods;
    Increased income operators arising from greater demand for transport services; and of transport
    Enhanced capital values of property made more accessible by improved roads.

The main benefits arising from sub-projects in the clean water supply sub-sector were:
    Time savings in obtaining clean water;
    Reduced expenditures for purchasing clean water from alternative sources;
    Lower health expenditures from reduced incidence of water-borne disease; and
    Increased income from new economic activities made possibly by the availability of clean water.

The main benefits arising from sub-projects in the irrigation sub-sector were:
    Increase in crop yields (crop output per unit cultivated area);


                                                      30
       Increase in area under cultivation;
       Cultivation of higher value crops and higher yielding crop varieties;
       Increase in farmer incomes (from increased productivity factors listed above);
       Reduced risks of, and costs arising from, extreme events such as droughts or floods; and
       Enhanced capital values of agricultural land with improved irrigation.

As part of project monitoring and evaluation, a study titled Evaluation of Economic Feasibility and Cost
Effectiveness of ILGR Infrastructure Investment was undertaken in 2009. Utilizing a multi-stage
purposive sampling method, the study authors sampled 30 sub-projects across seven participating districts,
in the roads, bridges, clean water supply, and irrigation sub-sectors. Data for the study was obtained
through a desk review of relevant project documentation, as well as from field surveys and interviews in
the districts. In line with commonly used methods for cost-benefit analysis, the study identified the main
quantifiable benefits from each sub-project investment, estimated the monetary values of these benefits
based on explicit assumptions, and then calculated EIRR taking into account the monetary cost of the sub-
project in question. Sub-projects were assumed to provide a flow of benefits over 10 years, and the annual
cost of operations and maintenance was assumed to be 2 percent of the investment cost. The discount rate
used was 12 percent, which is reasonable given the prevailing interest rate environment and cost of capital
in Indonesia. In addition, the study calculated general income multipliers to examine the multiplier effects
of the sub-project investments on local economies, and also undertook an analysis of how local quality of
life indicators improved due to the sub-projects.

A review of the study, first undertaken during preparation of the LGDP project in 2010, and again during
preparation of this ICR, found the study’s methods and findings to be credible and sound. Table 6 below
summarizes the study’s findings of the average EIRR for all sub-projects sampled in each sub-sector.
Clean water supply was found to generate the highest EIRR on average, followed by irrigation. Roads and
bridges had relatively lower EIRR. These results are generally consistent with similar analyses of the
economic returns from small-scale rural infrastructure investments in Indonesia. Based on all available
information reviewed during preparation of this ICR, it would be reasonable to conclude that most other
sub-project investments did generate similar levels of positive net benefits and EIRR. Calculating the
overall EIRR for all 262 sub-project investments would require going through each sub-project and
modeling the multi-year flow of benefits expected from each– a task which was not possible given the
time and resources available for preparing this ICR.

(a) Summary of Borrower Completion Report

The Government of Indonesia provided a very comprehensive and high-quality completion report. The
report was 39 pages long, and did not include its own executive summary of outcomes, performance
assessments, and lessons. Because of the length of the report, the Bank’s ICR team excerpted key sections,
with the knowledge and concurrence of GOI, to represent both GOI’s completion report and GOI’s
comments on the Bank’s ICR. The full report has been included in the project files.

Section 2.5 – Achievements of Governance Reform

2.5     After the implementation of a series of local governance reform agenda, which was divided into
several steps to be completed within 2005 to 2011, ILGRP had succeeded in stimulating the incorporation
of public aspiration in formulating local regulations, planning and budgeting; opening the availability of
public information; improving pro-poor budgeting; refining financial management; constructing up-to-
standard procurement process; and increasing public satisfaction on the services provided by the Local
Government.

i.      Incorporation of Public Consultation in Local Planning. According to NPS’s monitoring and
M&E Secretariat’s final evaluation , there was an increase in public participation in the process of
formulating local regulations, planning, and budgeting. Most of the local regulations (>90%) related to
the general public within the period from 2008 -2010 went through public consultation. The formulation
of planning documents (RPJMD, RKPD, and Renstra SKPD) had involved 12 Kabupatens. The increase
in public participation was connected to the improvement in the facilitation of public aspirations
throughout the process of planning, budgeting, and outlining the local regulations. The facilitation of
public aspiration in the process of local regulations had increased from 79% in 2008 to 91% in 2010. In
addition, the process of planning and budgeting had increased from 67.12% in 2008 to 70.89% in 2009.

ii.      The Availability of Public Information. The monitoring activities conducted by NPS and the Final
Evaluation by M&E Secretariat showed improvement and growth in the implementation transparency
related to the availability of public information and documents by means of various publication activities.
The Kabupatens’ capacity in managing information had also improved. Based on M&E’s final evaluation,
83% of the public felt that nowadays the public documents in Kabupatens were easily accessible.
Nevertheless, the public claimed that not all of the published documents were needed. Only 43.9% of the
public stated that the published documents conformed to what the public needs. The public had greater
needs of information that directly affect them. For instance, in the publication of APBD, the public
needed information on the budget allocation in its region.

iii.    Increasing Pro-poor Budget. In order to increase pro-poor budget, one of the agenda was to use
the SRTPK as a guide in the process of planning and budgeting. In terms of output, 14 Kabupatens had
executed the said agenda. However, not all of the Kabupatens showed higher proportion of budget
allocated for poverty alleviation. M&E Secretariat’s final evaluation revealed that out of 10 samples of
Kabupatens, only four Kabupatens showed higher proportion of budget allocated for poverty alleviation.
The four Kabupatens were Kabupaten Bandung, Bulukumba, Kebumen and Bolaang Mongondow. If the
proportion of budget allocated for poverty alleviation were compared to the total APBD, the pro-poor
budget was increased in only three Kabupatens, which were Kabupaten Bulukumba, Kebumen, and
Bolaang Mongondow. The proportion of said budget declined in other Kabupatens because the APBD
was limited while employee expenditure continued to increase. Moreover, the local government felt that
there were numerous poverty alleviation program executed by the central government. Nevertheless, if


                                                    37
compared to the number of poor residents, there had been a decline in the number of poor residents in all
of the participating Kabupatens since 2007.

iv.      Up to Standard Procurement Execution. The procurement process performed by the participating
Kabupatens were in accordance with the procurement regulations, which were the Keputusan Presiden
Nomor 80 Tahun 2003 that had been revised to Peraturan Presiden Nomor 54 Tahun 2010 On Pedoman
Pengadaan Barang dan Jasa Pemerintah. Apart from obeying the said regulations, the compliance was
also due to ILGRP’s effort in pushing the Kabupatens to implement the reform agenda that conformed
with the government regulations, ILGRP’s facilitation and capacity building, such as procurement
training and certification.

v.      Local Financial Management Practices. The Local Financial Management practices in the
participating Kabupatens had improved. The cause of the improvement was the enactment of two
regulations on local financial management, which were Peraturan Menteri Dalam Negeri Nomor 13
Tahun 2006 and Peraturan Menteri Dalam Negeri Nomor 59 Tahun 2009. These regulations were in line
with the local financial management reform agenda initiated by ILGRP. An indicator of improvement in
the local financial management was the absence of findings related to the contingency fund in the audit
conducted by BPK. Along with social aid, contingency fund was often noted in BPK’s findings. In 2007
to 2008, there were findings related to contingency fund in two Kabupatens. However, since 2009, there
were no findings related to the utilization of contingency fund in the participating Kabupatens.
The prominent problem in local financial management was asset management of both local government
asset and ILGRP investment asset. The local governments were unable to satisfactorily conduct asset
management and, as a result, a lot of unrecorded local government asset. The inability to manage assets
caused 13 out of 14 participating Kabupatens did not receive a qualified opinion from BPK’s audit.

vi.      Increased Public Satisfaction on Public Services. ILGRP had pushed the local governments to be
transparent about their public services procedure through various publications. According to M&E
Secretariat’s final evaluation, through the publication of permit services procedure, which included the
required time and fee, the public felt ease in accessing public services. As result of the straightforward
access to public services, M&E Secretariat’s final evaluation showed that 79% of the public was very
satisfied with the local governments’ services, while 18.3% was satisfied. Only 5.3% was less satisfied
and 2.3% was unsatisfied with the local governments’ services.

Section 2.7 – Sustainability of Governance Reform

2.7    Sustainability of Governance Reform. ILGRP obliged the Kabupatens to continue the
implementation of the governance reform agenda even though the investment was no longer available in
2011. Despite the obligation, according to NPS’s monitoring, there continuity of the implementation of
the governance reform agenda was very diverse in each Kabupaten. The sustainability of the
implementation of governance reform agenda can be grouped to the following classifications: [1]
Continued agenda reform implementation, [2] Declining quantity and quality of agenda reform
implementation, and [3] Discontinued agenda reform implementation.

1)      Continued agenda reform implementation. Although ILGRP had ended and did not provide
investment anymore, several reform agenda were still implemented by the local governments in the same
manner as when the Project was in progress. The implementation of the agenda was continued for two
reasons, namely [1] the local governments were committed to implement the agenda as they have felt the
benefits, and [2] the legal umbrella that obligated the implementation of the reform agenda.

In some cases, both reasons were synergized. A reform agenda was continued to be implemented because
of the presence of the legal agenda and the commitment of the local government to continue its


                                                    38
implementation. For example, the implementation of public consultation in the formulation of local
regulations and APBD was continued because the local government felt that public involvement
improved the quality of the regulations, made the implementation of the regulations easier, and restored
the local government’s image in the public eye . Moreover, the local government had to conduct public
consultation in the formulation of local regulations as it was stipulated in the following Ordinance Law:
Undang-Undang Nomor 10 Tahun 2004 on Pembentukan Peraturan Perundangan.

Several reform agenda, particularly the ones related to local financial management and procurement, had
to be implemented due to the presence of legal umbrella. The legal umbrella for local financial
management was the following regulations: Peraturan Menteri Dalam Negeri Nomor 13 Tahun 2006 on
Pengelolaan Keuangan Daerah, which was revised to Peraturan Menteri Dalam Negeri Nomor 59 Tahun
2009 on Pengelolaan Keuangan Daerah. The legal umbrella for procurement was the following
regulations: Keputusan Presiden Nomor 80 Tahun 2003, which was revised to Peraturan Presiden Nomor
54 Tahun 2010 on Pedoman Pengadaan Barang dan Jasa Pemerintah. With the presence of the said
regulations, the reform agenda in the area of local financial management and procurement were ought to
be implemented by the local governments. Reform agenda on Procurement, in particular, had been a part
of the basic task function of a certain SKPD in the Kabuputen. As a result, the reform agenda on
procurement would continue to be implemented by Kabupatens.

In the area of Basic Democratization, several reform agenda had legal umbrellas. Public consultation on
the formulation of local regulations was stipulated in Undang-Undang Nomor 10 Tahun 2004 on
Pembentukan Peraturan Perundangan, Peningkatan. Public access to public documents and information
was regulated in Undang-Undang Nomor 14 Tahun 2008 on Keterbukaan Informasi Publik, Publikasi.
ILPPD were stipulated in Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 6 Tahun 2006 and participative planning process
were regulated in Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 8 Tahun 2008.

2)       Declining quantity and quality of agenda reform implementation. Several reform agenda suffered
declining quality in its implementation. One of the reform agendas that suffered declining quality was
Publication, such as the publication of planning and budgeting documents, procurement documents, and
licensing. The decline was due to the change in the type of media used (from poster to website) or in the
area of distribution (the distribution that was supposed to reach villages had only reach the kecamatan or
SKPD). The reason for the decline was the limited fund for publication, local governments’ commitments,
public’s requests, and local governments’ publication management. In addition, institutional issues related
to the transition from PIU to the Dinas Teknis (Technical Unit) as the implementer of Publication had a
significant impact on the continuation of the said reform agenda.

3)     Discontinued agenda reform implementation. Several governance reform agenda were no longer
implemented by the Kabupatens because of the absence of fund allocated to the implement the agenda
due to limited fund. The reform agenda that the local government had stopped implementing were
procurement survey, publication of procurement sanctions, and publication of contracted unit price.

Section 2.8 – Lessons Learned on Governance Reform

2.8      Lessons Learned on Governance Reform. From the implementation and the continuation of
governance reform in Kabupatens, there was a number of important lessons learned, namely the difficulty
in performing governance reform and “tidak berjalan dalam ruang hampa?. A lot of factors influenced the
implementation of governance reform in Kabupatens and these factors could be grouped into three
categories, which were: [1] The commitment of Head of District; [2] The condition of internal
bureaucracy, [3] The presence of non-governmental organizations, and [4] program facilitation. These
factors not independent but interconnected.



                                                   39
1)       The commitment of Head of District. The commitment of the Head of district was the main key
in the implementation to improve governance in the Kabupaten. Without the Head of District’s
commitment, good governance could not be established. It was related to the function of the Head of
District as the highest authority in the Kabupaten to determine public policies, which included the
availability and allocation of fund, and the allocation of bureaucratic staffs. If the Head of District had
low commitment in improving governance, there would be no fund allocated to improve governance.
Even if the fund were available, the portion would have been very small. Morover, in the process of
mutation, several Kabupatens conduct the process based of the will of the Head of District instead of the
merit system. If the Head of District had good commitment in governance, the allocation of staff would
be based on the merit system instead of subjectivity.

2)      The condition of internal bureaucracy. Bureaucracy was the steering wheel of governance. The
experience in implementing ILGRP showed that the bureaucracy condition contributed in improving
governance reform and it became another key in achieving good governance. A good bureaucracy was
achieved by being transparent with the public, by involving the public in the government process, and by
providing public information to the public. In addition, bureaucracy with good vision on governance had
good support on the implementation of governance reform. The experience of ILGRP showed that not
every bureaucracy staff had good vision on governance. Some were unwilling to be open to the public.
Nevertheless, even if a few people had good vision and was open to the public, the starting point of
improving governance had been established. The improvement could be strengthen with the support of
the Head of District and the non-governmental organizations.

3)       The presence of Non-Governmental Organizations. The implementation of local governance
reform in Kabupatens showed that active public participation in the governance process by individuals
and institutions had a positive impact on the implementation of governance reform [Kebumen,
Bulukumba, Lebak, Magelang, and Ngawi]. In contrast, the implementations of governance reform in
Kabupatens with passive public participation were more likely to be stagnant [Gowa, Takalar, and
Bolaang Mongondow]. As the local governments making rooms for public participation – whether in the
process of planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation – non-governmental
organizations would fill those rooms. If non-governmental organizations were unavailable, there were no
parties to fill the rooms that had been opened by the local government. In addition, non-governmental
organization could act as a watchdog on the execution of governance and construction. If there was an
indication of misuse, the public/non-governmental organizations, could file a warning to the local
government. On that account, a number of NGOs made efforts to improve their quality in order to
supervise good governance. In Kabupaten Lebak, for instance, had initiated School of Budgeting (Sekolah
Anggaran/SANGGAR) with purpose to equip the NGOs activists with the understanding on how to
analyse government budgeting.

4)        Facilitation. The project executors in the Central level facilitated the implementation of ILGRP
by providing consultants and facilitators. The facilitation process conducted by the consultants and
facilitators had significant contribution in the implementation of governance reform and the entire Project.
Good facilitation process encouraged favorably reform implementation in Kabupatens, whereas weak
facilitation had negative impact towards the reform quality.

Section 3.8 – Lessons Learned in the Implementation of Poverty Alleviation Investment

3.8      Lessons Learned in the implementation of Poverty Targetted Investment. The following are
several lessons from implementing the Poverty Alleviation Investments:

   The investment were unrelated to the instigated reformation substance. Investment fund was given to
    build infrastructures that were oriented to alleviate poverty, whereas governance reform was aimed to


                                                    40
    improve public transparency, participation, and accountability in the area of basic democratization,
    local financial management, and procurement. Meanwhile, the institution that implemented the
    reform agenda did not receive any incentive other than capacity building activities. As consequence,
    the orientation of the Project was changed from governance reform as its focus to investment.
   Pro-poor investments often needed large fund for operation and maintenance, therefore self-
    management by the general public was unfeasible. The operation and maintenance were consequently
    assigned to private parties.
   The mechanism used to distribute fund to Kabupatens should not be the Tugas Pembantuan
    mechanism. The usage of the mechanism was obviously incompatible with the existing regulations
    because Tugas Pembantuan mechanism was meant for Central Government’s activities that were
    conducted locally/in Kabupatens. In addition, according to the law and regulations, this mechanism
    did not allow Kabupatens’ executive and legislative to discuss budget allocation. Tugas Pembantuan
    mechanism also posed many problems for the Central Government, especially on issues related to
    budgeting and reporting.
   With the Tugas Pembantuan mechanism, the Subprojects constructed by ILGRP became the assets of
    the Central Government. As a result, the Central Government had to handover the assets to the Local
    Government. The handover process had to be prepared very early as the process needed a
    considerable amount of time.
   The implementation of investment in ILGRP was always in conflict with the regular planning and
    budgeting cycle. The results was oftentimes the budget allocation for the coming year could not
    match the specific needs of the program and therefore needs significant revision afterwards. To
    include the Subproject investments in the Budget Implementation Entry List (Daftar Isian
    Pelaksanaan Anggaran/DIPA), the Kabupatens’ DIPA must be subjected to revision. Taking into
    account of the experience in executing the Project, the time needed for DIPA revision was
    considerably long. In 2007, 2008, and 2009 the Kabupatens’ DIPA revision was finalized in March,
    October, and July, respectively. The DIPA revision for FY 2010 was finalized in May. The long
    process of DIPA revision was caused by (1) the prolonged process in gathering supporting data from
    Kabupatens and (2) the impression that the DIPA revision requirements were constantly altered. In
    addition, the incompatibility between the Project cycle and the regular planning also caused the delay
    in the DIPA revision process. Therefore, the said requirements must be discussed with the Ministry of
    Finance before the DIPA revision process.

Section 4.6 – Lessons Learned on Implementation Support

4.6     Lessons Learned on Implementation Support. The lessons learned from the implementation
support were as follows:

   The mobilization of consultants was conducted in November 2006, whereas the Project had started
    since October 2005. In one hand, the number of NPS members was limited, which caused the Project
    implementation in the period of 2005 – 2006 was not under good supervision. This condition was due
    to the signing of Loan and Grant Agreement at the end of the financial year (October 11, 2005) which
    then caused the allocation of budget in FY 2006 for recruitment unadmissible as the cycle for budget
    allocation had passed. As consequence, the budgeting process for consultants and other activities
    financed by loan and grants had to be done through the mechanism of APBN Revision FY 2006,
    which were finalized in October. Thus, the activities could only be done in November 2006.

    Lesson that could be learned from this case were:
    1) The schedule for the signing of loan and grant agreement should consider the cycle of planning
    and budgeting in progress. This is important in order to put the loan and grant in effect in the current
    or the following year.



                                                    41
    2) The process of consultant recruitment should be conducted at the start of the Project as the
    consultants were needed to supervise the Project implementation since the Project begun. The
    supervision could not be relied solely to the NPS due to the limited human resources to do assistancy,
    facilitation, and monitoring.

   RMC was only mobilized in May 2009. The delay was caused by the change from consultancy firm
    to individual consultant. A consultancy firm was initially used as RMC, however, the process started
    in 2006 and did not reach completion in 2008 due to the different the perception between the
    Procurement Team and World Bank about the evaluation method towards the companies that
    submitted the proposals. Therefore, the RMC was changed to individual consultant in 2008. The
    delay in the recruitment of RMC caused the presence of RMC insignificant as it was established
    towards the end of the Project. A number of lessons could be learned from this issue, such as:
    1) It is important for the Government of Indonesia and Donor to have the same perception before
    Project implementation. The matching of perception need to be done in detail, especially on the
    perception related to procurement process. Differing perception would only hinder the program
    implementation.
    2) Recruitment of consultants should follow the flow of the structure (The NMC first and followed
    by RMC and Facilitators) in order to avoid disparity and inconsistency in the Program
    implementation.

   The facilitators in Kabupaten level were located by considering their place of origin. A facilitator was
    not stationed in his place of origin in order to preserve the facilitator’s independence in providing
    assistance, facilitation, and advocation. He was required to live in the appointed Kabupaten and
    housing benefit was included the salary. However, the housing benefit was not conducted as some
    facilitators live in their own house and others were absent for days. This situation reduced the speed
    of Project implementation and the image of the Project became unfavorable.

    The following lessons could be learned from this issue:
    1) The posting of facilitators should be based on professionalism. Independence was very important,
    but a good monitoring system was needed to ensure the facilitators were in the place of assignment.
    2) The placement of facilitators in their own place of origin was not always bad. IN some cases, it
    could be preferable as the facilitators were aware of the culture and the networks in the location.
    Therefore, the Project implementation could be more manageable.

   Capacity Building. The themes of capacity building were determined by two mechanisms, which
    were based on the Central Government’s decision and based on Kabupaten’s recommendations. As
    for Kabupaten’s recommendations, the recommendations were proposed to the NMC as the
    Kabupaten did not have clear grand strategies on capacity building. The foundation of the
    recommendation was not on the strategy to improve governance, but the nature was incidental and
    founded on the need of the moment. As a result, some kabupatens did not do any follow up activities
    after the capacity building had completed. From this situation, the lesson that could be learned was
    that every kabupaten should be requested to give recommendations on capacity building and the
    recommendations should be founded on the big strategy in improving governance. The kabupatens
    should be required to submit follow up plans and target to achieve. These requirements were
    necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the capacity building in order to improve governance.

   With two institutions doing the monitoring and evaluation, the monitoring and evaluation process
    became more frequent. The frequent monitoring and evaluation were not always positive due to some
    issues, such as the lack of coordination during monitoring and when feedback on the monitoring and
    evaluation results were submitted by both institutions.



                                                    42
Section 4.7 – Lessons Learned on Project Design

4.7     Lessons Learned on Project Design. ILGRP was designed using the stick and carrot approach.
Kabupatens that had succeeded in implementing all of the phases in the governance reform agenda would
be given investment funds gradually. The following are several lessons that could be obtained from
project design:

   The carrot and stick approach used by ILGRP was effective in urging the implementation of
    governance reform in Kabupatens when the Project was ongoing. Even so, this approach could not
    guarantee the continuation of the Project when investment had ended. The continuation of the Project
    was greatly influenced by the commitment of the Head of District in improving governance in his
    Kabupaten.
   The phases in ILGRP was not synchronized with the Government’s planning and budgeting cycle.
    The selections of activities that must be executed in each phase of the Project could not be completed
    in one cycle of planning and budgeting. As consequence, Project implementation was behind
    schedule if compared to the initial plan. For future projects, it would be best to consider the
    Government’s planning and budgeting cycle. There are two ways to accomplish this, which were (1)
    by completing the reform agenda within a year and preparing the investment in parallel with the
    completion process, or (2) by imposing multi yeas investment.
   There was too many governance reform agenda initiated by ILGRP. Based on the results of
    monitoring and evaluation conducted by NPS and M&E Secretariat, several agenda reform was
    incompatible with the public needs. In publication, for instance, the public had less need for the
    publication of Renstra SKPD, but had more need for the publication of the public services procedure.
    Therefore, the publication could be simplified to publication on the public services procedure, APBD
    and RPJMD. Improvement in the process of determining the initiated reform agenda would be needed
    for future Projects.

Section 4.8 – Notes on Institutionalization

4.8      Notes on Institutionalization. From the implementation of the Project, there were several notes
related to the Institution of the Project, namely:

        1)      Steering Committee [SC]. Throughout Project implementation, the coordination between
        the SC Team was executed by formal correspondence. The SC Team had never met in a formal
        meeting forum due to their busy schedule. A number of efforts to bring together the SC Team
        were unsuccessful. At the Secretariat level (NPS and M&E Secretariat), however, coordinations
        were conducted intensively and the results of the coordinations were always reported to the SC
        Team. Therefore, the duties of the SC Team, which were related to Project related decisions,
        could be performed.

        2)      National Project Secretariat [NPS]. For the duration of Project in 2005 – 2011, the NPS
        had experienced four transitions, which were conducted by considering the progress in Project
        implementation and the mutation process in MOHA. Generally, NPS had succeeded in executing
        the ILGRP. Every year, there was improvement in management, especially concerning financial
        administration support. However, there were several notes about the NPS team, which were:
         According to the Decree of the Directorate General of Regional Autonomi MOHA, the total
            personel of the NPS Team was numerous. However, the ones that could actively work on the
            Project were only two to three people due to their responsibilities related to basic daily
            functions.



                                                   43
   The limitation on the number of active personels caused the NPS Team unable to supervise
    the substance of the Project. The NPS Team was more focused on their biggest responsibility,
    which was the administrative aspect.

3)       Monitoring and Evaluation Secretariat (M&E Secretariat). Throughout the
implementation of the Project, the M&E Secretariat had performed its duty well. The monitoring
activities were conducted regularly, both incidentally and thematically. A number of the study
and survey activities were executed, although some of the activities were late and cancelled.
Some notes on the implementation of M&E Secretariat’s activities are as follows:
 The mechanism on submitting the feedback of the monitoring and evaluation results was
    unclear. The monitoring and evaluation results were not entirely submitted to the executing
    agency, which was the party responsible of the Project implementation. Even throughout the
    Project implementation, there had never been any formal submission of monitoring and
    evaluation by the M&E Secretariat to the NPS. The monitoring and evaluation results were
    delivered/requested through informal processes. This arrangement placed the NPS in a
    difficult position in obtaining inputs on improving the Project implementation based on the
    completed monitoring and evaluation results.
 A number of studies and surveys were behind schedule, such as the implementation of Mid-
    Term Evaluation, which was supposed to be conducted in 2007, was only performed in 2007.
    Due to various reasons for the delay, the Governance and Decentralization Survei [GDS],
    which was planned to be performed in 2009, was rescheduled to 2010 and was eventyally
    canceled because of limited time. Meanwhile, the data from GDS was hoped to be used to
    measure the success of Project implementation.

4)       Provincial Coordination Team [PCT]. The PCT’s involvement in ILGRP did not begin at
the start of the Project, but in the middle of Project implementation. This caused the performance
of PCT’s duties and responsibilities was less optimal. From all of PCT’s duties, only two duties
went relatively well, which were the monitoring of Project implementation and the process of
socializing the implementation of ILGRP to other Kabupatens within its province. However, there
were only six PCTs that conducted this socialization process, which were: [1] West Sumatera, [2]
North Sulawesi, [3] Central Java, [4] East Java, [5] Yogyakarta, and [6] Gorontalo. Meanwhile,
the replication of the implementation of governance reform agenda in Provincial level had never
happened. However, the PCT of West Sumatera and Yogyakarta had good initiatives. These
provinces encouraged the use of the governance reform indicators initiated by P2TPD as one of
the indicators of budget allocation from the provinces to the Kabupatens.

5)      Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Based on NPS’s observation, the performance of
PIUs was varied. The PIU, which had daily routines in Bappeda, performed well in Project
implementation. This was related to the position of Bappeda that had a function in coordinating
the process of planning and budgeting, and this position gave Bappeda a bargaining power to
other work units. Another note related to PIU was the continuity of the PIU personnels. In some
Kabupatens, the PIU understood the Project very well as personnels had never changed, even if
the personnel had to be changed, the changed would have occurred after a long period of time. In
other Kabupatens, however, the restructuring of PIU personnels often occur and it affected the
PIU’s understanding on the Project, which eventually had negative effect on Project
implementation in the Kabupaten.

6)      The World Bank. As the lender, the World Bank established the ILGR Task Team to
supervise the Project implementation. Other than being the lender, the World Bank also
administer the DFID Grant for the ILGRP implementation. In the execution, the World Bank’s
supervision in the implementation of ILGRP was very stringent, which was evident in the process


                                           44
of No Objection (NOL) request for every activities, the implementation of supervision mission,
and discussions. In other words, as a lender, the Bank never stopped in providing loans, however
the Bank was very involved in the Project administration and substance. This situation caused the
Project executor saw the lender as rigid and deeply intervening. In fact, the World Bank and the
Government were both Project executors, but both parties had different bureaucracy system and
procedure. Despite the differences, during Project implementation, there were continual
improvements through intensive communication between the World Bank and the Government of
Indonesia.

7)       DFID. As the grant provider, the involvement of DFID was limited to the monitoring of
Project execution. On the early phase of Project execution (2006-2009), DFID was involved in
the World Bank Supervision Mission and a number of National Workshops. DIFD gave inputs
related to the utilization of its grant. After 2009, however, DFID was no longer involved in the
Project execution.
