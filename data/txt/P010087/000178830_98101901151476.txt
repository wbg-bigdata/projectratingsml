PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF FOURTH SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Industrial and agricultural expansion in Pakistan has resulted
in a 10% annual growth in energy consumption in recent years.  Much of
this growth has been supplied through increased production of natural
gas, which now accounts for about 32% of total energy supplies, and
which is also used as a raw material in the production of nitrogenous
fertilizers. Most of this gas is obtained from a major reservoir at
Sui, in Baluchistan. Expansion of Pakistan's natural gas industry has
been facilitated by Bank loans to the country's two gas transmission
companies. In 1954 the Bank made a loan of US$14 million equivalent to
Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC) to build a line from Sui to Karachi.
It has also made loans to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) to expand
its system in 1964 (US$15 million equivalent) in 1969 (US$8 million
equivalent) and in 1970 (US$19 million equivalent). All these loans
are fully disbursed.
ii.       The Bank has now been asked to assist in financing a project
for further expansion of SNGPL's pipeline system. The project is de-
signed to increase the system's capacity from 297 to 415 million cubic
feet per day (MMcfd) to meet the demand for gas for fertilizer production
at Multan, Lahore and in the North West Frontier Provinces and for power
generation at Lyallpur; to expand gas supplies to a variety of industrial,
commercial and domestic consumers in areas presently served; and to extend
gas service to the town of Sargodha (Map 11216).
iii.      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$103.2
million of which the proposed loan would finance US$60.0 million, repre-
senting the estimated foreign exchange costs of procurement of materials,
compressors, purification equipment and pipeline construction equipment.
The remainder of the finance would be provided by the Government, in the
form of a contribution to SNGPL equity of PRs 265.0 million, through local
borrowing of about PRs 190.0 million and through SNGPL's internal cash
generation. Procurement would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding with a 15% preference for local suppliers. Commitments for long-
lead items, totalling US$8.3 million, have been made since appraisal, and
retroactive financing in respect of these items is expected to amount to
US$5.5 million.
iv.       The Government has been slow to grant tariff revisions necessary
to maintain SNGPL's profitability and the company failed to meet the finan-
cial covenants of Loan 696-PAK in financial years 1972 and 1973 (FY 72 and
FY 73). While the company's operating results and financial position have
shown improvement since then as a result of tariff increases in August 1973
and December 1974, further tariff increases are required if SNGPL is to meet
the 12% return required by the latest loan agreement (696-PAK) rate-of-
return covenant. The Government has agreed, therefore, to grant an increase



- ii -
of PRs 0.20 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) effective July 1, 1975, and to
review a further proposed increase of PRs 0.70 per Mcf to become effective
July 1, 1976 with the Bank in March 1976. With these increases, it is
expected that the company will earn a satisfactory return on net fixed
assets in operation of not less than 12% from June 30, 1978 onward.s.
v.        The proposed project would avoid the higher economic costs of
importing substantial volumes of petroleum products and, thereby, is
estimated to yield an economic return of about 33%.
vi.       The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan to SNGPL of
US$60.0 million equivalent for a term of 22 years, including a four and
a half year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the Govern-
ment) and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL) (a public company with a
majority Government shareholding) have requested the Bank's assistance in
financing the expansion of SNGPL's gas pipeline system to meet the growing
demand for natural gas in the northern half of Pakistan. The total cost of
the proposed project is estimated at US$103.2 million, of which US$60.0 mil-
lion, representing the estimated foreign exchange costs, would be financed
by the proposed loan which would be made to SNGPL for a period of 22 years,
including a four and a half year grace period.
1.02      The Bank has previously made four loans, totalling some US$56
million equivalent, for construction of gas pipelines in Pakistan. The
first of these (99-PAK) was made to Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC)
(a public company with a minority Government shareholding) in 1954, and
the remainder to SNGPL in 1964 (377-PAK), in 1969 (597-PAK) and in 1970
(696-PAK). All of these projects have been successfully completed and
the loans fully disbursed.
1.03      Other loans/credits to the transport sector in Pakistan have
included three for highways, seven for railways, including three joint
loans to Pakistan Eastern and Western Railways, and five for ports. One
highway loan was cancelled in July 1971 because bids received were greatly
in excess of original estimates. All other loans/credits have progressed
satisfactorily.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission
composed of R. Roberts (economist), P. Nichols (consultant) and K. Sonney
(consultant), which visited Pakistan in May 1974, and a follow-up visit
by 3. Burns (financial analyst) in March 1975.
II. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      The Pakistan economy was severely strained during FY 71 and
FY 72, when political uncertainties, the disturbances leading to the
separation of former East Pakistan, and severe drought combined to
bring growth to a virtual halt. In FY 73, however, GDP rose about 7%
in real terms, or at slightly more than the average annual rates during
the Second and Third Plan periods (July 1960 - June 1970). Floods in
August 1973 caused extensive damage; nevertheless, growth in FY 74 is
estimated at 5%, with agricultural output rising only 2% and manufac-
turing production increasing by about 6%.



-2-
2.02      A large natural gas reservoir was discovered at Sui in the Province
of Baluchistan in 1952, and, in 1955, SGTC completed construction of a 347-
mi pipeline from these reserves to Karachi along the east bank of the Indus
River. In 1958, a 217-mi, 16-in line was laid from Sui to Multan by the
Government, and acquired in 1963 by the newly-formed SNGPL, who extended it
northwards to Lyallpur in 1964 and to Lahore in 1965. In 1967 the Rawalpindi
area, previously supplied with gas from the Dhulian gas/oil field, was linked
to the SNGPL system. The present pipeline systems of Pakistan are shown in
Map 11214.
B.   Energy Resources
2.03      Pakistan's remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas total
approximately 11.35 million million standard cubic feet. Details are given
in Annex 1. The largest reservoir, at Sui, has, at present, substantial un-
committed reserves. However, with completion of an on-going expansion of
SGTC's system and the proposed SNGPL expansion, Sui reserves will be fully
committed and, at the forecast rate of consumption, will be capable of meet-
ing these commitments only until about the year 2000. The Mari field, the
next largest, has a high inert gas content which makes it better suited for
the production of nitrogenous fertilizers than for fuel. Mari gas is being
utilized by a plant producing 170,000 tons of urea per year, and tro further
fertilizer plants are planned which will fully commit these reserves. The
small Sari and Hundi fields, about 40 miles from Karachi, will be tapped by
the first phase of the on-going SGTC expansion project. Gas associated with
the production of oil from the Dhulian, Meyal and Tut fields is particularly
valuable because of its high heating value and because of its location at
the far (northern) end of the pipeline system from Sui. Reservoir engineer-
ing studies of these fields have recently been undertaken to determine the
size of the oil and gas reserves and the optimum rate of gas offtake (para
4.12).
2.04      Unconnected gas fields include those of Kandhkot and Mazarani, with
reserves of 0.5 million million cu ft which can be readily and economically
developed, and those of Uch, Zin and Khairpur, with reserves of 3.6 million
million cu ft, which are difficult to exploit, because of their remote loca-
tion or the low quality of gas. The Uch field has gas with a high inert gas
content. However, the size of the reserves may be large enough to justify
the cost of purification, and the Government proposes to undertake a feasi-
bility study which the proposed project would finance (para 4.04 (m)).
2.05      Pakistan has three groups of coalfields:  the first, located be-
tween Karachi and Hyderabad, includes the Lakhra and Meting-Jhimpir fields
and contains proven reserves of about 50 million tons of poor to average
quality lignite; unproven reserves at Lakhra are estimated at 240 million
tons; the second group, located in the Quetta area, includes the Khost-
Sharigh-Harnai, the Mach and the Sor Range-Degari fields and contains
reserves of about 40 million tons of high-volatile bituminous coal and
about 68 million tons of sub-bituminous; the third group, located between
Rawalpindi and Sargodha, on either side of the River Indus, includes the



- 3 -
Makerwal and Salt Range fields and contains reserves estimated at 97 million
tons of high-volatile bituminous coal. In general, the quality of these re-
serves is poor, with a high ash and sulphur content and low heating value.
Coal from the Sharig-Harnai field has the highest heating value and nearly
all of it possesses some coking properties.
2.06      Of the total proven hydrocarbon reserves, gas comprises, in terms
of heating value, about 65%, oil about 5% and coal about 30%. However, if
the unproven reserves of lignite at Lakhra are included, the proportion of
coal is increased to 43%, while that of gas is reduced to 53% and that of
oil to 4%.
2.07      Pakistan's substantial hydro-electric power potential is estimated
to be in the order of 10,000 MW. Part of the potential is being developed
through the Mangla and Tarbela dam projects, which together have an ultimate
installed capacity of 2900 MW. The dam at Mangla (Map 11215) was completed
in 1967 and the first six units are in operation, providing 600 MW of in-
stalled capacity. Following problems which have arisen at Tarbela during
the first test filling of the reservoir in July/August, 1974, extensive
remedial works will have to be undertaken. Based on present planning for
the completion of these works the first four generating units, each of 175
MW capacity, should be commissioned towards the end of 1976. Other hydro-
electric stations include Warsak (160 MW), which may be extended by two
additional units, each of 40 MW, and a number of small stations with a total
installed capacity of 107 MW.
2.08      Although first priority in the use of water from Pakistan's power
dams is given to agriculture, hydro-electric generation supplies the base
load of the power system and this pattern will continue for the next several
years. Thermal plant is normally used for firming up hydro-generation during
the critical period of March, April and May when low reservoir levels reduce
the output of hydro plant.
C.   Energy Consumption and Supply
2.09      Energy consumption in Pakistan has been increasing in recent years
at about 10% per annum, reflecting industrial and agricultural growth and
the displacement of non-commercial forms of energy by commercial forms.
Much of this growth has been satisfied through increased production of gas
and hydro power. In 1973, natural gas provided about 32% of total energy
supplies and hydro about 16%. Petroleum products in 1973 provided about
43% of total energy supplies, down from a peak of 47% in 1970 (Table 1).
2.10      Imports of crude oil and refined petroleum in 1974 amounted to
about 4.0 million tons, equivalent to about 88% of total requirements.
Since domestic production of crude oil is static at about 400,000 tons
per annum and demand is expected to grow at about 7% per annum, the pro-
portion of Pakistan's consumption of petroleum supplied by imports is
likely to expand more rapidly than total consumption. The increases in
petroleum prices which occurred in late 1973 and early 1974 may, therefore,



- 4 -
be expected to have a heavy impact on Pakistan's balance of trade in the
years ahead. Whereas in 1973 Pakistan paid US 164.0 million for 3.2 mil-
lion tons of imported crude oil, in 1980, assuming a crude oil price of
US$7 per barrel (C&F Karachi, in constant dollars) the country will have to
pay about US$394 million for 6.5 million tons of such imports. The devel-
opment of alternative indigenous energy sources, therefore, merits high
priority in the Government's investment plans.
2.11      Gas consumption is increasing at about 13% per annum, a growth rate
which reflects, in part, the substitution of gas for coal and fuel oil in
thermal power plants. Notwithstanding recent tariff increases, gas remains
the cheapest fuel in terms of heating value, and the rapid growth in consump-
tion is expected to continue. In addition to the proposed SNGPL project,
which is the subject of this report, SGTC facilities are being expanded by
an on-going project, financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which will
supplement the existing Sui-Karachi pipeline on the east bank of the River.
Indus, with a second pipeline to the west of the river.
2.12      Electricity consumption is increasing at about 16% per annum,
reflecting agricultural demand for tubewell pumping and the requirements
of industry and the urban centers for electricity services. A growth rate
of 12 to 13% is expected to be maintained until well into the 1980's. Gen-
eration of public power in Pakistan (Map 11215) is shared between the Water
and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and Karachi Electric Supply Corpora-
tion Ltd. (KESC). KESC has 515 MW of installed generating capacity, includ-
ing a 137 MW nuclear station, and supplies Karachi and environs. 1WAPDA has
1,742 MW of installed capacity and supplies the rest of the country through
four systems, the largest of which, the Northern Grid, supplies the Punjab
and accounts for 76% of WAPDA's sales. The high growth rate of consumption,
coupled with a shortage of finance, has led to power shortages, load shed-
ding and a general decline in the quality of service. To meet this situation,
WAPDA is making more frequent use in its expansion program of gas iturbines,
which can be installed in a much shorter time than is required to design and
construct a steam turbine station. They are also very attractive from the
point of view of overall system cost and capital saving. However, once
installed, gas turbines, which should be reserved for peaking power, often
have to be operated continuously for lengthy periods to meet the desmands of
particular areas. The increasing use of gas turbines, together wiith the use
of Sui gas for steam units at Guddu and the use of off-peak gas in other
thermal stations, is expected to result by 1980 in a substantial increase
in the consumption of gas for power generation. However, as a percentage
of total gas sales, consumption for power generation will continue the de-
cline of past years.  Sui Northern's sales to WAPDA, which were 51%, of total
sales in 1967, fell to 34% in 1973, and are expected to decline further to
about 31% in 19.80.
2.13      Consumption of coal has been declining in recent years, reflecting
a switch by industrial consumers to gas. Present production totals about
1 million tons per annum.



-5-
D.   Energy Planning
2.14      The Government has reviewed its priorities for its Fifth Plan
period (1975-80) in light of the recent oil price increases. Exploration
for oil and gas is being encouraged; the development of existing hydro-
electric sites will be accelerated, if possible; wherever possible domes-
tic energy will be substituted for imported petroleum; and the efficiency
of energy utilization will be increased. The Government is being assisted
in the development of energy policies and planning by the UNDP, which is
undertaking an energy survey, to be completed by July 1975.
2.15      In the past, most gas and oil exploration has been carried out by
the Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), a public corporation, or by
the Burmah Oil Company (BOC) subsidiary Pakistan Petroleum Ltd., or Attock
Oil Company and its subsidiary, Pakistan Oil Ltd. However, the Government
has granted exploration licenses to a-number of other oil companies, includ-
ing Amoco, Marathon, Esso and Wintershall, and an increase in exploration
by these companies and by OGDC is expected. In FY 75, exploratory drilling
plans include 8 wells by OGDC, four by Amoco, one by Marathon and two off-
shore wells by Wintershall. In the period 1975-80 OGDC plans a total of
57 exploratory wells. In addition, they plan development drilling of the
Tut and Meyal oilfields.
2.16      Plans for development of hydro-electric sites include the installa-
tion of the full 12 units at Tarbela, with a capacity of 2,100 MW, by 1981,
two additional 100 MW units (7th and 8th) at Mangla by 1977, and two further
units (5th and 6th) at Warsak. Thermal generating stations planned include
a 200 MW gas turbine station at Lyallpur in 1975, an additional 210 MW steam
unit at Guddu (based on Sui gas) by 1977, a 200 MW steam unit at Multan by
1978 (using fuel oil from a planned refinery), and 625 MW of capacity in the
Karachi area between 1975 and 1980. With these additions, WAPDA's installed
capacity is expected to exceed 4,000 MW by 1980 and KESC's to reach about
1,200 MW. In addition to these firm plans, the Government is investigating
the feasibility of a thermal station based on Lakhra coal and the desirabil-
ity, by the early 1980's, of adding a nuclear station of 500-600 MW to the
Northern Grid. A substantial increase in the base-load requirements would
be necessary to justify a nuclear station of this size.
2.17      There are many ways in which the efficiency of energy utilization
can be improved. One of the most important and urgent is the improvement
of WAPDA's 30% transmission and distribution losses which, it is estimated,
can be reduced by half by such measures as an increase in the investment in
transmission and distribution systems. A proposal for Bank financing of
transmission facilities is planned for Board presentation in FY76. During
the Fifth Plan period it is planned to install two 500 KV transmission lines
between Tarbela and Lyallpur, one of which will be completed by 1976 and the
other by 1979, and to interconnect the northern and southern systems. This
latter will permit the use of surplus hydro power in the southern system,



- 6 -
and will provide a significant saving in generating capacity due to the
seasonal diversity in peak demand between the two regions, and to the
pooling of reserves.
2.18      At present petroleum gas, a valuable fuel, is being flared at the
oilfields for lack of the necessary extraction and distribution facilities.
The Government is considering a project to provide such facilities, both at
the oilfields and at the proposed Multan refinery, and may seek assistance
in financing the substantial foreign exchange component.
III. THE BORROWER
A.   Corporate Structure
3.01      SNGPL is a limited liability company incorporated in Pakistan in
1963, with its registered office and headquarters in Lahore. Approximately
300 miles of existing pipelines were taken over from the Government by SNGPL
at the time of its formation, and a further 800 subsequently constructed.
3.02      SNGPL has a long-term contract with the Burmah Oil Company (BOC)
subsidiary Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) for the supply of natural gas from
the Sui field, and with SGTC for the purification of this gas. SNGPL buys
gas, arranges for its purification, transports it and sells it to indus-
trial, commercial and domestic users.
3.03      The Company has an authorized share capital of PRs 400 million,
of which PRs 118 million has been issued. The ownership of the shares is
summarized below:

Government-controlled share ownership will be increased to 85% of the issued
share capital as a result of the forthcoming equity contribution of PRs 265.0
million (para 6.11). The shares of SNGPL were issued in denominations of



PRs 10 and are quoted oni the Lahore and Karachi stock exchanges. Their
value reached a high of PRs 17.85 in March 1970 and then declined to a
range of PRs 6.50 - 7.50, partly due to the poor financial performance
of SNGPL in 1972 and 1973 (paras 6.03 and 6.04) and the fact that no
dividends were paid for those years. They have since recovered to
PRs 11.20 - 11.60 on declaration of the dividend for 1974 (para 6.09).
3.04      SNGPL's Board of Directors is composed of 13 members, including the
Chairman and the Managing Director. The Chairman and three other Directors
are nominated by WPIDC. Four Directors are nominated by BOC and four by the
*            other shareholders.  Day to day control of the Company is exercised by the
Managing Director, who is the chief executive of the Company and ex officio
member of the Board. The Managing Director is appointed by resolution of
the Board after nomination by WPIDC and BOC, and after confirmation by the
Government.
B.   Organization and Management
3.05      The present Company organization is shown in Chart 8850.  The
growing size and dispersion of SNGPL's distribution activities are posing
increasing problems of management control and organization to the Company
and the present organizational structure is becoming unwieldy. For this
reason the Company is proposing to make certain organizational changes,
including establishment of separate distribution and transmission depart-
ments in place of the present sales and distribution/transmission/construc-
tion departments. The proposed changes are acceptable to the Bank. In
addition, to ensure effective execution of the project, SNGPL has agreed
to strengthen its construction department along the lines recently recom-
mended by a Bank-financed pipeline expert.
3.06      The total number of employees of the Company increased from 1,557
in June 1970 to 2,504 in March 1974. Approximately 80% of the added staff
were hired for project construction and for the distribution service and
this emphasizes the growing importance of these activities within the Com-
pany. Much of the increase in staff occurred in 1971 and 1972; additions
since then have averaged about 4% per year. On completion of the proposed
project the construction department would be signficantly larger than re-
quired for normal maintenance purposes. However, SNGPL plans to compete
for pipeline and compressor station construction in the Middle East, even
if no further pipeline work materializes in Pakistan.
3.07      Despite general labor unrest in Pakistan, employee relations in
SNGPL remain good and the Company has never experienced any strike action.
t           Non-supervisory labor, numbering about 2,200, are represented by a single
union which negotiates labor agreements with the Company covering-two-year
periods. The last agreement took effect July 1, 1973 and provided for
increases in wages of approximately 22%, as well as substantially higher
fringe benefits.



- 8 -
3.08      Top management in SNGPL is composed of competent, experienced and
well-trained Pakistani nationals. ilowever it lacks strength in depth due to
the rapid expansion of the Company and the departure of a number of senior
personnel. Consequently, a disproportionate burden of work and responsibil-
ity is now falling on senior managers. For this reason, SNGPL has agreed to
undertake a program of training and upgrading of management, technical and
operational staff, and funds have been provided for this in the cost esti-
mates (paras 4.04 (k) and 4.11).
C.   Accounting System
3.09      SNGPL has an efficient accounting system, based on commercial
accounting principles, in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act of Pakistan. The finance and accounting department is under the control
of the Finance Manager who reports directly to the Managing Director, and
is composed of six sections: finance., projects, payroll, budget and cost,,
planning and bills and imports, each headed by a qualified and experienced
accountant.
3.10      SNGPL utilizes a comprehensive system of budgeting and costing pro-
cedures for purposes of management control and future planning. Operating,
capital and cash budgets are prepared annually, together with estimates of
profit and loss and cash receipts and payments. Monthly computer printouts,
comparing actual and budgeted operating costs and capital expenditures are
provided to management.
3.11      SNGPL is increasing its use of computer processing for routine
accounting jobs and now utilizes data processing equipment for assets and
depreciation accounting, stores recording, and share transfer and regis-
tration, in addition to the monthly operating statements.
IV. THE INVESITENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Investment Program
4.01      A project (3 A) which was recently completed will supply gas to
WAPDA's new gas turbine station at Lyallpur. The project, which cost
about US$7.5 million, involves the laying of some 18 miles of 18-in dia-
meter loopline between Sui and Multan, 33 miles of 16-in loopline between
Multan and Lyallpur, about 14 miles of 10-in and 8-in loopline between Meyal
and Dhulian, and the transfer of four compressors from Sui to various points
on the line to Lyallpur. The project will raise SNGPL's throughput capacity
from 277 MMcfd to 297 NMcfd. Construction was undertaken by SNGPL with its
own equipment and labor. The progress and quality of the work was inspected
in September, 1974, by a Bank-financed pipeline expert, and was found to be
acceptable by international standards.



- 9 -
4.02      SNGPL's investment program for 1975-85 totalling PRs 1,265.5 mil-
lion is shown in Table 2 and includes, in addition to the proposed project
and minor capital works and replacements, an amount of PRs 32.7 million for
the purchase of purification facilities from SGTC in 1978.
B.   Description of the Project
4.03      The proposed project (designated Project 4 in SNGPL's investment
program) consists of the facilities necessary to increase the capacity of
SNGPL's gas transmission system by 118 MMcfd from 297 MMcfd to 415 Mcfd
through additional gas purification units, pipeline loops and compressors.
It involves construction of 116 miles of large diameter loops and 15 miles
of small diameter lateral, and the installation of about 34,000 hp of new
and about 9,000 hp of relocated compressors. Gas service would be provided
to a new fertilizer plant at Multan and would also be extended through addi-
tion of a lateral line to the communi-ty of Sargodha. Low pressure distribiu-
tion facilities would be constructed to serve domestic and commercial con-
sumers in that city and additions made to existing distribution systems.
4.04      The project includes:
(a) the procurement and installation, including
cathodic protection, of 27.85 miles of 18-in
and 88.1 miles of 16-in diameter high pressure
steel pipe paralleling sections of the existing
pipelines between Sui and Lyallpur, and between
Lyallpur and Lahore;
(b) the procurement and installation, including
cathodic protection, of high pressure steel
pipe to extend the system by 15 miles of 6-in
diameter line to serve Sargodha;
(c) the procurement and installation of two 100 MMcfd
capacity gas purification units at Sui;
(d) the construction of three new compressor stations,
and procurement and installation therein of four
3,840 hp compressor units and relocation of five
existing 1,100 hp units;
(e) the procurement and installation at five existing
stations of five 3,840 hp compressor units, and
the relocation of three 1,100 hp units;
(f) the procurement and installation of additional
scrubbers and equipment for restaging of com-
pressors at an existing station;



- 10 -
(g) the procurement of construction equipment (Annex 2);
(h) the procurement and installation of telecommuni-
cation equipment for one new compressor station;
(i)  the procurement of materials for and installation
of, additional low pressure distribution facilities
both in the area to be newly served and in the mar-
kets now being served;
(j) technical assistance for design and installation of
purification units and for design of telecommunica-
tions equipment (para 4.10);
(k) overseas training for SNGPL personnel in gas utility
operations and management (para 4.11);
(1) reservoir engineering studies of the Dhulian, Meyal
and Tut oil and gas fields (para 4.12); and
(m)  feasibility study of purification facilities for the
Uch gas field.
The location of the facilities is shown on Map 11216.
4.05      The 18-in and 16-in pipelines would be constructed for most of
their length on rights of way of existing pipelines; new compressor station
locations have been selected, and a preliminary survey of the lateral line
right of way to Sargodha has been made. Studies made by consultants have
determined the best type, location and cost of the required addition of
two 100 MUcfd units to desulphurization and dehydration plant.
C.   Construction Cost Estimates
4.06      The proposed project is estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$103.2 million (PRs 1,022.2 million). A loan of US$60.0 million would
cover the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project, which form 58%
of total costs. The various major elements of the project are shown in
the table below. Additional details are shown in Table 3.

Note:     Physical contingencies 3% on item 1 and 10% on items 3, 4 and 6;
price contingencies on foreign exchange costs 11% for 1975 and
7-1/2% per annum thereafter; price contingencies on local costs
10% per annum.
4.07      Materials and equipment costs are based on recent information on
prices. Construction and installation costs are based on current costs of
experienced contractors and, reflecting force-account construction (para
4.10), are included in local costs, together with taxes and duties. The
cost of the purification plant and installation is based on current prices,
provided by SNGPL consultants, and assumes foreign suppliers of equipment
and foreign contractors for supervision of installation. Communications
equipment would be supplied by foreign manufacturers and costs have been
estimated at quoted prices; installation would be done by SNGPL telecom-
munications personnel.
D.   Procurement and Disbursement
4.08      All major items (90% of foreign costs) of construction equipment
and materials including pipe, pipe fittings, purification plant, and com-
pressors would be procured by international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with Bank Guidelines. The fertilizer plant at Multan, which uses gas
as a raw material, Is being expanded with financial assistance from Abu



- X2 -
Dhabi, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Bank.  As the new plant is
scheduled to start production in May 1977, 28 miles of additional loopline
will need to be in service by that time. Inasmuch as the lead time on pipe,
fittings and equipment is very long, orders for pipe, totallirg US$3.9 mil-
lion, for this portion of the project have been placed in conformity with
Bank guidelines, and orders for valves and fittings and constructiorn equip-
ment have also been placed. The total of all such orders, including pipe,
is not expected to exceed US$8.3 million and an amount of US$5.5 million
which is expected to be disbursed before Board presentation would be retro-
actively financed by the proposed loan.
4.09       Disbursement would be on the basis of 100% of foreign expenditures
for materials and equipment, or 100% of the ex-factory cost of goods manu-
factured in Pakistan.  It is possible that about $14.0 million may be ex-
pended on small diameter pipe made in Pakistan. A 15% preference would be
offered to Pakistani suppliers. Disbursement would also cover 100% of the
direct foreign exchange costs of consultant services and overseas training.
The estimated project expenditures are shown in Table 4, and the schedule
of estimated disbursements in Table 5.
E.    Project Design and Execution
4.10       SNGPL has accumulated considerable experience using its own labor
and equipment in the construction of large pipelines and installation of
compressor stations. Recently it has successfully completed the installa-
tion of a large diameter pipeline to supply a new power station at Lyallpur.
Consultants employed by the Bank have concluded that SNGPL now has the
experience and capability of efficiently undertaking this work and given the
high level of activity in the international pipeline construction industry,
there is no likely prospect that foreign contractors would be interested in
the work or that they could execute it at costs lower than would be obtained
through construction by force account methods by SNGPL. There are no domestic
pipeline companies capable of carrying out the work and therefore it is pro-
porsed that the project should be undertaken by SNGPL. Expatriate technical
assistance has been provided for design and supervision of installation of
the purification units. In addition, assistance would be provided for welding
inspection, coating and wrapping inspection and engineering of cathodic pro-
tection. Funds for this have been included in the proposed loan.
4.11      In order to strengthen SNGPL's management and technical staffing
the proposed project would provide overseas training for SNGPL personnel
in gas utility operations and management. A sum sufficient to provide
training for ten persons for one year each at overseas locations is in-
cluded in the cost estimate.
4.12      The sales projections assume the continued availability of 20 MMcfd
of gas from the Dhulian field and of 15 MMcfd from the Meyal field.  Reser-
voir eng'neering studies have recently been undertaken to determine the
optimum rate of gas off take, and the Government will consult with the Bank
on the findings of the studies. In addition, the Government has undertaken
not to pernit the use of raw gas from the Sui gas field by any other users



- 13 -
if this may result in a reduction in the availability of raw gas to SNGPL
at a sustained rate of 436 MMcfd to the year 2000. This will provide a
supply of gas sufficient to ensure full utilization of the expanded facil-
ities.
4.13      Construction of the Sui-Multan section of pipeline would start in
August 1975 and be complete by November 1975 while the remainder of the large
diameter pipe-laying would start in April 1976 and be complete by March 1977.
Construction of compressor stations would commence in February 1976 and would
be complete in September 1977. Construction and installation of the purifica-
tion plant would start in June 1976 and be complete by June 1977, while the
distribution system is to be expanded over the years 1975 through 1978, in
conjunction with the construction of the lateral to Sargodha.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      The forecast rapid growth in Pakistan's energy demand must be met
if economic growth is not to be severely constrained. The economic losses
involved in not having required energy available from any source would be
patently large, but cannot be quantified. The economic evaluation is based
on a comparison of the proposed project with the next most economic alterna-
tive. Since the Government is already developing other indigenous sources
of power as rapidly as possible, the only practical alternative to the pro-
posed project is to increase energy imports. Accordingly, the economic
evaluation compares the proposed project against the alternative of increas-
ing imports of petroleum products, and it concludes that the proposed proj-
ect is fully justified.
5.02      Natural gas is one of the cleanest fuels available and, thus, the
project would also have environmental benefits in comparison with alternative
energy sources; however, these have not been quantified.
B. Gas Sales
5.03      SNGPL's average-day gas sales are expected to increase from 231
MMcfd in 1975 to 318 MMcfd in 1979, and to remain at that level during the
remainder of the forecast period. These volumes represent 78% and 77%,
respectively, of the maximum daily throughout of 297 MMcfd in 1975 and 415
MMcfd in 1979. Given the daily variation in throughput from the maximum,
these average-day sales figures represent virtually the maximum achievable
sales. Details of SNGPL's past and projected sales by area and industry
are given in Tables 6 and 7.
5.04      The recent construction of the loopline from Sui to Lyallpur
under Project 3 A will permit the supply of about 15 MMcfd of gas to
WAPDA's new Lyallpur thermal power station by 1976, and this, together
with miscellaneous increases totalling 4 MMcfd, will raise average-day
sales from the present 225 MMcfd to 244 MMcfd.



- 14 -
5.05      The further expansion of sales from 244 NMcfd to 318 SMcfd, follow-
ing construction of Project 4, is based on expected additional sales of 35
YThIcfd to the Bank-financed Multan fertilizer plant, 15 Mcfd to WAPDA's
Lyallpur station, 6 MMcfd to a proposed fertilizer plant near Peshawar, 5
MMcfd to the Dandot and Hattar cement plants, 3 MMcfd to two sugar plants
at Peshawar, and 10 MMcfd to general industrial, commercial and domestic
consumers. Included in the last figure are sales to the new market area
of Sargodha (2 MMcfd).
5.06      The sales forecast is based on firm commitments for the supply of
gas to WAPDA's stations at Multan and Lyallpur, to the Multan fertilizer
plant, the Dawood Hercules fertilizer plant, the Pak-American fertilizer
plant, and the proposed Peshawar fertilizer plant. Projections for other
major industrial consumers are based on past consumption and conservative
assessments of future expansion. Projections for general industrial, com-
mercial and domestic customers in existing market areas are based on the
current rate of making new connections and, in the new market area, on
a detailed market survey.
5.07      The low price of gas in relation to alternative fuels provides an
assurance that any shortfall in consumption by one consumer will be rapidly
taken up by some other consumer. For example, WAPDA's Lahore station is
forecast to take 8 MMcfd on an as-and-when-available basis; to the extent
that it is available, this station will substitute gas for the more expen-
sive fuel oil and might easily use twice the forecast amount. In fact, in
1974, this station consumed an estimated 18 MMcfd. In the foreseeable
future, therefore, supply is the constraint, not market demand.
C. Economic Benefits
5.08      The economic benefits of the proposed project have been calculated
from a comparison of the economic cost of natural gas, delivered to each of
the principal centres of consumption, with the economic cost of imported
petroleum product in those same centres. For the purposes of this compari-
son the current (mid-1974) cost of fuel oil was used ($65 per ton, C&F
Karachi). However, if diesel or kerosene were to be used instead for fuel,
and naphtha for fertilizer production, or if the alternative were imported
crude oil refined in Pakistan, the benefits would be substantially increased.
5.09      From 1979 onwards, the proposed project would avoid the consump-
tion of about 640,000 tons of fuel oil, with an annual s4ving in economic
cost of about US$44 million (Table 8). In addition, the proposed project
would avoid the transport, handling and storage of this quantity of fuel
oil, which would necessitate acquisition of 700 railway tank cars., and
storage tanks to hold an extra 62,000 tons of fuel oil, at a cost of about
US$20 million (Table 9).
5.10      The project design has been optimised to supply the required maxi-
mum throughput with the minimum cost combination of pipe size and compression
capacity. The proposed project is therefore the minimum cost means of obtain-
ing the foregoing economic benefits.



- 15 -
5.11      About 1982 SGTC will start to add the compression for which their
ongoing Indus Right Bank pipeline is designed and, by 1986, their maximum
daily requirements of raw Sui gas are expected to reach 420 MMcfd. This,
together with SNGPL's requirements of 436 MMcfd and WAPDA's 140 MMcfd will
exceed the delivery capability of the Sui gas field (Annex 1) by 116 MMcfd
and, if additional reserves have not been connected to the pipeline system
by then, gas supplies to either SGTC or WAPDA will have to be curtailed.
Although SNGPL is assured of its gas requirements, the 116 MMcfd curtail-
ment in supplies is treated, for the purpose of calculating the economic
benefits of the project, as though it will fall entirely upon SNGPL. Accord-
ingly, project benefits are discontinued after 1982.
D.   Economic Return
5.12      The economic costs and benefits of the proposed project are shown
in Table 10. Based on an economic life of six years the foregoing benefits
would yield an overall return of about 33%. If sufficient additional re-
serves are connected to the pipeline system by 1982 to supply the shortfall
of 116 MMcfd, the economic life of the project will be extended to at least
twenty years and the return will be increased to about 39%. The economic
return on the lateral line to Sargodha, based on a 20-year life and includ-
ing distribution facilities in Sargodha, is about 48%.
5.13      If the price of fuel oil were to fall to US$48 per tQn, C&F Karachi,
which seems unlikely at present, project benefits would be reduced by about
25% and the return to about 25%.
5.14      If, as a result of the project taking longer to construct than
expected, construction costs were to overrun by 15% and project benefits
were deferred accordingly, the return would be reduced to about 28%. If,
in addition, the price of fuel oil were to fall to US$48 per ton the return
would be reduced to about 19%.
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Gas Tariff
6.01      Gas tariffs charged by SNGPL are subject to approval by the Min-
istry of Fuel, Power and Natural Resources. The Government has been slow
in permitting tariff revisions necessary to maintain the company's profita-
bility and, due to increases in excise taxes and the introduction of the
gas development surcharge (a form of sales tax), the net effect of the six
price increases which have been allowed since 1964 has been to increase the
firm's average sales price by only 25% over the 11-year period. These
tariff changes are summarized below:

Increase offset by higher excise
duty and gas development surcharge.
The present tariff structure is shown in Annex 3.
6.02      The present structure of gas tariffs is not based on the financial
or economic cost of providing the service, inasmuch as the tariff does not
reflect distance or the cost of supplying different classes of customer.
In part, this arises from the difficulty of identifying costs for different
classes of customer, because of the high proportion of joint costs, and, in
part, it arises from a Government policy, designed to assist backward areas
of the country, of equalizing energy costs across the country.  Also, the
Government regards the supply of gas to domestic consumers as being in the
nature of a public service the charge for which need not necessarily cover
the full financial costs, although domestic sales, which account for about
2% of total revenues, cover short term marginal economic costs. The Cov-
ernment, however, accepts the need for gas revenues to cover the overall
costs of operation and to provide an adequate return on operating assets.
The use of marginal cost pricing as a minimum, and charging "what the



- 17 -
traffic will bear" as a maximum, has permitted construction of larger, more
economic, pipelines than would otherwise have been possib'le, and has enabled
fertilizer, for example, to be produced in competition with low cost imports.
Nonetheless, following recent oil price increases, the price of gas to the
domestic consumer was substantially below that of alternative fuels and,
taking into consideration the subsidization of the domestic gas consumer
who, in Pakistan, is generally in the upper-income levels, it seemed appro-
priate and desirable for the domestic gas price to be increased. Therefore,
the Government has increased the gas tariff for domestic consumers as part
of the last overall tariff increase.
B. Past Financial Performance
6.03      During the four-year period 1970-73, SNGPL's financial performance
deteriorated substantially. While sales increased by about 75%, operating
expenses increased by more than 90% during the period; the operating ratio
increased from 67 in 1970 to 74 in 1973 (Table 11). The return on net fixed
assets fell from 12.4% in 1970 to just over 7% in 1972 and 1973 (Table 12).
6.04      Fundamental deterioration of the firm's earnings performance began
in 1971, reflecting the combined impact of higher transmission and distribu-
tion operating costs, substantially increased depreciation and interest
charges with the implementation of Projects 2 and 3, and increased corporate
tax rates. The May 1972 devaluation of the Pakistan rupee significantly in-
creased the cost of debt servicing of SNGPL's large foreign loan account and
the depreciation charges on its adjusted fixed asset base. Although SNGPL
applied for a tariff increase soon after the devaluation to cover its increased
costs, it was not until August 1973, sixteen months later, that an increase
was granted.
6.05      The 1970 Loan Agreement (696-PAK) has a financial covenant sti-
pulating a return on net fixed assets of 10% up to FY 1973 and 12% there-
after. The devaluation of the Pakistan rupee produced a major change in
SNGPL's financial position and had the effect of reducing the return from
about 9.5% and 11.5% in 1972 and 1973 to 7.1% and 7.3% respectively. Like-
wise the debt/equity ratio would have been 69/31 in 1972 and 70/30 in 1973
compared with the actual ratios of 79/21 and 81/19. The liquidity position
of SNGPL also worsened during the 1970-73 period. Net working capital de-
clined from a surplus of PRs 57.9 million at the end of 1970 to a deficit
of PRs 5.4 million on June 30, 1973. During the same period the cash balance
declined from PRs 37.5 million to PRs 8.5 million. Further details of SNGPL's
financial performance during this period are shown in Tables 11 and 12.
6.06      SNGPL's net fixed assets rose during the period from PRs 311.8 mil-
lion in 1970 to PRs 791.6 million in 1973. Almost 40% of the increase was
caused by the revaluation of assets financed by foreign loans, following
the devaluation of the rupee in May 1972. Normal capital expenditures,
and the heavy expenditure relating to Projects 2 and 3 during the 1971-73
period, accounted for the remaining additions to fixed assets. The in-
crease in net fixed assets over the period was financed to a large extent
by debt liabilities, as shown below:

C. Present Financial Position
6.08      SNGPL's operating results for FY 1974 indicate that the firm's
financial performance has improved considerably over 1973 (Table 11).
This improvement is primarily attributable to the gas tariff increase of
PRs 0.48 per Mcf which took effect August 11, 1973 and applied to all but



- 19 -
domestic consumers. The net average sales price per Mcf during the period
rose to PRs 2.84 from PRs 2.42 in 1973. During FY 1974, the operating
margin increased from the 1973 level of 26.1% to 34.0%, and the net profit
from 1.5% of sales to 7.2%.
6.09      The improvement in operating performance is also evident in the
firm's balance sheet position (Table 12).  The current ratio, whicil had
deteriorated to a critically low level of 0.50 on June 30, 1973, recovered
to 1.03 by June 30, 1974 after providing for a dividend of 12-1/2% as agreed
with the Bank. The debt/equity ratio of 79/21 compares favorably with the
ratio of 82/18 which prevailed at the end of FY 1973. The return on net
fixed assets likewise improved to 12.7% from 7.3% in 1973.
D. Financing Plan

The effect of this financing plan is that the debt/equity ratio would decline
from 79/21 in 1974 to 72/28 by tlhe end of the project implementation in 1978,
falling thereafter to 68/32 in 1980 (Table 13). SNGPL has undertaken not to
incur capital expenditures in excess of US$2.0 million equivalent per annum,
other than those contained in the Investment Program (Table 2), without prior
Bank agreement.
6.11      The estimated foreign exchange costs of the proposed project would
be financed by the proposed loan. The Government has confirmed that the
financing of local costs will be met by an equity contribution of PRs 265.0
million from the Government and from local borrowing of about PRs 190.0
million. The remainder will be provided from SNGPL's internal cash
generation. The Government would charge a 1% guarantee commission on
the amount of the Bank's loan, making an effective cost to SNGPL of 9.5%
per annum.
6.12      SNGPL's total cash flow for the years 1975-85 is given in Table 14.
Capital expenditures during that period will total PRs 1,265.5 million in-
cluding PRs 1,022.2 million for the proposed Project.
E. Financial Forecast
6.13      Projected revenue accounts for the period 1975-85, which include
a provision for an 8-1/2% annual escalation of operating costs, are showln
in Table 15 and representative accounts for the years 1975, 1978 aLnd 1982
are summarized below:

- 21 -
6.14      The projected operating results assume that SNGPL will obtain the
following minimum tariff adjustments:
(a)  an increase of PRs 0.20 per Mcf, in SNGPL's
prescribed price, effective July 1, 1975; this
is required to restore SNGPL's finances to a
position consistent with the financial covenants
of the 696-PAK Loan Agreement;
(b) further increases of PRs 0.70 per Mcf effective
July 1, 1976 and PRs 0.10 per Mcf effective
July 1, 1978; these are required to maintain
an adequate rate of return during construction
of the fourth project and thereafter.
The Government has approved the first of these increases and will review
the second with SNGPL and the Bank in March 1976 to ensure that the rate
of return covenant can be met. Under the terms of the 696-PAK Loan Agree-
ment, a minimum rate of return on net fixed assets of 12% is required from
FY 1974. This covenant will be relaxed to 10% during 1977 and 1978 to take
into account the financial impact in those years of initially under-utilized
assets and capacity.
6.15      During the period 1975 to 1979, a combination of higher tariffs
and throughput will increase gas revenues by about 71% while gas volume
and profits (before tax) will climb by approximately 30%. During the
remainder of the forecast period, sales volume and revenue level off,
while increasing operating expenditures more than offset lower interest
expenses and cause some decline in profits beyond 1980. Net income through
the period 1975-85 is sufficient to support equity dividends of 10% in each
year (12-1/2% during 1975/77) and to allow reserves to build up by more than
PRs 55.0 million during the period. Debt service coverage falls to a mini-
mum of 1.1 in 1977, rising to 1.9 in 1985.
6.16      The projected balance sheets for the years 1975 to 1985 are
shown in Table 13.  Long term debt which reaches a peak of approximately
PRs 1,083.0 million by 1977 will be reduced to PRs 541.0 million by 1980.
The debt/equity ratio, 73/27 in 1977, will decline gradually to 54/46 by
1985. The 696-PAK Loan Agreement permits dividend payments only if a
current ratio of 1.5/1.0 is achieved after payment. To prevent an ex-
cessive accumulation of cash this requirement should be modified to
1.2/1.0 during the period of construction and to 1.0/1.0 from 1978 on-
wards. Details of the assumptions used in the financial projections are
shown in Annex 3.
F. Audit and Insurance
6.17      SNGPL is audited jointly by A. F. Ferguson & Company and Rahim Jan
& Company, both Pakistani firms with offices in Lahore. Audited accounts are
published annually within an acceptable period after the end of each financial



- 22 -
year. Semi-annual unaudited accounts are also published to meet the require-
ments of the Securities Exchange Rules of 1971.  In conformity with tiie terms
of the 696-PAK Loan Agreement, the auditors also certify whether the Company
has complied with the Bank's loan conditions. These auditing arrangements are
satisfactory.
6.18      SNGPL carries adequate liability and property insurance on its
facilities including a collective fire and consequential loss of profit
policy and a public liability policy.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreement was reached on the following principal points:
(a)  SNGPL to strengthen its construction department,
and to undertake a program of staff training
(paras 3.05 and 3.08);
(b)  SNGPL to employ consultants for design and
installation of purification units (para 4.10);
(c)  the Government to consult with Bank on findings
of reservoir engineering studies and to assure
adequate gas supplies to SNGPL's pipeline system
(para 4.12);
(d)  SNGPL not to undertake additional capital
expenditures in excess of US$2.0 million
per annum without prior Bank approval
(para 6.10).
7.02      The Government and SNGPL have made satisfactory arrangements for
financing local costs (para 6.11).
7.03      SNGPL has reaffirmed financial covenants of Loan 696-PAK, with
some modifications (paras 6.14 and 6.16).
7.04      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan to SNCPL of
US$60.0 million equivalent for a term of 22 years, including a four and
a half year grace period.

PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES PROJECT
Gas Reserves
General
Gas reserves have been reviewed in connection with each project
involving SNGPL system expansion. In each case the available reserve in
Sui was so large in terms of the projected withdrawal rates that there was
no need for serious concern. The proposed fourth expansion of the SNGPL
system, coupled with the construction of SGTC's Indus Right Bank Project
along with the addition of the Guddu thermal power station requirements
together will fully commit the Sui reserves. Appendix 1 summarizes the
estimated recoverable reserves in Pakistan as of January 1, 1974. The
location of the various fields relative to the gas transmission systems
is shown on Map 11214.
Meyal and Dhulian
It is proposed to base project 4 in part on gas from the Meyal
field. No reserve or reservoir study is available, the only information
being that contained in a symposium paper 1/ which makes the following
observation: "New oil fields have been discovered at Karsal, Tut and
Meyal all in the Potwar. The reserves of oil have not been ascertained
due to difficulties in making such estimates in fissured limestone fields".
In the absence of a firm basis for supply from this new Northern field the
third project was designed on the premise that facilities would be provided
to supply the project from Sui and Dhulian. A pipeline was laid in 1974
to take Meyal gas to Dhulian for processing and input to the SNGPL system.
The output of Dhulian was increased from 20 to 27 MMcfd following project 3
but it was found impossible to maintain this volume. Project 4 therefore
assumes an availability of only 20 MMcfd and it is proposed to obtain
15 MMcfd from Meyal. In the feasibility study, SNGPL states, "The sup-
plies from Meyal are estimated to be much higher and thus any shortfall
from Dhulian over the study period is likely to be offset by the antici-
pated additional supplies from Meyal". In the opinion of Bank staff, there
is a real possibility of decline below 20 MMcfd from Dhulian, and a reser-
voir study is required to confirm even the proposed offtake of 15 MMcfd from
Meyal. The available information indicates that even the basis for such

ANNEX 1
Page 2
studies (drilling records) is lacking. In view of the difficulty of making
an estimate of reserves in a fissured limestone field, such estimates must
be used with due regard to the probable margin of error. The Government
should agree, therefore, to undertake a reservoir study, by independent
reservoir engineers approved by the Bank, of the gas reserves and deliver-
ability 1/ from Dhulian and Meyal. If such study does not support the com-
bined withdrawal of 35 MMcfd through 1997, curtailment of sales for less
economic uses will have to be made to offset the shortfall, and the gas
tariff adjusted accordingly. However, even if reservoir data were avail-
able now, it is unlikely that the project's design would be significantly
affected, since the project is concerned with increasing the flow of gas
from Sui rather than from Dhulian or Meyal.
Sui
With regard to Sui, Pakistan Petroleum Limited, the field
operators, have stated: 2/
"It is pointed out that keeping in view the production
history of field, the recoverable reserves and various
reservoir parameters, the optimum producibility of the
field is estimated at about 1,000 MMcfd. --- The maximum
potential of 1,000 MMcfd could be sustained for 11 years
provided it is attained by 1986. --- It is our considered
opinion that the producibility and sustained production
period of the field be taken into account when deciding
on new projects based on gas ex Sui Field    ".
Bank staff accept these conclusions:
Upon recalculation of pressure decline forecast based on, specific
projects subsequently submitted, Pakistani Petroleum Limited (PPL) have
projected the delivery capacity limit at 935 MMcfd of raw gas from January
1986 through December 1997, or at 876 MMcfd from 1 January, 1986 through
31 December, 2000. In order to assure an uncurtailed supply of gaLs for
the projects through the year 2000 rather than 1997, it is proposed to
limit total offtake of raw gas from Sui to the following volumes:
1/   Deliverability refers to the daily rate at which the available reserve
of reservoir fluids (oil, gas and water), can be produced without
physical damage to the wells or reservoir and with due regard to the
economic limit in the number of wells drilled.  Deliverability is thus
of coequal importance with the reserve estimate and should not be over-
looked in connection with stated reserves.

The 436 MMcfd of raw natural gas, after deduction of shrinkage
due to purification and gas used by compressors and auxiliaries along the
pipeline, will provide 380 MMcfd to sales. If the above schedule is adhered
to, curtailments in maximum-day delivery of gas will likely begin about the
year 2001, and will increase thereafter, thus affecting the useful life of
the SNGPL system. This has been reflected in a change in the depreciation
rate and the required gas tariff.

APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Financial Forecasts
1.        Interest and other charges on the Bank loan during construction
are treated as operating expenses.
2.        SNGPL's present gas tariff structure, as shown in Annex 3, forms
the basis for estimating the sales price of gas, together with the follow-
ing assumed tariff increases:
Additional PRs per Mcf
July 1, 1975         PRs 0.20
July 1, 1976         PRs 0.70
July 1, 1978         PRs 0.10
3.        The purchase price of gas assumed in the financial forecast is
based on the schedule below. It is expected that the Government will allow
SNGPL to pass on any increases in these prices to consumers in the form of
higher tariffs.
Field                Price

Next 5 MMcfd         PRs 2.037 per Mcf
Over 15 MMcfd        PRs 1.975 per Mcf
4.        In accordance with an agreement between SGTC and SNGPL, dated
June 28, 1972, the cost of gas purification is being shared proportionately
between the two firms. Under the agreement, SNGPL is charged the direct
operating, depreciation and interest costs associated with Purification
Banks 5, 6 and 7, together with a proportionate share of the costs of
operating joint facilities, and these combined charges are shown as gas
purification expenses in the profit and loss accounts. Costs of operating
existing banks have been estimated in consultation with SGTC on the basis
of projected purification volumes. Operating costs of the new purxification
banks to be installed at Sui in 1977 are based on costs of operating existing



ANNEX 4
Page 2
facilities, escalated at 8-1/2% per year. For purposes of consistency, puri-
fication costs shown in the accounts for both the existing SGTC-operated
facilities and the proposed new units include depreciation. Purification
costs include an allowance for boiler fuel of 3% of the cost of Sui gas pur-
chased. An amount equivalent to 4% of total purification charges is allo-
cated to internal consumption and included under compression costs. Charges
from POL for purification of gas ex-Meyal are based on PRs 0.15 per Mcf during
the first five years and PRs 0.12 per Mcf thereafter.
5.        Transmission costs are based on Sui Northern's actual experience
*           and on the budg4ed figures for the financial year ended June 30, 1975,-
escalated at 8-1/2% per annum. Base costs (FY 1975) used to estimate in-
cremental charges for new facilities are shown below:
Metering            PRs 508 per mile
Cathodic protection PRs 1,579 per mile
Other:                         Cost factor    Cost per mile
Loop lines                         .3          PRs 1,927

Single lines-normal terrain       1.0          PRs 6,422
6.        Distribution costs are estimated as follows:
(a) Existing system - budgeted figures for FY 1975, escalated
by 8-1/2% per year.
(b) Fixed costs of establishing and maintaining stations in
new development areas - based on actual experience of

Cost per connection                     101
These costs, escalated at 8-1/2% per year, are applied to future years
on the basis of the planned distribution expansion programme.
7.        Compression costs are estimated on the basis of actual experience
and budgeted figures for FY 1975, escalated at 8-1/2% per annum. Variable
operating costs of PRs 50.66 are applied (1975 base year) to incremental
compressor running hours, and allowances for increases in fixed operating
costs are included from 1976.
8.        Provision for statutory contributions to workers' participation
fund and workers' welfare fund has been made at 8% of profit before tax.
9.        Interest is calculated on the following assumptions:
(a) Foreign loans will incur an interest rate of 8.5% per
annum on the reducing balance, repayable in 35 equal
semi-annual installments commencing in March 1980. An
additional Government guarantee commission of 1% per
annum is also assumed.
(b) Local loans will carry an interest rate of 12.5%
per annum, with repayment commencing after two years
in 16 equal half-yearly instalments.
(c) Existing loans/debentures carry interest rates in
accordance with their terms.
10.       Tax has been calculated at the existing rate of 55%.

11.       SNGPL normally distributes dividends at a rate of 10% per annum
on paid up capital. No dividends were paid in 1972 and 1973. Dividends
of 12-1/2% have been assumed for the years 1975 to 1977 and 10% thereafter,
except on additional equity during the first three years.
12.       Depreciation is calculated for accounts purposes on the straight
line method and for tax purposes on the reducing balance method.  Effective
FY 1975, SNGPL intends to increase the depreciation rate on transmission
lines from 2-1/2% to approximately 3.75% to reflect a termination of economic
life in 2000 with a 10% residual value.  Depreciation rates applicable to
major assets are as follows:
