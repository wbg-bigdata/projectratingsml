FOUKrH SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINE PROJECT (LOAN 1107-PAZ)
PREFACE
Loan 1107-PAZ (Fourth Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Project) was signed on May 15,
1975. The loan in the amount of USM6O.0 million was reduced to US$52.3 million due
to foreign exchange savings and was fully disbursed in December 1982. The operation
of the revamped gas transmission system started in 1979. The initial benefits
generated by the project started in 1980 and reached their maximum after full
utilization of the transmission and distribution system in 1982. This Project
Completion Report was prepared by the Energy Department and was based on information
obtained during project supervision and from the Appraisal, President and
Supervision reports as well as other documents from the project files. The Borrower
submitted a final completion report containing its vievw on the project
implementation and supplied additional data for the PCR.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, the Project Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report to the
Government and the Borrower. The comments which were received have been taken
into account in preparing the final report and they are reproduced in the
Appendix.

FOURTH SUm NORTHERN GAS PIPELINE PROJECT (LON 1107-PAK)
PROJECT WC:IELPIETI  REPRT
HLRhliEhts
1.       The Fourth Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Project (SNGPL IV) wa approved
by the Executive Directors on May 8, 1975 for an amount of US$60.0 sillion to
assist in financing the expansion of SNGPL gas transmission and distribution
system. The project is a continuation of Pakistan's development program to
utilize indigenous gas resources for substituting imported oil.
2.       The principal objective was to increase the capacity of SNGPL's gas
transmission and distribution system to transpart natural gas from Sui,
Dhulian and Meyal fields to industrial, camercial and dosestic consumers in
the northern area of Pakistan. The SNGPL IV project provided for the
construction of facilities to increase the system's capacity fran 297 !KCFD to
415 NKCFD.
3.       The final project cost was US$116.0 million of which US$52.3 million
was the foreign exchange cost and an equivalent of US$63.7 million were local
costs. Compared with the total project cost at appraisal of US$103.2 million
the cost overrun was 12.4Z. The difference between appraisal cost estimate
and final cost was in local costs (para. 4.04). The increase in local costs
was due to an expansion in scope of the gas transmission and distribution
network during project implementation, which was carried out by force
account. On the other hand, savinRs in foreign exchange costs resulted, due
to lower than estimated steel prices for linepipe amounted to US$7.7
million. This anount of US$7.7 million was cancelled so that the total amount
disbursed at the closing date was USS52.3 million.
4.       The Bank financed all the required foreign exchange costs of the
project and provided technical support which was instrumental in achieving
project objectives. The project served also as a vehicle for continuing the
dialogue with GOP addressing energy pricing issues and the long-term
development of the country's uatural gas resources.
5.       SNGPL IV project, similar to SNGPL III, was constructed by the
Borrower's internal construction forces. The project as appraised was
completed on time and within budget except for the additional work which was
added after appraisal to recover associated gas from Neysl field and the
expansion of distribution network which delayed the final completion until
December 1982 (paras. 3.02, 3.03).
6.       During the project period GOP substantially increased its control on
SNQGL directly through its majority in the Board of Directors and indirectly
through legislative actions, tariff adjustment procedures and important
management decisions. However, SN QL managed to remain a fully competent
operating unit to perform the demanding task of a public utility. Financial
projections have remained satisfactory despite the limitations on available



gas supplies and the delays in granting tariff increases by GOP (paras. 7.01,
7.15). SNGPL's financial performance has been satisfactory particularly in
the relatively high level of self financing.
7.       The structural imbalance between the supply of natural gas and
rapidly increasing demand has resulted in gas shortages and load shedding.
The important technical proposal put forward for immediate consideration was
that all power statioos which can be converted to fuel oil should be modified
to operate on dual firing, using gas in sumer and fuel oil in winter when gas
demand exceeds supply (para. 10.3). Gas utilization in thermal power
generation should be interruptible to release gas for the substitution of
premium grade fuels used in domestic and commercial applications. Government
has already made some progress in this direction.



PAKISTAN
FOURTE SUI NORTHERN GS PIPELINE PROJ CT - LOAN 1107-PAL
COPLEI    REPORT
I.       DUCTICZ
1.01     Comuercial energy denand in Pakistan increased over the past decade
at an annual rate of 7X reaching 14.0 million TOE in 1982. The main sources
of supply are oil, natural gas and hydropower. The share of natural gas and
hydropower has iucreased over the same period fran 46Z to 58Z and that of oil
has decreased from 45S to 37Z. In 1975 proven gas reserves in Pakistan were
estimated at 16.4 TCF and remaining recoverable reserves at 12.9 TCF. The
major gas field is Sui with original recoverable reserves of 10.5 TCF followed
by Mari field estimated to contain 4._ TCF. Sui field production is totally
comitted to the two existing gas tr=amission systems feeding south to
Karachi, Sui Gas Transmission Company (SG&C) and north up to Peshwrar, Sui
Nortbern Gas Pipelines, Ltd. (SNGPL). With Sui field approaching plateau
production, the gap between domestic supply and demand continues to grow
resulting in increased oil imports. The growth of domestic energy supply and
the severe seasonal load shedding of both natural gas and electricity has
disrupted industrial production and consequently increased costs. The GOP is
accelerating the development of domestic energy resources to resolve these
problems, at the same time easing the pressure on the balance of payments and
improving the prospects for continued economic growth.
1.02     Apart from the present loan (Fifth Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Project)
the Bank has financed five loans for the construction of gas pipelines in
Pakistan totalling some US$108 million equivalent. The first loan (99-PAK)
was made to SGIC in 1954 and the remainder to SNG(L in 1964 (377-PAK), in 1969
(597-PAK) 1970 (696-PAR), and the completed Project, SNGPL IV, in May 1975
(1107-PAK).
1.03     This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission who visited
Pakistan in January 1984 and the completion report submitted by SNGPL in April
1983.
II. PROJECr PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     Pakistan's investment program continued, after completion of SNGPL
project III, the development of available uncommitted gas supplies from Sui
field to meet market demand for power generation at Multan and Lyallpur
(Faisalabad) plus the expansion of industrial, coamercial and donestic gas
distribution to substitute for petroleum products. The Bank responded to GOP
and SNGPL's request to finance the proposed development of the gas
transmission system and an appraisal mission visited 7akistan in May 1974.
RBnk staff appraised the project in April 1975 with the assistance of two
consultants
2.02     The project as originally conceived consisted of facilities necessary
to increase the capacity of SNGPL's gas transmission system from 297 NMCFD to



415 MMCFD (380 MMCFD from Sui field and 35 MICFD from Dhulian and Meyal
fields). The project as appraised provided for the construction of:
(i)      116 miles of high pressure large diameter loop pipelines (16",
18") and 15 miles of small dianeter lateral pipeline (6");
(ii)     Three new compressor stations and increasing compression
capacity of existing stations;
(iii)    Two 100 HOCFD gas purification units at Sui field;
(iv)     Low pressure distribution to expand the existing systen and to
supply new areas;
(v)      Telecommunications equipment for one compressor station;
(vi)     Supply of construction materials and equipment; and
(vii)    Technical assistance and training.
III.  PROJECT IMPLEENT.rION
Background
3.01     The third expansion project, SNGPL III, increased _he capacity of the
gas transmission systen from 277 NMCFD to 297 MMCFD to supply gas to WAPD&
power station at Lyallpur (Faisalabad). Construction was undertaken by SNGPL
using its own equipment and labor. The quality and progress of work proved to
be acceptable by international standards. Given the high level of activity in
the pipeline industry worldwide in the period of 1975-1978 it was agreed that
the project execution for the fourth expansion project also could be
undertaken substantively by SNGPL through force-account construction and would
be the most cost-efficient to implement the project. However, given the size
and complexity of the development program under project IV it was also
recognized that expatriate technical assistance would be needed in specific
areas to assist SNGPL staff in organizing and executing the project.
Implementarion Performance
3.02     Despite a number of minor problens, the main components of the
project were completed on time. The extension of closing date relates to
project amendments after Board approval. The coustruction of the main gas
transmission pipeline loops for the originally appraised project were
completed on time. The two purification plants were planned to be constructed
by SGJC. Working arrangements with SGCC could not be finalized and SNGPL
completed the construction work itself about one year later than the date
originally estimated. The gas compression stations were also delayed due to
the shortage of pipe fittings which were not ordered and delivered on time.
Despite these delays, all these components were completed by the planned
completion date of June 1978.
3.03     The project cost was estimated in 1974 when steel prices were
exceptionally high. Steel pipes were purchased in 1975 at much lower prices
than estimated resulting in savings in foreign costs. SNsCPL subsequently



-3-
requested the Bank to expand the scope of the transmission and distribution
system component of the project. This request was approved by the Bank in
October 1976 and the loan agreement was amended to include the additional work
as follows:
(i)   construction of 96 miles of 8 inch diameter high pressure
pipelines to extend the present system to serve Wazirabad,
Gujarat, Sialkot, Bahawalpur and Sadiqabad; and
(ii)  construction of 20 miles of 10 inch diameter high pressure
pipeline to the Raripur Fertilizer Plant.
The appraisal report had originally taken account of gas supply to a planned
fertilizer plant; this was located later at Haripur. Gas supplies were
considered adequate for additional consumers because average sales volumes
were below the restricted off-take figures from Sui field and WAPDM gas
consumption was reduced because of greater availability of hydro-power. In
1979 GOP requested to use part of the loan funds to finance the utilization of
associated gas from Meyal field which otherwise would have been flared. The
Bank responded with its approval to finance the dehydration facilities and the
tie-in pipeline from Meyal to Dhulian, which was already connected to the
system. Only the additional work for the utilization of associated gas from
Meyal field and for expanding the distribution network which was approved in
1979 resulted in the delay of construction completion until 1982.
Gas Supply/Demand Balance
3.04     The completed project consisted of facilities necessary to increase
the capacity of SNGPL's gas transmission system from 297 MHCFD to 415 MCFD
through additional gas purification units, pipeline loops and compression-
Expansion of the low pressure distribution system was not quantified duriL6
appraisal and SNGPL continued the expansion within the system capacity and
fiscal allowances. The system capacity after project completion proved
adequate to handle the gas supply as forecast in the appraisal report. The
gas supply cnmmitments by source to meet peak denand for the period 1975-1982
were as follows:

In early 1979 Heyal field was expected to supply SNGPL increasing quantities
of gas rangiug from 30 IMMCFD in 1979 to 110 MMCFD in 1985 and onwards. SNGPL
based its expansion in part on these projections which never fully
materialized due, in part, to the unexpectedly severe difficulties experienced
in the drilling and completion of the development wells at Meyal.

3.05     The projected gas demand at appraisal compared with the average daily
consumption over the same period 1975-1982 was as follows:
AVERAGE MILY DEMAND (MMCFD)
APPRAISAL                 ACTUAL
1975                      230.6                    252.4
1976                      244.1                    231.3
1977                      254.1                    246.6
1978                      299.8                    234.1
1979                      317.5                    247.4
1980                      317.9                    298.9
1981                      317.9                    320.3
1982                      317.9                    339.2
The difference betwen estimated and actual gas sales in the table above
reflects the delsys in construction of the gas purification plant and
compression stations for the year 1978 as well as the delay in the
construction of Multan fertilizer plant until late 1979. For 1981-1982 actual
sales more than exceeded the appraisal estimates as average gas demand grew
very rapidly.
3.06     At the time of appraisal no independent assessment was available on
Toot and Meyal fields oil reserves and their associated gcs production
capacities. In 1978 Bank supervision mission reported that independent
evaluation by consultants indicated that associated gas from Toot and Meyal
fields will be adequate to meet SNGPL's requirements and the feasibility study
of the Uch field was therefore considered as no longer required. Further
studies carried out by Ges Development Corporation (GDC) consultants
recnmmended to GOP a medium-term development plan to increase gas production
from proven fields (Pirkoh, Kandhkot, Mari and Sui Upper Limestone). Uch field
was not considered in the study partly because GOP did not authorize the
developnent drilling required for evaluating the gas reserves to prove the
adequacy of gas deliveries and partly because of the poor quality of Uch gas.
Technical Assistance and Performance of Consultants
3.07     SNGPL engaged specialized c%,nsulting firms to carry out welding
inspection for the quality control of construction work for the high pressure
gas transmission pipelines.  The consultants' performance was satisfactory.
SNGPL prepared duty specifications for the purification plants in accordance
with previous designs prepared by foreign contracting firm for the existing
plants. Another foreign engineering firm prepared the detailed engineering
and procured the materials and equipment for the two 100 MMCFD purification
plants. Erection supervision was carried out by the engineering firm
including start-up and test runs; their performance was also satisfactory.
The actual operating performance of the two units was superior to the
guaranteed figures for gas quality and design flowrates.

SNGPL's Construction Performance
3.08     SNGPL used its own construction forces in practically all the project
work. There were substantial cost savings in foreign currency compared vith
the cost envisaged during appraisal. The work was completed within budget and
on schedule for the principal components of the project with the exception of
the purification units and compressor stations. SNGPL's performance was
exceptionally good and provided the comnany with the experience to construct
other oil and gas transmission pipelines in Pakistan.
Procurenent
3.09     SNGPL has complied with Bank guidelines and loan documents/
procurement directives. Procurement under the loan was divided into three
categories of contracts for materials and equipment costing the equivalent
of: (i) $250,000 or more, (ii) more than $25,000 up to $250,000; and (iii)
$25,000 and less provided that the aggregate of all such contracts shall unt
exceed $3,000,ODO. While categories (i) and (ii) were to be procured on the
basis of ICB, category Ciii) was exw-pted. Category Ci) was subject to Bank
review of all phases of procurement (advertising, bidding documents,-bid
analysis and contract award) while phases (ii), (iii) required the Borrower to
furnish to the Bank copies of the contracts prior to the submission of
applications for withdrawal of funds. SNGPL has commented on the ceilings and
thresholds of these categoriee for future loans and offered the following
suggestions for Bank consideration.
(a) Purchases against small orders under category (iii) of $25,000
and less should be without aggregate limitation.
(b)  The ceiling of contracts under category (.iL should be raised to
$500,000 instead of $250,000.
kc) Contracts costing less than $250,000 should be subject to LCB
with no limit on the aggregate of such contracts.
3.10     SN&PL has also commented on Bank procedures for disbursement which
result in delays in opening letters of credit to suppliers and proposed the
following:
(a) Application for qualified agreements to reimburse need not be
sent to the Bank for contracts costing more than $250,000
(category i) because such contracts are awarded after receiving
Bank approval.
(b) Contracts subject to LCB (category ii) and small orders
(category iii) to be exempted from qualified agreements to
reiLmurse.
(c) Amendments to letters of credit in respect of the delivery
schedule, country of origin or any such anendnents that do not
change the contract price should not be subject to Bank
approval.



-6-
(d)  SNGPL considers that changes in freight charges affecting the
value of letters of credit should be allowed within a reasonable
percentage of the value of purchase order. They propose 5Z for
category (i), IOZ for category (ii) and 15Z for category (iii)
provided that such amendments do not affect the ranking of the
successful bidders.
3.11     Most of these proposals/suggestions which would have proved
beneficial were considered in the Fifth Sui Northern Gas Project, Loan 2324-
PAK and were taken into account as follows:
(i)    Small orders estimated to cost not more than US$75,000
equivalent each may be procured through LIT provided, however,
that itens so procured shall not exceed US$500,000 equivalent in
the aggregate.
(ii)    With respect to contracts for goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of US$500,000 or more SNGPL will follow Bank
guidelines for ICB.
Ciii)    For contracts not governed by the preceding paragraph SNGPL will
forward all documents requested by the Bank with its
recommendations for award and the Bank will review these
documents to determine their concurrence with Bank's guidelines
for procurement.
(iv)    Except in cases involving an increase in the cost of a contract
by more than 15Z the Bank agrees without prior consultation to
any modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of a
contract, or grant5ng an extension, or issuing a change order.
IV.      ACHIEVEIMEN  OF OBJECTIVES
4.01     With the completion of the construction work the targeted capacity
increase was achieved at peak loads reaching 378 MMCFD from Sui field.  When
the reduced bore valves are totally replaced and the main gas transmission
pipeline is pigged periodically, improved flowrates can be attained. The gas
transmission and distribution system is operating at design capacity in the
winter months when demand reaches its maximum.
4.02     As a consequence of the relatively low price of gas as compared to
other sources of energy, the nunber of consumers (particularly in the
industrial and the domestic sectors) increased between 1975 and 1982 from
1,700 to 2,950 and 68,000 to 365,000 respectively. At the end of the project
period SNGPL was adding 50,000 new domestic consumers every year. Currently
the amount is limited to 28,000 per year because of gas shortages.
4.03     The development of the gas distribution network was such that gas
supply becane the constraint not market demand as expected in the appraisal
report. The low price of gas in relation to alternative fuels provided an
assurance that any shortfall in consumption by one consumer would be rapidly
taken up by some other consumer. SNGPL is now burdened with a curtailment
policy starting with power generation which is currently exposing the company
to financial penalties.

expenditures:

4.05     The difference between appraisal cost estimate and final cost is in
the local costs. The marked increase in local costs is due to the expansion
of the distribution component and the main transmission network (carried out
by force account) which was approved by the Bank. The high cost of steel
pipes during 1974 influenced the estimated cost at appraisal while the actual
cost of pipes purchased during 1975 was much lower when prices stabilized to
their normal level, resulting in a sizeable cost underrun and savings in
foreign exchange.
4.06     The original loan amount was US$60.0 million. On August 1, 1980 an
anount equal to US$7.0 million was cancelled; this was followed by another
cancellation of the undisbursed balance of US$712,658.64 on the final loan
closing date December 31, 1982.

5.02     The disbursement profile as given in Annex 1 covers approximately 8
years, mainly due to the extension of the scope of work. The foreign currency
component in the completed work represents 87Z of the loan amount and the
undisbursed balance (US$7.7 million) was cancelled. The underrun in foreign
costs was due to lower costs of piping materials.
VI.      INSTITUrIONAL DEVELOPMEKT AND PERFORMANCE
6.01     Background. SNGPL was incorporated as a limited liability company in
1963 and converted to a public conpany in 1964, with its registered office and
headquarters in Lahore. The principal business of the company is the
purifying, transmitting and distributing natural gas, mainly from the fields
in Sui, Keyal, Dhulian and Toot, to industrial, commercial, and residential
consumers. In addition, the Projects Department is involved in designing,
engineering, and constructing pipelines, not only for SNGEL' s projects but
also for outside clients.
6.02     GOP has, in line with appraisal expectations,increased its
participation in the conpany through an equity increase (in 1976 and 1977) so
that GOP is now, directly or through goverment controlled companies, the
major sharebolder. Table VII (1) below indicates the changes in ownership
during the project period:
Table VII (1) Structure of Ownership (Z)

Burmah Oil Company (BOC)              33.3             6.7

100.0          100.0
1/ Through GOP controlled companies.
6.03     Increased GOP participation has resulted in much more influence being
exercised by GOP on SNGPL's decision making process. SNGPL's Board consists
of 13 directors, including the Chairman and the Managing Director (MD). All
the members of the Board, with the exception of two, represent GOP. This
reflects the reported change in SNCPL's ownership and the related increasing
impact of GOP on SNGPL. At the time of appraisal, four directors represented
non-GOP controlled shareholders. The Managing Director is nominated jointly
by the Burmah Oil Conpany Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation and by



GOP. Since 1982 the Chairman of the Board has been SNQGL's Managing Director;
previously the Chairman was the Secretary of the Ministry of Petroleum.
However, the Ministry of Petroleum effectively retained the control over all
important decisions tbrough its nominees on the Board of Directors.
6.04     Organization and Manamement. SNQ(L's organization chart appears as
Annex 9. In the SAR, references to the increasing problem of management
control and the proposed changes are made. During the period under review,
most of the proposed changes were implemented. A separate department for
transmission distribution, sales and relecounuaication was established.
However, other changes in the organization proposed in the SAR and made during
the project for the purpose of alleviating the load of senior management were
not as effective as expected in the SAR. For example, the nunber of managers
reporting to the Managing Director, compared to the SAR, did not decline as
much as proposed. This and the remaining organizational issues were subject
to further discussions under the new project SNGPL V.
6.05     The only weakness of the organization is in planning, particularly
long-term demand/supply forecasting, tariffs, assessing the profitability of
various projects, and demand management. These inadequacies in planning may
to some extent be an organizational response to the increasing involvement of
GCP in all aspects of supply, demand, tariffs and investment decisions of
SNGPL, effectively reducing the direct value to SNGPL of developing its own
capabilities in these areas. This involvement has had overall a detrimental
impact on SNGPL's ability to function as an independent entity. The Bank's
policy was to strengthen SNGPL's managerial independence through increased
financial independence. This policy was reflected in the continuing dialogue
with SNGPL and GOP. In the meantime, SNGPL established a separate planning
department and waged a serious effort to improve its planning capabilities.
It should be noted however, that despite GOP involvement, SNGFL managed to
remain a fully competent operating entity and by far the best qualified
institution in Pakistan to perform its demanding job of a public utility.
6.06     Staffing.  SNGPL has, at present, a staff of about 3500 people,
including 420 professionals. At the time of the SAR SNGPL enployed about 2500
people. The staff growth is, in principle, in line with expectations, and is
reasonable. However, the size of the construction department is of concern,
particularly if the planned outside contracts (see Section IV (4)) do not
materialize. In the SAR it was reported that there were plans to compete for
construction contracts in the Middle East; however, these did not materialize
after the project implementation period. A major contract work outside
Pakistan would substantially change the character of SNGPL's operations,
because the business risk associated with the (outside) contracting
activities differs considerably from the business risk associated with the
main activity, which is transmitting and distributing gas. Perhaps the best
solution could be to separate contracting activities as a subsidiary of
SNGPL. There were various conversations with SNGFL on this subject, mainly in
the framework of the appraisal of SNGPL V. As a result SNG?L stopped hiring
pezsonnel for the construction department and the number of positions
substantially reduced.



- 10 -
Personnel Policy
6.07     The employee relations remained good during the project period.  The
non-professional staff is unionized and works under two-year agreements. The
last agreement provided for a 15X salary increase across the board, together
with a 62 annual increase. The minimum wage is PRs 204/month, but, taking
into account a 5-month bonus and other benefits, overtime, etc., it reached
PRs 683/month. The average wage of unionized staff is about PRs2000/month,
which is attractive by local standards. Professionals are not unionized, they
do not obtain bonuses or overtime, and their average pay is PRs 4800/month.
It seems that many are dissatisfied as they have reached the top of their pay
scales and they are not eligible for any salary increases. However, the
salary package and the job security offered remains attractive by local
standards and this is reflected in the remarkably low turnover of the staff,
(2.9% for professionals and 1.7Z for other staff). This can probably be also
explained by the relatively young age of the staff, perhaps the lack of
alternatives within the country, and the reduced employment opportunities in
the Middle East.
Training
6.08     There is a perception by senior staff that the declining compensation
benefits have an impact on the overall quality of the professional staff.
SNGPL does not have an internal training program, and as a result, a provision
of US$184,000 was included in the SNGPL IV project to cover the training
expenses abroad. This included training institutes' tuition fees and living
allowances of the participants. The training program was broadly divided into
two categories: (i) technical staff and (ii) managers. The training for
technical staff was organized    acccmmodate (i) infoxmative courses about the
latest developments in the rel. ant fields of engineering and gas technology;
(ii) visits to gas transmission and distribution companies; and (iii) visits
to major manufacturing compauies of related equipment. The training of the
managerial staff was oriented toward broadening their outlook and familiarity
with relevant practice and techniques. Although it was recognized that
differences in the social enviromnents are a serious limitation in the
immediate applicability of these methods in Pakistan, the experiences from
these courses and methods were highly appreciated by participating
individuals. The training program was considered educational aad useful by
all participants. The basic objectives of these training programs were
realized. It should be noted, however, that the management and control of the
training program were not very satisfactory, particularly because of
inadequate evaluation and the dissemination of the information from the
training. This shortcoming is recognized by the management of SNGPL. The
lesson to be learned is that better reporting and evaluation are required on
the results of training.
6.09     Accounting and Management Information System.  SNGPL has an efficient
accounting system, based on coamercial accounting principles, in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act of Pakistan. The comprehensive
system of costing and budgeting for the purpose of management control was
further improved and, during the project period, functioned to the
satisfaction of the Bank. The monthly information required by the Bank was
provided promptly and in adequate detail. Most of the accounting functions
are computerized, using SNGPL's own facilities and personnel.



- 11 -
6.10     Audit. SNGCL was audited jointly by two Pakistani finns. SNGPL
books were well kept and the external auditor's reports were unqualified,
prepared promptly and in a very satisfactory fashion. Auditors also
certified, as agreed in the Loan Agreement, to the compliance with the
covenants. This practice worked very satisfactorily.
6.11     Insurance. During the project SNGPL carried adequate liability and
property insurance on its facilities, including a fire and consequential loss
of profit policy and adequate public liability insurance policy. The policies
were issued by the National Insurance Corporation, a state owned insurance
company. The assets of the conpany were insured at their original value in
PR's, with an adjustment for a subsequent exchange loss, so that SNQGL is not
fully covered for foreign inflation.
VII.    FINAICIAL PERFORNAACE
7.01     The implied financial objectives of the project were oriented towards
maintaining and possibly strengthening SNGWL's financial position, as
reflected in the financial covenants and the financing plan (see paras. 8.01
and 8.02). SNGPL's financial perfomnance over FY75-83 has been satisfactory,
particularly in view of the good levels of self-financing. Statements showing
SNGPL's Income Statement, Balance Sheets and Sources and Applications over
FY75-83, together with the SAR estimates, appear as Annexes 2, 3 and 4. These
estimates were based on 1979 constant prices at the exchange rate of 1US$ -
PRs9.9 and because of price level differences are not readily comparable with
the actuals.
7.02     Income Statements. The volume of gas sales is close to SAR
estimates, (with slightly higher gas offtake from Sui and slightly lower gas
offtake from the Dhulian and Meyal fields). The significant differences were
recorded during FY77-78, with sales 20Z below estimate because of lower
offtake by Wapda power stations and the delay in the commissioning of the Pak-
Arab fertilizer plant. In current prices tli" tariff increases estimated in
the SAR were less than the actual increases. As a result, the average
revenues have increased much faster than anticipated in the SAR. The table
below indicates the increases in average revenues per MCF in current prices:

Although the average sale price is still low by international standards (see
para. 7.03), the table above indicates that the average revenues per MCF
increased by 95% (in current terms) and by 36% in constant terms.  Compared to
SAR, the revenue increases in constant terms were slightly below expectations.
7.03     The cost of gas at the closing date of the loan, was:
Table VIII (2) Cost of Gas Purchase/a
(PRs/Mcf)
Field            Rate    Excise Duty    Total    US$ Equivalent
Sui              3.35        2.43         5.78            0.42
Dhulian/Meyal   2.00         2.43         4.43            0.32
Toot             2.00         2.43        4.43            0.32
/a Including the gas development surcharge, a form of sales tax.
In the SAL, it was estimated that the purchase price of gas would remain
constant at PRs2.00/Mcf, so that the price to SNGPL (inclusive of excise
duties) is about 155% above the SAR expectations (in current terms) and 43Z
above the SAR expectations in constant terms.
7.D4     The operating costs became increasingly higher than the SAR
expectations for the FY80-83 period, mostly as a result of the higher cost of
gas purchased by SNGPL and used as boiler fuel for purification purposes and
in compression stations.
7.05     During FY75-77 the depreciation was slightly below the SAR estimate
because of delays in capital expenditures. During FY78-83, the depreciation
was higher than the SAR estimate because of significantly higher capital
expenditures and the devaluation of the Pakistani rupee in relation to the US$
and the subsequent revaluation of assets financed by foreign loans to reflect
the devaluation. In all, depreciation is approximately 30% higher than the
SAR estimate.
7.06     Interest charges on foreign loans were very close to the SAR
estimates because the savings incurred due to the lower amount of the Bank
loan (about 12%) were offset by the exchange losses caused by the devaluation
of the Pakistani Rupee(26%). Interest charges on local loans were
significantly higher because of the higher than expected financing of capital
expenditures through local loans.
7.07     Profits estimated at SAR and actual profits (in current terms)
compare as follows:

1976                  17,23D                41,278
1977                  14,829                48,881
1978                  26,953                32,432
1979                  44,566                24,522
1980                  45,002                71,678
1981                  44,062               132,232
1982                  43,116                76,703
1983                  40,971                68,332
The profits in constant terms, expect for FY79 and FY80, were in line with the
expectations of the SAR. The substantially higher profits in FY81 were due to
external pipelaying services performed by SNGPL for Pakistani firms.
7.08     A very typical feature of SNGPL's finances is that dividends were not
based on the actual profits but on the paid-in capital. The table below
outlines the relationship between dividends paid and profits.

/a Dividends to profits.
/b Dividends to paid in capital.
During the period under review the dividend paid as a percentage of paid-in
capital increased from 5.8% in FY76 to 20Z during FY81-83. During the period
the paid-in capital increased by 98%. The clear tendency of the Board of
Directors to pay dividends was not always related to SNGPL's performance or
compliance with the covenants. During FY78/79 and again during FY83,
dividends were .paid although the current ratio was below the covenanted 1.2.
(See further para. 8.01(e) and Table IX on page 15).

7.09     Balance Sheets.  Current assets were significantly higher than the
SAR expectatioos because of higher account receivables and a three-fold
increase in the level of inventories. The higher level of receivables is
explained in part by the higher tariffs, while the higher level of inventories
is explained i= part by the continuing expansion of SNGPL (it was assuned at
SAR that SNGPL would become more or less stagnant after 1980).
7.10     The level of fixed assets was very close to the SAR expectations
during the project, with the exception of FY82-83, because of the higher
additional investments and revaluaton of fixed assets for exchange losses
related to the devaluation of PR. During the period FY78-83 work in progress
was above the SAR expectations, in the amount of PRs159 million on average.
7.11     Current liabilities were slightly higher than double those of the SAR
expectations because of the significantly higher price of purchased gas and
the higher level of SNGPL's activities (higher payroll, external contracts,
and continuing expansion beyond 1980).
7.12     The overall indebtedness of SNGPL was slightly higher than the SAR
expectations because of the exchange losses as a result of the devaluation of
foreign loans (no significant foreign borrowiugs were incurred outside the
Bank loans) and the hLgher level of local borrowings.
7.13     Sources and Applications Statement.  The variances in the cashflov
can be largely explained by those in the Incone Statement and the Balance
Sheet. Annex 5 and 6 show a reconciliation of the Investment Plan for the
period FY75-FY83 as presented in the SAR and the actual figures. The
following notes are warranted.
7.14     On the sources side, the reconciliation shows the proposed IBRD loan
according to SAR was to contribute about 58% of the total project costs.
However, ultimately it contributed only 45% of the total project cost.
Similarly, according to SAR, the proposed IBRD loan was to contribute about
41% of all available resources; however, the IBRD loan ultimately represented
only 16.87% of these resources. This was because of the higher than projected
internal cash generation, the larger than projected cost of the project, and
the larger than projected local borrowings. On the other hand the equity
contribution represented only 8.6%, which was less than the 18.3% projected.
7.15     On the application side, the reconciliation shows that the SNGPL IV
project anounted to only 37% of the total capital expenditures for the period,
compared with the 70% projected in the SAR. This was a result of the larger
than expected Other Capital Expenditures (i.e., expenditures other than SNGPL
IV) including advanced action on the SNGPL V Project. At appraisal it was
assmed that a small investment program (PR's15-17 million per annum) would be
entirely financed from internal sources; in fact, a larger investment program
(on average PRs205.0 per annum) was financed to some extent from outside
sourc:s.  On average the internally generated funds represented 59% of the
capital expenditures. In the SAR it was expected that internally generated
funis would amount to only 25% of the capital expenditures. The major source
of internal financing was depreciation, while external financing largely
orig.nated from local loans and partially from GOP equity injection in FY75 -
FY77, according to SAR expectations.

VIII. WOOPLIANCE WITH LOAN CDVENANTS
8.01     In view of SNGPL's performance unde-r the third project, the Bank
agreed with SNC?L on strict financial covenants for the fourth project. As we
mentioned above, the financial covenants were designed to preserve and
possibly strengthen SNGPL's financial position, tbrough an adequate rate of
return and related tariff level, through various limitations (on debt,
investment above an agreed investment plan and on dividend), while maintaining
an adequate level of liquidity and self-financing. A comparison of the
projected SN QL's financial perfomance with the actual perfommance regarding
various covenants could be sumarized as follows:

1981      12.5    21.0      2.0    3.6     2.6    1.4      65/35      63/37
1982      12.7    15.2      2.0    2.7     2.4    1.1      62/28      65/35

As the table above indicates, SNGPL has, in principle, complied with the main
part of its covenants. However, the following coments are warranted:
a)   SNGPL was unable to meet the debt to: equity ratio during the
FY75-FY79. This was primarily a result of: (i) delays in
receiving required tariff increases; (ii) higher than projected
foreign exchange losses, related to foreiga borrowing (from the
Bank); and (iii) higher than projected domestic borrowings.
After prolonged discussions, the Bank has during FY78179 granted
permission to increase domestic borrowings, approved the related
fixed charges on selected SNGPL's assets and subsequently
relaxed the debt to: equity ratios to 70:30.
b)   SNGPL has only partially complied with the requirement to
revalue its assets. The revaluation took place only to the
extent that che assets were revalued for the foreign exchange
losses on the loans used to finance these assets. This means
that the foreign and local inflation are not fully reflected in
the value of the assets. SNGPL was informed of this inconsis-
tency but during the period under review has not been permitted



- 16 -
by GOP to take corrective action (see also para. 8.02).
c)   SNGPL deducts the contribution in aid of construction made by
its consuners from the assets value.  This practice is not in
compliance with the covenant, as the requirement refers to "all
fixed assets in operation' (Loan Agreement, Sect. 5.07 (b)(v)),
irrespective of the sources of financing. SNGPL confirmed that
assets fins yced in part by its cons uners are owned and operated
by SNGPL.-
d)   SNGPL includes, in its operating income, revenues arising from
external construction activities. The relevant pipelaying
activities cannot be considered routine, as thev are dependent
on: (i) the demand for such services (which is very erratic)
and (ii) the availability of surplus capacity internally. The
income fron these activities should not be included in SNGPL's
operating income. (The Loan Agreement defines the operating
expenses in detail with regard to the gas transportation
revenues, but no definition is given with regard to operating
revenues). Moreover, it is financially unwise to merge together
financial results for two such disparate activities. Although
the Bank's views havs been made known to Govermnent, no action
has yet been taken.
1/ The Borrower commented that the revaluation took place and it was
reflected in the accounts for the fiscal year FY84. This is correct,
hovever, it does not change the fact that in conflict with the require-
ment of the loan agreement, the company assets in operations were revalued
during the Project IV (subject of this PCR) only partially as described
above (see Annex 10, para 8.Olb).
2/ The Borrower commented that the contribution of consumers represents
their sharing of cost of service lines, and therefore the receipts should
be set off against the cost of fixed assets. The accounting treatment
adopted by the borrower and its auditors is to credit the receipts to an
account entitled deferred credit, to be amortized over the expected lives
of the relative assets. The amount thus amortized is to be credited to
profit and loss account in order to set off an appropriate amount of
depreciation which is calculated on the full cost of assets. We do not
share this interpretation and consider, that irrespective the questioc
of ownership of the relevant assets, those assets are unquestionably
assets in operation and should therefore be included in the calculation
of rate of return on all assets in operation as required by the loan
agreement.
31 The Borrower commented that the income from outside construction
activities is to be included in operating revenues for the purpose of
the determination of the tariffs (see Annex 10, para 8.01d). We do not
share this interpretation and consider that for the reason stated above,
the income from the external construction activities should not be
included in operating revenues for purpose of determination of tariffs.

e)   SNQIL paid in FY78 a cash dividend equal to 83Z of the profit,
although the current ratio at the end of that fiscal year was
below the covenanted ratio. This vas also the case in FY79 and
in FY82. This was because of an interpretation of the covenant
which was in conflict vith the intent of the covenant. Under
this interpretation an interim dividend could be paid while
there would be no formal test on the current ratio (the test
date was the end of the year). Therefore, the interim dividend
was paid on the assumption that the current ratio was adequate
and, if subsequently the current ratio at the end of the year
was not adequate, it was too late to retrieve the funds. This
issue of the legal interpretation was again a subject of the
discussions with SNGPL during appraisal of SNGPL V.-/
8.02    Overall, SNGCL conplied with the intent of the principal covenants,
with the exception of full revaluation of fixed assets and the dividend
limitation (paras. 8.01a and 8.01e). Again, while evaluating SNG(L's
compliance with covenants, it should be recognized, that SNGPL was
increasingly influenced by GM. GOP exerted influence: Ci) directly, (e.g.
through delays in approval of tariff increases required to meet Bank's
covenants); (ii) indirectly, (e.g. through its nominees on SNGCL's Board
declaring interim dividend in conflict with intent of Bank's covenants); or
(iii) through administrative actions which prevented to fully revalue SNGPL
assets, because of the concern of GOP about the impact of full replacement
cost accounting on taxes, revenues and inflation country wide.) It should be
noted however, that regarding the issue of revaluation of the fixed assets,
SNGPL was not an isolated target and a similar policy was used regarding also
other Bank projects (e.g. Power, Water, etc.).
IX.     ECONOIC PERFORNhCE
Gas Supply
9.01    The economic benefits of the project have been calculated from a com-
parison of the econcic cost of natural gas, delivered to each of the principal
centers of consunption, with the economic cost of imported petroleum products in
those same centers. Since 1980, SNGPL has been facing severe gas supply constraints
because of a growing demand (partly fueled by low gas price) which cannot be met
from the existing fields. The economic losses involved in not having required
energy available from any source would be significant, but could not be
quantified. The SAL recognized that a potential supply gap existed, therefore
1/ The Borrower commented that the current ratio covenant cannot be
construed to mean that raZio 1:1 must be met throughout the year except
as required at the time of the declaration of dividend (see Annex 10,
para 8.01c). We do not share this interpretation. As stated above the
test date for the current ratio is the year end date and no dividend
should be paid in the year in which the covenant restricting the dividend
declaration is not met.



- 18 -
(a) assumed the gas sales were to remain constaut from FY81 onwards
at 317.9 MMCFD (on average);
(b) required the GOP to allocate to SNGPL not less than 436 MHCFD
(at maximum) of Sui raw gas until 6/3012000;
(c) formulated a covenant under the loan that required SNGPL to
write off 90Z of the original value of its assets (on a revalued
basis) by 6/30/2000; and
(d) required SNGPL not carry out additional expansionary investments
after 1979.
9.02     With regard to the Dhulian and Meyal fields owned by Pakistan
Oilfields Limited (POL), SNGPL has not signed supply contracts. Dhulian ceased
production in FY80. In early 1979, PPL informed SNGPL that the deliveries
from Meyal would iucrease but these increases never materialized. However,
SNGPL based expansion of its system in part on these projections. It was
implicitly assumed that SNGPL would be able to manage the demand for its gas
so that it would match its supply commitment. Unfortunately, this was not the
case. The demand exceeded the supply by a wide margin resulting in gas
shortages and load shedding.
9.03     Gas Denand.  The following comments could be made based on detailed
evaluation:
Ca) Until FY80, the actual sales were below SAR expectations
essentially because of the smaller demand mainly from the power
industry;
(b) the demand of the fertilizer, cement and sugar sectors has been
close to SAR expectations; and
(c) the demand of the general industry sector has, since FY76, been
above expectations, and from FY80 to FY82 the gap has increased
from 36.8 NKCFD to 71.9 XMCFD (see Section 4.02).
9.04     Under these circumstances SNGPL was not able to satisfy the denand it
created by connecting such a large number of new consumers without baving
assured additional gas supplies. SNGPL was attempting to reduce the
consumption of gas by curtailing the supply; however, in relation to its major
consumers (power) this was not possible because of non-interruptible character
of the sale contract.
Rate of Return Evaluation
9.05     The economic cost used included all capital and operating
expenditures incurred in the production, transmission and distribution of the
incremental gas supply to consumers. The economic benefits are calculated



- 19 -
using the export price of surplus fuel oil (consumed in power generation) as
the marginal fuel displaced by natural gas plus the investments used to store
and transport it to consunption centers in the north by rail tank wagons. The
quantification of benefits is based on the existing consumption pattern and
existing transportation system. For the purpose of this calculation in the
SAB it was assuned that the operating costs of the transportaticn system for
the alternative fuel oil are comparable and therefore are offsetting the
operating cost of the gas transmission system. The econamic cost and benefits
of the project are shown in Annexes 6, 7 and 8. As mentioned above, the
project implementation of the additional work was delayed resulting in a
corresponding delay in the realization of the full benefits of the project.
Based on the economic life of 20 years, the project yielded an economic rate
of return of 57%. This exceeds the rate of return of 39% expected by the
SAR. The following facts have a positive impact on the rate of return: (i)
increased volumes of gas delivered; (ii) higher utilization rate; (iii) higher
than projected fuel oil cost; and (iv) higher than anticipated avoidable
capital cost; The following facts have a negative impact on the rate of
return: (i) the delay in the implementation of the project; tii) higher
economic cost of gas; and (iii) the very serious constraints in the supply of
gas to SNGPL; (iv) txie higher than projected transportation cost.
9.06     Notwithstanding the insufficient supply of gas in relation to actual
demand, the project was a sound investment, because it eliminated a need for
importation of large quantities of petroleum products and a major related
investment in the transport, handling and the storage of the these products.
K. ROLE CF THE BANK
10.1     The long relationship of the Bank with Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
Limited existing through three previous projects contributed significantly to
SNGPL's ability to service increasing numbers of industrial and residential
consumers. The Fourth Project was no exce,tion. The Bank not only provided
all required foreign exchange but also provided support in selection and
evaluation of the proper technical solutions, contract packaging and grouping
procurement of the services and equipment, prequalification of contractors _nd
various design matters. The role of the Bank here was instrumental in
achieving the technical objectives of the project. The relationship with the
borrower remains -^ellent.
10.2     In addition, Project IV was used as a vehicle for continuing dialogue
with GOP and SNSPL on the issues related to energy pricing, supply and demand
of natural gas and also on broader sectoral issues of the long term
development of country's energy resources. An extensive evaluation of options
for expanding gas supply and transmission systems was prepared by a consultant
firm in 1982 (and financed under a $700,000 Project Preparation Facility) and
has laid the preliminary basis for systematic gas investment planning for the
remainder of the decade. The role of the Bank here was very important,
providing continuing effective support to GOP in studying their options to
secure adequate energy needed for economic development.
XI.  CONCLUSIONS AND LESSCNS LEARNED
11.1     The structural imbalance, between the supply of natural gas and the
fast increasing demand is a reality for the foreseeable future. Based on the



- 20 -
experience in the Fourth Project, a nmber of technical suggestions were put
forward. They were as follows:
(1) All power generating units which can be converted to fuel oil
should be modified to operate on dual firing, using gas in
summer and fuel oil in winter. Gas utilization in thermal power
generation should be interruptible to release gas for the
substitution of premium grade fuels as and when needed. The
same applies to cement plants and other industries using gas in
eteam generation. GOP has agreed to this strategy.
(2) When the service life of canpressors on the gas transmission
system exceeds their useful life and become due for replacement,
looping with larger size pipelines should be considered if it
proves viable to save gas used in gas turbine prime movers.
SNGPL has followed this advice in its recent decisions on
enhancing capacity.
(3) Study the allocation of natural gas taking specific account of
the cost of getting other fuels to consumers. Some action by
GOP has already been taken in this respect (SNGPL V Guarantee
Agreement dated July 21, 1983).
11.2     The completed project has contributed to the development of gas
demand in the period 1975 - 1981 when gas supply was adequate. The gas
supply/demand study carried out by consultants (PPF financed under SNGPL
project V) projected an increase in gas demand from 720 MHCFD in 1981 to 1410
MMCFD in 1990. The study has identified major gas shortages and recommended a
gas development plan to increase gas production from proven gas fields. The
plan will involve investments in field development of U.S.$488 million and
transport pipelines of U.S.$250 million. The development plan offers good
grounds for structuring future Bank lending in the energy sector in general
and the petroleum subsector in particular.
11.3     In view of the constraints in future gas supply GOP should take
concrete measures to limit growth in gas demand by curtailing future use of
gas in thermal power generation and exercise peak load shaving during peak
demand. Peak load shaving study is already included in SNGPL project V and
will be dependent on how wide the gap is between average and maximum daily
demand within the gas transmission systen capacity to justify added
investments.
11.4     The gas development plan is a medium-term solution to meet increasing
gas demand. GOP has already taken some steps to encourage private sector
participation in oil and gas exploration by making available increased acreage
on reasonable terms. The Bank can expand its assistance particularly in
exploration and development of gas-prone areas which will not be interesting
to the private sector.
11.5     As the gas demand, primarily from general industry dramatically
increased after 1980, and at the sane time it become apparent that the fields
Dhulian and Meyal will not produce the planned quantities of gas, SNG"L was
confronted with limited supplies which could not possibly match the demand
(see paras. 9.03 and 9.04); as a result, SNGPL was confronted with a

discrepancy between the committed sales volumes and the actually delivered
supplies. The lesson learned here is, that the Bank should make sure that the
borrower's committed supplies will exceed the coumitted sales by a margin or
that the sales contracts have clauses adequate to provide a cushion against
unexpected decline of the production or failure to bring fields into
production, as it was the case with Dhulian and Meyal. Under the SNGQL V
project conditions were imposed by the Bank, assuring additional gas supplies
prior to effectiveness of the loan.
11.6     As a result of the discrepancy between the supply and demand, SNGPL
was gradually forced to resort to curtailments of sales with a paralyzing
effect for the economic activity of industries depending on gas as a major
energy source. With regard to its major consumers (power industry) the cuts
were actually administrated by the GOP. Nevertheless, because of cuts and in
accordance with the gas sales contracts, SNGPL was confronted with stiff
penalties to WAPDA. The lesson learned here is that the sales contracts of
the Borrower should be on an interruptible basis and should provide an
adequate protection to the Borrower against the penalties resulting from
administrative actions of the GOP. Under SNGPL V, the penalties were
eliminated.
11.7     A further recommendation, that a separate financial and managerial
objective has to be developed for the Projects Department, has not been
adopted completely, although there has been some reassignment of staff.
Ultimately, the efficiency of contracting activities might be improved by
creating a separate (affiliated) construction company.
11.8     The experience learned from the Fourth project provides assurance for
positive results in ocntinuing the dialogue with GOP for tne development of
the energy sector to achieve their objectives.

It will be seen frum the above table that dividends were-
paid from the profits of the year except in FY 1979 and
FY 1983 when the shortfalls to maintain the desired level
were met from the revenue reserves built from tht profits
of the earlier years. The World Bank covenant regarding
declaration of dividends was also met, as according ;-
Section 5.06 adi) of the Loan Agreement, dividend can u.
declared out of the profits of the year or any other
undistributed profits accumulated after January 1, 1964
According to Section 5.06 a(ii), a current ratio of 1:1
(and not 1.2:1 as mentioned in the Project Completion
Report) is required in any fircal year after 30 June 197S
after the payment of dividend (assuming such payment was
made on :he date of such declaration). In the years ended
30 June 1979 and 30 June 1983 also the current rat tocovenant
was duly met as confirmed In the Auditors Certificates srn'
to the World Bank alongwith the Annual Reports relaTing t'.
these vears.
Para 8.01(a)                                                                 PCR
correc ted.
Thp ratio worked out in the Table is debt to equity
ratio and not debt to equity plus debt ratico.
Para 8.01(b)
The Company has now revalued its assets and tht                    Fontnote

Para 8.01(c)
Cost sharing by consumers is amortized over  hth life              Fo.tnete
of the assets and, therefore, this is netted off mlth the                    added to PCR.
cost of the assets for the purposes of determination of the                  para. 4t.i(i r
return on net assets in operation. Since the above recoverivs
from consumers are towards sharing of cost nr service connections
the receipts are set off against the cost of fixed assets
created for this purpose. The return on net fixed assets in
operation is reallv one form of return on capital empioyt'd and
as sucti it will not be logical to claim a return on an investbmvnT
not made by the Company. This is our interpretation ot the
relevant covenant and is the basis on which tariff increase-s
have also been allowed to the Company in th- past by the
