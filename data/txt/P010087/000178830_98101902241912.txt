INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE FOURTH SUI NORTHERN GAS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) with the guarantee of the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent of US$60 million to help
finance a project for expanding the gas transmission and distribution
capacity of SNGPL. The loan would have a term of 22 years, including
4-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2% per annum. Pakistan would
charge SNGPL a guarantee fee of 1% per annum on the outstanding amount of the
Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to SNGPL to 9-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Current Economic Situation and
Issues in Pakistan" (658-PAK, dated March 28, 1975) was distributed to
Executive Directors on April 11, 1975. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex I.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (then West Pakistan) expanded at an
average annual rate of more than 6% during the decade of the 1960's. In
the Second Plan period (1960-65) this growth was spearheaded by industrial
growth of 13% per annum. During the Third Plan (1965-70) agricultural out-
put grew at 5.6% annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice
varieties, compared with less than 4% in the first half of the decade, but
the industrial growth rate fell to 7.6%. During the 1970's, however, the
growth rate has been considerably lower. During fiscal year 1970/71 and
1971/72, there was virtually no change in total output as political un-
certainties and the conflicts culminating in the separation of the former
East Pakistan resulted in a decline in industrial activity, while drought
virtually halted agricultural growth. Since the return of civilian rule
in late December, 1971, growth has been fairly modest. After two years
without growth, the GNP grew by 7% in 1972/73, but the increase declined to
5% in 1973/74 and this fiscal year it will probably be less than 3.5%. The
industrial expansion was the result primarily of fuller utilization of capa-
city.
4.        In the past year, Pakistan has suffered a series of setbacks.
These have included much larger than anticipated wheat import requirements,
a deterioration of about 20% in its terms of trade and damage during the
trial filling of Tarbela dam that will delay the availability of its water
for irrigation by one year (until about December 1975) and for power genera-
tion by 7 or 8 months (to October-November 1976). However, there have also



- 2 -
been important positive developments, including an acceleration of public
sector investment, some upturn in large-scale private investment, growing
economic ties with, and aid flows from, the Middle East oil-producing
countries, the reopening of transport, postal and limited trade ties with
India, and prospects for a slowdown in world and domestic inflation.
5.        In 1974/75 the output of the major agricultural crops may decline
by 3% or more owing to lack of water. River flows during the 1974 summer
crop season were the lowest in the past 90 years and fall and early winter
canal supplies were only 40% to 50% of normal. Agricultural prospects for
1975/76 depend heavily upon ample canal water this spring and summer and
adequate rains next fall. To encourage agricultural production in the longer
run, farm prices must be adjusted so that farmers receive higher (closer to
world market) prices for their cotton, wheat, rice and other products. The
government has recently lowered export duties and announced higher procure-
ment prices and higher prices to consumers, but further changes in this
direction are needed to rationalize the price structure. Other requirements
for rapid agricultural growth are more adequate programs to make use of
Tarbela Dam water, to increase tubewell water supplies, reduce water-logging
and salinity, improve seeds and cultural practices, and provide more power
to pump water and cultivate fields. With the increasing desire of small
and medium-scale farmers to participate in the "green revolution", agri-
cultural growth in the next five years could at least equal the 5.6% annual
rate of the 1965-70 Third Plan period if appropriate government pricing and
other policies and programs are followed. When water from Tarbela Dam be-
comes available, probably at the end of 1975, this will substantially in-
crease the area cultivated.
6.        Public and private domestic savings rates have declined steadily
since 1969/70. The chronic problem of public sector resource mobilization
is, together with private resource mobilization, the most important economic
issue facing Pakistan today. Action is needed on three fronts: (a) to
increase revenues through additional taxation and more efficient tax col-
lection and administration; (b) to reduce subsidies and restrain other non-
developmental expenditures and (c) to increase revenues from Government
enterprises through higher prices and increased efficiency.
7.        The 1974/75 consolidated federal and provincial budget projected
a 27% increase in total expenditures and a 37% increase in development ex-
penditures. The growth of current revenues was expected to be at the much
lower rate of 15%, however, partly due to reductions in export duty and
income tax rates. Both domestic and foreign borrowing were to rise substan-
tially in order to cover the larger gap between current revenues and total
expenditures. However, declining world market prices for cotton, yarn and
textiles and increased wheat imports have resulted in a further reduction
in revenues from export and excise duties (Rs 1,300 million) and increased
expenditure on wheat subsidies (Rs 1,300 million). The resulting increase
in financial requirements has been nearly matched by additional counterpart
receipts from new cash loans and grants (Rs 2,475 million). Another Rs 1,000
million of additional revenues partly from new tax increases and higher



- 3 -
Government utility charges and partly from higher than anticipated revenues
from other taxes will offset other expenditure increases and thus hold the
budget deficit to approximately its original level.
8.        After more than a decade during which prices rarely rose more than
2-3% annually, Pakistan has been experiencing price increases of 20% to 30%
annually since early 1972. Since mid-1973 the growth of the money supply has
been limited to about 14% annually by various measures of monetary and fiscal
restraint. At the same time (late 1973) that these restraints began to curb
domestic demand-pull inflation, however, international market price increases
became much more important. The dollar prices of imports rose by 37% in
1973/74 and are expected to increase by a further 32% this year. Dollar ex-
port prices rose 47% last year, but are expected to increase only 7% this
year (1974/75). If international and domestic wheat prices do not rise above
present (March 1975) levels, however, then the rate of inflation in Pakistan
will probably decline in the coming months.
9.        The deterioration in Pakistan's balance of payments resulting
from increased imports, particularly of wheat, and the adverse changes in
the terms of trade are reflected in an increase in the current account deficit
plus debt repayment from US$235 million in 1972/73 to US$680 million in
1973/74 and US$1,465 million in 1974/75. The deficit in 1974/75 has been
financed to an important extent by aid from OPEC countries (US$450 mil-
lion) although about US$90 million of short term borrowing and some drawing
down of exchange reserves has also been necessary.
10.       Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June, 1974, amounted
to about US$6.0 billion equivalent, of which US$1.7 billion was undisbursed.
Of this total, about $450 million represented debt incurred on account of
projects visibly located in Bangladesh and negotiations are now underway as
a result of which it is expected that most of this debt will be assumed by
Bangladesh. At present Pakistan does not have a severe debt service problem
largely because of the arrangement, concluded last June, whereby countries
participating in the Pakistan Consortium agreed to provide US$650 million
equivalent in debt relief over four years. However, the increased borrow-
ing that has become necessary means that debt service will probably grow
substantially faster than exports. By 1980, even assuming borrowing on
relatively favorable terms, Pakistan's debt service may well exceed 20%
of foreign exchange earnings. Including undisbursed balances, Pakistan's
debt to the Bank and IDA now represents about 16% of its external public
indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio might increase to about 18%. The share
of the Bank Group in total debt service (after taking account of the debt
relief which Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about 28%,
but is expected to decrease to about 14% in 1980. In these circumstances,
although Pakistan should receive as much aid as possible on concessionary
terms, a moderate amount of Bank lending is justified.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
11.       The Bank and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan between the start of operations in 1952 and 1971, totalling
US$1.2 billion. After becoming a member of the Bank and IDA in August
1972, Bangladesh agreed to assume liability for 11 credits totalling
US$151.4 million for uncompleted projects and recently assumed liability
for a further US$92.4 million in loans and credits on account of completed
projects visibly located in its territory. During FY72-74, the Bank and
IDA made 7 loans and credits to Pakistan amounting to US$224 million.
12.       Of the gross amount of US$1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (East
and West), West Pakistan received about 72%. During its long association
with Pakistan, the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the
economy. Until 1972, 38% of the total commitments were for public services,
29% for agriculture, 22% for industry, 10% for industrial imports, and 1%
for education. Lending for public services amounted to some US$325 million
and included loans and credits for railways, electric power, gas pipelines,
Karachi Port, highways, telecommunications and water supplies. A large
part of the lending for agriculture was for Indus Basin projects. The
lending for industry has been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit
and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most projects for which loans and
credits are being disbursed, construction is now going ahead satisfactorily.
The principal problems being encountered are that the rates charged by some
of the public services have not kept pace with inflation and, hence, some
utilities are not earning the return which they need. Furthermore, some
institutions have financial problems arising from the loss of assets in
the former East Pakistan. These problems are the subject of current dis-
cussions between the Bank and the Government. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of March 31, 1975 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Our lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.
The first of these is to support the directly-productive sectors of the
economy to increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain
export growth in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other
industrial and agricultural products. The main part of our assistance for
industry will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as
Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC), the Indus-
trial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the newly established National
Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) which is to provide finance primarily
for industries in the public sector. The most important part of future
lending for agriculture is expected to be for the government's new program
to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity and
improving the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. A mission
recently appraised the Khairpur East tile drainage project and is now



-5-
preparing its report. Other projects in the agricultural sector on which
preparatory work is proceeding include seeds multiplication, agricultural
credit, livestock, and rural development. In addition, the Government has
requested the Bank Group to be the Executive Agency for a UNDP technical
assistance grant for improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus
Basin.
14.       The second objective is to continue to improve the institutions
which are responsible for the principal public services which have benefitted
from Bank Group lending in the past, namely, Karachi Port Trust, the Tele-
graph and Telephone Department, the Water and Power Development Authority,
the Pakistan Railways, and the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company. In most
of these, institutional improvements are being made with technical assistance
financed by the Bank Group.
15.       The third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. The Government proposes
to give high priority to rural development. However, Government rural devel-
opment programs are still in an early stage of formulation. A mission to
assist the Government in the preparation of a project for rural development
has recently visited Pakistan. At the Government's request a mission has
recently studied the plans for the urban development of Karachi, whose
population now exceeds 4 million. A Karachi master plan was recently
completed with the assistance of consultants financed by UNDP, and urban
projects are being developed within the framework of this plan. In view
of the preparatory work which has already been done on urbanization
problems of Karachi, there are good prospects for worthwhile participation
by the Bank Group in this area. The Government has also asked the Bank to
study the urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city.
Planning in Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the
immediate need is for technical assistance. A mission to examine problems
of urbanization and regional development on a country-wide basis has just
returned from Pakistan.
16.       During this fiscal year, in addition to the loan now proposed,
a credit of US$36 million for telecommunications was approved last September
and a proposal for a credit of US$30 million for the National Development
Finance Corporation is to be considered in May. Projects for seed multi-
plication and for tile drainage have been appraised and preparatory work is
well advanced for an education project, a power transmission project and a
project for water supply and sewerage in Lahore.
17.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million
by equity participations. (These are shown in Annex II). About US$12
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include
three in the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one
each in steel, cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.

PART III - NATURAL GAS IN PAKISTAN
18.       Pakistan is endowed with substantial natural gas resources, and
the known recoverable reserves are presently estimated at about 11.35 mil-
lion million standard cubic feet. The main fields are the Sui Field in
Baluchistan Province and the Mari Field in Sind Province, which together
contain about 87% of the reserves. The Sui Field, the largest, was dis-
covered in 1952 and its remaining recoverable reserve is estimated at 7.04
million million standard cubic feet. The Mari Field was discovered in 1957
and has an estimated remaining recoverable reserve of 2.81 million million
standard cubic feet. This field contains a high proportion of inert gases
which makes the gas more suitable for fertilizer production than for fuel.
The other presently known reserves are made up of ten smaller scattered
fields. The known gas reserves make up about 65% of the total heating value
of proven hydrocarbon reserves. The rest consists of oil (5%) and low-
grade coal (30%).
19.       In recent years, gas consumption has been increasing at about
13% per annum, compared with a growth rate of about 10% in total energy
consumption. Natural gas provides about 32% of total energy supplies,
hydropower about 16%, and petroleum products about 43% (of which about 4.0
million tons or 88% of total requirements were imported).
20.       Exploitation of the Sui gas field was started with the completion
in 1955 of a 347 mile pipeline to Karachi by the Sui Gas Transmission
Company (SGTC), for which the Bank made a loan of US$14 million equivalent.
In 1958, the Government constructed a 217 mile pipeline northwards from Sui
to Multan, and SNGPL was established to own and operate this line. Later
the line was extended to Lyallpur. SGTC has started construction of a
second pipeline from Sui to Karachi with financial assistance from the
Asian Development Bank.
21.       The Bank has made three loans totalling US$42.2 million equivalent
to SNGPL. The first loan in the amount of US$15 million was made in May 1964,
the second loan of US$8 million in May 1969 and the third loan of US$19.2
million in June 1970. All three projects have been successfully completed.
22.       To assist the Government in formulating comprehensive energy
policies, the UNDP is financing an energy sector survey which is expected
to be completed in July 1975.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       The project, to be implemented during FY76-78, was appraised in
May 1974. The Appraisal Report (No. 577(a) - PAK, of April 24, 1975) on
the proposed project is being distributed separately. A project summary



is attached as Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washington in December
1974. The borrower was represented by Mr. A. U Loan, Managing Director of
Sui Northern and the Government of Pakistan was represented by Mr. Manzur
Ahmad, Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Fuel, Power and Natural Resources
and Mr. A. M. Mufti, Economic Minister, Embassy of Pakistan. However, after
negotiations some time was required to allow the Government and SNGPL
prepare a new financing plan along lines agreed upon with the Bank.
Project Description
24.       The proposed project consists of the facilities necessary to
increase the capacity of SNGPL's gas transmission system from 297 million
cubic feet per day (MMcfd) to 415 MMcfd, an increase of about 40%, through
additional gas purification units, pipeline loops and compressors. The
project includes some telecommunications equipment for a new compressor
station and technical assistance for the design and installation of the
purification units and the telecommunications equipment. It would also
provide some overseas training for SNGPL personnel and funds to carry out
a feasibility study and detailed engineering required for the exploitation
of the gas field at Uch, which has a high sulphur content.
25.       The project will also provide the necessary gas supply for the
fertilizer plant at Multan which is being built with assistance from the Bank
(US$35 million), the Asian Development Bank (US$27 million) and Abu Dhabi
(US$31 million). The Government and SNGPL are obliged to provide this gas
supply under the terms of the Bank's Loan Agreement (988-PAK) for the
Multan Fertilizer Project.
Project Implementation
26.       SNGPL, the Borrower and implementing organization, is a limited
liability company incorporated in Pakistan in 1963. It has an authorized
share capital of PRs 400 million, of which PRs 118 million has been issued.
Of the issued shares, 33.3% are held by Burmah Oil Company (BOC), an inter-
national company registered in Scotland, 33.6% by the West Pakistan Indus-
trial Development Corporation, a wholly Government-owned corporation, 18.6%
by other Government-controlled organizations and 14.5% by the general public.
SNGPL's senior management is composed of competent and experienced Pakistani
nationals. As a result of the recent rapid growth of the company and the
departure of a number of its senior officers, the company has decided to
introduce certain organizational changes, including the establishment of
separate transmission and distribution departments and to strengthen its
construction department. It has been agreed that specific proposals for
these changes will be sent to the Bank and that the company will consult
with the Bank about their implementation (Section 4.01 (b) of the Loan Agree-
ment). The company is also introducing a program of training for its manage-
ment, technical and operational staff, the foreign exchange costs of which
would be financed from the proposed loan.
27.       SNGPL has accumulated considerable experience using its own labor
and equipment in the construction of large pipelines and installation of



- 8 -
compressor stations. Recently it has successfully completed the installation
of a large diameter pipeline to supply a new power station at Lyallpur.
Consultants employed by the Bank have concluded that SNGPL now has the ex-
perience and capability of efficiently undertaking this work and given the high
level of activity in the international pipeline construction industry, there
is no likely prospect that foreign contractors would be interested in the
work or that they could execute it at costs lower than would be obtained
through construction by force account methods by SNGPL. There are no
domestic pipeline companies capable of carrying out the work and therefore
it is proposed that the project should be undertaken by SNGPL.
Cost and Financing
28.       The proposed project is estimated to cost US$103.2 million equiva-
lent (PRs 1,022.2 million). The foreign exchange cost will be between US$51
and US$60 million depending on whether small-diameter pipe is purchased
from domestic or foreign suppliers. The cost estimates are based on recent
information on prices. Contingencies on foreign exchange costs have been
calculated at 11% for 1975 and 7-1/2% p.a. thereafter. Contingencies on
local costs have been calculated at 10% p.a.
29.       The proposed loan of US$60 million equivalent would finance the
foreign exchange costs of pipe materials, construction equipment, compres-
sors, purification plant, telecommunications equipment and technical assist-
ance. The remainder of the cost would be financed by a Government contribu-
tion of PRs 265 million to SNGPL's equity, by local borrowing of about
PRa 120 million and SNGPL's cash generation. All major items of materials
and equipment would be procured by international competitive bidding. Do-
mestic suppliers of small-diameter pipe, the only significant locally avail-
able material for the project with an estimated total cost of US$13.5 mil-
lion equivalent, would be allowed a preference of 15% or import duty which-
every is lower. If domestic suppliers are awarded contracts, the loan would
finance the total cost of the local purchases and would, in that event, cover
about US$9 million of local expenditure. Details of the cost estimates,
which include customs duties, and estimated disbursements are shown in
Annex III. In view of the very long lead time on pipe, pipe fittings and
construction equipment, SNGPL has already placed orders, in conformity with
Bank Guidelines, totalling US$8.3 million equivalent. About US$5.5 million
is likely to have been disbursed between November 1974 and the time the loan
agreement is signed and would be financed retroactively by the proposed loan.
30.       The prices charged by SNGPL for the sale of gas are subject to
the approval of the Ministry of Fuel, Power and Natural Resources. In
May 1972 the devaluation of the rupee led to a substantial increase in the
cost of servicing SNGPL's foreign loans with the result that the Company
was unable to meet the rate of return specified in the last loan (No. 696-
PAK). It was not until August 1973 that the Government agreed to a general
price increase for SNGPL which considerably improved its financial position.
In June, 1974, and again in February of this year the price of gas to con-
sumers was substantially increased by an increase in excise duty and the
imnosition of a "development surcharge" which is also a form of excise duty.
These measures went some way to make the price of gas reflect the increased



- 9 -
value of the resource brought about by the large increase in the price of
imported fuels. SNGPL's financial position was not affected by these
changes but last December, it did receive an increase equivalent to 14 paisa
per thousand cubic feet (McF) of gas sold (by an adjustment of the gas devel-
opment surcharge) to enable the company to earn the rate of return required
by Loan 696-PAK. In connection with the proposed loan, the Government has
agreed that, as from July 1, 1975, SNGPL will receive a further 20 paisa per
Mcf of gas sold. The approval of this increase by the Government is a con-
dition of effectiveness of the loan. Furthermore, the Government has under-
taken to provide SNGPL with any additional funds needed to complete the
project (Guarantee Agreement - Section 2.02).
Financial Covenants
31.       In order to ensure the financial viability of SNGPL, the Govern-
ment and SNGPL have agreed that:
(a) Gas tariffs would be set so as to provide revenues sufficient
to produce a rate of return on the value of SNGPL's net fixed
assets in operation of 12% in FY76, 10% in FY77 and FY78 and
of 12% thereafter. (Section 5.07 of the Loan Agreement and
Section 3.03 of the Guarantee Agreement.)
(b) SNGPL would pay dividends only out of prior earnings, and
only if, after payment of the dividend, it has a current
ratio of 1.2:1 thrugh FY78 and 1:1 thereafter (Section 5.06
of the Loan Agreement.)
(c) SNGPL would not incur additional long-term debt without Bank
approval if the debt/equity ratio were higher than 65:35
(Section 5.08 of the Loan Agreement.)
(d) SNGPL would not undertake, without prior Bank approval,
investments in fixed assets, other than its present invest-
ment program, in excess of US$2 million equivalent p.a.
(Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement.)
These covenants are substantially the same as those included in previous Bank
loans to SNGPL except that the required current ratio in the dividend limita-
tion covenant has been reduced from 1.5:1 to 1.2:1 during the construction
period and 1:1 thereafter in order to avoid an undue accumulation of cash.
Gas Reserves
32.       With the proposed project the reserves of the Sui Field are fully
committed for the estimated life of the project facilities, i.e. until
2000. The Government has, therefore, agreed that in order to avoid short-
ening the project facilities' useful life, it will not permit the use of
raw gas by any other users, if this would result in a reduction in the avail-
ability of raw gas to SNGPL below a sustained rate of 436 MMcfd. (Section



- 10 -
3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement.) SNGPL's sales projections assume the
continued availability of 20 MMcfd of gas from the Dhulian Field and 15
MMcfd from the Meyal Field. Reservoir engineering studies have recently
been undertakeu to determine the optimum rate of gas offtake from the Meyal
Field and the Government will consult with the Bank on the findings of
the studies (Section 3.01 of the Guarantee Agreement).
Economic Justification
33.       Pakistan's energy demands are increasing rapidly.   On completion,
the proposed project would permit the substitution of gas for the importa-
tion of about 640,000 tons of fuel oil p.a., with annual savings of about
US$44 million, and would obviate investment of about US$20 million in oil
transport, storage and handling facilities. The project is estimated to
have an economic return of about 33%. This return is unlikely to be less
than 19% even in a combination of adverse circumstances. Since gas is a
clean fuel, the project also has environmental benefits which have not
been quantified.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and SNGPL, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Pakistan and the Bank, the Report of the Com-
mittee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
35.       Portions of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 30 to 32 of this Report. Satisfactory arrange-
ments for an average increase in SNGPL's sales revenue of Rs 0.20 per Mcf,
effective July 1, 1975, are a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan (Section 7.01(a) of the Loan Agreement). In addition, under Section
5.03 of the Loan Agreement SNGPL agrees to extend the mortgage and floating
charge against its assets, already granted to the Bank in respect of the
previous loans, to cover the proposed Loan.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

cr . ;,bo. 50       Education: U3$8.5 Million Credit of March 25
19614; Closing Date:  June 30, 1975
The project has suffered major delays on account of akninistrative
difficulties, shortage of building materials, lack of local funds, the 1971
war, the 1973 floods, and re-negotiation of some civil works contracts at
the agricultural university necessitated by sharp increases in the cost of
uuilding materials and wages. Although 90% of construction is finished the
project will not be completed by the revised closing date. A further
extension -- from June 1975 to June 1976 -- will be necessary. Installed
equipment at the university represents more than 90% of the original
allocation. Of another $200,000 which has been made available for further
essential equipment, $120,000 has been ordered and the remainder is to be
procured by the extended closing date. Except for four overseas fellow-
ships, the other components of the project, i.e., equipment for technical
institutes and teacher training, have been completed.
Loan No. 376        Karachi Port: U$17. Million Loan of March _14,
1964; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The project has been substantially completed.
Loan No. 548        Tarbela Dam. US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10,
196B; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30,-1974,
the main embankmint had been completed to full height, and the first
irnpoundment began on schedule in July 197T. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one of
the tunnels necessitated ths emptying of the reservoir, in the course of
which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is nearing
completion. Additional resources will be required to meet the costs of
the remedial measures and the situation is under consideration of the
Contributing Parties to the Indus Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agree-
meIts.
V/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that, they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvement of track and bridges,
and (b) rehabilitation and improvement for workshops and depots has been
satisfactory. However, the proposal for the expansion of the marshalling
yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first stage of a new marshalling
yard at Pipri has been included instead. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 1972, has been extended by three years to December 31, 1975,
to allow time for procurement of materials required in the construction
work at Pipri. Because of a further delay caused through relocating the
yard, a further extension of the closing date may be necessary. Consul-
tants (Sofrerail, France) have been appointed to assist in implementation
of measures for improved operations.
Cr. No. 157         Agricultural Development Bank:   US$30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969; Closing Date:
June 30, 1.975
The project became effective on September 23, 1969 and the original
Closing Date (June 30, 1972) was extended to June 30, 1975.
During recent months there has been an improvement in tractor
supply to Pakistan and this Third Credit should be fully disbursed by the
revised Closing Date. The Agricultural Development Bank (ADBP) has
submitted an application for a Fourth Credit. Before it can be considered,
however, ADBP requires rehabilitation both financially and administratively;
the East Pakistan liabilities issue has not yet been resolved, resulting in
ADBP incurring heavy losses due to making reserves against servicing of
borrowings for loans made in former East Pakistan; total overdues are
increasing and have become almost unmanageable; and its lendirg policies
and organization require thorough review. IDA is pressing the Government
to deal with ADBP's financial problems and a decision is expected shortly.
With the agreement of Government and ADBP, IDA is helping with the engagement
of a team of consultants, through UNDP, to assist with ADBP's rehabilitation.
If the application to UNDP is successful the aim is for the consultants to
be in Pakistan not later than May 1975.
Cr. No. 177         Development Finance Company - IDBP:    US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its

liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The
original Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to
December 31, 1977. IDBP has continued to improve its operational standards
but recent environmental developments, including a textile crisis have not
permitted an improvement in arrears, which is creating difficult liquidity
problems. While this situation remains, IDBP is expected to obtain the
necessary local funds from the State Bank of Pakistan. After a recent
supervision mission, the Association, in consultation with the Govennment
and IDB?, is exploring ways in which some of the issues presently confronting
IDBP can be resolved. Utilization of the IDA credit is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 206         Egineering Education:    US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Overall the project is about 24 months behind schedule. Construc-
tion of staff housing has been delayed due to the shortage of counterpart
funds, but is expected to be completed by the Closing Date (December 1976).
Other construction and procurement of most equipment is expected to be
completed six months before then. Progress in staff development has been
unsatisfactory, largely because teaching salaries are low compared to those
in industry. The Closing Date of the project may be postponed because of
delays in recruiting experts. Civil works costs are expected to be about
85% above the appraisal estimate in rupee terms, but total projects costs
are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million due to the
1972 devaluation of the rupee.
Cr. No. 213         Power Transmission and Distribution:   US$23.0
Million Credit of August 13, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Imolementation of the project, which had imDroved during the past
year, is nresently suffering again from a setback which will require a
second Dostponement of the closing date to the end of 1976. The new delay
is caused by additional claims of Yugoslavian manufacturers on which
cumbersome negotiations are presently underway. Pending a satisfactory
solut.on of the discussion, the suppliers have stopped delivery of the
equipment. However, it is expected that the conflict with the Yugoslavs will be
settled shortly with a substantial increase in price allowed not only in
cost of material but in cost of erection.
The Credit is still limited to US$23 million with WAPDA and the
Pakistan Government realizing that any overrun will be taken care of by
their own resources.
Cr. No. 122         Third Karachi Port:   US$18.0 Million Credit of
July 19, L973 ClosirJg Date:   June 30, 1979
Construction has not yet started. Only one highly qualified bid
was received for each major contract and. these are still under consideration
by KIT.

Loan No. 961        Industrial Investment:   US$25.0 Million Loan of
Januar; Closing Date:             June 30. 197
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign currency
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.   PICIC's
arrears have remained high which is creating serious liquidity problems.
This has mainly been the result of environmental developments including a
textile crisis. While this situation remains, PICIC is expected to obtain
the necessary local funds from the State Bank of Pakistan. Its management
has also been weakened after the departure of some of its senior staff
including most recently, the Deputy Managing Director. After a recent
supervision mission, the Bank, in consultation withthe Governient and PICIC,
is exploring ways in which some of the issues presently confronting PICIC
can be resolved. Up to January 30, 1975, sub-projects amounting to US$8.4
million had been credited. Disbursements amounted to $150,000.
Cr. No. 466         Flood Rehabilitation:   US$35.0 Million Credit of
March 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30s 1975
Good progress was made in restoring the protective bunds and canals
damaged during the 1973 floods, by a mechanized contractor and local labor-
intensive methods. Most of the work was completed before the 1974 monsoon,
in which slight rainfall resulted in some of the lowest river flows on record.
The restoration of road works has been considerably slower, and provisions
made under the credit for importation of spare parts for the repair of
construction and farming machinery have been delayed due to administrative
difficulties, with the result that spares and serviceable equipment are still
in very short supply.
Cr. No. 492         Fourth Karachi Fort: TUS&116.0 Million Credit of
July 1~iT974T 'Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Tender documents have been issued to prequalified contractors and
bids are due for ooening on July 21, 1975.
Loan No. 988        Miultan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan of
May 24, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Procurement is making good progress and order for 95% of the value
of plant materials financed with the aid of the Bank loan have been placed.
About 50% of the plant being financed by the ADB loan has also been ordered.
First shipments of equipment are anticipated in June 1975.   It is now
estimated that there will be a foreign exchange cost overrun of about US$20
million, which has been met by an additional equity contribution from the
Government of Abu Dhabi.
Cr. No. 510          Third Telecommunications: US$36.0 Million Credit
of September 12, 1974; Closing Date:   December 31,
1978
Tender documents for all major items have been prepared and ame
being issued. Progress on the project is proceeding as scheduled.
