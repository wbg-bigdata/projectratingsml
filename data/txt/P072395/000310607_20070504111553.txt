3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
Background and Context

Since the mid-1990s Malawi has been implementing wide-ranging reforms supported by a number of
credits, including three Bank Adjustment Credits, IMF ESAF-PRGF arrangements, and bilateral donors.
These reforms, however, have had mixed success. Economic growth has been fluctuating and has remained
low in recent years, growing by less than 2 percent a year since the mid-1990s. With the population
growing annually by nearly 2 percent, this has meant a stagnant per capita consumption for nearly a
decade.

The low growth has been due to a combination of factors: the adverse external environment, droughts, slow
progress on key structural reforms, and most importantly chronic macroeconomic instability. Inflation has
remained high, driven by growth of money supply and large fiscal deficit. The impact of the large fiscal
deficit on broad money was exacerbated by excessive borrowing by the parastatals directly from the
banking system and by the Government's domestic borrowing as the aid flows remained unpredictable.
Malawi's high fiscal deficits were mainly the result of poor fiscal discipline and weak public expenditure
management. The fiscal situation was plagued by weak monitoring, lack of effective penalties for
overspending, unbudgeted spending for emergency relief, and unplanned demands from parastatal losses.
High fiscal deficits combined with the reduction in donor inflows created a potentially unsustainable
domestic debt situation. By mid 2003, Malawi's domestic debt had soared to 18 percent of GDP, with
nearly 80 percent of it in short term.

The high debt, low growth, and poor economic performance were accompanied by food insecurity for
Malawi's poor with famine-like conditions as recently as in 2002. The combinations of low growth, food
shortages, and fiscal pressures also had serious consequences in terms of poverty. About 65.3 percent of
the Malawians lived below the poverty line, and nearly 16 percent of the Malawian adult population in the
15-49 age groups was HIV positive. Tobacco, the country's most important crop, suffered from high cost
supply chain that resulted in the farmer receiving only half of the price at the auction floor.

With the preparation and launching of the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) in April
2002, the Government developed a comprehensive program aimed at reducing poverty. A Bank/IMF Joint
Staff Assessment (JSA) favorably assessed the MPRSP and its policy contents. However, progress in the
implementation of the MPRS has been slow due to slippages in macroeconomic performance and the
2004/05 drought.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

To support the implementation of the MPRSP a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared, which
was explicitly linked the overall goals of the MPRSP. In line with the CAS, discussed by Board in May
2003, the Bank prepared the Fiscal Management and Accelerating Reform Program (FIMAG) to support
program of the Government included in the MPRSP.

Before the CAS was presented to the Board, Malawi was judged to be in a low case lending program and
was considered eligible to move into a base case if it had met specific triggers on: macroeconomic stability;
budget implementation; accounting and reporting; education; health; HIV/AIDS; and, governance. By the
time of the presentation of FIMAG to the Board, Malawi had achieved all the above mentioned CAS
triggers for the base case. In addition, it succeeded in maintaining a satisfactory portfolio performance, as



                                                     - 2 -

evidenced by the low percentage of problem projects (less than 10 percent) and the satisfactory
disbursement ratio (around 20 percent). These achievements, combined with the reforms planned in the
context of FIMAG made Malawi eligible for the base case level of lending program.

Baseline projections with access to HIPC resources showed that Malawi was in serious financial situation.
Its gross financing requirements for 2004-06 were estimated at about $344 million a year. Of this amount
$77 million a year was estimated to be a financing gap (over and above regular financing and HIPC
resources). These financing requirements needed to be met by resources from multilateral and bilateral
donors, including the FIMAG. Availability of these additional resources was also crucial for outlays on
health and education to a level consistent with poverty reduction objectives.

The FIMAG (US $50 million) was the first (of the two) structural adjustment operation designed to support
policy and institutional reforms outlined in the base-case lending scenario of the 2003 CAS. The proposed
amount, which was higher than $30 million originally envisaged for this operation, was accommodated
through the increase in IDA allocations to Malawi. The purpose of the proposed two adjustment operations
was to support policy measures in three areas: (i) improving expenditure management (including progress
on fiscal decentralization); (ii) advancing parastatal reform (including privatization of power and water
enterprises, and greater transparency in maize marketing operations; and (iii) implementing key policy and
institutional reforms in the agriculture sector (including improved efficiency in tobacco marketing
arrangements). FIMAG followed closely the reform areas outlined in the CAS.

FIMAG also provided a framework for other Bank operations in Malawi. It supported policy decisions on
privatization and was closely tied to the Privatization and Utility Reform Project, which provided technical
support for the privatization program. It addressed the problem of Government arrears to the water utilities
in line with the National Water Development Project. FIMAG support for expenditure management was
linked to the Financial Management, Transparency and Accountability Project, which provided technical
assistance for improving expenditure tracking, internal audit, performance monitoring and oversight
institutions. The FIMAG support for fiscal decentralization was linked to the Malawi Social Action Fund
project that strengthened the role of communities below the District Assembly level. Also, FIMAG support
for HIV/AIDS was crucial for the success of HIV/AIDS program supported by the Multi-sector HIV/AIDS
project.

Original Objective:

The long-term goal of FIMAG was to generate sustainable growth, reduce poverty and alleviate the impact
of HIV/AIDS through improved fiscal management, reforming parastatals, and improving the environment
for agricultural growth. Its resources were to provide the critical balance of payments and fiscal needs so as
to enable important reforms to be carried out without increase in the domestic debt.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The FIMAG objectives were not revised as they remained relevant to the circumstances of Malawi
throughout the FIMAG implementation.

3.3 Original Components:

In addition to supporting macroeconomic stability, FIMAG aimed at supporting four main reform areas,
described below, consistent with the development objectives mentioned above:




                                                     - 3 -

Improving fiscal management by improving overall budget formulation, execution, monitoring, and fiscal
decentralization.

Accelerating parastatal reforms through improving parastatal finances and arrears and continued
privatization of telecommunications, power and the Agriculture Development and Marketing Corporation
(ADMARC) subsidiaries.

Reforming land policy and agriculture through improving land utilization and returns to tobacco growers,
as well as developing a food security policy.

Combating HIV/AIDS with emphasis on the policy framework, the financing framework, and the
institutional framework for the public sector response at the national and District levels.

The reforms and the supporting policy measures under each component are described in the FIAMG's
Letter of Development Policy (LDP), and sequenced in the Policy Matrix attached to LDP. The FIMAG
achievements and the outputs/outcomes of its components are described in Section 4.2 below. The details
are presented in Annex 1.

Note:The rating on this ICR is based on harmonized criteria for ICR and IEG evaluations, consisting of a
6-points scale (highly satisfactory; satisfactory; moderately satisfactory; unsatisfactory; and, highly
unsatisfactory). The guidelines do not require rating for the ICR components, but it is provided to show the
reason for the overall rating

3.4 Revised Components:

The original components remained unchanged.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

There was no quality at entry review carried out by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) on this operation.


The ICR finds the quality at entry to be Moderately Satisfactory. This assessment is based on the
following considerations:

Relevance of objectives and design. The reforms covered by the FIMAG program were appropriate for
Malawi's economic situation at that time. The policy areas under FIMAG underscored the priority that the
Government had attached to its reform agenda. FIMAG design was based on the three pillars of the 2003
CAS (discussed above) and was intended to support the development priorities of Malawi. The reforms in
fiscal management were designed to strengthen the Government's capacity to move towards
macroeconomic stability while initiating steps to improve the delivery of social services through
accelerating fiscal decentralization. The parastatal reforms were intended to begin addressing issues related
to their excessive borrowing and the burden on the budget while improving the delivery of key
infrastructure services.   The reforms in agriculture were designed to improve land functioning and
agriculture markets. The reforms in HIV/AIDS area were intended to define the institutional and financial
framework that would mitigate the social and economic impacts of HIV/AIDS. The FIMAG reforms were
long-term in nature and followed the Bank's earlier support through three adjustment loans (and the related
TA operations) on Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program in 1996, 1998, and 2000, focusing on
public expenditure management, tax policy, privatization, and civil service reform.

Analytical base. The FIMAG supported reforms were mostly underpinned by important analytical work in
Malawi including: the 2001 Public Expenditure Review (PER), which formed the basis for designing the
fiscal management of the FIMAG. The parastatals reforms benefited from the knowledge gained through
the Privatization and Utility Reform Project. Background papers from the 2003 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) were used to
design budget execution and monitoring part of the FIMAG. The background work on the 2004 Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) formed the backbone of the growth strategy and the actions concerning
agriculture and infrastructure services. There were also some analytical work carried out for the poverty
and social impact of ADMARC restructuring, though inadequate for designing the reforms of food
marketing.

Relevance of risks. The operation had identified four main risks. First, risk of policy slippage in the run up
to the elections. Second, delays in donor inflows, necessitating the domestic financing of the Budget. Third,
exogenous shocks, especially from drought/ famine, destabilizing the macroeconomic agenda. Fourth, high
incidence of HIV/AIDS, and the continued erosion in human resources. The mitigating response envisaged
included: (i) consultations with all stakeholders to create broad support for the program and the provision
of technical assistance to firm up the analytical basis for the reforms; (ii) working closely with all
development partners to make sure that all operations and their financing are coordinated; (iii)
strengthening the systems to respond quickly to early warnings of a possible famine; and, (iv) strengthening
the legal and institutional framework for addressing the incidence of HIV/AIDS. While the risks and the
responses identified were all relevant, the implementation risks were somehow overlooked (see below).

Compared to the above positive aspects, the FIMAG design also had some drawbacks:

    l First, FIMAG began with a weak macroeconomic framework and ended up with a poor
         macroeconomic performance, making it difficult to anchor FIMAG reform programs to a stable
         and reliable macro framework. The main reason for macroeconomic instability was the high and
         growing fiscal deficit, which had characterized Malawi's economic performance, and had remained
         a major obstacle to implementing key reforms, including those to reduce the high domestic debt.
         The frequent fiscal slippages and breach of agreements with the IMF programs were a clear
         indication of the inability of the Government to establish fiscal discipline. In fact, the effectiveness
         of FIMAG had to be delayed for nearly 5 months so that the Government could meet the financial
         and structural benchmarks under the IMF Staff Monitoring Program (SMP). This made it even
         more difficult for FIMAG to timely complement the IMF program in supporting the mutual
         objective of maintaining macroeconomic stability in Malawi. It is only more recently, and after the
         election of the new President, that the Government has become more fiscally responsible to control
         excessive deficits with the objective to reduce inflation and the rising domestic debt.

    l Second, some of the FIMAG components had an designed with unrealistic framework for
         implementation. As a result, the outcomes achieved were less than what was intended. This was
         particularly the case for MTL privatization, ADMARC restructuring, and the restructuring of the
         tobacco sector institutions. In all these cases, the planned restructuring required a longer time
         period for implementation than the time frame designed in the FIMAG operation. In general, three
         factors contributed to this unrealistic framework:

            l During the preparation, the detailed nature of many of the reform actions were not
                  adequately worked out. As a result, during the implementation, some of the policy actions
                  needed to wait for other activities to complete (e.g. studies and reviews) before they could



                                                       - 5 -

                 be firmed up or implemented. The reason was because further assessment of the situation
                 was needed to determine what would be practically feasible and what would not, in order
                 to decide on a clear way forward.

            l Both the FIMAG team and the counterpart team had optimistically assessed the pace of the
                 implementation of the ADMARC reforms and the possible hurdles in that process.
                 Consequently, they overestimated the Government's capacity for its implementation. The
                 Government was also preoccupied with the general elections, which were only few months
                 away.

            l When the new Government came to power, it decided that additional technical work was
                 needed to further prepare a comprehensive restructuring plan for ADMARC, including the
                 design of its social activities operations. As a result, the Government not only needed to
                 work out the additional technical details to design the next steps, it also needed to build the
                 necessary internal consensus for their implementation. Consequently, the Government
                 could not fulfill the ADMARC core Tranche condition and after months of delay in release
                 of the second Tranche, requested for a waiver.

   l Third, some conditions proved burdensome for the Government to implement. For instance, the
        Government was not comfortable with the condition for establishing a Public Service
        Remuneration Board to implement the medium term pay policy, and noted during the Negotiations
        of the operation that this is an onerous process requiring amendment to existing constitution. Also,
        the impact of the medium term civil service pay policy on pensions had not been appropriately
        assessed, making it fiscally burdensome and unsustainable for the Government to implement that
        policy. The Government also found it too demanding to decentralize land rent collection to all
        Districts, as had been envisaged by the FIMAG negotiated condition, and in practice limited that
        action to only 4 Districts, which were more prepared to take on this responsibility.

   l Fourth, some of the FIMAG objectives and policy measures implied a more promising outcome
        than they actually entailed. For instance, FIMAG had set as an objective improving the efficiency
        of public service delivery by moving budget formulation and execution decisions closer to
        communities and elected representatives. This in principle implied devolution of responsibilities to
        local governments, whereas in practice this became limited to the decentralization of other
        recurrent transactions (ORT) expenditures in primary education and healthcare. Therefore,
        decentralizing decisions on expenditures was far from realization as the institutional capacities and
        procedures for full devolution of responsibilities were not yet in place to allow the locally elected
        representatives to take control of these expenditures. Similarly, the Credit Agreement refers to
        "staff retrenchment" as part of the ADMARC restructuring plan, whereas in practice the scope of
        this activity has been narrowed to "staff review".

In retrospect, it seems that the results of the FIMAG operation were not much different than that of the
other three adjustment operations in Malawi. A 2006 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) carried out by
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) concludes that the Bank's four adjustment lending in Malawi have
had limited outcomes in terms of policy and institutional reforms and have been unsatisfactory regarding
macroeconomic stability, despite the fact that most of the adjustment lending aimed at fiscal reforms. The
problem seems to have been too much emphasis on institutional changes such as MTEF and inadequate
attention to policy issues affecting fiscal discipline, such as: (i) increasing incentives of officials to commit
to medium term expenditure targets; (ii) improving the robustness of budget planning and execution
systems; and, (iii) clarifying reporting relationship and accountability.


                                                       - 6 -

The CAE recommends that the future adjustment credits to be based on actions taken, not on action plans,
in particular they need to be more focused and scaled to meet implementation capacity. The CAE also
recommends priority to be given to strengthening budget implementation and better management of public
expenditure to enhance fiscal discipline.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Moderately Satisfactory. As a whole, the operation achieved many of the objectives identified in the Letter
of Development Policy (LDP) and the Credit Agreement.

The Government implemented many of the structural reforms that it committed to in the LDP. From a
difficult initial situation, Malawi made progress towards achieving a moderately satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. The macroeconomic framework has been supported by the IMF PRGF since
August 2005 (see Component A below). Achieving macroeconomic stability largely depended on fiscal
discipline and improved public financial management. Actions taken to complete the civil service wage
policy laid the foundation for improving expenditure control and a more predictable wage bill (see
Component B). In the area of parastatal reform, important enterprises in the utility and agriculture sector
have been either sold or brought to the point of sale. The ADMARC law has been repealed and further
restructuring of this entity look promising, tobacco levies have been reduced, and tobacco institutions have
been restructured (see Component C). In reforming agriculture, Malawi has implemented key elements of
its land policy. It also has increased the land rents, finalized the land law, and implemented a program to
reduce costs and improve the efficiency of tobacco marketing arrangements (see Component D). Malawi
has also implemented a program to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for combating
HIV/AIDS and has ensured that adequate resources are channeled to HIV/AIDS activities (see Component
E).

The achievement under FIMAG components are discussed in section 4.2 below, and the details are
presented in Annex 1.

4.2 Outputs by components:
The details of the Government reform program supported by FIMAG and its components are discussed in
the Program Document (Report No. 27649). Drawing on that document, this Section describes the
accomplishments under each of the FIMAG reform areas.

A.     Macroeconomic Policy Framework

With the preparation of the MPRSP, the macro economic program of the Government needed to focus on
sustaining macro stability to provide a firm basis for implementing the structural reform agenda outlined in
that strategy paper.

Malawi has had a history of weak macroeconomic performance, caused mainly by repeated fiscal slippages
and poor expenditure management, leading to unsustainable rise in price levels and domestic debt. The
Government undertook in its LDP to reduce fiscal deficit in order to reduce domestic borrowing and money
growth. Although the Government was moderately successful in creating a macroeconomic framework that
supported the MPRS objectives, its macroeconomic performance was poorer than what was anticipated in
the LDP. In recent years, the Government has been able to establish a better track record under an IMF
SMP and three-year PRGF program adopted in August 2005. Under the new PRGF, the Government had



                                                     - 7 -

set a more realistic medium term objectives to achieve macroeconomic stabilization.               The recent
performance under the PRGF has been relatively encouraging as the thrid review was completed in
February 2007.

Malawi's economic performance in the recent years has been influenced by two main trends. First, there
has been progress towards macroeconomic stabilization driven mainly by improved expenditure
management, though it is too early to tell extent to which the sound budgetary process and public
expenditure management will be sustained. The fiscal deficit dropped from an average of 8.2 percent
during 2001-2003 to 5.3 percent in 2005. Consequently, the inflation rate, which over 2001-03 was
around 22 percent, dropped to about 11.5 percent in 2004 before rising again to 16 percent in 2005 on
account of a sharp rise in food prices due to the drought. Malawi's external situation, however, has
remained structurally weak with high dependence on official transfers.

Second, a severe drought towards the end of 2004 affected growth and inflation, and put a strain on the
fiscal position of the Government. Real GDP grew by 5.1 percent in 2004 because of a rebound in tobacco
production, compared to on average 3 percent during 2001-2003. The improved GDP growth, however,
was adversely affected by a drought towards the end of the 2004/2005 crop season and resulted in a fall in
GDP growth to less than 2 percent in 2005. The continuation of low economic growth and chronic food
shortages due to the droughts, could further increase fiscal pressures and negatively affect the
Government's poverty reduction agenda.

B.    Improving Fiscal Management

Satisfactory. This rating reflects the Government's implementation of FIMAG core and non-core policy
conditions related to improving budget formulation, strengthening budget execution, improving budget
monitoring and control, and deepening fiscal decentralization.       More specifically, the Government of
Malawi with support of FIMAG implemented the following measures and achieved the following results.

   l Improved budget formulation through several measures aimed at (i) reducing the cost of running
        the Government and making it sustainable; and (ii) restructuring the wages for civil servants and
        making the wage bill more predictable. The Government carried out a functional review of its
        institutions and reduced the number of ministries and agencies from 46 to 25 and the number of
        permanent secretaries from 68 to 36. To ensure a stable wage bill, the Government completed the
        civil service wage policy and approved the Medium Term Pay Policy for Malawi civil service.
         However, the impact of the new wage policy on pensions was not timely assessed, making it
        difficult for the Government to implement this policy. Starting with the 2004/2005 budget, the
        Government consolidated the numerous allowances that were not taxed (e.g., fuel and housing) into
        basic pay, with the exception of travel allowances. Pay grades were unified across the core civil
        service, and the number of grades was reduced to 18 from 75. As a result of the reform, general
        gross wages rose by 25 percent, the minimum wage increased by 50 percent, and the wage bill in
        the budget increased from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2003/2004 to 7.5 percent in 2004/2005. Most of
        the increase in wages has been in the upper tier of the pay scale and has resulted in widening of the
        salary gap between the highest and the lowest levels by almost 90 times. The Government also
        consolidated salary and allowance structure of the Malawi civil service to form a uniform salary
        structure. As a result of these and other improvements in fiscal management and execution, the
        overall budgetary deficit declined from 7.8 percent of GDP in 2004 to 5.3 percent in 2005 and
        contributed towards an improved macroeconomic performance.

   l Strengthened budget execution function with the objective to control chronic overspending by the



                                                   - 8 -

         Government agencies. Specific actions included: approval of Public Finance Management and
         Public Audit Bills in August 2003; issuing circulars to operationalize the Public Finance
         Management and the Public Audit Acts in 2004 and issuing Treasury instructions for their
         implementation in 2005; approval of Public Procurement Bill; issuing procurement regulations;
         creating a functioning Directorate of Public Procurement and appointing its Directorate. Other
         actions included creating an Internal Audit Unit (IAU) in the Office of the President and Cabinet
         (OPC), appointing its Director, and approving the draft Internal Audit policy and its procedure,
         and the Cabinet approving Action plan for operationalizing the IAU as well as approving and
         submitting to Parliament Amendments to the Corrupt Practices Act. However, the IAU is not yet
         fully functional as the hiring of the auditors has not been completed. All of these happened in 2003
         and 2004 and began to affect the budget management and execution in 2005.

   l Improved budget monitoring and control to increase transparency of public expenditures by
         providing timely access to information. The Government began submitting the Quarterly
         Expenditure Reports (QERs) to the Cabinet Committee on the Economy and the Budget and
         Finance Committee of the Parliament. The Government, however, has not followed through with
         this practice recently. As a result, expenditure transparency has remained low and the public is not
         timely informed on budget execution, including the actual and budgeted pro poor expenditures.
   l Deepened fiscal decentralization to begin moving budgetary decisions closer to local communities
         and making them accountable for those decisions.             The Government issued guidelines for
         utilization of general grants on HIV/AIDS activities and implemented two specific actions. First, it
         decentralized the extension related services of the Ministry of Agriculture in accordance with the
         Cabinet Paper on Sector Devolution.           This was done by transferring the associated ORT
         expenditures from the Ministry of Finance directly to the District Assemblies. Second, it
         decentralized to the District Assemblies the responsibility for ORT expenditures in primary
         education and primary health care centers, in accordance with the Cabinet Paper on Sector
         Devolution, and transferred the associated staffing and budgetary allocations for carrying out these
         activities from the MOF to the District Assemblies.

Transferring ORT expenditures to local authorities marked a beginning and not a real devolution of
responsibility to the local authorities. The actual management of the ORT expenditures by District
Commissioners actually took place in the FY 2005/2006 budget, where the ORT budgets for primary
health and education in each District were presented with the District Commissioners as controlling
officers.

The Government also increased the level of land rent and decentralizing to the District Commissioners the
responsibility for land rent collection for non-tobacco farmers. (The collection of the land rent on leasehold
estates was carried out in two ways: for tobacco farmers, the rent was collected at the auction floor; for
non-tobacco farmers, land rent was collected by three regional collection points- North, Center and South).
The Government decentralized land rent collection only to 4 Districts because the capacity of these districts
for managing rent collection had been strengthened. While land rent collection started in 4 Districts, the
FIMAG condition envisaged this applying to all Districts. The roll out of the decentralized land rent
collection in the 25 remaining Districts has now started in line with an action plan agreed between the
Government (Ministry of Land) and the Bank. The main reason for the delay was the process of hiring the
tax officials and cleaning up land records at the District levels. The Government issued a Gazette notice of
delegation of powers to the Districts to collect land rent, and set aside the required amount in the FY 2005-
2006 budget to recruit land officers and land clerks for all the remaining Districts.

Further details of achievements in these areas are presented in Annex 1.

C.    Accelerating Parastatal Reforms

On balance, moderately satisfactory. This rating reflects the fact the while progress was moderate in
privatizing and restructuring enterprises, actions under this component took longer to implement than
originally anticipated. This eventually led to the Government request for a waiver on an important core
condition related to ADMARC restructuring.

Parastatals had remained a drag on Malawi's economic growth. They absorbed large budgetary resources
and had created contingent liabilities for the Government as they could not service contracted debt. To
address the issues related to monitoring of parastatal finances, borrowing and arrears, the Government of
Malawi with support of FIMAG embarked on several measures:

   l First, The Government privatized the following ADMARC subsidiaries.                   David Whitehead &
         Cotton Ginnery; Cold Storage Company (the Lilongwe abattoir), and Grain & Milling Company.
         The Government also brought to the point of sale Blantyre Milling, Alexander Forbes, MITCO,
         MANICA and Indebank.

   l      Second, to improve efficiency and coverage of utility services through increased participation by
         the private sector, the Government after many months of delays and discussions brought the MTL
         to the point of sale. It also prepared and submitted to Parliament Electricity Bill and the Energy
         Regulation Bill in line with the approved power policy.

   l      Third, to develop systemic approach to the privatization of the remaining public enterprises, the
         Government revised the Divestiture Sequence Plan in line with the recommendations of the study
         on privatization strategy, and carried out the action plan to address the implementation constraints.

   l      Fourth, to control parastatal borrowing and the resulting contingent liabilities, the Government
         included in the Public Finance Man-age-ment Act clear guidelines for parastatal borrowing. Also
         the MoF issued a circular to all Chief Execu-tives with instruc-tions for compliance with the
         borrowing policy.

   l      Fifth, to eliminate utility arrears and their recurrence, the MoF paid utility bills directly on behalf
         of selected ministries, including the Ministries of Defense and Health. Although this practice has
         stopped, the outstanding payments owed by the Government to telephone, power and water utilities
         were reduced by a significant amount in 2005. To maintain utility arrears at less than 60 days, the
         MoF instructed Controlling Officers to submit evidence of utility bill payment together with
         monthly expenditure returns as requirement for the following month's funding allocation. However,
         this has not much reduced the arrears beyond 60 days.

   l      Sixth, to improve efficiency of the maize market and to avoid future bail out of the ADMARC, the
         Government repealed the ADMARC act and incorporated ADMARC as a limited liability
         company under the Company Act. It also prepared a framework for restructuring social marketing
         activities formerly carried out by ADMARC.

The ADMARC was in fact the biggest obstacle to agricultural development as it became detrimental to the
efficiency of the grain markets and constrained private sector involvement in the agriculture sector. Its
restructuring was an important second Tranche condition, which required downsizing of ADMARC by
splitting that entity into two units, the first dealing with commercial operations and the second social


                                                       - 10 -

functions. The latter involved agricultural input supply and crop purchasing in remote and poor areas.

The condition for ADMARC stipulated that: the Government will implement the plan for restructuring
ADMARC commercial activities that has been approved by Cabinet through appointing a new Board for
the company, carrying out staffing reviews, and separating social marketing activities from ADMARC
Limited. While the Government implemented a few reforms related to ADMARC, the progress were not
enough to fulfill the second Tranche condition as reflected in the Credit Agreement.

When the new Government came to power, it decided that further technical work was needed to prepare a
comprehensive restructuring plan for ADMARC, including the design and operation of social functions.
Consequently, the Government requested for a waiver and recruited consultants to assist in the preparation
and implementation of a comprehensive restructuring plan in two phases. On the basis of the first phase of
work completed in January 2006, the consultant presented the Government with options for restructuring
and the Government approved a cabinet paper defining next steps in the reform of ADMARC.

The cabinet paper provided a framework for meeting the three conditions for Tranche release mentioned
above. The paper proposed creation of two new companies out of the current ADMARC: one, a private
commercial entity, Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO), created by
separating commercial activities currently carried out by ADMARC; and, two a company to carry out the
social activities, which would retain the name ADMARC and would concentrate its operations in food
crops in the areas where private traders are not providing the necessary marketing services.

The Bank agreed to waive this condition and release the second Tranche on two considerations: first, the
overall satisfactory progress in the implementation of the FIMAG program (5 of the 6 Tranche core
conditions had been fully met); and, second technical work was in advance stage and the approved
Government paper had defined a set of principles to govern the ADMARC reforms. The Bank felt that
granting the waiver will give the Government the additional time needed to carry out the necessary
analytical work and to build internal consensus among the agencies to resolve the design problems related
to separation of social marketing activities from ADMARC .   [1]




The next steps in the reform of ADMARC include: (i) appointment of a new Board for the company; (ii)
carrying out staffing review; and, (iii) separating social marketing activities from ADMARC. The latter
activity involves several actions. First, assets related to commercial operations will need to be evaluated
and transferred from ADMARC to MAWTCO. Second, Government would need to reach an internal
consensus on a set of social markets where the new ADMARC will operate on the basis of clear and
transparent criteria and close down remaining markets. Third, additional work needs to be carried out to
determine the structure and operational policies of ADMARC and to design a subsidy mechanism.

The Government is in the process of launching this phase of its work with consultants for creating the two
institutions. There seems to be a good chance of a consensus on ADMARC reform within the Government.
However, it could still take some time before key elements of the reform engaging are implemented.

Further details of achievements are presented in Annex 1.

D.    Reforming Land Policy and Agriculture

Moderately Satisfactory. This rating reflects the fact that the Government fulfilled policy conditions of
FIMAG, but progress in reaching the outcome was less than anticipated. Under this component the



                                                     - 11 -

Government achieved two of its three primary objectives to reform land policy and its utilization, and to
improve return to tobacco growers. However, it had less success in increasing food security and in
preventing food price increases to protect the vulnerable. More specifically, the Government with support
of FIMAG implemented the following measures and achieved the following outcomes/outputs:
   l Reformed Land policy to ensure an equitable access to land and its use. The Government launched
         an intensive communication campaign to explain the objectives of the new land law, and presented
         to Parliament the new land bill. The amount of land sublet or reverted to public land tenure and
         offered for sale increased from 10,000 ha to 100,000 ha. The Government approved a new land
         taxation policy and revised land taxation in line with that policy. Land fees for leasehold had not
         been adjusted in 5 years (law required adjustment every 3 years). In addition, capacity to collect
         land fees was weak and collection rates were low (30 percent). The Government published in the
         official gazette and publicized in the local newspaper and radio a notice to adjust land fees from
         MK50 to MK1, 000 per hectare for leasehold land according to Land Act. Also, to improve land
         collection rates, the action plan prepared by the Ministry of Land to strengthen collection capacity
         (at the District and ministry levels) was implemented.
   l Improved returns to Tobacco growers[2] by reducing substantially levies on tobacco. Tobacco
         producers used to receive a much lower share of the auction floor price (60 percent) than in
         neighboring countries because of high and numerous statutory levies and the inefficiency at all
         levels of the supply chain. The Government implemented the first and the second phases of the
         action plan for reducing levies on tobacco, resulting in an immediate 2.5 percent increase in
         farmers' gross proceeds from tobacco (amounting to a 25 percent increase in net return/kg). To
         foster competition in domestic markets, the Government issued and publicized detailed operational
         guidelines on contract farming and direct exporting by tobacco growers. Other reforms under the
         FIMAG involved obtaining cabinet approval and implementing detailed operational strategy and
         necessary legal and regulatory instruments for restructuring the tobacco sector institutions.

With the support of the IDA Emergency Drought Recovery Project, the Government carried out a
comprehensive institutional review of the tobacco sector and approved an operational strategy to improve
the efficiency of tobacco marketing and to restructure the tobacco sector institutions with the objective to
increase transparency of their operations. The findings and results of this review were discussed at a
stakeholder's workshop. Based on the workshop's recommendations, a paper outlining the operational
strategy and action plan to restructure tobacco institutions was prepared and approved by the Cabinet in
June 2005. The Government also improved tobacco marketing in line with the recommendations of the
institutional review, and amended the governing legislative and regulatory framework to put into effect the
restructuring. Tobacco marketing was non-competitive and tobacco sector institutions were not operating
on a transparent basis. As part of restructuring tobacco industries, the Government began to work out the
modalities for creating the Local Commodity Exchanges, offering the local producers access to a local
competitive outlet. Further studies, however, are needed to improve overall governance in the sector and to
increase competition and efficiency in the domestic marketing system.

   l      Took steps towards food security by initiating improvements in the maize marketing and
         developing private sector initiative in grain marketing. The Government approved food security
         policy to develop a transparent and balanced nutritional food security system and to protect most
         vulnerable during shortage periods. In addition, it began the process of restructuring the social
         activities formerly carried out by ADMARC, in line with the new food security and nutrition
         policy. However, the food security policy was poorly designed and was not successful in increasing
         food production or in making the prices stable, although some institutional structures have
         improved.

E.     Combating HIV/AIDS

Satisfactory. This rating reflect the fact that all the credit conditions were substantially met and that there
was a considerable progress towards reaching the Government three objectives of setting up the policy,
institutional, and financing framework to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS.

At the time of the preparation of FIMAG, the HIV/AIDS was widespread, but the legal and institutional
frameworks for the public sector response to address this problem were not in place. In addition, the
domestic funding for the national response to HIV/AIDS was low and erratic. The Government tried to
adopt a framework for the national response to HIV/AIDS and included in the budget resources for
managing HIV/AIDS interventions. However, the implementation of HIV/AIDS programs had not made
much progress. To address these problems, with support of the FIMAG and other operations, the
Government program focused on three areas:

   l Defined the policy framework, by developing and approving the national HIV/AIDS policy and
         submitting to Parliament the Law creating National Aids Commission (NAC).

   l Strengthened the institutional framework for public sector response at national and District
         levels. This involved taking several measures, including issuing public sector main-streaming
         guidelines by NAC; approving Public Sector HIV/AIDS main-streaming strategy prepared by the
         Department of Human Resource Management; appointing the Steering Committee; and,
         establishing ad hoc HIV/AIDS Coordinating Committees in many Districts. The Government also
         appointed the full-time Coordinators, established Institu-tional Committees, initiated first year
         programs in 10 public institu-tions, approved HIV/AIDS main-stream-ing strategy for District /
         City Assemblies, and ensured that 4 District and City assemblies have full time HIV/AIDS
         Coordi-nators and functioning committees for HIV/AIDS.

   l      Set up the financing framework by adopting several measures, including: (i) changing
         classification of HIV/AIDS budget lines as pro-poor expenditures and, as such, protected from
         diversion to other uses; (ii) issuing guidelines for General Grants to Districts, specifying that
         HIV/AIDS interventions are eligible expenditures; and, (iii) allocating at least 2 percent of the
         non-salary recurrent budget to HIV/AIDS interventions in line with the public sector
         mainstreaming strategy. In addition, the Government allocated US$2.0 million in the FY2004/05
         budget for HIV/AIDS interventions, to be disbursed to the NAC in the amount of US$0.5 million
         for each quarter. The US$2.0 million was supposed to be provided each year to support the
         coordination and management of the national response. (In FY03-04, the Government allocated
         US$1 million to NAC because NAC activities under Multi-Sectoral Aids had not started). For the
         FY05/06, US$1.2 million have been budgeted so far, but it is not clear whether the remaining
         amounts will be allocated this year. The Government also successfully obtained funds from the
         Global Fund for HIV/AIDS for about $196 million to be disbursed over five years.

Further details of achievements are presented in Annex 1.


    [1]The Bank also considered the option of not releasing the second Tranche on the basis of non- compliance with the
    ADMARC condition, but recommended against it on account of the precarious balance of payment situation (as a result of

    the 2004/05 drought) and the fact that the second Tranche was an important part of the Government financing plan agreed
    with the IMF. Without the second Tranche resources, the Government had to borrow domestically to meet budgetary
    targets, thus undermining the fiscal stabilization efforts.

    [2]
       OD No. 4.76 defines limitations to World Bank support for the tobacco sector and is therefore relevant to the FIMAG.
    The team had obtained an appropriate waiver for the needs of the proposed reform program.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not Applicable. This was a policy-based operation.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not Applicable

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Modest. Given that in some program areas the results were not fully achieved or were delayed, the overall
institutional development impact is assessed as modest:

In the area of fiscal management, the Government made progress in strengthening budget process and
execution and in facilitating efforts towards decentralization. Functional review of the Government
institutions, the reduction in the number of ministries, and the preparation of action plan and the
appointment of task force to help its implementation contributed to reducing the cost of running the
Government. Also, the preparation of the Medium Term Pay Policy for Malawi civil service, consolidation
of salary and allowance structure, and the establishment of a Public Service Remuneration Board helped a
more predictable wage bill. In the area of budget execution, preparation of Public Finance Management
and Audit bill and the issuance of circular for its implementation as well as the approval of the Public
Procurement Bill and the establishment of the Directorate of Public Procurement and the appointment of its
Director contributed to strengthen budget execution. Other institutional development impact included the
creation and appointment of the Director of an Internal Audit Unit in the Office of President and Cabinet,
drafting of Internal Audit Policy, and approval of the Amendments to Corrupt Practice Act. On budget
monitoring and control, important institutional development included the preparation of Quarterly
Expenditure Reports and its publication in the MoF website and the local newspapers. On decentralization,
the notable development included the preparation of the Cabinet paper on Sector Devolution Plan,
decentralization of extension services related to the Ministry of Agriculture, and the decentralization of land
rent collection, primary education, and primary healthcare to the Cities and District Assemblies.

In the area of parastatal reform institutional development impact included: incorporating ADMARC as a
limited liability company; approval of power policy; preparation of Electricity Bill and Energy Regulation
Bill in line with the approved power policy; and, preparation of guidelines for parastatal borrowing.

In the area of agriculture the institutional development impact covered land policy, support to tobacco
growers, and food security: land policy was approved; special commission on drafting the Land Bill
established; public awareness campaign initiated; review of levies on tobacco completed; guidelines on
contract farming and direct exporting were drafted; operational strategy for restructuring the tobacco sector
was prepared; first annual performance audit of AHL, TCC, and TAMA was produced; and, food security
policy was approved.

In combating HIV/AIDS, institutional development impact included: development of HIV/AIDS national
policy; establishment of Institutional Committee and initiation of the first year programs; establishing
Ad-hoc HIV/AIDS coordinating committee; functioning committees for four District and four City
Assemblies; and mainstreaming HIV/AIDS budget line.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Drought: an important factor outside the control of the government was the recurrent droughts in 2001-02
and again in 2004-05. These droughts led to losses in income and increased subsidies to agriculture, thus
undermining macroeconomic stability.

Increase in oil prices: the pressure on the budget owing to the increase in oil prices during 2004-05 was
another factor beyond the control of government put a heavy pressure on budgetary resources. However,
inflation and current account deficit were not much affected, though they remained high due to other
factors.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Macroeconomic framework:          The maintenance of fiscal discipline in the interest of macroeconomic
stability was within government control. Yet, the Government had a hard time maintaining a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. Following approval of the loan in April 2004, the macroeconomic framework
agreed with the IMF was derailed because of the rise in public spending before the election in May of that
year. As a result there was a substantial delay of about 5 months in loan effectiveness and release of the
first Tranche compared to its originally targeted release date of April 2004.

Restructuring ADMARC: the change of approach by the new Government on restructuring and downsizing
ADMARC led to a considerable delay in release of the second Tarnche and a request to waiver this core
condition. That Tranche was released almost 6 months after the original targeted release date (almost 2
years after the approval).

Other areas where more timely actions by the Government may have resulted in a better outcome included:
further efforts at reducing deficit spending, faster privatization of public utilities, decentralization of land
rent collection to all Districts (instead of 4), more proactive in restructuring of tobacco institutions,
including the creation of Local Community Exchanges.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Same as above.

5.4 Costs and financing:
There were no changes in the costs or the financing of FIMAG. The Credit was in the amount of US$50
million on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and a grace period of 10 years. FIMAG was a two
Tranche operation with core prior actions for Board presentation. During the Negotiations of this operation
the Government agreed to a TA program of about US$1 million (funded by donors and budgetary
resources) to carry out a number of studies to facilitate fulfillment of various Tranche conditions.

The Credit was approved on April 13, 2004, became effective on September 7, 2004. The first Tranche
was released on September 10, 2004 and the second Tranche on April 20, 2006. The Credit was extended
once from December 31, 2005 to June 30, 2006 to enable the Government make further advances in the
politically sensitive and time consuming reforms in ADMARC and the tobacco sector. That extension
increased the period of implementation between effectiveness and closing date to about 22 months.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:




                                                     - 15 -

Overall, sustainability is rated as likely. However, there are some concerns.

Perhaps the most important element in sustainability is the fiscal deficit and how it will impact
macroeconomic stability. The Government is focusing on strengthening fiscal discipline by further
improving budget preparation and execution and increasing its transparency. However, given the past
record, there are some concerns regarding Government's ability to control fiscal deficit and the domestic
debt, which continue to remain high. There is more optimism now than before for macro sustainability as
the new Government, which came to power in May 2004, has put stoppage on extra-budgetary
expenditures that characterized the former Government.

In the areas of budget management, execution, and monitoring, sustainability is likely as most of the policy
actions have been included into the regular operations of the Government. In decentralization, the
Government succeeded in empowering the District Assemblies to take expenditure decisions in health and
education, and to collect land rent. However, sustainability concerns exist on extent to which Districts have
adequate capacity to undertake the devolved responsibilities and to influence expenditure decisions on
primary education and healthcare. Also, the roll out of land rent collection to all Districts is an issue that
needs to be dealt with in a pragmatic way as it probably would involve a phased approach given the
capacity constraints.

Progress in privatization is likely to continue, but, the difficulties experienced in the case of privatization of
large utility enterprises would likely persist. Significant steps have been taken towards ADMARC
restructuring. However, there are uncertainties regarding additional time and efforts that are still needed to
implement the required actions. Clearly, further efforts beyond FIMAG would be necessary to complete the
reform program of this entity, including the creation of downstream companies, staffing requirements of
ADMARC commercial and ADMARC social, the actual staff retrenchment, and the creation of the
operational framework for social functions that ADMARC would carry out.

In the case of agriculture, there is a better chance for sustainability of reforms due to improved
rationalization of land rents and returns to tobacco growers, though further work may still be needed to
complete restructuring of tobacco sector industries. However, there is a sustainability concern regarding
food security as the policy on food security has not succeeded in increasing food production or in making
food prices stable. In combating HIV/AIDS, the benefits are likely to remain sustained due to improved
legal, institutional, and financing frameworks.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The lending scenario for the 2003 CAS included two structural adjustment credits (for FY04 and FY06
respectively) to support key structural reforms complementing the Government's macroeconomic
stabilization efforts, with a view to establishing a foundation for broad-based sustainable growth. As
mentioned before, the FIMAG was the first of these two operations.

In line with the CAS, the Bank will prepare the second adjustment loan to Malawi as a successive operation
to FIAMG. The proposed second operation will build on FIAMG achievements and will further deepen the
reforms in the areas of fiscal discipline, agriculture, parastatal restructuring, and private sector
development. Other follow on Bank operations will also build on the continuity of the FIMAG supported
policy measures.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:



                                                      - 16 -

Moderately Satisfactory. The reasons for this rating include timeliness of the operation and the consistency
with the Government's development strategy and the reform measures reflected in the MPRSP and the CAS
(see also section 3.5, Quality at Entry). FIMAG was in fact a continuation of structural reforms supported
by other adjustment operations since the mid 1990s, and was built on the results of those operations.
The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of FIMAG was satisfactory as it
considered all technical, financial, and institutional aspects of the operation. FIMAG was prepared with a
full knowledge of the economy and considerable analytical work, such as those on public expenditure
review, country economic memorandum and CFAA, and CPAR. However, its preparation was interrupted
by derailment of the macro fiscal variables, and its execution was delayed by the optimistic time line
designed for restructuring ADMARC. Although FIMAG was appraised thoroughly, the commitment of the
Government to timely implement the first and the second Tranche policy measures was overestimated. This
was partly due to the poor implementation of macroeconomic policy measures (in case of the first Tranche)
and slow actions on restructuring ADMARC in a timely manner (in case of the second Tarnche).

The most important reform measures that the Bank has supported Malawi through its adjustment
operations included: the introduction of the cash budget system, the liberalization of the foreign exchange
market, the liberalization of the financial sector, a continued implementation of the tax reform program
aimed at broadening the base and lowering tax rates, introduction of the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) as a budgeting tool, the introduction of the Credit Ceiling Authority system to prevent
the Government from borrowing from the banking system when it did not have to do so, and                 the
introduction of the Credit Control System to assist the Ministry of Finance to monitor and track
Government ministries and departments that accumulate commitments into arrears. However, as mentioned
before, the 2006 CAE concludes that the Bank's four adjustment lending in Malawi have had limited
outcomes in terms of policy and institutional reforms and have been unsatisfactory regarding
macroeconomic stability. The recommendations of this evaluation provide valuable guideposts for
improving the impact of the Bank's future adjustment operations in Malawi.

7.2 Supervision:
Satisfactory. The team followed up with the Government on all reform fronts and reviewed progress in
achieving the milestones described in the LDP and the Program Document.

The Bank team on FIMAG consisted of professionals with relevant technical expertise in the areas of
public sector reform and agriculture. The team leader made monthly visits to the country and intervened
when there were problems. The presence of the Bank office in Malawi as well as the regular presence of the
team leader in the county greatly facilitated monitoring the FIMAG implementation. The team regularly
prepared aide-memoirs to alert the Government on implementation problems. Also, the Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) contained a realistic assessment of the FIMAG performance.

 The supervision team succeeded in establishing a collaborative relationship with the counterpart team, the
IMF, and other development partners to ensure consistency of assistance to Malawi. The Country Director
also did some overseeing during his visits to Malawi to resolve essential issues impeding the operation (e.g.
strengthening reform monitoring group in the MoF). These were important factor in keeping the supervision
quality high.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory in view of the rating for lending and the
quality of supervision.

Borrower



                                                     - 17 -

7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance in the preparation of FIMAG is rated Satisfactory. The preparation of FIMAG
started with strong backing of the Government and the implementing agencies. There was a strong support
for reform from the highest levels in the Government aided by a dedicated team in the Ministry of Finance.
This helped increase ownership of the program and a full understanding on the policy contents of the
FIMAG as highlighted in the LDP.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
The overall implementation performance of the Government is assessed as moderately satisfactory. As
discussed in section 4, the Government was effective in the implementation of most of the envisaged
reforms. Although the Government was fully involved in the design stage, the loan effectiveness was
delayed by about 5 months until September 2004 to enable the Government to reach an agreement with the
IMF on a new staff monitoring program. This was mainly because the PRGF program had gone off track
on account of the Government overspending before the elections. Release of the second Tranche was also
delayed by about 6 months. While the effectiveness delay did not reflect delay in implementation, the
second Tranche delay was because of the slow progress in a number of reforms including the ADMARC
restructuring, which necessitated reformulation of plans and granting of a waiver for this condition,
following the arrival of the new Government and its change of approach regarding this entity's
restructuring.

The Government set up a Steering Committee, as a counterpart team chaired by the Secretary of Treasury,
to facilitate the preparation and to oversee the implementation of FIMAG reforms. In addition, the
Government appointed a senior civil servant from the MoF to serve on a full time basis as a coordinator for
FIMAG. There were many reform areas in FIMAG that involved more than one ministry or agency.
Decentralization involved the line ministry, MoF, Local Governments, and the Accountant General. Reform
in tobacco involved MoF, Agriculture, and support from a range of stakeholders in the tobacco industry.
ADMARC involved the MoF, Agriculture, and the Privatization Commission. The counterpart team was
instrumental in overcoming the resistance from the effected line ministries and in pushing the agenda
forward.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
See section 7.5

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
In view of moderately satisfactory implementation, the overall performance of the Borrower is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

Adjustment operations should not be complex for countries with weak implementation capacity. The
slow progress in implementing the ADMARC reform was mainly because it involved a complex set of
social-political issues, which took a long time to resolve and went beyond the implementation capacity of
the agencies involved. Because of these complexities there were serious lapse in the design of that
component as the operation entered the reform process with actions spelled out, but without the design
being completely worked out.

Design of the adjustment operations need to be thoroughly worked out to avoid implementation delays.
The lessons drawn from FIMAG exercise indicate that the timing of policy implementation cannot be easily
determined if the details of Tranche release conditions are not properly worked out at the time of the
preparation of the operation. The lack of details could make the condition ambiguous or could potentially



                                                    - 18 -

put at risk the timely implementation of the envisaged measures and the follow up actions.

Expectations should be realistic in the case of transforming the state-run operations. It is important to
be realistic on the time period required to transform state operated activities into commercially operated
activities. The burden on the budget may remain for several years before the state activities can be
commercially and independently operated. It may require consensus building or taking certain political
decisions, which might not be popular. The full transformation may even have to wait until the
implementation of complementary measures in the subsequent operations. In any case, it is important to
realistically assess and plan for the transformation these institutions, given the political economy concerned
and the weak implementation capacity of many Government agencies.

Efforts at capacity building are crucial for deepening policy and institutional reforms.
It is important to build and strengthen capacity at the level of the implementation agency to ensure success
of policy reforms. In the case of Malawi, it is particularly important to build capacity at District levels so
that they could effectively carry out functions and responsibilities devolved to Districts under the ongoing
decentralization program

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The government of Malawi has been agreed with the report and would like to add the following
two comments to its publication:

(1) Page 6 of the report paragraph 4 mentions that at the time of negotiations, government was not
comfortable with the establishment of a Public Service Remuneration Board because the processes of
setting it up could have been onerous, requiring amendment to the existing constitution. We would like to
mention that the new government has actually established this Board and it s operational.

(2) Page 15 of the report paragraph 5 mentions that timely actions in areas such as decentralization of and
rent collection could have resulted in better outcomes of the program. While we agree with this conclusion,
we would also like to highlight the fact that it was not possible to move faster with decentralization of land
rent collection given the weak capacity of handling finances in the district assemblies at that time. However,
Government has made some progress in building the capacity of District Assemblies. Further, 24 more land
officers have now been recruited and deployed in districts to facilitate land rent collection at district level.

[5]The guidelines for contract farming contain the following features: (i) Contract farming should be allowed for both flue-cured and burley tobacco, (ii)
Contract farming should be open to all, not only to the members of TEAM, (iii) Grower bodies like TAMA, NASFAM, or an organized group of growers to
negotiate an overall contract framework including a floor price and publicize it. (iv) The date of effectiveness of guidelines should be indicated.
