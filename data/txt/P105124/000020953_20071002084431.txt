                                  FORA PROPOSED
  FIRST HIMACHAL PRADESHDEVELOPMENT POLICY LOANAND CREDIT
                            TO THE REPUBLICOF INDIA

Borrower           Republic o f India

ImplementingAgency State o f Himachal Pradesh

Amount             Credit: SDR42.5 million (US$65 million equivalent)
                   Loan: US$135 million

Terms              Credit: Standard IDA terms; 35 years maturity with 10years o f grace.
                   Loan: Payable in 20 years including 5 years o f grace period; at the standard
                   interest rate for LIBOR-based variable-spread U S Dollar single currency
                   loans.

Tranching          The loan and credit proceeds for the operation would be disbursed in two
                   equal tranches o fUS$ 67.5 million and SDR 21.25 million, respectively. The
                   operation i s designed so that all key actions for the first tranche have been
                   taken prior to Board Presentation. Disbursement o f the second tranche i s
                   expected inFY 2008-09, conditional on fulfillment o f the prior actions for the
                   second tranche.

Description        The proposed operation supports the medium term program o f the
                   Government o f Himachal Pradesh (GoHP). The overarching objective o f the
                   proposed loadcredit i s to support the implementation o f critical structural,
                   fiscal, and administrative reforms needed to achieve sustainable and rapid
                   economic growth and inclusive development over the medium term, while
                   sustaining the environmental heritage o f the state. The priority areas for the
                   operation will be fiscal adjustment and promotion o f environmentally
                   sustainable development-with        particular reference to the development o f
                   hydropower. The overall program will also support reforms to enhance
                   growth and employment, and improve governance and public administration.

Benefits           The proposed operation, consistent with CAS objectives, supports measures
                   to institutionalize fiscal stabilization and to sustain rapid economic growth in
                   one o f India's major "special category" states. Fiscal reforms and measures
                   to strengthen financial accountability should reduce the state's dependence on
                   debt financing, while increasing fiscal space for development expenditures
                   along with their efficiency.          Support to environmentally sustainable
                   development will help to protect the state's precious natural resource base,
                   from which it derives its comparative advantages in sectors like tourism, and
                   hydropower. Improvements in governance and administrative effectiveness
                   combined with growth-enabling reforms should lead, over time, to increased
                   private investment and productive job opportunities for the educated
                   population, along with expanded access to improved basic services,
                   particularly for the remote areas.         Bank support for the program i s
                   complemented by reform-linked assistance from Government o f India (GoI).
Risks              The proposed operation faces four key risks. First, implementation may be
                   slower than planned because o f institutional capacity constraints.     Second,
                   non-adherence to the targets set in the Medium Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP)
                   could derail the state's adjustment path, and affect future tranche release.
                   Third, there could be a reputational risk for the Bank fromperceivednegative
                   impacts on the environment from support for the Government's planned

                    hydropower development.         Fourth, elections for the State's Legislative
                    Assembly are due inearly-2008.
                    Several steps have been taken to reduce the risks involved. First, to help
                    alleviate capacity constraints, the Bank i s seelung to ensure that significant
                    technical assistance i s available to follow through on the reform measures
                    supported by the proposed operation. Close attention i s also being paid to
                    sequencing the reforms in such a way as to avoid an overloaded agenda
                    which would strain implementation capacity.         Second, enactment o f the
                    Himachal Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2005,
                    reduces the risk o f deviating from the fiscal correctionpath. Linkingo f Bank
                    assistance as well as central government debt relief to the achievement o f
                    annual fiscal adjustment further strengthens the incentives for the GoHP to
                    adhere to the MTFP. Third, to mitigate any reputational risk, the Bank will
                    continue to hold regular consultations with stakeholders to address any
                    concerns, and will emphasize that the proposed operation will help GoHP
                    embark on an environmentally sound path to hydropower expansion. Fourth,
                    broad ownership o f the principal objectives o f the program has been built
                    among key stakeholders, through extensive consultations that are ongoing.
                    The reformprogram addresses HP's development priorities over which there
                    i s broad consensus. Careful consideration has also been given to political
                    economy factors in the design o f the reforms, and their sequencing, and

I                   tranching.

                                          I. INTRODUCTION

1.    Located in North India, Himachal Pradesh (HP) i s a small mountainous state bordering Punjab,
Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. With a geographical area o f 55,673 sq. k m s and
population o f 6.6 million, HP accounts for 1.6 percent o f the national geographical area and about 0.6
percent o f India's population. It i s one o f India's leading states in terms o f human development, and, has
some o f the best indicators interms o f gender equality and access to services. Moreover, inrecent years,
HP has achieved economic success in the form o f higher growth rates than the rest o f the country-
powered by rapid expansion o f the secondary and tertiary sectors which collectively account for more
than 80 percent o f the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). HP now has a per capita income o f just
under US$ 800 per capita which is slightly higher than the national average-although           by comparable
international standards, it remains quite low.

2.    HP is a unique state because o f the success it has achieved over the past three decades, despite
severe structural disadvantages o f relative remoteness, environmental fragility, and a difficult hill terrain
which raise costs o f service delivery-all      characteristic of Himalayan states in India. Nevertheless, in
order to sustain this progress, the state faces some difficult transition challenges, especially to create jobs
for a rapidly growing and educated labor force, and unlocking the potential for private sector led growth
in high-value tourism and niche manufacturing and other sectors, while addressing key fiscal and
environmental sustainability issues. If successful, this strategy will have important demonstration effects
for many other hill states inIndia facing similar circumstances.

3.    It is notable that, since the formation of HP as a state in India in 1971, successive state
administrations have focused on overall progress-with              particular attention to social and human
development, which are areas where HP has emerged as one of the leaders in the country. Buildingupon
the state's recent success, the government seeks to achieve the twin objectives o f sustainable growth and
inclusive development over the medium term. The state's past enviable track record i s testimony to the
ability o f its people and government to forge a social consensus and compact necessary to achieve such
goals.

4.    The World Bank has been approachedby the Government o f Himachal Pradesh (GoHP) through the
Government o f India (GoI) to become a partner in its development effort, and support a developing
program o f policy and institutional reforms. In light o f its articulated development objectives, GoHP has
signaled willingness to adopt and continue reforms in key areas to create fiscal space to finance critical
investments, promote private sector development, encourage sectors where the state can compete
effectively by playing to its natural strengths, strengthen governance and public service delivery, conserve
and protect its environmental heritage, and further improve social outcomes-as         indicated in the Budget
Speech for 2007-08. To help underpin HP's reforms, the Bank has been requested by both GoHP and the
Go1to provide support inthe form o f development policy lending in support o f the government's medium
term reform program. This document details the reform program o f GoHP and proposes Bank support
through a loan o f US$ 135 million and a credit of SDR 42.5 million (US$ 65 million equivalent),
commensurate to the reform process and sequenced appropriately so as to manage the risks involved.

5.    The structure o f the Program Document is as follows.                Section I1 summarizes the recent
developments at the national level and their implications for HP. It reports on HP's recent development
outcomes. Section I11describes GoHP's overarching reform program, and Section IV outlines the Bank's

program in HP. Section V discusses the specific components o f HP's policy and institutional reform
program supported by the First Himachal Pradesh Development Policy Loadcredit (HPDPL 1). Finally,
Section VI describes implementation o f the proposed operation. Annex A contains a description of
GoHP's program inits Letter o f Development Policy (LDP).

                     A.     Recent NationalDevelopmentsand their Implicationsfor HP

6.    Rapid growth and poverty reduction. Acceleration in economic growth has propelled India onto
the global stage as an emerging economic giant.                     After slowing from 2000-01 to 2002-03, Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth has resumed its rapid rate, and the country has experienced an average
annual GDP growth rate o f over 8 percent during the past three years.' The expansion has been resilient
inthe face of volatile oil prices and slowing growth inthe United States. The momentum is expectedto
continue inthe near term, with GDP growth rate projected above 9 percent for 2006-07. Notwithstanding
recent global capital market events, India's growth remains broadly based and i s not excessively affected
by the current downturn incapital inflows following global shifts inrisk assessment. Growth is supported
byrobust consumption, investment, and exports. India's GDPper capita growth rate since 1991puts the
country inthe ranks o f the top ten fastest-growing countries in the world. The acceleration in economic
growth has coincided with millions o f Indians moving out o f poverty, and the poverty head count ratio
has fallen from 36 percent in 1993-94 to 28 percent in2004-05.

7.    Thriving services, improving performance in industry, and lagging agriculture. The growth
surge has been fuelled primarily by rapid and robust growth in the services sector-which                        has grown at
an annual average rate o f 9 percent since the 1990s, contributing nearly 69 percent o f the overall average
growth o f the economy in the period between 2002-03 and 2006-07 and, in the process, expanding the
share o f services in GDP to 55 percent. More recently, industry, expanding by nearly 10 percent over the
last three years, has joined services as an engine o f growth. Consequently, industry's share in GDP has
risen to 26 percent-but         more gradually than services when viewed over a longer period. On the other
hand, agriculture growth has lagged and has been volatile: growing at just 2.3 percent in the five-year
period ending 2006-07. Consequently agriculture's share in GDP has declined to 19 percent in 2006-07
from 22 percent in2002-03.

8.    Growth has been supported by wide-ranging, gradual reforms. India continues to reform its
economy gradually, and, at the same time, expand the scope to cover larger parts o f the economy. India's
trade and investment regimes have become considerably more favorable: the average external tariff for
nonagriculturalgoods has beenreducedbelow 10percent, and i s committed to reachingEast Asian levels;
foreign investment has been permitted inmost sectors o f the economy; and the country has taken a more
proactive stance in trade negotiations. Weekly inflation as measured by the Wholesale Price Index had
risen above 6 percent driven by supply side factors, but has dropped to 4.05 percent as o f the week ending
August 4, 2007. India's monetary authority's response to the spurt in inflation has been creditable,
adjusting policy instruments to manage liquidity and signal higher costs o f borrowing, improving the
depth o f the financial sector, and allowing greater flexibility in the management o f the exchange rate.
Fiscal policy has also responded to the inflation spurt by adjusting customs and excise rates. Along with
other structural reforms to improve the investment climate, trade reforms and greater openness have led to
increased competition and induced efficiency-enhancing microeconomic restructuring o f firms.                          The
latter, in turn, has generated more robust and durable growth o f the Indian economy inrecent years. The
aggregate investment rate in the economy had also climbed to 33.8 percent o f GDP in 2005-06, from
about 23 percent in 2001-02, much o f it due to greater private investment that i s financed by higher
domestic savings o f 32.4 percent o f GDP.


 This is also appreciably faster than the 6 percent annual growth inthe 1980s and 1990s, and 3.5 percent earlier

                                                                2

9.    India's macroeconomic situation remains strong. The external position o f India's economy has
improved dramatically. The rapid growth o f exports and highvolume o f remittances have resulted in a
comfortable balance-of-payments situation (and foreign exchange reserves o f US$ 229 billion as on
August 10, 2007). An increasing trade deficit expanded the current deficit to 1.1percent o f GDP (US$ 9
billion) in2005-06 by neutralizingthe strong flow o fremittances and services export proceeds. However,
capital inflows remain buoyant, and the capital account surplus was nearly US$ 24 billion in 2005-06.
India's vulnerability to an external crisis i s therefore limited by its record level o f reserves, equivalent to
more than 7 months of imports and exceeding India's gross external debt. India's gross external debt was
about 15 percent o f GDP as o f end 2006-07, and i s expected to decline further. The fiscal position of
state and central governments has continued to improve and the general government (states and central
governments combined) fiscal deficit has fallen fkom more than 10 percent o f GDP in 2001-02 to about
7.4 percent in 2005-06.       General government debt remained high-although          declining-at    nearly 83
percent o f GDP in 2005-06. The key downside macro risks facing the Indian economy inthe short term
are higher oil prices, inflation, rapid credit growth, and a slowdown inthe global economy, although they
are unlikely to derail the overall momentum.

10. India's primary challenges now include improvements in public service delivery. The recent
economic performance i s also creating new challenges. While India's economic and social performance
has been impressive on many counts, it has also been uneven. For example, many dimensions o f health
provision-the     prevalence o f children with complete immunization against childhood diseases,
percentage o f women with timely visits from auxiliary nurses and midwives, and percentage o f children
delivered inpublic institutions-have     worsened between 1998-99 and 2002-03. Similarly, both maternal
mortality rates and the under-five mortality have hardly improved. In the area o f elementary education,
there has been an impressive decline in the number o f out-of-school children-from             25 million in the
early 2000s to 13 million by 2005-but        quality issues are now becoming more central. Similarly, the
availability o f infrastructure-power,    water, roads-is     under severe stress and may constrain future
growth. As the problem o f aggregate poverty has gradually retreated, much o f the stubborn disease
burden and rural poverty i s attributable to environmental factors and resource degradation. Demographic
change coupled with rapid growth has fueled increased demands and pressures on life-giving natural
resources-water,    air, soil-that are vital to sustaining development inthe near term.

11. Addressing imbalances across regions, sectors, and households. According to the Bank's India
Development Policy Review (2005), one o f the central challenges facing India i s to extend the benefits o f
rapid growth to more regions, sectors, and people. Nearly three-fifths of India's poor (some 150 million
people) now live in four states: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh. Although these states
are growing at modest rates, they are increasingly lagging the rest o f the country in investment,
manufacturing, and income. At the sectoral level, agriculture employs nearly 60 percent o f the labor
force, but contributes less than 20 percent o f GDP. At the same time, the combined impact o f the
growing rural-urban divide and rising inequality within urban areas has resulted in disparities across
households and people. While HP has low poverty and i s not a lagging state, the primary sector still
contributes almost 70 percent o f employment while accounting for less than a quarter o f GSDP.

12. Incentives for state-level reforms. While efforts to address the fiscal consolidationhave begun to
show impressive results, progress has been less even across states and expenditure efficiency remains a
critical issue.  The problem i s more acute at the state level, since Indian states are responsible for
delivering major services and carrying out important functions in many critical sectors (e.g. education,
health, agriculture, rural roads). Many states suffer from a high debt to Gross State Domestic Product
(GSDP) ratio. This creates a fiscal space issue for critical development expenditure as debt servicing
preempts a large share o f government resources. One o f the policy planks for the Go1 to create fiscal
space for growth enabling expenditure and restore fiscal sustainability has been to accept the
recommendations o f the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) for the period 2005-10. Under the TFC's
terms, almost all major Indian states have passed fiscal responsibility legislation committing themselves


                                                        3

to eliminating their current deficit and reducing fiscal deficit to 3 percent o f GSDP by 2008-09.* Inreturn
the states have receivedan incentive package consisting of: (i)              the restructuring o f GoI's debt to the states
at a lower rate o f interest o f 7.5 percent per annum, and (ii)             write-off o f annual debt repayment to Go1
linkedto staying on track to meet the revenue deficit elimination target set for 2008-09.

13. The implications of TFC for HP. The Go1 guidelines to states for providing access to its `states
debt consolidation and relief facility' (DCRF) requires states to put in place Fiscal Responsibility
Legislation and frame their fiscal correction path.                GoHP has enacted the Himachal Pradesh Fiscal
Responsibility and Budget Management Act (HPFRBMA),2005, and tabled its MediumTerm Fiscal Plan
(MTFP) for the period 2007-08 to 2011-12-providing                       a credible expenditure framework that i s in
compliance with the TFC's requirement o f elimination o f the revenue deficit by 2008-09 and reduction o f
the gross fiscal deficit to 3 percent o f GSDP by that yeare3By enacting the HPFRBMA,2005, GoHP has
received access to the DCRF o f the Go1structured by the TFC.4 Under this, Rs. 8.24 billion o f Go1loans
carrying an interest rate o f 7.5 percent repayable over 20 years were restructured. Consequently, GoHP
will benefit from a reductionininterest expenditure to the extent o f Rs. 1.35 billion over the period 2005-
06 to 2009-10 on outstanding Go1 loans. HP i s also eligible for write-off o f Rs. 0.41 billion in annual
repayment o f Go1loans over 2005-10 ifit stays on its fiscal correctionpath.

14. Other impacts of TFC recommendations. The TFC's recommendations impact HP's finances in
several other ways:

       There i s an increase in tax devolution to the states from 29.5 percent to 30.5 percent o f the net
       proceeds o f all shareable central taxes and duties. HP's share in shareable central taxes and duties
       other than service tax has been fixed at 0.522 percent. This i s lower than the share awarded to HP
       bythe previous EleventhFinance Commission at 0.683 percent. Inservice tax, HP's share has been
       fixed at 0.529 percent as opposed to the earlier 0.692 percent. HP also gets significant grants fkom
       the centre under the TFC in support o f its non-plan revenue deficit. Over the period 2005-06 to
       2009-10, GoHP will receive Rs. 102 billion on this account. This provides significant central
       government support to GoHP's finances.

       The terms o f support from the centre to the states have changed. Based on TFC recommendation,
       Go1now passes on the official development assistance to states on the same terms and conditions as
       it receives them. However, for "special category" states like HP, Go1has recently restored the pre-
       TFC formula o f passing on official development assistance in a grant to loan ratio o f 9O:lO.'                         The
       10 percent which i s a loan will be passed on to the state in accordance with applicable policies o f
       GoI.

       The TFC has provided for a range o f special purpose grants including grants for maintenance of
       roads and public buildings,education, health, and forests, conditional on states maintaining the base
       spending level in real terms. HP i s eligible for special purpose grants in the areas o f roads, public
       buildings, and forests, but has been excluded from education and health because o f a reasonable



  Revenuedeficit is the differencebetweentotal revenuereceiptsand current expenditure.
  See Annex B for details on the MTFP.
  One of the policy planks for the Government of India to accelerate fiscal consolidationat the subnational level has been to put
in place a range of schemes to support reforms at the subnational level. Its Fiscal Reform Facility (FRF) provided additional
funding to states during 2000-05 on the basis of improved fiscal performance. Its debt swap facility for all states operated
between 2002-05 enabled HimachalPradesh to restructure its debt portfolio with lower cost borrowing to the extent of Rs. 35
billion, saving interest expenditure of about Rs. 1.5 billion per annum. The carrying cost of debt therefore declinedfrom 14
percent of the on-budgetdebt stock in2001-02, to 11percent in2005-06 (RE).
  "Special category" states are those havingcharacteristicslike strategic border locations, hilly terrain, inadequateinfrastructure,
largetribal population,andlimited resource bases comparedto developmentneeds. There are eleven"special category" statesin
India.

      profile o f expenditure in health and education. TFC grants in the health and education area favor
      states with a low expenditure profile.

State Backgroundand Context

15. HP has some distinctive characteristics that set it apart from other Indianstates. First, it i s a
relatively young state in the Indian union. The state, currently comprising 12 districts, was granted full
statehoodin 1971. Second, HP i s a small state both interms o f area and population. Of the population o f
about 6.6 million, 90 percent still reside in rural areas. In terms o f area, it ranks seventeenth among
India's states and union territories-and          i s one-sixth the size o f Rajasthan, India's largest state. Third, it
i s geographically different from most Indian states located in the plains. HP i s largely mountainous, but
exhibits extraordinary biological diversity. Except for a few pockets bordering Punjab and Haryana,
altitudes span from 400 meters to almost 7000 meters above sea level. Of the aggregate geographical
area, almost two-third i s officially classified as forests. The hilly terrain and forest cover contribute to
low availability o f land for traditional agriculture, and net sown area i s only about 15 percent o f the total.
The population density in the state-at           around 110 per sq. km.-is        lower than the national figure o f 320
per sq. km., largely due to relatively low and scattered populationinthe hilland forest areas.

16. Opportunities and constraints arising from uniqueness. HP's unique characteristics present
important development opportunities which on the one hand the state can exploit, but which also impose
several constraints on the other. The salubrious climate, abundant water resources, cultural heritage, and
natural touristy ambience can contribute to the expansion o f important sectors like horticulture, tourism,
and hydropower. Simultaneously, HP faces development challenges arising from its high elevation,
topography, and resource dependence-as                well as from a changing and more competitive international
environment. The state's mountainous terrain and remoteness o f much o f the population increase the
difficulties o f infrastructure development, urbanization, market-oriented agriculture, and efficient public
service delivery. Costs o f service delivery and infrastructure construction are relatively high-and
contribute to fiscal pressures for the government. For example, broad estimates by the Bank suggest that
converting a single-lane road to double-lane in the hills costs about twice what it costs inthe plains. The
ability to diversify the economy i s limitedby rugged topography and poor market access, which render
large scale industrializationmore costly and difficult than elsewhere inIndia. HP also confronts common
environmental problems-such              as pollution, soil degradation, and declining forest quality-but           with its
high level o f dependence on natural resources and the fragile Himalayan ecosystem, it is especially
vulnerable to the consequences o f environmental decay. Accordingly, it i s recognized that it may be more
difficult for HP to meet its development challenges on account o f its size and other constraints.
Therefore, Go1 has given HP the status o f a "special category" state in recognition o f these unique
constraints, under which the state receives special central grants and incentives.

17. Contributorsto success. HP has several significant achievements interms o f economic growth and
social development, in spite o f its natural constraints. Supportive government policies, a transparent and
accessible administration, a peaceful political environment, and central support have contributed to the
state's development.          In particular, from a focus on building transport and infrastructure facilities
immediately after its formation in 1971, HP has gradually assigned priority to expenditures in the social
sectors, which has considerably expandedthe availability o fbasic social infrastructure and amenities, and
helped build an educated and healthy population. HP has achieved per capita social sector expenditure
which i s currently about double the all-States average inIndia. The initial infrastructure investments have
also started yielding dividends in terms of higher growth. The state has benefited from wise leadership
throughout the decades o f its existence-and            that, in turn, has been based on strong public support for

Success in a Hill State", prepared by the World Bank (2007). See Section IV (E) for details.

policies that have encouraged social development, and delivery o f public services. Central assistance to
HP as a "special category" state has been important in the process, but primarily because the state has
managed it well to further development.




18. Recent growth and diversification. The state experienced slower growth than the rest o f the
country during the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 1). Over the last decade, however, HP has achieved higher
levels and growth rates in income compared to the average Indian state, and the economy i s showing
increasing signs o f diversification (Figure 1). The secondary and tertiary sectors have expanded more
rapidly than the primary sector-partially           inresponse to tax exemptions and special incentives that have
attracted investment inthese sector^.^ Incontrast, the share o f the primary sector has dwindled from 32.1
percent o f GSDP in 1993-94to 21.4 percent in2005-06--comparable to the Indian average o f about 19.6
percent (Figure 1). Despite its natural constraints, HP currently has a per capita income which i s more
than 8 percent higher than the national average.

19. Differences in sector growth rates. Although HP has grown faster than the rest o f the country
recently, this follows two decades o f slower growth-and                  the state needs to consolidate and sustain this
performance if this i s to become a "steady state equilibrium".                          On one hand, sub-sectors like
manufacturing, communication, and banking have grown particularly rapidly since the 1990s. T h i s i s
partly a result o f special Go1incentives to industry in HP due to its status as a "special category" state.
On the other hand, HP has been unable to tap the full growth potential in sectors like tourism, inwhich it
has significant natural advantages to compete effectively in a global economy.

20. Constraints to industrialization. Manufacturing has grown at over 10 percent annually inrecent
years, partly as a result o f special central industrial incentives noted above. Since the announcement o f
the Special Incentive Package by Go1in 2003, the state has receivedinvestmentproposals o f close to Rs.
200 billion (including new units and expansions o f existing units) with proposed employment o f more
than 280,000 persons. More importantly from a growth perspective, actual investments in the state have
increased by more than 50 percent since 2003-from                   Rs. 31 billion to over Rs.46 billion in September,
2006. However, investments are concentrated in the border districts near Punjab and Haryana-and                              less
in the interior and remote districts, reflecting the natural constraints o f the state's hill geography.
Additionally, the new investment realized in the state i s about 8 percent o f the investments o f Rs. 192
billion that have actually been approved by the state since 2003. The main concern i s that even these new


 Historically, the boost to industrial development came in the early 1980s when a host o f incentives were announced by the
centre and state. The recent major incentives to industries in HP come in the form of GoI's Special Incentive Package o f 2003
and GoHP's New Industrial Policy o f 2004 which provide, among other things, a five-year tax holiday and ten-year excise relief
to existing and new industries (revised to expire in2010), and capital investment subsidies to new industries innotified locations
and to old unitsincase o f substantial expansion. These have elicited an increase ininvestments.

                                                                6

investments may dry up once the sops are phased out in 2010, unless steps are taken to improve the
state's own business environment to encourage the private sector. A rapid survey conducted by the
World Bank also suggests that private sector firms regard inappropriate slulls o f available workers and
lack o froads as key constraints to operating inHP.'

Opportunities for ProductiveEmployment

21. Issues around productivity of employment. An important issue for the state i s to enhance
opportunities for productive employment. Though aggregate unemployment rates in HP are lower than
national averages, at 2.9 percent compared to 7.3 percent, there i s evidence that the productivity o f
employment may be low.' First, despite its declining importance, the primary sector still accounts for
almost 70 percent o f employment, but generates less than 22 percent o f GSDP. Second, the employment
figures conceal underemployment or disguised unemployment. In 1999-00, 6.3 percent of rural and 4.4
percent o f urban workers reported being available for additionalwork. Inaddition, 5.2 percent of workers
reported availability for alternative work, suggesting dissatisfaction with their current employment. There
i s a need to transition workers out o f subsistence agriculture to more productive employment by creating
suitable opportunities in the non-farm sector.               The transition is already happening, with increasing
deployment o f incremental workers in construction, manufacturing, and sectors associated with tourism-
while agriculturaljobs are on the decline."           The pace o f the process, however, needs to be speeded up.

22. Mismatchesin skills, expectations, andlocation. Even while industryrepresentatives cite lack of
slulls as a key constraint to private sector development, unemployment rates in HP tend to rise with
education levels-and          unemployment rates among graduates are about 10 percent. This suggests a
mismatch between the slulls being imparted through the formal education system and those required by
the upcoming industries.             Other than the skills gap, field discussion reveal that there are other
"mismatches" as well. First, there i s a mismatch in location, in that: (i)              many o f the newjobs created in
the developing industrial belt bordering Punjab and Haryana require relatively low level skills, and the
educated youth o f HP are over-qualified for these manualjobs; and (ii) infrastructure facilities and
                                                                                         poor
living conditions inthe industrial belts may be deterring native Himachalis from migrating to these areas
in search of employment, and act as impediments to mobility. Second, there is a mismatch between
industry requirements and workers' expectations, in that industry finds it easier to hire and train
secondary pass-outs, and even use migrants from neighboring states. As a consequence, the demand for
more qualified non-technical graduates and post-graduates being producedby the HP education system i s
limited. Moreover, limited field interviews suggest the educated youth o f HP are more interested injobs
inthe public sector-which            currently employs about 85 percent o f organized sector workers. Given the
limited scope for public sector employment, GoHP recognizes the importance o f generating suitable
private sector job opportunities.

Poverty andHumanDevelopment

23. Superior indicators of humandevelopmentoutcomesand access. HP's performance inreducing
poverty has been highly satisfactory, despite the challenging environment it faces. In 2004-05, HP had
the lowest poverty headcount rate in the country after Punjab, at 11.6 percent, and poverty has declined
much faster in HP since the mid-1990s compared to the rest o f the country (Figure 2). HP's per capita
real consumer expenditure i s almost a thirdhigher than the national average, and it has superior indicators
o f human development outcomes and access than the rest o f the country on most indicators (Figure 2).
Moreover, the state i s on track to achieve-r                    has already achieved-most            o f its Millennium
Development Goals (Table 1). The key issue inthe state i s no longer about access to social services as in

inthe hilly terrain where service delivery costs arehigher,that suffer from insufficientaccess.

24. Vulnerability and inclusion. Even though less than 10 percent o f the population i s classified as
poor, HP faces issues interms o f vulnerability o f the population. Absolute poverty i s not a major issue by
itself-but    this is basedon relatively low estimates ofthe poverty line. However, vulnerability estimates
for the state suggest that the likelihood o f households falling into poverty inthe near future i s higher than
the proportion o f households currently poor-especially            inrural areas. It is estimated that about a fifthof
the population could slip into poverty within the next three years if the state's good economic
performance cannot be maintained."


  Vulnerability is estimatedfrom National Sample Survey 1999-00data. The expected future poverty status of a household is
obtained by comparing the predicted future per capita consumption with the current poverty line, with predictions based on

25. Lower socio-economic gaps than national averages. HP i s one o f the best developed Indian states
in terms of gender equity of social indicators. However, there are some indications of differential
outcomes and access for social, economic, and geographic categories. Indicators generally tend to be
worse for households that are poorer, have less educated members, without regular employment, with
high dependency ratios, and live in remote areas. It is very important to note, however, that socio-
economic differentials are lower in HP than in most other Indian states, and are not always consistently
systematic in any one direction. In some cases, indicators for women in HP are actually better than for
males-like      primary enrollment rates (Figure 3). The state's 28.7 percent Scheduled Castes and Tribes
(SC/ST) population do have weaker indicators than non-tribal groups-but                       are still better than national
averages (Figure 3).

primary and 0.25 secondary schools per 1000 population in India on average, corresponding figures for
HP are 1.81 and 0.34-implying               wider coverage o f educational institutions. Likewise, in health, while a
single Sub Center (SC) and Primary Health Center (PHC) caters to 5085 and 31954 people in India on
average, figures for HP are much lower at 2651 and 12488 people re~pectively.'~However, there are
issues around road connectivity and transport in the hill state. Poor quality o f the state's main arterial
roads i s recognized by the state to be a particularly important issue.

          111. HP'S REFORM PROGRAMAND THE PARTICIPATORYPROCESS

27. Limits to state-led development. HP's recent achievements mask several challenges for the state.
HP's achievements have been largely led by the public sector, influenced by its status as a "special
category" state which entitles it to liberal central government grants and, more recently, industrial
investment incentives. On the one hand, the soft budget constraint from the devolution regime, combined
with farsighted planning, has proved beneficial inmaking HP a leading "special category" state in India
in terms of development performance.                    On the other hand, this resulted in high debt, and, more
importantly, excessive reliance on public-sector-led development. HP's public-sector-led development
has certain limits, and the financial flows from the central government would depend on future Finance
Commission recommendations. The special tax incentives that have promoted industrial growth are also
due to be phased out gradually by 2010. At the same time, past success has raised expectations o f
economic development which could be difficult to fulfill, unless GoHP undertakes reforms and devises
alternate strategies to move the state from being a provider to a facilitator and regulator. HP must take
advantage o fnew opportunities to tackle the state's development challenges.

28. Sustaining success through important transitions. HP realizes that, to a great extent, the state
may be reaching the limits o f its traditional model o f growth and social development: one that i s heavily
dependent on public spending, financed by borrowing and central assistance. The sustainability o f HP's
success for the future will depend on addressing three major transitions that the state faces: (i)                     the growth
strategy in HP must evolve from one that i s still far too heavily dependent on public expenditures and
debt-to     an increasing focus on growth led by the private sector; (ii)productive employment
opportunities must be created for HP's young and increasingly educated labor force, so that reliance on
the public sector for employment opportunities goes down; and (iii)                      the state's environment and natural
resources must be managed well to contribute to effective development in a sustainable manner.
Underlying these transitions is the upfront need to sustain recent improvements in the state's
macroeconomic performance.

29.   Overall state vision and strategy. The state's overall strategy is articulated inits plan documents.
The Approach Paper to HP's Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) presents the overarching objectives o f
the state as faster and sustainable growth, and inclusive development. HP's articulated medium term
development priorities recognize the state's unique challenges and opportunities. The government aims
to achieve an annual growth rate o f 8.5 percent duringthe Eleventh Plan. The state seeks to focus more
on capitalizing on its comparative advantage, by increasing the productivity and economic value o f its
natural assets, and specializing in sectors where it can compete effectively ina globalized economy.

30. Priority areas in the GoHP program.                          The priority areas for the government, given its
development challenges and successes, are: (i)creating fiscal space to fund the state's development
vision; (ii)exploiting the untapped potential in sub-sectors like hydropower and tourism in an
environmentally and economically sustainable manner; and (iii)                        protecting the state's environmental
wealth, and improving the overall institutional approach to environment management. These areas are
supported by measures to improve governance and public administration, and promoting private sector
development for faster growth and productive employment. For the relatively well developed social
sectors, fiscal space will free up room for priority expenditures to promote inclusive development. The
government's efforts and forward looking strategy in the priority areas are described in brief below, and
elaborated inAnnex A inthe LDP.

                 A.     CreatingFiscal Space and Improving PublicFinancial Management

31. Key challenges. The major constraint faced by the state i s creation o f fiscal space to finance the
development vision while moving towards a fiscally sustainable position. About 65 percent o f GoHP's
expenditure has been committedto salaries, pensions, and interest payments inthe last two years-among
the highest inIndian states-squeezing            the fiscal headroom for operations and maintenance (O&M) and
capital expenditure.         GoHP carries debt stock o f about 74 percent o f GSDP (including off budget
borrowing)-and       has the second highest per capita debt inIndia, which strains debt servicing ability.

Recent Developments and FutureTargets under the MediumTerm Fiscal Plan

32. Recent signs of fiscal recovery. GoHP's finances show encouraging signs o f fiscal recovery
(Annex B). Recent measures that have helped to achieve this include: (i)                     increasednon tax revenue from
the sale o f power from royalty andor equity share with the commissioning o f the 1,500 MW Nathpa
Jhakri power project in 2004-05;16 (ii)          higher tax revenue from the introduction o f the Value Added Tax
(VAT) since 2005-06; (iii)expanded central grants under the TFC award in 2005-06; and (iv)
compression o f expenditure from 32 percent o f GSDP in 2002-03 to 28 percent in 2006-07 (RE). These
measures have brought the annual fiscal deficit down from over 12 percent o f GSDP in 2002-03 to about
4 percent in2006-07 (RE). The current deficit has declined from nearly 8 percent o f GSDP in 2002-03 to
0.6 percent in 2006-07 (RE), and a primary deficit has been converted into a primary surplus (Figure 4).
HP's fiscal strategy is aimed at maintaining this adjustment in order to achieve fiscal sustainability, and
create necessary headroom for priority expenditure at the same time.

33. Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. GoHP's fiscal policy i s underpinned by
systemic reforms aimed at improving the quality o f fiscal adjustment.                    The fiscal management i s
institutionalizedby the Himachal Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act o f
2005.     The FRBM commits GoHP to conducting fiscally sustainable policy and annually tabling a
MediumTerm Fiscal Plan (MTFP) that reduces the current deficit by two percentage points of revenue
receipts until revenue balance i s achieved. The FRBM also requires the state to reduce its outstanding
guarantees on long term debt, until it can cap outstanding risk weighted guarantees at eighty percent o f
total revenue receipts.

34. Adjustment under the MTFP. GoHP has prepared an MTFP for 2007-08 that articulates the
government's medium term fiscal objectives and strategic priorities consistent with the FRBM, and sets
clear milestones for five years beginning 2007-08 (Annex B). This MTFPhas been accepted by a Cabinet
Resolution, and will also be shortly tabled before the Legislature. The current MTFP i s consistent with
the FRBM and TFC recommendations, and targets elimination o f GoHP's current deficit in 2008-09 and
reduction in the ratio o f gross fiscal deficit to GSDP from 4.3 percent in 2006-07 to 2.2 percent by 2011-
12 (Figure 5). The share o f debt to GSDP i s targeted to reduce to 47 percent by 2011-12. Going forward,
GoHP will execute its budget to meet the 2007-08 MTFP targets, and prepare the 2008-09 budget in
alignment with the MTFP targets for that year. Inorder to meet the MTFP targets, GoHP has adopted or
proposed several reformmeasures to enhance revenues, control expenditures, and manage debt.

35. Consolidated fiscal deficit.               Based on currently available information-including             financial
information from the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB)-the                  consolidated fiscal deficit
i s expected to decline from 11.1percent o f GSDP in 2006-07 (RE) to 2.1 percent o f GSDP by 2011-12,
on account o f a robust improvement in HPSEB's projected financial position and a steady decline in
GoHP's non-power fiscal deficit. Of the total adjustment o f 9 percent in the consolidated fiscal deficit
over the period, 6.7 percent would be on account o f improvement inHPSEB's finances."

36.    Stress tests of debt trajectory projected under MTFP. Four stress tests were conducted for the
debt trajectory projectedunder the current MTFP preparedby GoHP. Inthe steady state, real interest rate
i s initially assumed at 5.5 percent-stabilizing          to 5 percent from 2008-09 onwards. Real GSDP growth
begins at 8.5 percent, and moves gradually towards a long term growth rate o f 7 percent by 2016. Real
interest rate i s assumed at 5.5 percent until 2008, dropping to 5 percent thereafter. As the reference
scenario, under steady state conditions o f the MTFP, if projected forward to 2020, debt to GSDP ratio
should decrease to about 35 percent. Table 2 below shows the state's likely debt trajectory under
different scenarios o f shocks. First, a shock to GSDP growth o f 2.5 percent in 2010-11 and 2011-12


l7 See Annex B.

                                                                12

could slow the reduction o f debt to GSDP to 37.9 percent by 2020. Second, a decline in central transfers
o f an order o f 5 percent annually from 2010-11 onwards, will raise the 2020 debt to GSDP ratio to 46.1
percent. Third, an interest rate shock o f 3 percentage points in 2010-11 and 2011-12 over the baseline
will have a marginal impact on the 2020 debt stock, increasing it to 38.4 percent o f GSDP. In the
improbable event o f simultaneous materialization o f all three shocks, the projected debt to GSDP ratio
increases over the baseline by nearly 16 percent o f GSDP in 2020-to              51.2 percent compared to the
reference case o f 35 percent. To maintain the original debt trajectory inthe face o f such shocks, the state
would have to generate higher primary surpluses. While these stress tests show hypothetical scenarios,
they do indicate that the state needs to stay on a strong fiscal correction path over the medium term to
achieve its MTFP.

Measuresto EnhanceOwnRevenues

37. Recent tax reform measures. Unlike other Indian states, HP has a small tax base resulting from
low levels o f industrialization, higher dependence on agriculture which i s relatively untaxed, and a small
population. Regardless, however, GoHP has proactively embraced nationally coordinated tax reforms
such as the introduction o f state level Value Added Tax from April 1, 2005, and reduction in stamp duty
on property transactions to 5 percent in line with the requirements under the National Urban Renewal
Mission. These reforms have by and large been successful in most Indian states-with            VAT inparticular
resultingin overall revenue gain o f 14 percent in2005-06 and over 20 present in 2006-07, mainly from
greater compliance and improvement intax administration. Reduction in stamp duty across Indian states
has also seen an increase in properly valued and registered transaction resulting in an increase in stamp
duty revenue of over 20 percent. The state is also unique in having several taxes (including VAT and
state excise) administered by the Excise and Taxation Department-thus           providing a strong nucleus for a
single revenue agency.

38. Tax revenue reforms. To improve tax revenues, GoHP has announced several encouraging
measures in its 2007-08 Budget to raise its own tax revenue from 5.9 percent o f GSDP in 2005-06 to 6.5
percent by 2011-12.         If successful, the state's dependence on central government grant transfers will
decline from 15.2 percent o f GSDP in 2005-06 to 11.8 percent by 2011-12.                    The measures will
correspondingly lead to improvement in own revenue effort from 8.6 percent o f GSDP in 2005-06 to 9.1
percent o f GSDP by 2011-12. Key revenue measures announcedby GoHP are as follows.

9 For the motor vehicle tax regime, GoHP proposes to generate additionalresources of at least Rs. 55
million through: (i)    introducing a higher Motor Vehicles token tax on vehicles older than 15 years; and
(ii) increasing Motor Vehicles token tax rates to target an additional growth o f at least 6 percent inmotor
vehicles tax-take over 2006-07 (RE) from the new tax measures. This has been accepted by the HP
Cabinet on June 11, 2007, through official notification. Additionally, the Transport Department i s to
initiate studies to examine how to improve motor vehicle taxes and fees, including the use o f ad valorem

taxes for all new vehi~1es.I~GoHP has also liberalized the licensing rules for private bus operators,
effective financial year 2007-08, and that should see an increase inpermitand registrationfees, the annual
token tax, and the special roadtax.

9 To plugleakages inthe collectionofluxury tax byhotelowners, the government has approved anew
luxury-tax arrangement based on minimumoccupancy to replace the previous system o f a flat tax o f 10
percent on hotel room rent. To this end, the government has issued a notification dated August 6, 2007,
moving to a luxury-tax arrangement based on 30 percent minimumoccupancy. By this, the government
expects greater tax compliance, and this will also relieve the burden o f maintaining detailed accounts and
undergoingdetailed assessment.

 9 GoHPwill explore the possibility of switchingfrom a specific to an advaloremexciseduty structure
for liquor depending on the experience with a new license fee system to vend liquor based on minimum
guaranteed off-take that i s being put in place from 2007-08. The system, as presently structured, has
specific excise duties on liquor and licensing to vend liquor classified in eight categories, with sub-
categories. GoHP will adopt suitable reform measures in the 2008-09 budget based on the
recommendations from an assessment o fthe excise tax structure on alcohol and licensingregime.

 9 GoHPwill undertake anexternal evaluationof ValueAdded Taximplementation, withaview towards
strengthening VAT administration to maintain tax buoyancy. The introduction o f VAT in 2005 raised
growth in sales tax revenue by 34 percent in 2005-06-but                      i s projected to grow by a slower rate o f 7
percent in 2006-07 (RE). Although VAT i s the main own tax source, gains from this may dry out
following two years o f implementation if its administration i s not strengthened. The yield fkom this tax
has to be raised at least to the national average o f 3.7 percent o f GDP. As a first step, GoHP i s
undertaking computerization o f VAT administration, which i s expected to commence this fiscal year.
Furthermore, GoHP will undertake an external evaluation o f VAT implementation that could include
value chain analysis, VAT assessment, system o f refunds, use o f nationally harmonized definition o f
goods, fraud risk analysis, VAT threshold limit, etc. The results o f the evaluation will be usedto further
strengthenVAT administration.

9 Studies shall also be initiated to explore further areas for increasing tax buoyancies-through
introduction o f new tax measures and the Services Tax that i s likely to be devolved to state governments
by GoI.

9 The stamp duty rate for registration of land sale transactions will be reduced from 8 percent to 5
percent effective in2007-08, so as to check evasion and the undervaluing o f property transactions. GoHP
has already reduced stamp duty in April 2005 to 8 percent from the then prevailing 12 percent. As a
further measure to strengthen administration inthe near future, GoHP will introduce franking machines to
plug leakages in stamp duty revenue. InHP, at present rates, stamp and registration duties amount to a
potential tenth o f property value, higher than in most other states.20 Stamp duty reform i s therefore a
significant measure, and will expectedly result in an increase inregistered property transactions, create a
more active land market, and make the state more attractive for investment.

39. Non-tax revenues from hydropower. Given that HP i s a small state, its tax base i s limited.
Accordingly, non-tax revenue needs to be expanded, with the major source identified as the development


   Non-transport vehicles are subject to one time tax, while transport vehicles are subject to an annual tax. Inaddition, HP levies
a special road tax on transport vehicles. The current level o f the one time tax i s 2 percent on the price o f personal vehicles such
as cars and 1.5-3 percent on the price o f two wheelers. The one time tax i s considerably lower than in other states where it could
range between 6 percent and 8 percent o f the price of the vehicle.        Transport vehicles are charged an annual specific tax
depending on the nature o f the vehicle.
2o In addition to the 8 percent stamp duty, registration fee under the Indian Registration Act, 1908, as applicable to HP, at the rate
o f 2 percent on the value o f consideration, subject to a maximum o f Rs.25, 000 is also levied. Most states levy only 1 percent
registration fee.

                                                                 14

o f state's natural hydropower potential that will help make the state a net exporter o f electricity. GoHP
has taken important steps to increase non-tax revenues-from       the sale o f power obtained as royalty and/or
equity share from hydropower, as mentioned above. The potential o f this sector to generate future
revenues for the state government cannot be over-emphasized. Basic back-of-the-envelope calculations
suggest that revenues from the sale o f royalty power and/or a share o f the power generated proportional to
equity investedby GoHP inhydro projects with other partners-e.g., Go1inthe case o f Satluj Jal Vidyut
Nigam Limited (SJVN), together with dividends, could be more than 37 percent o f HP's current level o f
own revenue receipts and more than double the current level o f own non-tax revenues by 2012-13.

40. Non-tax revenues from user charges. Efforts need to be broad based beyond hydropower
resources to make critical services provided by GoHP self sustaining. However, rationalization o f user
charges i s challenging which makes the pace and magnitude o f revision more difficult, and this has to be
calibrated. There i s scope for raising royalty from user charges, inparticular. A major policy issue inthe
Department of Irrigation and Public Health (IPH) i s a huge gap between funds collected for irrigation and
drinlungwater schemes, and the cost o f operating and maintaining these schemes. This is due to a near-
zero rate o f hnking water charges, coupled with very low charges for both flow irrigation and lift
irrigation4ven after irrigation charges were revised in June 2005. Although the stated policy i s to
revise irrigation and water charges by 10 percent annually, this i s rarely implemented. Presently, user
charges cover less than 2.5 percent o f the O&M charges in IPH. There are instances where user charges
have been subjected to roll-backs based on populist decisions, such as in the health sector.                 An
institutional mechanism that can periodically decide on appropriate user charges i s required.

41. Analysis of user charges. As a first step to improving cost recovery, GoHP proposes that selected
administrative departments shall undertake a review of user charges. This review-especially irrigation,
drinlung water, health, transport, minor minerals royalty-is         being initiated.     Reform measures to
rationalize user charges will be adopted based on the recommendations-to          reduce implicit subsidies and
to improve sustainable financing o f O&M o f public investment. GoHP already charges a "green fee"
from tourists to Manali. It plans to introduce this in other tourist destinations, and use the funds so
collected for environmental conservation activities in ecologically vulnerable tourist areas. As a further
measure to strengthen the links between service provision and cost recovery, GoHP will constitute a
 `Tu@ Committee ' by 2009-10, to regularly determine user charges for various services like transport,
education, health, water, and irrigation, and advise GoHP accordingly.

42.   Beneficiary participation in irrigation and drinking water schemes.                 In order to improve
efficiency and quality, the state i s taking important steps to devolve control (and costs) o f both services to
beneficiary groups. Guidelines have been prepared to transfer total or partial responsibility o f drinking
water schemes to Gram Panchayats.          Similarly for irrigation, IPH has drafted guidelines to transfer
responsibility o f tertiary canals or small schemes to water user groups.           GoHP has begun to pilot
devolution o f irrigation and drinking water schemes to beneficiary groups (ie., water user associations
and Gram Panchayats, respectively)-in         conjunction with training to enhance the capacity o f these user
groups. The proposal to transfer operations o fbelow sector storage tanks and complete rural water supply
schemes was approved on January 17, 2006. Subsequently, GoHP has developed official guidelines for
devolving schemes to beneficiary groups, and these guidelines have been issued to field functionaries for
implementation. Piloting o f this program has begun recently. As o f July 21, 2007, operations o f 17
Irrigation Tubewells and 12 Flow Irrigation Schemes had been transferred to Farmer Development
Societies (Krishak Vikas Sanghs). As o f July 21,2007,771 DrinkmgWater Supply Schemes had been or
are inthe process o f being handed over to Panchayati Raj Institutions-f        the 1011 identified for transfer.
Inaddition, the state has already announced a participatory strategy involving Water User Associations
and Gram Panchayats (GPs) to participate in planning and execution o f irrigation and drinking water
schemes respectively. This could be practiced for all new projects wherein the government provides
technical and one-time financial support to the GPs or beneficiaries to develop their own water resources.

 Measuresto ImproveExpenditureComposition

 43.    Targeted improvements in expenditure composition.                           Simultaneously, the government
 appreciates the need to improve expenditure composition towards capital outlay and critical non-wage
 O&M. As a first step, the MTFPhas committed that GoHP will: (i) share o f salary expenditure to
                                                                                  contain
 total expenditure to 30 percent by 2011-12; (ii)reduce interest expenditure to revenue receipts to 17
 percent by 2011-12; and (iii)    and increase non-wage O&M and capital outlay by at least 4 percentage
 points and 8 percentage points o f total expenditure by 2011-12 (Figure 6). Achievement o f these targets
 will be critically dependent on the reforms implemented.

 44. Measures to create fiscal space and improve expenditure effectiveness. GoHP has announced
 several reform measures in this area. These actions are projected to result in a decline inthe expenditure
 to GSDP ratio from 28.2 percent in 2006-07 (RE) to 26.6 percent in 2009-10 as per the current MTFP o f
 the government.

 45.    High salary bill. HP has one o f highest ratios of government employees (regular and non-regular)
 per 100 o f population, at 3.5-although,        excluding the Education Department which accounts for 35
 percent o f government employees, this ratio i s about 2.3. On one hand, this has helped HP to achieve one
 o f the best indicators o f human development in the country. On the other hand, this has contributed to
 wages and salaries talung up about 35 percent o f state expenditures-which                i s one o f the highest in the
 country. While the total size o f the civil services (excluding PSEs and local bodies) has grown about 30
 percent between 1990 and 2003, work-charged employees have grown 613 percent while part-time
 employees have grown some 212 percent. Regardless o f the reasons behind HP's burgeoning civil
 service, the fact remains that the state can no longer afford the resulting wage and pensionbill, amounting
 to 50 percent o f the state's revenue receipts, thus crowding out much needed capital and non-wage O&M
 expenditures.

 46. Ban on recruitment. As a step towards addressing the salary bill, GoHP has reinforced a ban on
 recruitment (contract, part-time, daily wagers), except with the prior approval o f the Finance Department
 and the Cabinet and such approval to be granted only for functional posts-via                  official instructions on
 expenditure control dated June 13, 2007. Creation o f posts will be allowed only for posts which are
 justified as functional by the respective departments. GoHP will provide baseline data for contract, part-
 time, and daily wage employees as o f March 31every year for monitoring purposes.

 47. MediumTerm ExpenditureFramework. GoHP will expand performance budgeting by initiating
 departmental Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) in a few key departments, such as
 Education, Health, Public Works, and Irrigation and Public Health. GoHP has already issued instructions

                                                             16

dated June 11,2007, to the concerned departments-with                   broad guidelines to prepare MTEFs for 2007-08
to 2011-12 that will result inbetter prioritization o f expenditure.

48. Domestic power subsidy. For 2007-08, this shall be capped at 2006-07 levels. Subsidies and
transfers account for about 7 percent o f total expenditure, up from 5 percent in2003-04. GoHP's subsidy
to the Himachal Pradesh Electricity Board (HPSEB) was Rs. 2.45 billion in 2006-07 (RE)-which                                    is
relatively small in quantum compared to other states.'l               GoHP has reduced the power subsidy to Rs. 1.5
billion for 2007-08.

49. Pension reforms. Pensions are an increasing fiscal burden, having risen from about 8 percent o f
expenditure in 2002-03 to over 9 percent at present. InAugust 2006, the state introduced a Contributory
Pension scheme for new employees joining service after M a y 15, 2003, and it follows the Go1pattern o f
contributions.'*      However, the impact of the new pension scheme will be felt over the longer term, and,
till then, the state will have to contend with pension expenditure under the Defined Benefit scheme for
employees hired prior to M a y 15, 2003. GoHP will create a fund for financing Defined Benefit pension
scheme with an initial corpus o f Rs. 0.5 billion that will be enhanced over time-and                           also undertake
pension liability and cash flow projections with respect to civil service with a view to medium term
reforms.23 Furthermore, the contributory pension scheme will be gradually extended over subsequent
years to cover newly hired pensionable civil servants in Urban Local Bodies, Universities, Public Sector
Enterprises, Statutory Boards, etc.

50. Other measures. Inorder to identify non-merit subsidies for gradual phase out, a Core Group will
also be set up under the chairmanship o f the Chief Secretary. GoHP will also work on developing a
sustainable mediumterm plan for universities and private educational institutions to determine grants-in-
aid. GoHP will develop maintenance plans for fixed assets such as roads, buildings, and equipment for
funding purposes, and link annual funding to the plans. GoHP will set up an institutional mechanism in
the form o f an Expenditure Review Committee to undertake rolling annual reviews to identify
unproductive programs, and rationalize and improve efficiency o f existing programs.

ManagingDebtand Contingent Liabilities

51. Recent measuresto manage debt. GoHP has been classified as a debt stressed state by GoI.'~In
order to better manage its debt, GoHP has actively prepaid, restructured at lower interest rates, and
swapped debt.          Between 2002-03 and 2004-05, GoHP has swapped Rs. 36.41 billion o f debt.
Additionally, the TFC has restructuredRs. 8.24 billion o f Go1loans at a lower interest rate o f 7.5 percent,
repayable over 20 years. The state has already taken an important step by malung it mandatory to report
under the FRBM a Budgetary statement that presents `contingent liabilities arising out o f borrowings by
PSEs and Special Purpose Vehicles and other equivalent instruments where liability for repayment i s on
the state government, all claims and commitments made by the state government having potential
budgetary implications'.

52. MTFPtargets for debt reduction. Over the period 2007-08 to 2011-12, GoHP proposes to replace
Rs. 16.8 billion o f high cost debt with coupon rates o f 10 percent and above. Debt that carries coupon

tariff recommended by the Himachal Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission and the implemented tariff. The scale of the

        employee contributes 10 percent o f Basic Pay and Dearness Allowance towards his pension benefits and the state matches

23 Projections will be initiated for Statutory Boards, Corporations, Universities and Aided Institutions, and Local Bodies and the
D C scheme i s proposed to be extended to cover new pensionable staff inthese agencies.
24 A state is classified as "debt stressed" by Go1if its interest payment to revenue receipt ratio is equal to or greater than 20
percent.

                                                                 17

rates 10 percent and above constituted about 19 percent o f outstanding debt stock at the end o f March 31,
2007. Approximately 45 percent o f the debt will be repaid between 2007-08 and 2011-12.                  GoI's
framework for external borrowing by "special category" states provides for pass through on a basis o f 90
percent as Go1grant and 10 percent as loan. Ineffect, this provision will result in substitution o f debt by
grants o f amounts GoHP would have otherwise borrowed-and               i s equivalent to debt write-off. The
proportion o f debt to GSDP will therefore decline from 74 percent in 2005-06 to 47 percent in 2011-12.
As GoHP's fiscal situation improves, its interest expenditure to revenue receipts ratio will also decrease
from 24 percent in2005-06 to 17percent in2011-12.

53. Fiscal implications of PSEs. HP has 23 Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) that employ close to
50,000 people. More importantly from a resource flow perspective, however, the annual support to PSEs
by way o f direct subsidies is not too high. GoHP has kept annual subsidies to these enterprises at a
relatively low level o f Rs. 0.4 billion in2006-07, down from Rs. 0.48 billion in 2005-06. Much o f this i s
given to Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) on account o f the state's social responsibility o f
providing public transport services on unviable routes. On the other hand, contingent liabilities in the
form o f outstanding guaranteed borrowings by state-owned PSEs i s high-at            about Rs. 35.5 billion or
about 14 percent o f GSDP as on March 31, 2006. The government also carries significant fiscal risks
from the accumulated losses incurred by PSEs. As of March 2006, the total past accumulated losses o f
these enterprises was about Rs. 9 billion or 3.5 percent o f GSDP. The HPSEB and HRTC are the two
largest PSEs, accounting for nearly 80 percent o f the employees and 70 percent o fthe accumulated losses.

54. Proposed short term reforms to lower off budget borrowings and contingent liabilities. The
2007-08 budget has announced that risk-weighted state guarantees for loans will be capped at existing
levels. A Finance Department notification has been issued, dated July 13, 2007, amending the HPFRBM
rules o f 2005, reducing the cap on risk weighted guarantees to 40 percent o f total revenue receipts o f the
preceding year, fiom the existing 80 percent. With proper risk weighting on existing guarantees, GoHP
will meet the guarantee ceiling. GoHP presently reports guarantees on an equal weighted basis-but          will
begin reporting risk-weighted guarantees as required under the FRBMby the next fiscal year. This will
help minimize exposure to loss-making state-owned enterprises and boards, while malung the award of
guarantees strategic in furtherance o f development objectives.           All off budget borrowing will be
eliminated, and the state has already consolidated Rs. 25 billion o f its o f f budget borrowings inits books
by taking over their debt servicing, although this i s not reflected in the Finance Accounts. Over the
medium term, GoHP will also institute a mechanism to evaluate contingent risks on an ongoing basis, and
begin disclosing, budgetingand accounting for these.

55. Proposedmediumtermreforms to lower offbudgetborrowingsand contingentliabilities. The
state will continue reforms inthis area during subsequent years. GoHP tends to finance losses o f PSEs by
restructuring PSE operations and, sometimes, strategic asset sales.             GoHP has generally stopped
supporting loss-making PSEs though state-guaranteed borrowings. Inthe medium term, GoHP will put in
place a set o f formal rules to govern eligibility o f PSEs, cooperatives, and statutory boards for
government guarantee. While these PSEs as o f today are not imposing a huge annual cash subsidy burden
on GoHP, the loans extended to some corporations and guarantees given to others may result in a future
fiscal liability. Over the medium term, GoHP proposes to take a fresh look at PSEs and initiate a reform
strategy, as well as establish a set o f formal rules to govern eligibility for state guarantee by state-owned
enterprises, cooperatives, and statutory boards.

ImprovingPublicFinancialManagement andProcurement

56. Improving budget formulation and execution. Consistent with its commitment to fiscal
transparency and restoration o f fiscal indicators to sustainable levels over the medium term under the
FRBM, GoHP has initiated reforms in the systems and processes o f budget formulation and execution.
While the existing budget system i s functional, reforms are required to achieve the development vision o f


                                                       18

the state and to adapt institutional arrangements to support the fiscal strategy.      The key challenge i s to
ensure that a comprehensive resource framework and a medium term perspective guide the three
objectives o f budget management: (i)      aggregate fiscal discipline in line with the MTFP; (ii)    strategic
policy decisions by GoHP within the constraints o f the MTFP; and (iii)       stimulating the efficient use o f
public funds. GoHP has proposed actions to address each o f these areas. Beginning 2008-09, GoHP will
present a Fiscal Policy Paper to the Council o f Ministers outlining linkages between government policies
and outcomes to get broad agreement over budget contours, and setting department ceilings for
expenditure in a multi-year framework. Along with the MTEFs being initiated in four key departments
and inputs o f the Expenditure Review Committee, line departments are expected to make strategic
choices among different programs-advancing         the government's development objectives. In subsequent
years, GoHP intends to improve budget documentation to provide clearer links between policy priorities
and goals, budget allocations and performance. Measures to strengthen internal and external oversight
and procurement, as detailed below, will stimulate expenditure efficiency over time.

57. Assessment of public financial management. GoHP simultaneously seeks to modernize and
strengthen public financial management and procurement systems to improve the efficiency o f public
spending. A Preliminary Assessment o f the Public Financial Management and Procurement Systems in
HP was undertaken by the Bank as part o f preparation o f the HP Economic Report; this assessment
suggests that the framework for public financial accountability inHP i s generally sound, although inneed
o f modernization in several areas which GoHP must address. Its current strengths include: (i)            timely
approval o f budgets; (ii)  exercise o f transaction level controls over budgeted expenditures; (iii)    regular
and timely preparation and reconciliation o f monthly and annual accounts; (iv) regular external audit, and
timely availability o f reports; and (v) legislative oversight over matters reported in audits through follow
upby the Public Accounts Committee.

58.   Agenda for change. Despite several achievements, some key areas require strengthening for the
state's public financial management system to assist expenditure effectiveness, and support GoHP's
medium term fiscal and governance program-as              denoted by a preliminary assessment o f Public
Financial Management and Procurement. The need for reformi s particularly evident inthe area o fbudget
execution procedures, including weaknesses in internal controls. It i s necessary to complete the ongoing
computerization o f treasury systems, strengthen the internal audit system, and have more effective
legislative oversight and timely follow up on audit observations.           In response to the preliminary
assessment, GoHP has outlined an agenda for further strengthening financial management and
procurement and prioritized the following actions from the year 2007-08 onwards: (i)             modernize the
Himachal Pradesh Financial Rules, 1971, in line with the General Financial Rules (GFR), 2005, o f GoI,
to strengthen internal controls; (ii)reinforce the responsibility and accountability of Heads of Department
(HOD)to ensure more effective utilization of resources and strengthen internal controls; (iii) a     conduct
Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment (PFMA) using the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework with World Bank assistance to review PFM arrangements
including select PSEs; (iv) complete treasury computerization and roll out coverage to the sub-district
level; (v) constitute a working group to work out an internal auditfunction in terms o f scope, coverage,
and focus, with a view to movingtowards a `riskbased' audit approach as opposed to a transactions based
audit approach, and streamline the audit function inUrban Local Bodies (ULBs); and (vi) reduce backlog
o f Utilization Certificates and audit o f ULBs, and (viii) create a database o f serious audit observations, to
be monitored by a highlevel State Audit and Accounts committee.

59. Strengtheningpublic procurement. Public procurement inHP i s governed by Procedures & Rules
for the Purchase o f Stores, which i s an appendix to the Himachal Pradesh Financial Rules. These are
maintained by the Controller o f Stores under the Industry Department, and relate to procurement o f
goods. While the Store Purchase Organization i s the nodal agency for negotiation o f rate contracts, there
i s an increasing effort to decentralize department-specific purchases to the respective departments.
Procurement takes place amidst a large number o f controllers and overseers. Improving oversight o f


                                                       19

procurement involves rationalizing control as well as increasing the ability o f the government and the
private sector to monitor performance. The challenge in H P i s to integrate procurement into a well
defined PFM system.         GoHP proposes to follow such an approach that will focus on integrating
procurement with planning, budgeting, accounting and auditing.             The reform will work towards
instituting a modernprocurement law to guide procurement activities ingovernment and developing an e-
procurement strategy implemented to improve procurement outcomes in the state. Procurement
assessment o f select entities will help identify areas o f focus to improve overall procurement
effectiveness. This will leadto improvedprocurement performance over the medium term.

          B. PromotingKey Sectors for Growth, Employment, and Revenue Mobilization

Tapping Hydropower ResourcesEfficientlyand Sustainably

60. Key challenges. GoHP puts a highpriority onjudicious exploitation o f the unrealized hydropower
potential in an efficient manner. The state has huge untapped hydropower potential on account o f five
perennial rivers, representing about 13 percent o f the total hydropower potential estimated for India. This
assumes particular significance, notjust as a source o f renewable and low carbon "green energy" that can
help alleviate power shortage in India's Northern Electricity Grid, but also as a critical source o f non-tax
revenue for the state as discussed above.       However, to realize this potential, it must be harnessed
sustainably with due regard for the associated impacts. This is particularly important as environmental
resources in the state provide the foundation for its economy. GoHP has started to recognize that one o f
the most challenging dimensions o f sustainable hydropower development i s the management o f the
environmental impacts. It i s now particularly keen to ensure proper implementation o f environmental
management activities, given that the earlier track record o f the state's agencies intimely implementation
o f these activities has not been encouraging.

61. Plans for rapid development of hydropower.               The pace o f exploitation o f the hydropower
potential inthe state has increased over the last few years, with 6545 MW o f the total potential o f about
20,000 MW already harnessed, and another 6500 MW already allocated or under implementation. GoHP
targets development o f 59 percent o f the state's aggregate hydropower potential by 2012. Thus, the
momentum i s expected to increase further as several new planned projects become operational as per
GoHP's own plans. The state, keeping environmental concerns inmind, has recently cancelled 462 h4W
o f projects. Most o f the remaining identified sites/ projects are also already in the process o f award
through a process o f global competition.

62. Institutional structure of the power sector. The Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board
(HPSEB), a public body create.d in 1971 under the Electric Supply Act (1948), continues to have a
monopoly inelectricity transmission, distribution, and supply. Inter-state sales account for over a third o f
HPSEB's total sales, while agriculture accounts for less than one percent.            The state has had an
independent functioning regulatory commission-the           Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Regulatory
Commission (HPERC)-for         the power sector since 2001. Ithas issued five tariff orders to date, the latest
one being in April, 2007. The HPERC has taken a number o f initiatives including establishing an
improved consumer grievance redressal mechanism, enhanced public hearing procedures, and the
introduction o f economically sound tariff-settingprinciples.

63. Importance of development of hydropower resources. GoHP has followed a mixed model o f
development o f the state's hydropower resources through: (i)      the state sector, by HPSEB directly; (ii)
central companies like the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) and NTPC; (iii)               joint
venture (JV)with Go1(Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited or SJVN); and (iv) private sector companies like
the Jay Pee and Bhilwara groups. GoHP i s entitled to earn royalty, in the form o f 12 percent o f power
generated by the project free o f cost, for the use o f its water resources by the hydropower projects. In
addition, incase o fjoint venture, GoHP also has an entitlement o f additional power proportionate to their


                                                     20

equity stake at the regulated tariff that it can either use within the state or sell to other states. The revenue
earned through the sale o f royalty and equity power that has already started flowing in i s expected to
provide significant resources to the state inthe coming years. This highlightsthe importance o f managing
the hydropower development as well as the utilization o f the consequent revenue earned ina well planned
manner for the state's overall development.

64. Futurevision for development of hydropower resources. HP has recently notified a new Power
Policy with special emphasis on accelerating the devel+opment o f the untapped hydropower potential
through both public sector developers as well as private investment. Under the new Power Policy o f
GoHP, the royalty from hydropower projects has been fixed at 12 percent o f power generated by the
project free o f cost for the first 12years o f project operation, 18 percent o fpower generated by the project
free o f cost for the next 18 years, and 30 percent o f power generated by the project free o f cost after 30
years o f project operation. Subsequently, after 40 years o f operation, the project reverts back to the state
free o f cost. The state has also retained the right to take up equity inthe new hydropower projects. GoHP
has recently set up a new generation company, the Himachal Power Corporation (HPC) to undertake
implementation o f hydropower projects in the state. It has been proposed that a number o f new projects
that had been either earlier allocated or are still unallocated be transferred to this new entity." GoHP has
announced that the remaining projects will be allocated on a priority basis.                However, given the
challenges being faced on hydropower development, the pace o f development needs to bejudiciously and
prudently managed with appropriate institutional mechanisms to support the desired outcomes and ensure
that development i s sustainable.

a)    Measures to Promote SustainableDevelopment of Hydropower

65.   Constraints to sustainable developmentof hydropower. It is particularly important that the state
develops its hydropower resources inan environmentally sustainable manner. Injudicious exploitation o f
the state's hydropower resources can pose a threat to the state's natural resources. As the development of
the significant hydropower potential o f HP advances to a mature stage under its planned expansion,
concerns pertaining to optimal planning for the development o f the state's river water resources and the
long-term sustainability o f this development will come to the fore. The project-based approach currently
inuse bythe state (and throughout India) will be inadequateto address these concerns. Withthe entry of
the private sector as well as a number o f relatively new public sector agencies into hydropower
generation, HP i s increasingly experiencing the situation where projects in the same river basin are
assigned to a number o f different public and private operators. This approach to allocating projects could
eventually give rise to controversy or conflict, as the differing owners/operators could have different
priorities for the quantum o f exploitation o f the water resource available to them, and there may be
differing views on the actual use o f the water held by local communities, environmentalists, and other
interest groups. Eventually, as the revenues earned from sale o f power generated from these hydropower
projects become significant, it i s normal to expect the emergence o f competing views on the use o f these
revenues in the context o f the public discourse on the budget. At the same time, HP has a limited track
record in implementation o f hydropower projects on its own through state agencies. The state sector has
only a small share in the hydro capacity currently operational. There have been delays in implementing
projects. Further, the role o f the state's agencies (notably the Forest Department) in planning and
implementation o f the environment management activities-like          Catchment Area Treatment (CAT) plan,
compensatory afforestation, etc.-related         to hydropower projects have been hampered by lack o f
adequate capacity and skills, contributing to sluggish pace o f implementation with a significant portion
remaining unfinished by project commissioning. It i s critical that the state strengthens its institutional
mechanism for preparation, implementation, and monitoring environment management activities, and also
puts inplace appropriate accountability mechanisms to ensure that these activities are completed before
the projects are commissioned (and are then subject to ongoing monitoring)-so                 that HP's precious
naturalresources are managed well.

66. Strengtheninginstitutionsfor sustainable hydropower development. GoHP appreciates that the
development o f hydropower should be in consonance with environmental safeguards, as injudicious
exploitation can pose a threat to the state's natural resources. Implementation o f most o f the environment
management activities falls within the domain o f the state and, HP i s taking several measures to
strengthen its institutional structures for the planning, implementation, and monitoring o f environmental
management activities.        Sustainable harnessing o f hydro-potential will require moving away from
fragmented and piecemeal assessments to a comprehensive and planned evaluation o f opportunities and
risks that take account o f the cumulative and sequential effects o f expansion. In particular, the state i s
designing an accountability mechanism for preparation and implementation o f C A T Plans ina time bound
manner. It should also be recognized that the prioritization o f CAT Plan implementation i s based on the
fact that, from the viewpoint o f different stakeholders, including hydropower developers and the local
communities, accelerated implementation o f the CAT Plan i s critical.

9 As a first step, the statehaspreparedandagreedonimplementingatimeboundAction Plan for? (i)
completion o f priority catchment management activities infour large hydropower projects, with identified
timetable, fundingrequirements, fundingsources for the activities, and implementation and monitoring
responsibilities, inthe short term; and (ii)  preparation and implementation o f river basin level Catchment
Area Treatment (CAT) plans, for sustainable development o f hydropower, for all major river basins,
starting with the Satluj basin, inthe medium to long term. Inthe short term, GoHP has identified four
large hydropower projects-Nathpa-Jhakri,        Baspa, Rampur and K o l Dam-for       which it will facilitate
completion o f the outstanding catchment management activities (Catchment Area Treatment and
Compensatory Afforestation) over the next three years, starting from current financial year. Given the
limited capacity o f the forest department, the state has also decided to outsource implementation o f some
o f the activities (civil works, etc.) under the C A T plan to either the project implementing agency or other
contractors, with the objective o f accelerating their implementation. Inthe medium to long term, the state
has drawn up plans for preparingriver basin level C A T plans for all major river basins, starting with the
Satluj basin. Once the basin-level CAT plans are prepared and ready for implementation, all the
remainingproject-specific plans shall be integrated into them-and,         untilthen, the individual CATplans
will continue to be implemented. All basin-level CAT plans will bebasedon highquality disaggregated
GIs-based baseline data on forest cover and quality, erosion intensity, and silt load. HP also plans to
develop this baseline within a specified time period through utilization o f the services o f the Forest
Department, and engaging consultants as required.

9 Inorder to manage these processes, GoHP, as the stewardofthese significantresources, is lookingto
move beyondthe present planningparadigm based on the individual project to a more holistic approach to
development based on river basin management as a whole, that incorporates the environmental and social
aspects as integral to the process o f development. Inthis respect, GoHP i s undertaking a study for the
Satluj river basin for the optimal and integrated development o f power with consultant support funded by
Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PP1AF)-and            the agreed findings from this study will
form the basis for further policy measures.            The study would demonstrate the methodology for
optimization o f hydro-development in the Satluj basin with the goal o f facilitating coordinated and
sustainable development by private and public sector developers, with due consideration for the
environmental and social impact o f river-basin-wide development. The optimization study will cover
environmental and social implications o f multi-project development, including, but not limited to: (i)
implications for water resource management; (ii)catchment area treatment plans; (iii)potential
cumulative impact on natural forests and other protected areas; (iv) social impacts arising from multiple
projects; and (v) communication and public outreach issues.                 Further, the different hydropower
developers on Satluj River have come together and established a "Forum o f Hydropower Producers o f
Satluj Basin"in order to achieve common goals and objectives for harnessing the hydropower potential o f

the Satluj basin in an eco-friendly manner, and to ensure the development o f the area.27 This positive
development has been recognized by GoHP inits new Power Policy.

9 Inparallel, the state is planningto undertakean assessmentofthe skill and capacity gaps existingin
the different state agencies for undertaking the environmental management activities and will then
prepare a plan for buildingup capacity for implementationand supervision.

67. Determining environmental flows. GoHP recognizes that numerous environmental risks need to
be considered as early as possible for developing sustainable hydropower inthe state. HP i s the only state
in India to adopt a hydropower development policy, which attempts to internalize the environmental
externalities, and provides some guidance for managing the various environmental risks-such                                as
maintaining water quality and in-stream flow, conservation o f aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity,
conserving and providing for water flows for downstream uses including ecological flow requirements,
managing erosion, sedimentation, and catchment degradation, etc. GoHP and the HP Hydropower Policy
recognize the need for additional research and effort to develop specific guidance and implementation
capacity in all these areas in the short to medium term. HP i s also the only state to mandate an in-stream
flow o f a minimumo f 15 percent o f the lean flow o f the rivers, downstream o f any diversion or dam on
any river in the state (including for projects constructed earlier).                 However, there i s scope to better
estimate this flow based on more scientific research and estimation methods. GoHP recognizes this, and
i s aware that scientific studies are required to develop site- or river-specific standards for in-stream flows,
and also that there i s a need to develop capacity to implement and monitor the in-stream flow mandate.
As a step in this direction, GoHP has proposed to conduct a study to determine a methodology for
estimating sitehiver-specific optimal environmental flows-which                i s a technically demanding task.

68. Benefit sharing mechanisms. GoHP recognizes that local communities are the most directly
affected by the development o f hydropower projects-especially through disruption to social and
economic life during the construction phase, and in some cases physical displacement. It i s because of
the disproportional impact on local communities, sometimes including the permanent loss of the use of
the water for other purposes (at specific locations), that benefit-sharing mechanisms have been developed
as a means o f ensuring sustainable and equitable development, and o f amelioratingpotential opposition to
development that could emerge intheir absence. Inits efforts to ensure sustainable, equitable and socially
acceptable development o f the state's rivers under the new Power Policy, HP has put in a provision for
developers to set aside 1.5 percent o f the project cost towards local development under a Local Area
Development Committee (LDAC). Inaddition, there are other alternatives that the state can consider for
benefit sharing,28 and different models that GoHP could consider to help build local communities' and
local administration agencies' capacity to manage revenue streams and decide on development priorities.
As a step towards better benefit sharing, a strategy study, described below, will include suggestions on
developing suitable mechanisms for local communities to ensure sustainable and equitable development.

b)     Measures to Promote Efficient Development of Hydropower

69. Possible risks in developing hydropower through the Himachal Power Corporation. As
described above, HP has been following a mixed model o f development o f the hydropower resources.
Recently, however, following the establishment o f the Himachal Power Corporation, it has been proposed
that a number o f new projects that had been either earlier allocated or are still unallocated be transferred
to this new entity for development. This new approach can have significant challenges for the state, and it
would be worthwhile for GoHP, strategically, to evaluate the risks and benefits involved in following this
model, in comparison with the corresponding risks and benefits from the alternative models. These

include: (i)  possible crowding out o f funding for priority sectors with the state's resources committed for
contribution to equity or raising debt for development o f the new hydropower projects; (ii)                  inadequate
resources and capacity for implementing the new projects, thereby affecting the pace o f hydro
development; and (iii)     the possibility offiscal strain in the event o f need for GoHP to bear the off-take
andpricingrisk for the power generated from these projects, especially considering the very competitive
tariffs projectedfrom the proposedcoal-based ultra mega power projects.

70. Improving state's hydropower planning and management capacity. In response to these
challenges, GoHP i s planning to undertake a strategy study for: (i)         developing a framework for the state
for building hydropower projects (through state / central / private / JV route, or a combination) and for
optimizing the revenues on account o f royalty / equity power from these projects to the state, while
minimizing investment needs and risk; (ii)       suggesting a framework for utilization o f part o f the revenues,
accruing to state from the hydropower projects, for accelerating and sustainable, equitable, and socially
acceptable development o f the state's hydropower resources; and (iii)             suggesting alternative ways for
benefit sharing with the communities. Recommendations from this study will be discussed and, once
agreed, implemented during subsequent years.              GoHP i s also planning to enhance their regulatory
capacity to ensure that any new hydropower projects get built as per good practice standards o f
construction, and that aspects like dam safety, underground works stability, floods management etc. are
appropriately addressed by all developers.

71. Issues around the efficiency of HPSEB. HPSEB, which had been suffering financial losses until
FY06, has now started to show a cash surplus-driven mainly by the significant increase inrevenue from
inter-state sales (Figure 7). The Board still needs to improve internal systems and efficiencies, especially
focusing on addressing the challenges arising from: (i)         high`interest payments on HPSEB's outstanding
debt o f Rs. 26.35 billion in 2005-06, with annual debt servicing o f Rs 4.69 billion, or 26 percent o f total
revenue;" (ii)   transmission and distribution losses o f around 23 percent in 2004-05, which, though low
compared to some other states, could be reduced further; and (iii)           an employeeikwh-sold ratio which i s
among the highest in India, implyingpossible over-staffing (Figure 7). Inaddition, central to the reform
o f the institutional structure o f the power sector in HP i s the need to comply with the Electricity Act
(2003) to improve the effectiveness o f HPSEB and to upgrade the humanresource capacity that lies at the
heart o f the sector's institutions. Under the Electricity Act (2003), states were to restructure their state
electricity boards by segregating the transmission function from the power trading function. GoHP i s yet
to decide on an appropriate model for HPSEBa3'

72. Implementing the Electricity Act of 2003. HPSEB has initiated the process o f separating its
accounts into the three segments o f the power supply chain (generation, transmission, and distribution).

While implementingthe requirements o f the Electricity Act (2003), including on the restructuring, the
state can benefit from the experience of similar states that have already implemented or are implementing
the provisions o f the Act. HPSEB currently has staff strength o f slightly more than 26,000, but the large
work force notwithstanding, it faces an acute shortage o f the professional and technical skills. It will be
critical for GoHP to ensure that the sector management i s focused on inductingprofessional and technical
s h l l s to keep up with this rapidly evolving business environment.                        GoHPBPSEB will provide
implementation plan for enhancing the effectiveness o f operations o f HPSEB under the Electricity Act
2003-and      begin implementation o f the plan this fiscal year.




73. Key challenges. Despite the state's geographical and environmental advantages that should make it
an attractive tourist destination, the tourism sector has been growing at an annual rate o f 6.4 percent since
1993-94, which i s marginally lower than aggregate GSDP growth rate o f 6.7 percent for the state. The
sector faces several constraints inthe nature o f poor connectivity inthe form o f underdevelopedroads and
small airports unsuitedto major commercial airlines, inadequate facilities for high end tourists, slow place
o f implementation o f new projects even compared to other hill states, lack o f inter-departmental
coordination to develop the sectors, and generally low participation o f the private sector in the high end
tourist market.       HP i s one o f the few Indian states receiving tourists per year greater than its total
population o f 6 million-but              intake i s confined largely to low-end and domestic tourism, while foreign
tourists account for only 3.1 percent o f annual intake. This i s better than the national average o f 2.3
percent foreign tourists in 2004, but states like Kerala have achieved higher shares o f foreign tourists like
5.6 percent. The trade, hotels, and restaurants sub-sector related to tourism contributes about 8.5 percent
o f GSDP at present. On a per-arrival basis, this contribution works out to be lower inHP than nationally
and in states which have worked on developing their tourism potential (Figure 8).

tourism receipts and total arrivals.

74. Importance of the sector. GoHP specifically recognizes that tourism i s a sector that can prove vital
for the state's long term growth and employment-largely                   on account o f tourism being a labor intensive
sector where HP has immense potential on account of its environmental, climatic, and natural heritage.
The sector also has the potential to absorb educated workers. Planning Commission estimates show that


                                                                   25

an investment o f Rs. 10 lakh intourism creates 47 jobs-thus       making the sector particularly important in
the context o fHP's stated objective o f creating productive work opportunities for educated workers.

75.   Current vision for the sector. GoHP's stated objective i s to develop the state's tourism sector as a
prime engine of economic growth, and to position itself as a major global destination by 2020. The state
has a Tourism Policy in place, framed in 2005. The target i s to increase the contribution o f tourism to
GSDP to 15 percent by 2020. This Policy has some good thinking and the right statements o f intent. It
focuses on developing better intersectoral coordination, upgrading infrastructure facilities, marketing HP
effectively as an attractive tourist destination, investing in training for tourism services, and promoting
activity-based tourism. In particular, the Policy recognizes the need to promote the private sector, and
strengthen tourism in an environmentally sustainable manner. However, the Policy needs to be updated.
It is also not on schedule in terms o f implementationtargets defined inthe Policy. The Policy needs to
more clearly define financial targets, achievement targets, and modes o f financing in order for it to be
effective as an implementation guide for all stakeholders. In spite o f GoHP's stated commitment to
tourism development, an inter-departmental consensus on its importance also needs to be strengthened.
Accordingly, GoHP proposes to update the Tourism Policy, and would include, inter alia, a detailed value
chain analysis o f the sector to identify policy problems in private participation in tourism, and a time-
bound Action Plan and implementationresponsibilities, to make it more actionable and effective.

76. Tourism Development Board. A multi-departmental HP Tourism Development Board (HPTDB)
has been set up under the chairmanship o f the Chief Minister, to promote the sector-and                 it was
operationalized in 2005 with a view to minimizing bureaucratic hurdles in tourism development. The
HPTDB i s supposed to formulate policy guidelines for tourism development, and advise GoHP on matters
relating to regulation and licensing. The Tourism Policy recognizes that tourism development in HP i s
under-funded relative to other states, but better coordination and integrationamong departments including
Public Works, Transport, Irrigation and Public Health, Power, Forests, Environment, Urban
Development, and Town and Country Planning-which              can contribute to better infrastructure and civic
amenities-will      help development. The state hopes to achieve this through the HPTDB, which has
representation from various line departments. At the same time, in order to develop and implement this
vision, the institutional mechanism-including        inter-departmental coordination-has       to be improved.
The HPTDB i s an apex body that could take the institutional lead-but                 it must be activated in a
meaningful way, with clear mandates and regularized meetings. It must lead in facilitating a political
consensus amongst all constituencies about the importance o f tourism, and clearly communicate to all the
stakeholders that tourism i s a priority sector. The Executive Body o f the HPTDB has almost 100
members, which makes it unwieldy. The organization, composition, and mandate o f the HPTDB will be
evaluated, and changes introduced if required and as appropriate. GoHP also proposes to involve and
consult with civil society groups in developing tourism-especially in its plan to certify and classify
tourist facilities, and organize specialized tourist events like annual fairs, etc., inthe medium term.

77. Regulation and clearances. Inorder to minimize bureaucratic delays for the private sector, GoHP
has introduced single window clearance for tourism projects. However, the system has to be made more
efficient to attract more investment. The HP RegistrationTourist Trade Act was passed in 2002, in order
to allow for chechng and inspecting hotels and travel agencies against over-charging or substandard
services. GoHP also plans to promote tourism through strengthening the capacity o f Hotel Associations
to conduct inspections, classifying tourist units by facilities provided to ensure value for money to
tourists, and strengthening Tourist Police by training 500 police and home guards in tourism-related
matters like safety for tourists.

78. Recent measures to improving air connectivity. The airports at Shimla, Dharamshala, Pathankot,
and Kulluare not well-connected to other Indian cities, and can only take ATR 42 aircraft. There are 56
helipads in the state, but they are not used for regular commercial services. Moreover, travel time from
Delhi to Singapore or Bangkok i s half o f that required to reach Shimla by surface transport. In order to


                                                       26

 overcome this constraint, the government i s loolung to improve air connectivity. The Airlines Authority
 o f India has opened the expanded runway and new terminal o f Kangra Airport at Dharamshala, and Air
 Deccan (a major domestic airline) has operated its first flight in April, 2007. A proposal to develop
 Bhuntar airport i s pending with the Ministry o f Civil Aviation and Airports Authority o f India. The
 runway o f the Kullu Airport i s to be expanded by building a bridge on a river near the terminal, and
 connecting it to the runway. An airport i s planned at Mandi. Since expansion o f airports are a medium
 term option requiring financial resources, encouraging regular helicopter and chartered flights-
 especially in conjunction with major private hotel chains-are               also part o f GoHP's plan to improve
 accessibility.     A proposal for helipads and helicopter services has been developed, and is currently
 awaiting clearance from the Ministry o f Finance.

 79. Promoting the private sector. Inorder to directly encourage the private sector, GoHP i s directly
 inviting private parties to establish facilities in the state. GoHP has already tendered for expressions o f
 interest for the development o f seven properties, broadly suggesting usage-like                    golf courses, health
 facilities, hotels, etc-in     conformity with GoHP's priorities. Shortlisting i s inprocess, and bids are likely
 to be approved this calendar year. GoHP i s also planning to involve the private sector inthe construction
 o f three ropeways: Dharamshala-Triund, Manali-Rohtag-Solan, and Kullu-Bijli Mahadev.                          The bid
 process for this will be initiated shortly. Over the medium term, the state plans to upgrade Kangra and
 Bhuntar airports to allow for larger aircraft, as well as develop helipads and helicopter connectivity.

      C. Promotingthe InstitutionalFrameworkfor Environmentally Sustainable Development

 80. Key challenges. HP's rich and varied natural heritage presents both opportunities and challenges to
 its development strategy. Natural resources are a critical, if underutilized, engine for accelerating growth
 and poverty reduction. HP's key growth and revenue drivers inthe medium term are critically dependent
 on the state's natural resource base. At the same time, resource dependence renders the economy highly
 vulnerable to the consequences o f environmental degradation-and                recent environmental developments
 have been worrying (Figure 9). While some environmental degradation inevitably accompanies growth,
 inaction or failure to balance the environmental costs o f development with the benefits will have
 particularly serious consequences for the state-whose              opportunities lie in sectors like horticulture,
 tourism, and hydropower which depend on the environment. Given HP's unique geographic situation and
 small resource base, protectingrichnaturalresources assume greater importance than inother states.

 81. Commendable new initiatives. HP has introduced several measures to address the growing threats
 to its fragile ecology, although there remain issues around implementation. These initiatives include: (i)
 broadening the State Pollution Control Board's (SPCB) regulatory role to include environmental auditing,
 micro/macro level environmental planningby which zoning atlases have been completed for five districts,
 the preparation o f district level industrial siting guidelines, and industrial estate planning studies;              31




 31The five districts are Shimla, Kullu, Kangra, Kinnaur and Chamba

                                                               27

(ii)establishment of a Special Area Development Authority to implement the approved notified
development plans; (iii)     implementation o f a ban on polythene bags o f certain dimensions with effect
from June, 2004; and (iv) segregation o f non-biodegradable waste.32

82. Fragmented approach to environment management.                         Environmental management i s an
interdisciplinaryfield requiring cross-sectoral decisions and coordination for effective management, inthe
absence o f which most development activities can induce significant and irreversible changes with
adverse environment implications. However, the current approach to environmental management in HP
i s fragmented and it i s treated as a "clearance" requirement to be obtained from, for example, the Forest
Department or the State Pollution Control Board.             There are also examples o f inter-departmental
disagreements in HP on environment-related issues. Problems tend to be addressed retrospectively only
when they become highly visible. There i s no mechanism for facilitating cross sectoral coordination, and
so there are high risks that decisions taken in one sector (e.g. industry location) may compromise the
economic potential o f other activities (e.g. tourism). Current development patterns raise concerns about
the efficiency, competitiveness, and sustainability o f resource use-especially given the fragility o f the
state's resources. Prudent economic management calls for environmental issues to be fully integrated into
economic policy and mainstreamed in various sectoral activities-especially in sectors where activities
can have significant impacts on the eco-system.

83. Improvinginstitutions to manageenvironmental assets. The state recognizes the need to sustain
its environmental resources-beginning          with a move from the current fragmented approach to
environment management to an institutionalized system. Such an approach will facilitate better inter-
departmental coordination to ensure convergence o f environmental objectives, minimization o f
intersectoral conflicts, and better integration o f environmental goals into planning. Particular attention i s
proposed inthe Eleventh Plan to the maintenance o f quality forest cover, even while promoting access o f
rural communities to this important livelihoods resource.                 GoHP i s committed to improving
environmental management.

84. Establishmentof an Environment Department. Even in a state like HP, whose growth potential
i s critically linked to the environment, there i s no strong or well-established Environment Department.
The Environment Department i s at a very nascent stage o f establishment, till recently housed as a small,
one-member wing within the Science and Technology Department, and not geared to influence
development decisions from an environmental perspective. Recognizing the importance o f environment,
GoHP, in its Budget announcement, has proposed to form a Department o f Environment and Pollution
Control, as per terms o f reference issued by the Ministry o f Environment o f Forestry in GoI.                  A
comprehensive Government Order (GO) has already been notified by GoHP on April 13,2007, providing
details for the formation o f the department itself, its staff and equipment composition, and functions for
each o f the subset departments: Science and Technology, Biotechnology, and Environment and Pollution
Control.      This department will help promote inter-departmental coordination to ensure convergence o f
environmental objectives and minimize intersectoral conflicts, and help to capitalize on the state's
comparative advantages and use environmental resources as growth drivers.

85. Capacity building, skills assessment,research,and development. An urgent needhas been noted
for conducting a capacity assessment for the new Department o f Environment and Pollution Control. The
assessment would review staffing / skill mix, equipment, knowledge and resource requirements, as well
as identify functions to be performed by the Department and those to be outsourced. It has been further
emphasized by GoHP that the state's extremely fragile Himalayan eco-systems warrant a strong capacity
for research and development inpriority areas such as adaptation strategies for glacial melts due to global
warming; preservation o f pasture lands and wetlands (Ramsar sites); river basin issues impacting
environment flows, aquatic life and impacts on livelihoods. Recommendations o f the assessment / study

Technology & Environment, Sponsoredby the MoEF.

would be implemented as a priority. In the context o f GoHP's specific needs of balancing green cover
and maintaining the "health" o f forests, the need for further research in the area has been recognized by
GoHP. GoHP will work on preparation o f guidelines to strengthen the Compensatory Afforestation
programs usingscientific criteria (e.g. biodiversity offsets, restoration biology).

86. Developing an EnvironmentMaster Plan. The government i s committed to strengthening better
environmental planning and management inthe state. With a long term perspective, GoHP has indicated
its intention to prepare an Environment Master Plan for the state to foster inter-departmental coordination
and include environmental considerations as key planning tools.              The Master Plan will support
development goals, providing a holistic view o f the growth-generating potential o f natural resources, as
well as their limits and carrying capacity. As a first step, a time bound Terms o f Reference (TOR) for the
Master Plan has been prepared by GoHP.~~The TOR include an operational mechanism for the
Environment Master Plan, identifying execution, accountability, monitoring, and enforcement procedures,
and roles for other departments such as Transport, Forestry, Tourism, Hydropower, Industry, Urban
Development, Town and Country Planning, and Public Works-to             be coordinated by the Environment
Department. The components o f the Environment Master Plan would include detailed resource inventory
covering all environment parameters; trend analysis o f environment degradation; vulnerability assessment
to establish zones; and appropriate development criteria to guide development and optimize resource
utilization. The activity will be outsourced, under GoHP supervision. Once prepared, its implementation
would be piloted, beginning with fragile areas and gradually scaling up to state level.

87. Public participationin environment decision making. GoHP i s keen to strengthen community
involvement mechanisms, to enhance environment performance, accountability, and improve regulatory
compliance. Since GoHP has already established Local Area Development Committees ineach district, it
has been agreed that three pilot "community environment monitoring mechanisms" would be initiated
through these Committees in the near term.         In addition, grievance redressal mechanisms will be
established by project proponents to increase their environment responsibility andpublic accountability.

88. Improvingmuck and debris disposal. GoHP recognizes that it i s important to prevent muck and
eroded material (resulting from construction work, especially roads) from being indiscriminately
deposited on the hill slopes-damaging forests and ultimately adding to the silt load. Instead, all muck
and debris generated from construction works should be disposed at the designated sites-which        mustbe
protected against breach or erosion, and used for productivepurposes (such as village grounds, real estate,
parlung spaces, gardens, etc.) after disposal i s complete at a particular site. As a first step, the Urban
Development Department (UDD) will identify and assess feasibility (including environmental and social
impact assessments) of muck disposal sites within urban areas and in the urban fringes. The Public
Works Department (PWD) will similarly identify suitable disposal sites all along roads in a phased
manner-starting    with national and state highways, major district, other district roads, and village roads.
The Forest Department will assess and clear these sites for muck disposal. The identified sites will be
notified, and protection works for these sites will be implemented using rural employment guarantee or
other similar schemes in subsequent years. The procedures/mechanisms developed under HP States
Roads Project can be an example that GoHP could follow for similar works.

                      D. StrengtheningGovernanceandPublicAdministration

89. Key challenges. HP has many achievements to its credit: rapid improvements in human
development indicators over time, a tradition o f openness in government, and relatively low levels of
corruption. The Transparency International indicators identify HP as the second least corrupt state in
India. Yet, there i s room to improve transparency and accountability, especially in issues relating to



33See Annex D.

                                                     29

recruitment and transfers. Developing a coherent strategy to address these challenges i s an important
element insustaining the state's positive past recordinhuman development.

AddressingStaffingIssues

90. Functionalreorganization. GoHP has issued instructions dated June 7, 2007, to all departments
and Public Sector Units, to furnish data to the Department o f Economics and Statistics identifying posts
which are vacant, surplus, and vacant and surplus. Posts vacant for more than three years are to be
recorded as well. This exercise i s expected to be completed by September, 2007, as per the official
instructions.    This information will help functional reorganization in subsequent years.                 A
manpower/functional review in five departments-Public         Works, Irrigation and Public Health, Forests,
Health, and Education-will     also be undertaken. Based on the recommendations o f said review, GoHP
will prepare a time bound Action Plan to improve the organizational structure o f the departments, and
implement it.

91.   Outsourcing in major departments. The Education Department has filled some 4,065 vacant
positions, with teachers appointed on contract at a lower rate o f remuneration, by Parent-Teacher
Associations (PTAs). Although the proportion o f such appointments i s relatively small compared to the
large number o f teachers in the state (about 75,000), the role o f PTAs i s significant because it enhances
teacher accountability, reduces the need to transfer teachers as PTA appointments are school-based and
thus non-transferable, and heightens PTA involvement in school management generally. Urban Local
Bodies (ULB) have started outsourcing the collection and transportation o f solid waste-Shimla           has
asked an NGO, Center for Development Communications (CDC), to take over collection and
transportation in two wards out o f 25, and plans to extend this pilot to other wards over time. The
Department o f Irrigation and Public Health (IPH) has recently asked a private party to handle a large rural
drinlung water supply scheme in Hamirpur covering 214 habitations with a combined population size o f
almost 100,000. All O&M o f this lift scheme has been handed over to the private construction contractor
for five years, talung pressure off the department.

ImprovingAdministrativeEfficiency

92. Recent reforms to improve administrative efficiency. Important steps have been taken to
improve the recruitment process-the      Subordinate Selection Services Board, for example, can no longer
destroy records after three months, as was the practice in the past, and the Board i s beginning to use
Information Technology (IT) to enhance transparency o f functioning.             Secretariat reform in file
movement i s a priority, and GoHP has introduced a computerized file monitoring systemin2004.

93.   Simplifyingfile management. Improving administrative efficiency throughbetter file management
i s a goal for GoHP. While GoHP has introduced a computerized file monitoring system in 2004, few
Secretaries and their officers are actually using the system to reduce delays and cut pendency. Section
officers inparticular are not well trained inthe use o f computers. The use o f the single-file system across
government i s limited, with only Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, Vigilance, Planning, and
Economics and Statistics being the directorates where it has been introduced. GoHP will focus on the use
o f change management tools to better equip staff for the wider use o f e-governance inthe Secretariat.

94. Key measureson file management. GoHP has agreed that the single-file system will be extended
to at least five Directorates under the operation-Labor    and Employment, Transport, Tourism and Civil
Aviation, Information and Public Relations, and Social Justice and Empowerment-in             addition to the
ones already on the system. A notification dated August 17, 2007, has been issued to this effect. GoHP
has also expanded use o f REFNIC-which          i s a file traclung software-by     departments for all file
management and traclung functions in Secretariat. An administrative order has been issued dated June 1,
2007, outlining time bound expansion o f the implementation o f REFNIC in the Secretariat so as to reach


                                                     30

100 percent usage by October, 2007. Data as o f mid-July shows that expansion i s actually proceeding
faster than given inthe order.

95. Improving stability of tenure. Transfers are an important issue, and GoHP supports enhancing
tenurial stability. The average tenure (in their current posts) o f Principal Secretaries and Secretaries in
HPis currently a mere 14months; tenures for Deputy Commissioners are marginally better, at 17 months,
but still well below the two-to-three year minimumtenure set by HP's transfer policy.34 Giventhe high
turnover among senior staff, GoHP i s seeking to improve the tenure and stability o f civil servants to
promote effective implementationo f programmes by enforcing the tenure o f a minimumo f three years for
some positions and two years in others, consistent with HP's transfer policy, while discouraging
politicization o f transfers and recruitment.

96. Committee on MinimumTenures. GoHP has issued an official notification dated June 15, 2007,
setting up a state committee to review minimum tenures o f Indian Administrative Service (IAS)
officers4haired by the state Chief Secretary. This committee will exercise the functions outlined in a
Go1notification issued by the Department o f Personnel and Training, which amended the I A S (Cadre)
Rules on August 24, 2006.35 All I A S transfers that fall below the prescribed minimumtenure for the post
(three years insome cases and two years inothers) will be subject to review by the committee.

97.   Capping transfers. A yearly cap on transfers o f three percent o f actual worlung strength of
departments will be implemented, and an official notification capping transfers by cadre has recently been
issued, dated June 11, 2007. Monitoring data will be collected by the Department o f Personnel-as                          per
official instructions dated July 7, 2007, to all departments, to provide data on transfers on a bi-annual
basis. It was agreed that: (i)     GoHP will monitor average minimumtenure by post for the IAS, as per Go1
norms; (ii)  monitoring o f departmental cadres will be based on cadre strength; (iii)               promotional transfers,
transfers to newly created departments, and transfers on account o f a post being declared surplus would
be excluded; and (iv) the figures would be published on the Department o f Personnel's website. This
monitoring system will be publicly available through the internet.

ImprovingTransparencyandAccountability

98. Recent reforms. HP i s one o f the few states in India to have enacted legislation to address
corruption in public service delivery providing jail terms and fines for officials and non-officials for a
series o f offenses such as corruption inthe award and execution o f contracts, including contract splitting;
manipulating muster rolls or measurement books; supplying sub-standard goods to government;
adulterating medicines or manipulating their purchase; charging illegal fees; lending to fictitious persons;
maintaining false records; and absenting oneself from public duty. The Right to Information (RTI) Act
was passed in 2005.          Under the RTI, GoHP has strengthened the office o f the State Information
Commissioner. All state Departments are being encouragedto post all the required information under the
RTI Act on their respective websites, so that the common citizen can access all relevant information
pertaining to departmental schemes. HP has an independent Ombudsman (Lok Ayukta) inplace, with the
power to investigate allegations o f corruption relating to public servants (including politicians and
ministers).     There are significant e-governance initiatives under way, including land records
computerization, and the Information Technology Department currently handles over forty projects.

99. Aggressive implementation of the Right to InformationAct. Usage o f the RTI has generally
been low, and there i s room for improvement. Under the RTI, GoHP has strengthened the office o f the
State Information Commissioner. All state departments are being encouraged to post all the required
information under the RTI Act on their respective websites, so that the common citizen can access all


34A senior IAS officer inHP is likely to enjoy about the same truncated tenure as one inPunjab or Jharkhand.
35GoHP has already issued such a GO inthe case o f the Police Department, specifying in detail the functions as envisaged in the
IndianPolice Service (Cadre) Amendment Rules, 2006.

                                                               31

relevant information pertaining to departmental schemes. The process will be initiated by proactive suo-
motu disclosure o f information to be carried out in at least five major Departments with a large public
interface, which will be identifiedby GoHP. This will be duly scaled upto other departments.

100. Stepping up e-governance initiatives. E-governance has enormous potential in HP as a tool for
simplifyingtransactions and m a l n g it easier for citizens to access government services. GoHP plans to
implement land records computerization in 88 tehsils and integrated service center kiosks in all tehsils in
Shimla District, starting with at least seven services. This will be scaled up to other districts during
subsequent years, along with business process re-engineering initiatives as necessary.

         E. Improvingthe GeneralBusinessEnvironmentfor PrivateSector Participation

101. Key challenges. GoHP seeks to provide an enabling framework that promotes the private sector.
Better infrastructure and relevant slulls development (as indicated by the business climate survey) for the
workforce can reduce constraints to private sector participation, and, help reduce pressure on the public
sector for employment opportunities-which        could lead to a virtuous cycle in terms o f freeing up
additional fiscal resources for productive use.      Accordingly, the Plan places priority on developing
connectivity in the state, and improving the quality o f its main and arterial roads.     A vital thrust of
GoHP's program i s to tackle the problem o f skills mismatches-through       support to sectors which can
generate productive employment and by grooming educated youth with market-oriented slulls requiredto
enhance employability.

102. Addressingthe skills mismatch. The state i s workmg on revamping the education system with an
eye on employability. Two o f the key issues inthis employment process have been recognized as English
language skills and computer literacy.      To enhance computer literacy, GoHP has reduced fees for
underprivilegedsections o f society, and the Information Technology Department i s strivingto ensure that
within the next financial year, all Universities and Government colleges will be equipped with suitable
computer laboratories which will have internet connectivity. GoHP has already introduced Englishfrom
Class One inthe government primary schools. A special task force shall be set up to prepare a road-map
for the use o f English as a medium o f instruction in government schools, which will comprise reputed
educationists. Furthermore, GoHP i s seekingpublic private cooperation inthe planning and operations o f
technicalhocational education in the state. GoHP has implementedthe IndustryManagement Committee
(IMC) concept at the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) with private participation.        The Private
Universities Act was passed in2006 to allow establishment and regulation o f higher education institutions
in the private sector. GoHP is loolung for private sector partners who can use the state's existing
educational facilities to conduct technical and vocational courses that can improve employability o f the
youth-with    the private party to guarantee some minimumpercentage o f placements for students who
take the offered courses. Such innovative measures can reduce the burden on the government, and help
improve marketability and employability o f educated youth.

103. Removinginfrastructuralconstraints. Simultaneously, the state i s seeking to step up efforts to
alleviate infrastructural constraints, especially in rural areas and around the upcoming industrial
agglomerations. Improved connectivity could help attract the private sector to remote districts. Since
most secondary and tertiary sector industries tend to come up in an urban environment, promoting the
development o f urban infrastructure can also help to improve the business climate.     GoHP has recently
set up a development authority for the emerging BaddiBarotiwala-Nalagarh industrial area to draw up a
master plan for the planned development o f the area. Similar agencies are being planned for other fast
developing industrial areas as well. Shimla has been selected for financing under GoI's Jawaharlal Nehru
Urban Renewal Mission, and a Memorandum o f Agreement has been signed with GoI. GoHP has also
launched its own scheme for urban renewalwith an initial corpus of Rs. 0.3 billion.




                                                      32

104. Upgradation and expansion of roads networks. The state i s attaching priority to upgrading and
maintaining National Highways, and seeking declaration o f some o f the important state highways as
National Highways. As state highways and major district roads are important core roads linlungnational
highways and rural roads, the state has sourced external funding from the World Bank for their
upgradation and maintenance o f these roads. Providing connectivity to villages will receive utmost
priority, and GoHP i s committed to providing road links to almost all unconnectedPanchayats by March,
2008.

105. Addressing the skills mismatch. Given that one o f the key constraints to private sector
development as well as productive employment for educated youth i s the slulls mismatch, GoHP i s
seelung to assess and project the skill needs o f the secondary and tertiary sectors; better match the
provision o f technical and vocational training opportunities to market opportunities; and improve the
general quality o f education with a view to increasing employability. The state proposes to undertake a
study on slulls mismatches and shortages inHP. This will be an important step, since the extent of skill
gaps and mismatches in the state i s unclear at present. This constrains evidence-based policy reforms.
The study would include a skills-mapping exercise, to identify particular sectors which would emerge in
the near future, so that skill requirements could be projected. Based on this, the state needs to come up
with a skills development strategy to bridge current and future skills shortages and slulls mismatches-
worked out in consultation with industry, workers, and educators.            It should be noted that it is not
proposed that GoHP take the lead on skill development-but              that the study provides grounding for
policy-based reform, including on private sector involvement. The Terms o f Reference for the study has
already beenprepared, and the work for the study has already commenced.

106. Improving transport facilities to raise connectivity. As part o f a strategy to make available
public transport to rural areas, GoHP has announced a licensing scheme for all investment applications,
where at least 60 percent o f the busroute i s for rural roads. To make full use o f the highinvestment made
inroads construction, the licensing regime will be liberalisedto grant more permits to the private sector
for plying o f buses. This new policy i s a "win-win'' on many accounts. There shall be more direct and
indirect employment avenues for the unemployed youth. Through better transport opportunities, the state
economy shall benefit substantially, especially in sectors such as agriculture, horticulture, and tourism.
The state's tax revenues will also gain interms o f enhanced consumption o f diesel, spare parts usage and
higher collection o f road tax. The role o f HRTC will continue to remain important, especially for the
interior and far flung areas o fHP.

107. Infrastructure development in industrial areas.                 Though the Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh
Development Authority (BBNDA) has been set up to oversee infrastructure development in the area,
there are issues o f funding and co-ordination. GoHP will implement measures to synergize efforts under
the BBNDA, the Industries Department, and other relevant agencies-to             avoid duplication in planning
and implementation o f industrial area development o f BBNarea. A proposal for development o f worker
housing in the BBNarea, based on public private partnerships, will also be implemented. The Industrial
Area Development Act (IADA) to facilitate planned industrial infkastructure development through the
creation o f industrial area authorities in priority locations i s expected to be enacted by June, 2008. It i s
also envisioned that measures would be taken to strengthen the BBNDA and other IADAs through
additional funding.

108. Effect of business facilitation measures. GoHP will also undertake a study to evaluate the
effectiveness of business facilitation measures at the state and district level. Measures like the single
window facility have been in operation in the state for several years-and       GoHP would like to assess its
effectiveness and identify remaining bottlenecks.          Recommendations from the study could inform
subsequent reforms.

                          F. Public ConsultationsandParticipatoryProcess

109. Consultations around the reform program. HP has benefited from a transparent and accessible
administration. HP's plan document, which presents the overarching reformprogram, i s discussed inthe
state Legislature, and i s posted on the government website. For purposes o f the current program, a
stakeholder workshop was organized in September, 2006, attended by civil society, academia, and local
NGOs-to     discuss the reform priorities and options. All the major reform measures to be implemented
have been disclosed throughthe media inthe past few months. Decisions taken by the government on the
policy agenda have also been announcedthrough the media and other public channels.

                IV. BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

                                  A.   Linkto India's Country Strategy

110. Strategic importance of the HP operation. HPDPLl has strategic value at the national level for
Go1and the World Bank, for at least two reasons. One, this i s the first time in India that comprehensive
institutional reforms for environment management are being attempted through a Bank DPL. Two,
success o f a private sector led growth strategy in HP would have a strong demonstration effect on other
special category states, and would show that there i s a way out o f excessive dependence on the public
sector and central support. Success in this operation would also provide a valuable learning experience
for other states rich innatural resources seeking to harness their development potential sustainably, and
demonstration effects from this loan could have far reaching implications for the development pattern o f
similar states.

111. Value added of Bank engagement. Bank interventions can make a significant difference to the
reform program in the state. Although the state had been performing well inrecent years, its continuing
development would be vulnerable if the state i s unable to sustain its macroeconomic performance. There
i s a broad consensus emerging in HP on the need to transition to a more private-sector-led
environmentally sustainable growth path-to      avoid slipping into poverty in the medium term. Bank
involvement could support this by helping HP to strengthen its overall fiscal situation, improve public
financial management, promote environmentally sustainable development, and harness the potential o f its
two most valuable sectors-hydropower        and tourism. In addition, this project would provide a first
opportunity for the Bank to support a "special category" state in reducing its heavy reliance on public
centrally-funded support. As per GoHP request, the Bank will also bring in international expertise and
technical assistance in areas like hydropower, tourism, and environment. These provide an adequate
rationale for staying engaged with HP over the medium term by supporting the DPLrequest.

112. Importance of the HP operation in the national context. Key policy focus areas for the proposed
operation include sustainable hydropower development and environmental sustainability.           Both are
important issues inthe national context. Compromisedriver flows in HP could have implications for the
downstream states. Given that HP has 13 percent o f the total hydropower potential estimated for India,
this can help alleviate the power shortage inIndia's Northern electricity grid. Yet, given India's federal
structure, these issues cannot be dealt with by the central government alone, but require active
interventionby the state government. Since hydropower i s a national priority, and the CAS supports the
Bank's re-engagement in the hydropower sector, the special focus on sustainable development o f HP's
hydropower resources strengthens the case for Bank involvement.

113. Specific importance of Bank involvement in terms of environmental issues.               The Bank i s
supporting a number o f measures to strengthen institutions for environmental sustainability-both
overall, and with particular reference to the development o f hydropower. Specifically, it should be noted
that the operation does not support expansion o f hydropower per se-but,       rather, measures to make
GoHP's own plans for hydropower expansion more sustainable as described below. Infact, the Bank's

                                                    34

engagement in this area i s likely to lead to more positive environmental outcomes than would otherwise
have been possible inthis area.

 114. Thrust areas under current India Country Strategy. The key objective under the India Country
Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board on August 26, 2004, was to maximize and leverage diverse
resources o f the Bank Group to dramatically scale up its impact. Since 1997, the India CAS has included
a focus on states undertaking comprehensive reforms, in order to support the leaders o f change and to
serve as a catalyst to the state-level reform process. With the concentration o f poverty and poor social
indicators in a few states, the 2004 India CAS sought to open up new opportunities for engagement with
India's poorest states, while retaining an essentially reform and performance-based approach to the states.
State-level DPLs continue to remain an important part o f the Bank program.

 115. Request from HP for budgetary support. GoHP has sought Bank assistance in the form o f
budgetary support for a comprehensive reform program. This request has been endorsed by GoI. It i s
recognized that, while HP i s not one o f India's largest or poorest states, it faces various challenges and
constraints on account o f its size and location, as described earlier-n     account of which it i s regarded by
Go1 as a "special category" state, deserving of central assistance. Inparticular, relatively high costs o f
service delivery impose costs on GoHP which other governments o f states located in less hilly terrain
would not face.

116. Consistency of operation with CAS principles. First, one of the strategic principles o f the 2004
India CAS i s to selectively target limited resources to activities where assistance i s welcomed, and can be
most effective. The additional financing that the Bank can provide will help ensure that high-priority
expenditures are protected rather than crowded out at a time o f fiscal stress. It also provides financial
backing for the state's reform program and will enable HP to finance the direct costs o freforms as well as
to substitute cheaper for costlier debt. The concessional terms o f Bank assistance would enable HP to
achieve a more rapid decline in its debt service burden than would otherwise be possible. Second, the
focus o f the 2004 India CAS marks a departure from the earlier approach o f a comprehensive
involvement in a limited number o f states (the "focus states").         There i s a shift towards cross-cutting
dialogue with a wider range o f states. Given that HP i s the first o f India's eleven "special category" states
that has approached the Bank for support to its reform program through a DPL, this presents a unique
opportunity for the Bank to diversify its operations into this group.

117. Support to DPLs under CAS ProgressReport. The India CAS Progress Report, circulated to the
Board in March 2007, highlights that Bank support to DPLs in several states has contributed not only to
improvements in their fiscal performance, but more importantly, to growth, poverty reduction, public
sector reforms, and governance. HP faces similar challenges and priorities going beyond achievement o f
fiscal sustainability-in  terms o f accelerating growth, improving public service delivery, and promoting
environmental sustainability. Thus HP i s an appropriate candidate for Bank assistance, and the proposed
operation i s listed inthe CAS Progress Report. Inaddition, multiple pipeline operations inHP described
below imply that Bank investment lending i s set to expand in HP over the next few years. The proposed
budgetary support operation can be particularly important in developing and strengthening the broader
institutional structure and enabling environment-which       any specific investment operation would find
difficult to address.

                          B. Collaboration with other Development Partners

118. Working with external partners. The work o f the World Bank group has been coordinated or
leveraged with that o f external partners inmost sectors. Generally, coordination has worked well through
informal communication, complemented by periodic overview discussions.               During the current CAS
period o f FY05-FY08, the World Bank i s committed to proactively looking for opportunities to ensure
cooperation with external partners. In particular, DFID has worked together with the Bank on direct


                                                      35

budgetary support operations inAndhra Pradesh and Orissa. There i s considerable overlap inthe areas o f
activity between the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank-with             both institutions having a
substantial and growing engagement in infrastructure and energy, and also in adjustment lending at the
state level. Inparticular, a Natural Resource Management Society has been established inHP in order to
coordinate various programs and projects o f development partners relating to agriculture, watershed
management, irrigation, and forestry.

119. Consultation with donorsin HP. The HPDPLl will also buildpartnerships with external donors.
The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) i s currently active in HP, and i s supporting the
"Swan River Integrated Watershed Management Project'"-which          i s a project for integrated watershed
management inUna district. The project components include afforestation, erosion and flood control, and
improvements to terraced fields.     The proposed D P L operation has been discussed with JBIC.          In
addition, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) i s providing technical assistance in
agriculture; the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) has some projects and technical
assistance ongoing in areas like eco-development, irrigation, and capacity building for PRIs; and DFID
has some non-lending technical assistance inthe forestry sector. The Bank team has obtained DFIDTrust
Fund support to finance some technical activities and studies under the proposed DPL-in         the areas o f
tourism, hydropower, environment, and skill development, which will involve external expertise.
Consultations are planned and ongoing with development partners inthe state, and will continue over the
course o f the operation.

                              C. Relationshipto other Bank Operations

120. Limitedsize of the existingportfolio. The World Bank has limited presence inHP at present, with
a total portfolio o f US$ 126.8 million, including state share in central projects. Bank-funded watershed
development has been ongoing in the state for more than fourteen years. Currently, the Mid-Himalayan
Watershed Development .Project i s one year into implementation, and already shows promising results
with respect to assisting communities in sustainably managing their natural resources and developing
livelihoods. This project, with an allocation o f US$ 60 million, i s itself a follow-on to the successhl
Integrated Watershed Development project, which concluded in September, 2005, Inaddition, there are
national projects inhydrology and rural roads, where the allocation for HP i s US$66.8 million.

121. Expanding engagement. However, the World Bank's engagement i s expanding in area like state
roads, hydropower, rural livelihoods, and environmental management. Excludingthe DPL, projects inthe
pipeline exclusively for Hp amount to about US$ 930 million. The HP Afforestation Project (US$ 4
million) has been approved for inclusion in the portfolio o f the World Bank's Bio-Carbon Fund, which
will provide carbon finance pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to induce communities to plant and preserve
forests. The HP States Roads Project (US$220 million) has been approved by the Bank inJune, and will
provide support to reforms and expansion inthe roads sector. At the project level, the Bank, i s partnering
with the Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) for the Rampur Hydropower project in HP. The Rampur
Hydropower project (US$ 400 million), being implemented by SJVN, has been appraised recently and
will be presented to the Bank Board in September 2007. Go1 has also requested Bank to support the
LuhriHydroelectric Project (US$ 650 million). The project is proposed to be implementedby SJVN, for
which the necessary agreement i s yet to be signedbetween SJVN and GoHP.

122. Hydropower and environment. Several initiatives inthese key sectors complement the DPL. The
Bank's hydropower development engagement in India and in HP i s proceeding on several levels,
considering the multiple roles played by various players active in the field o f hydropower development.
Go1 has requested Bank's assistance in instituting suitable international technical and sustainability
practices in hydropower development in the Himalayan region, the home o f much o f India's untapped
hydro resources. At the state level, the Bank, through a technical assistance initiative, i s working with



                                                    36

GoHP on issues related to optimizing river basin development, particularly hydropower, and minimizing
the cumulative impacts o f several developments.

                                           D. LessonsLearned

123. Past experience. The current operation benefits from several important lessons drawn from policy-
based lending inUttar Pradesh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka, and also from the World Bank's
wider experience inadjustment lending.

9 DPLs can help push necessary reforms in a macro context which individual investment operations
may not be able to address-and     which can provide an enabling environment for subsequent investment
projects. In particular for this operation, a number o f departments are involved in implementation o f the
environmental management actions, and such multi-department coordination i s likely better achieved
through a DPL rather than a sectoral approach. If the state has to develop its untapped hydropower
potential in an environmentally sustainable manner, strengthening the institutional capacity o f the state
agencies for implementation and monitoring o f environment management activities-an          area on which
there has been limited focus in the past-is     crucial. Further, any efforts towards better mitigation o f
adverse environmental impacts will help subsequenthydropower projects. The need for the improvement
inthe capacity to implement Catchments Area Treatment (CAT) Plans-which            i s a key prior action for
the operation as described below-is     a lesson learnt from the earlier Nathpa Jhakri project.    DPLs are
also well suited to encouraging broader and more holistic evaluations o f hydrological developments.
Piece-meal and project specific approaches fail to capture the cumulative and conflicting consequences o f
multiple developments. This i s particularly important for HP, given the scale o f GoHP's envisaged
expansion o f hydropower.

9 Lessons from past experience suggest the need for a broad view of reforms. Fiscal adjustment is
inadequate on its own, and a complementary focus on other key areas i s needed for the success o f the
program. These lessons have been incorporated into the design o f the HP program, including choice o f
areas to support and phasing o f reforms. Eventhough one o f major focus areas o f the first operation i s on
fiscal adjustment, promotion o f environmentally sustainable development and development o f the state's
hydropower potential are complementary focus areas, given the importance o f environment and the
hydropower potential inHP's context.

9 The operationrecognizesthatreforms aremorelikelyto succeedwithstrongownership onthe partof
the state government. GoHP already has in place a vision for the future, as articulated in its plan
documents. It has shown particular keenness in approaching the World Bank for assistance inbuilding a
program, and introducing reforms to achieve this vision. In particular, GoHP has been proactive in
discussing and internalizing some important recommendations from the Bank's analytical work described
below-and    announcing reform measures along with the 2007-08 budget. These measures are detailed
subsequently, and show strong commitment to reforms on the part o f the state.

9 Adjustment programs need to show sensitivity to local conditions. This is particularly important in
HP, where the state does face significant difficulties on account o f remoteness and terrain-and         the
operation has been careful to pick up on issues like environment and sustainable development o f
hydropower which are critical inHP's context.

9 Experience to date has confirmed the usefulness of supporting the medium term program of the
government. While this approach arguably entails higher administrative costs for the World Bank, the
process contributes to good incentives-and      provides for continuity in the policy dialogue with states.
Accordingly, the HP operation has been designed to support the government's own program in a multi-
year framework.



                                                     37

                                      E. AnalyticalUnderpinnings

124. The Bank has prepared an Economic Report on HP titled "Himachal Pradesh: Accelerating
Development and Sustaining Success ina Hill State". This was based on close consultations with GoHP,
and civil society groups. The Economic Report has identified challenges in areas, including: (i)       creating
fiscal space to fund HP's development vision; (ii)     promoting institutions for environmentally sustainable
development; (iii)tapping the potential in sectors like hydropower in a sustainable manner; (iv)
improving governance and service delivery; (v) promotingprivate sector development through addressing
s h l l s mismatches that would also promote suitable employment opportunities for educated youth; and
(vi) enhancing the quality o fhuman development services. The proposed operation i s basedprimarily on
GoHP's development challenges and reformprogram, as analyzed inthe Economic Report.

125. In addition, the operation has drawn from existing literature on the state. Documents like various
issues o fthe Economic Survey o f HP, and the Himachal Pradesh Development Report (2005) prepared by
the National Planning Commission have guidedthe preparation o f the reformprogram.

126. The operation has been informed by in-depth studies inparticular sectors. For environmental issues,
this operation has been guided by a Draft "State o f the Environment Report" o f GoHP, several
unpublished reports, and a sparse peer reviewed literature on the environment in HP. Environmental
assessments prepared under past Bank projects-including          the Mid-Himalayan Watershed Development
Project and the State Roads Project-have         informed environmental aspects o f the proposed operation.
For the tourism sector, a consultancy study was undertaken specifically to understand challenges and
opportunities-and     guide the reform program. Analytical work undertaken duringthe first tranche will
be relevant for any subsequent tranches and operations.

                                 V. THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

                                     A. Objectivesand Sequencing

127. Development objective. The overarching objective o f the proposed HPDPLl i s to support the
implementation o f critical structural, fiscal, and administrative reforms needed to achieve sustainable and
rapid economic growth and inclusive development over the medium term, while sustaining the
environmental heritage o f the state. The priority areas for the operation-in         accordance with GoHP's
own reform program described in Section 111-will                  be fiscal adjustment, and promotion o f
environmentally sustainable development, with particular reference to the development o f hydropower.
The overall program will also support reforms to enhance growth and employment, especially in the
private sector, and improve governance and public administration. While human development i s an
important area for support in most DPL operations, HP's outcomes are more impressive than in many
other states. Inorder to concentrate on a few priority reform areas having the greatest likely development
impact, the focus o f this operation i s on strengthening the policy framework to ensure long-lasting
development benefits in the critical areas o f fiscal recovery, environmental sustainability, and
development o f important sectors with untapped potential. Human development outcomes in HP being
among the better ones inthe country, this i s not a critical priority area for the current operation.

128. Tranching. Since the government has adopted a medium-term program, the Bank's support will be
provided in two equal tranches o f US$67.5 million and SDR 21.25 million, respectively.             The second
tranche will be released after an assessment o f whether the reform program i s on track, based on
milestones agreed at the first tranche. It i s to be noted that, as per the current schedule, the second tranche
o f the operation is likely to be released only after the state elections early next calendar year. Any
subsequent operation will be processed on the basis o f the strength o f the overall program and the
legitimate financing needs o f the state.

                                               B. Policy Areas

129. The operation i s designed so that all key actions for the first tranche have been taken prior to Board
Presentation. This section describes the specific measures that form tranche release conditions, and their
implementation status. Disbursement o f the second tranche i s expected in FY 2008-09, subject to
fulfillment o f the conditions for the second tranche.       Eight prior actions were agreed upon at pre-
appraisal, all o f which have been met as described above in Section 111. Relevant paragraphs in the
preceding section o f the document where these actions are discussed are also cross-referenced.

Prior Actions for Release o f the First Tranche

130. HP has taken the following policy and institutional actions under its Program, for which the Bank i s
expectedto release the first tranche o f the loadcredit insupport o f the Program.

Creating Fiscal Space to Finance the State's Development Vision

P HP has prepared an MTFP covering the period FY 2007-08 to FY 2011-12with the objectives, inter
     alia, o f increasing its own tax revenue throughhigher tax effort, and controlling the wage bill, and has
     taken a number o f measures to implement the MTFP for FY 2007-08, including:

          o Introducing a higher Motor Vehicles token tax on all vehicles older than 15 years (Para 38,
                Bullet 1);

          o Increasing Motor Vehicles token tax rates to target an additional growth o f at least 6 percent
                inmotor vehicles tax take over 2006/07 (RE) fromthenewtax measures (Para 38, Bullet1);

          o Introducing an optional luxury tax regime for hotels requiringa flat payment based on a 30
                percent minimumhotel room occupancy (Para 38, Bullet 2);

          o Notifying a ban on recruitment inthe government (contract, part-time, daily wagers), except
                with the prior approval o f the Finance Department and the Council o f Ministers, and such
                approval to be granted only for functionalposts. (Para 46).

P HP has amended the rules o f the HPFRBMA o f 2005 to progressively reduce risk-weighted
    guarantees for each FY to below 40 percent o f the total revenue receipts o f the preceding FY, and has
    announced a framework to eliminate offbudgetborrowing (Para 54).

k HP has issued instructions to prepare a departmental Medium Term Expenditure Framework ineach
    o f the following key departments: Education, Health, Public Works, and Irrigation and Public Health
    (Para 47).

P HP has piloted devolution o f irrigation and drinhng water schemes to beneficiary groups (Le., user
    associations and Panchayati Raj Institutions, respectively), in order to achieve increased efficiency
    and reduce operations and maintenance costs (Para 42).

Sustainable Development of Hydropower

P HP has formulated a time bound Action Plan for managing the environmental aspects o f hydropower
    development focusing, inter alia:

         o In the short term, on completion o f priority catchment management activities in four large
               selected hydropower projects in accordance with a specified timetable, identifying funding

                                                       39

           requirements and sources for implementing the activities, and setting out implementationand
           monitoring arrangements (Para 66, Bullet 1, and Annex C).

        o In the medium to long term, on preparation and implementation o f river basin level
           Catchment Area Treatment (CAT) plans for sustainable development o f hydropower for all
           major river basins, starting with the Satluj basin. (Para 66, Bullet 1, and Annex C).

Promoting theInstitutional Frameworkfor Environmentally Sustainable Development

k  HP has issued a GO to establish a Department o f Environment and Pollution Control, Science and
   Technology, and Biotechnology, with details o f staffing and functions, in order to improve the
   effectiveness o f environmental management, protect vulnerable ecosystem services, and enhance
    sustainability o f development inthe State (Para 84).

k  HP has finalized a time bound Terms o f Reference for preparing an overarching Environment Master
   Plan for the State (Para 86, and Annex D).

Strengthening Governanceand Public Administration

b HP has taken a number o f measures for improving the functioning o f government, including inter
    alia:

        o Initiating a review to identify all surplus, vacant, and vacant and surplus posts (including
           posts that have remained vacant for three years or more) in government and public sector
           units(Para 90);

        o Introducing outsourcing in three major departments (Irrigation and Public Health, Urban
           Local Bodies, and Education) (Para 91);

        o Implementing the minimum tenure determined by Government o f India for Indian
           Administrative Service (IAS) cadre posts in the State (three years for certain positions and
           two for others); constituting a committee on minimum tenure pursuant to the Indian
           Administrative Service (Cadre Rules) 1954 (as amended inAugust 2006) regardingproposals
           for transfers o f I A S officers; and disseminating tenure information relating to I A S officers
           through the government's website (Para 96);

        o Curtailing transfers o f government employees to ensure that such transfers are contained on a
           yearly basis at no more than six percent o f the cadre strengtho f government departments and
           disseminating information about such transfers through the government's website (Para 97);

        o Introducing a single-file system in five additional directorates and formulating a time-bound
           plan for expanding the implementation o f REFNIC (file management and tracking software)
           by all departments inthe State secretariat (Para 94).

Conditions for Release of the Second Tranche

131. The requirement for the release o f the second tranche o fHPDPL1will be the following:

k  Satisfactory progress by GoHP in carrying out the overall GoHP Development Program, as set out in
   the Letter o fDevelopmentPolicy (and the Policy Matrix).




                                                     40

    Maintenance o f a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework by the state-in       particular, prepare
    2008-09 budget inline with agreed MTFP, and execute the 2007-08 budget to meet MTFP targets for
    that year.

    Complete a review o f user charges in the Departments o f Irrigation, Drinking Water, Health,
    Transport and Minor Minerals Royalty; and adopt measures to rationalize user charges, reduce
    implicit subsidies, and improve sustainable financing o f operations and maintenance o f public
    investment.

    Progress in implementation o f the Action Plan on catchment management activities for the identified
    four hydropower projects inthe short term, and preparation o f river basin C A T plan for Satluj river in
    the medium to long term, inaccordance withthe timeframe set out inthe Action Plan.

    Complete Satluj River basin study, and prepare a time-bound Action Plan based on the agreed
    recommendations o f the study, for the improved coordination and optimization o f sustainable
    hydropower development inthe Satluj River basin.

    Progress in preparation o f Environment Master Plan in accordance with the timeframe set out in the
    inthe Terms o fReference.

    Satisfactory progress in implementing the policy on minimum tenures and containing transfers
    referred, including satisfactory operation o f the monitoring systemreferredto therein.

    Prepare manpower and functional review in five identified departments (PWD, IPH, Forests, Health,
    Education), prepare time-bound Action Plan based to improve the organizational structure o f the
    departments, and carry out initial implementation o f recommendations including functional
    reorganization and abolition o f identified surplus posts.

132. The program will be reviewed by the Bank at a date mutually agreed with Go1 and GoHP, in or
before September, 2008. At that review, for release o f the second tranche, the macroeconomic framework
would be considered satisfactory if the Revised Estimates for 2007-08 released by GoHP along with its
Budget inMarch, 2008, are inconformity with the MTFPtargets for 2007-08 (Annex B). Inaddition, the
Budget Estimates for 2008-09, releasedby GoHP along with its Budget inMarch, 2008, would need to be
in conformity with the MTFP targets for 2008-09 (Annex B). Furthermore, the Bank will review the
completion o f the other actions required for the release o f the second tranche.

133. If at the review it i s determined that GoHP has met the conditions, the Bank will release the second
tranche. If, on the other hand, GoHP has not met the conditions for release o f the second tranche, the
Bank will give a ninety day notice period to GoHP to meet the conditions. Ifthey are not met within the
ninety day notice period, the second tranche will be cancelled by the Bank. In making the assessment,
any unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances beyond GoHP's control will be taken into account. The
closing o f the operation will be March 31,2009.

                             VI. OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION

                                     A.   Poverty and Social Impacts

134. Policies supported under the operation are not likely to have significant poverty and social
consequences, on poor people and vulnerable groups. Poverty i s already low in HP, and social indicators
are among the best inthe country. The reforms supported under the operation, and, more broadly, under
the state's reform program, are expected to make contributions to further reducing poverty in several
ways. Some o f the main mechanisms throughwhich the programwould impact poverty are as follows:

                                                      41

    0   Fiscal reforms will enable a greater share o f resources to be focused on poverty-related
        expenditures or social infrastructure. The MTFP seeks to reorient public spending towards high-
        priority developmental spending (social sector spending, non-wage O&M, capital spending) that
        will provide primary education, health, basic social and infrastructural service to the people,
        including support for improved agricultural performance-and    promote inclusive development.


    0   Structural reforms towards private sector development seek to improve the investment climate by
        easing the regulatory burden on the private sector. This will enhance economic growth and
        employment opportunities.


    0   The governance program would reduce corruption and harassment, which tends to hurt the poor
        disproportionately. While the operation supports measures to reduce the wage bill, it does not
        support direct retrenchment o f workers. Outsourcing will create more jobs in the private sector
        than otherwise would have been created inthe government sector.

135. The impact o f improving the business environment on job creation can be particularly positive.
There are constraints in both high-shll and low-skill segments o f the HP labor market, which are
manifested in highreliance on agricuhre and inhigh, double-digit unemployment rates among educated
youth. Inaddition, the slulls assessment study being undertaken by GoHP-with        Bank assistance-will
helpinthe preparation o f ajob creation strategy.

136. GoHP i s aware that there may be consequences to tourism development, and addressing this i s part
o f medium term plans. In particular, the risk o f the spread o f HIV/AIDS has been recognized. Even
though HIV prevalence i s only 0.13 percent and there arejust over 300 A I D S cases inthe state, GoHP has
inplace aneffective AIDS awareness campaign, andawareness is higherthaninother states.

                           B. Implementation,Monitoring,andEvaluation

137. Arrangements within GoHP. The Department o f Finance and Planning will be the nodal
coordinating agency for other departments from the GoHP side for overall implementation and
monitoring o f reforms proposed under HPDPL1. A multi-departmental group o f officials has been
working with the Bank team towards preparation o f the proposed operation, and will oversee the
implementationand monitoring for relevant sectoral components. Indicators for monitoring are indicated
in Annex A. Overall outcomes will be monitored through data published by the Department of
Economics and Statistics, administrative data maintained by various departments, surveys as undertaken,
and budget figures made available by the Department o f Finance and Planning.             GoHP has held
workshops on reforms, and important strategy papers and Plan documents are made available on the
website. Further public consultations will be held duringthe operation.

138. Role of the World Bank team. Monitoring from the Bank side will be undertaken through
implementation support missions-in     close consultation with GoHP. The Program Policy Matrix (Annex
A) provides a results framework that describes expected outcomes. During supervision missions, the
benchmarks indicatedinthe matrix will be evaluated, and interimsteps taken by GoHP will be monitored.

                                         C. FiduciaryAspects

139. Improving Public Financial Management i s a central part o f the reform program in HP. Based on
the findings and recommendations o f the State Financial Accountability Assessment, which will be
undertaken during the operation, key reforms can form the basis for future operations or tranches.
Specific measures are being supported under the operation, as presentedin Section V.




                                                    42

140. The Bank has reasonable assurance that the control environment for foreign exchange inthe Reserve
Bank o f India (RBI, which i s the Central Bank o f India) i s satisfactory for the purposes o f this operation,
based on the RBI audit report and the satisfactory outcomes o f other operations, which have been
disbursed and managed through the RBI. The InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) does not carry out a
Safeguard Assessment of the RBI. As part o f the preparation for this operation, the RBIaudit report and
published annual financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2006, were reviewedby the Bank. The
audit report has a clean, unqualified opinion, and was conducted by a group o f six private firms o f
chartered accountants appointed by GoI. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the
RBI Act, 1934, the notifications issued there under and in the form prescribed by the RBI General
Regulations 1949, and the audit has been conducted following auditing standards generally accepted in
India.

141. Additionally, GoHP has a well-defined program to make further progress on improving public
procurement that includes the passage o f a modem procurement law designed to enhance transparency in
procurement operations.       Specific steps to improve procurement have been complemented by the
enhanced financial management practices discussed above.

                                            D. Disbursement

142. Upon effectiveness o f the loan and credit, the borrower, i.e., the Government o f India (GoI) will
submit to the Bank a withdrawal application for the first tranche. The withdrawal application for the
second tranche will be submitted after the Bank and Go1 have assessed HP's compliance with tranche
release conditions. In each case, the Bank will disburse the US dollar proceeds to the credit o f GoI's
account with the RBI. This account i s controlled by the Office o f the Controller o f Aid, Accounts, and
Audit (CAAA) o f the Department o f Economic Affairs, Go1 and is part o f the GoI's general foreign
exchange reserves. Upon receipt o f each tranche of the loadcredit proceeds, Go1 will transfer the
equivalent rupee amount to GoHP as per the revised guidelines for the transfer o f external assistance to
"special category" states on a 90 percent grant and 10 percent loan basis. GoHP will confirm to the Bank
within 30 days, the receipt o f each tranche and its credit into the Consolidated Fundo fthe State.

143. The loan and credit proceeds for this operation do not finance specifically agreed activities. The
proceeds may be used for any purpose, in support o f the Program, other than to finance excluded
expenditures (as defined inthe loan agreement and financing agreement for the operation). Pursuant to the
legal agreements for this operation, India (inits capacity as the borrower o f the IBRDloan and IDA credit
recipient) and Himachal Pradesh will undertake not to use the proceeds to finance any excluded
expenditures. If any amount of the loan or credit proceeds are used to finance excluded expenditures, the
legal agreements will authorize the Bank to require India or Himachal Pradesh (through India) to refund
the amount.

                                        E. EnvironmentalAspects

144. Specific country policies supported by the operation are not likely to cause significant adverse
effects on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources.          In fact, environmentally
beneficial outcomes are expected from this operation, since enhancing the environmental sustainability o f
growth i s an overarching objective. Itrecognizes that environmental resources are a key engine o f growth
inthe state andenvironmental stewardship is an integralpart o fprudent economic management.

145. HP's environmental institutions and regulations build upon a comprehensive national level policy
framework for environmental and forest management, which set out elaborate regulations and procedures
that cover all aspects o f environmental and natural resource management. Implementationo f these i s left
to state level institutions. However, the environmental regulatory capacity inHP i s inits nascent stage and
needs substantial strengthening. The principal gaps include a ubiquitous shortage o f expertise, a lack o f

                                                      43

clear definition o f roles arising from fragmented environmental management roles, inadequate
coordinationamong departments, and weak compliance incentives.

146. It i s inthis context that this operation seeks to strengthen the capacity o f the environmental agencies.
It: (i)supports the establishment o f a Department o f Environment and Pollution Control; (ii) for acalls
review o f capacity and gaps and a time bound commitment to implement the recommendations o f the
assessment; (iii)establishes systems and procedures to mainstream and strengthen environmental
management within key sectors (especially the large footprint sectors such as roads and hydropower); (iv)
supports mechanisms to enhance public participation and promote accountability; and (v) most
importantly, supports the preparation o f an Environmental Master Plan, accompanied by a time bound
actionplan for the execution and implementation o f the Plan.

147. The Environmental Master Plan i s envisaged as a strategic management tool to strengthen the
sustainability o f growth in the state and encourage stakeholder participation.             It would facilitate
comprehensive and holistic environmental management by providing a platform for integrating cross-
cutting issues, engaging non-environmental agencies, establishing environmental baselines, identifying
fragile areas and assisting in monitoring performance over time.              This would provide a crucial
information base that would allow environmental stewardship to be integrated into mainstream policy and
decision malung. The Bank team i s assisting GoHP inthe preparation o f this Plan and it i s envisagedthat
there will be an ongoing engagement to assist inimplementation, compliance, and execution.

148. GoHP has identified hydropower as one o f the state's growth pillars. This operation recognizes that
to optimize the potential o f this sector there i s a need to assure sustainability and equity through
strengthened environmentalmanagement. There are weaknesses inthe implementation o f CAT plans that
will be addressed through this loadcredit. Given the dramatic expansion in hydropower development
envisaged by GoHP, this operation encourages a move away from fragmented, piece-meal, and project
specific assessments o f environmental activities towards more comprehensive and holistic approaches
that take account o f cumulative impacts. It should be recognized that the operation i s not supporting
hydropower expansion per se-but,         rather, supporting sustainability o f GoHP's own expansion plans,
through improved catchment management, afforestation, reduced soil erosion and landslides, etc.

149. Other reforms supported by this operation are expected to have no direct environmental impacts.
These include promoting better revenue and expenditure management to create fiscal space for
development priorities and improvements in governance and public administration.

                                          F. RisksandMitigation

150. The main risks include fiscal, reputational, political, and limited technical capacity. The nature o f
these risks and the corresponding mitigation strategy i s as follows:

         Fiscal Risk. Non-adherence to the targets set in the MTFP could derail the state's adjustment
         path, and affect future tranche release. Enactment o f the Himachal Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility
         and Budget Management Act, 2005, reduces the risk o f deviating from the fiscal correctionpath.
         Linlung o f Bank assistance, as well as central government debt relief to the achievement of
         annual fiscal adjustment, further strengthens the incentives for the GoHP to adhere to the MTFP.
         The award o f the Sixth Pay Commission o f GoI, which i s yet to be announced, will increase the
         salary expenditures o f state governments, as all state governments tend to follow the central pay
         award for their civil servants. The underlying fiscal model used for the operation provides for a
         reasonable increase in salary resulting from the yet unknown award. However, a higher than
         assumed increase will necessitate other fiscal correction measures to maintain adjustment. The
         operation i s being designed with tranches to mitigate against risk o f unacceptable fiscal slippage.



                                                       44

  GoI's framework for DPLs provides for tranching, and evaluation o f progress on tranche
  conditions before release o fthe subsequent tranche.

0 Reputational Risk. GoHP has plans to realize the benefits o f the state's large hydropower
  potential for the benefit o f the people o f Himachal Pradesh. This hydropower expansion i s going
  to proceed irrespective o f the Bank's involvement. The aim o f the Bank`s support i s to make the
  state's own hydropower development plans more environmentally sustainable. Under the current
  DPL, the main focus for hydropower i s on preparation and timely implementation o f CAT plans.
  The DPL program will encourage the GoHP to move coherently and comprehensively to study,
  plan and implement integrated actions for sustainable hydropower development. As a further
  mitigatory measure, the operation focuses on: (i)building institutions for environmental
  management in the state; and (ii)    improved environmental stewardship and planning. Thus the
  DPL is going to support the enhancement o f the institutional capacity o f GoHP to support and
  regulate the sustainable development o f hydropower rather than the indiscriminate development
  o f hydropower resources. Accordingly, no reputational risk i s perceived from this operation. The
  Bank will continue to hold regular consultations with stakeholders to address any concerns, and
  will emphasize that the DPL will help GoHP embark on an environmentally sound path to
  hydropower expansion.


0 Limited Technical Capacity. Implementation may be slower than anticipated in case of limited
  technical capacity. While capacity in HP i s arguably as good as that inother DPL states, the state
  may face technical constraints in implementing its first multi-sectoral DPL. In order to help
  alleviate these constraints, the Bank i s trying to ensure that significant technical assistance i s
  available to follow through on the reform measures supported by the proposed operation. Close
  attention i s also being paid to sequencing the reforms in such a way as to avoid an overloaded
  agenda which would strain implementationcapacity.


0 Political Economy Risk. HP faces state assembly elections in early 2008.        In order to ensure
  continuity in reform, broad ownership o f key objectives has been built among key stakeholders,
  through extensive consultations-in     order to align the operation to the government's Five Year
  Plan. The reform program also addresses HP's development priorities over which there i s broad
  consensus. Carefil consideration has been given to political economy factors inthe design of the
  reforms and their sequencing, and tranching.

Dear Mr. Zoellick:

1.     I am attaching a letter of Development Policy dated          August,
2007, from Chief Secretary to the Government of Himachal Pradesh. The
letter outlines the agenda through which the Government of Himachal
Pradesh proposes to strengthen and consolidate its reforms process, and
for which it has soughtassistance from the World Bank of US $200 million.

2.     Government of India supports this continued initiative and
commendsthe proposalfor the considerationof the World Bank.

CreatingFiscal Space

4.     For various reasons, including the fact that Hiinaclial Pradesh was denied its due
share in 1he hydropower projects ol' iinilivided Punjab that affected its revenues, the
Statc is iccliiig under a high debt st     .with    outstandiiig total debt of niorc tliari Rs.
20,000 crorc or 69% o f GSDP, and aiiiitial interest liability of about Rs. 1800 crorc or
6% of GSDP. To meet its high iiitcrest burden liab              cs, as aIw to maintain thc
required pace of its devclopmental goals, I1P Cioveriiments have bccn forccd in thc past
to resort to net borrowings o f morc than Rs. 2000 crorc per ycar. Thesc borrowings
included off-budgct borrowings which had been necessitated in the past to avoid
pcrennial ovcrdratis with the Resen-e Bank o f India.

5.     Kzepirig in vicii the scveritj of thc fiscal crisis, thc (iowrrimcnt has ciiiharlced
on a fiscal correction progrsm that has startcd yielding bcncfits. Thc fiscal correction

cnlzanceincnt of revenue. As a result total xpcnditurc as a share o f GSDP has dccliiicd
from 32% in 2002-03 to about 29% oCGSINJin 2006-07. 17iis is particularly evident
in salaries, whose share has declined from 1.4% of GSDP in 2002-03 to 9.4% in 2006-

 increase in rcvcnuc has contributed hi encouraging iiiiprovcinent in the fiscal balancc,
 which lias improved from 12.4% of CISDP in 2002-03 to 4.3% of GSDP in 200647. A

 6.     The Government is now engaged in consolidating the fiscal tiirnarouiid with a
 sustainable long term fiscal poiicy that targets reduction in the level of' debt stock while
 creating fiscal space for finaricing the development vision of the state. As a racilitation
 measure, the Gowmiieii1enacted the Himachal Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and t3udget
 Management Act (HI-'I:KBMA) in 2005. One of the Ley requirements of the kW'R13hlA
 is that a niiilti year rolling Medium 'Ieriii Fiscal Policy (M'I'1:P) shuuld be placed annually

M'I'FP also seeks to increase Stale's o'vvii tax revenue froin 5.2% of GSDP in 2006-07
to at leas1 6.3% of GSDP in 2009-10. Ihe MTFP lias charted a path to decrease salary

systematic process of increasing Stm's own revenues and compressing overall
expenditures, the interesl payment buidens are also sought to be brought down from
20% of total expenditure in 2007-08 to 15% by 2011-12. Besides the above M
targets, GOfP also iiitcnds to makc judicious use of DPL tmnches to increase capital
outlay froin 12% of total cqxitditirrc in 2007-08 to 30% in 701I.12. In addition. the

Note: Non-tax revenue fromroyalty power and equity power havebeenprojected on arealistic basis, considering
commissioning possibilitiesof ongoing hydropower projects, prices at which power may be sold, and actual generation. There
canbe an upsideto the revenueprojectionifmore aggressiveassumptions are usedor the three fundamental assumptions listed
above turn out to be more favorable than assumed. For demonstrationpurposes, we have attemptedto quantify the revenue
upsideas 0.3 percentto 0.5 present of GSDP ineach of the years 2009-10 to 2011-12. As a consequence, HP's projectedown
revenue could reach 9.4 percent of GSDP in2011-12. Correspondingly, the gross fiscal deficit could decline to 1.9 percent of

          Annex C: Action Planfor Completionof CatchmentManagementActivities
                   For SustainableDevelopmentof Hydropower inHimachalPradesh

1. GoHP has a vision of accelerating sustainable development o f hydropower projects in the state.
Several actions have been initiated by GoHP to facilitate rapid implementation o f the activities related to
the above activities:

         A committee headedby Chief Conservator o fForests (P&D) has been constitutedto develop
         strategy for effective implementationo f all CAT Planworks and to design formats for
         collecting/consolidating base line data, which can later on be converted into GIS platform. The
         committee will also develop performance audit system;
         All the monies payable on account ofcost of Compensatory Afforestation (CA), cost of CAT
         Plan, Net Present Value etc. are recovered from the user agency at the time or after the approval
         by the Ministryo fEnvironment& Forests (GoI), under Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. The
         funds so recovered are now beingremitted to account CA-1595 allottedto State Himachal
         Pradesh at CorporationBank Lodhi Road, New Delhiby Compensatory Afforestation Fund
         Management and PlanningAuthority (CAMPA);
         To ensure speedy transfer o f money to CAMPA a account to be operatedjointly by Conservator
         o f Forests (Finance) and Registrar (Budget) has beenopened inthe Corporation Bank Kasumpti
         Branch at Shimla. All the Divisional Forest Officers (DFOs) have been directedto deposit the
         amount recovered from user agencies to thisjoint account;
         Directions to prepare beat level status o f forest have been issued to all the Conservators;
         Public Works Department has beenrequestedto issue directions to ensure safe disposal o f muck
         generated inthe road construction process;
         The CAMPA has envisaged settingup o f State Level Steering Committee headedby the Chief
         Secretary o f the respective State and the State Management Committee headedby the respective
         Principal Chief Conservator o f Forests (PCCF) o f each State. These committees have been
         notified;
         Department has reviewedthe existingreporting mechanism for various departmental activities.
         Wherever necessary the formats have beenrevised;
         Three Watershed Development Societies for Ravi, Beas and Satluj catchment have been
         registered;
         For spending through Watershed Development Society, a separate account inthe Nationalized
         Bank i s opened for each society after release o f funds from CAMPNState Government;
         Eco-Task Force have beenraised by employing ex-army personnel to increase the pace o f C A T
         Plan work; and
         Reporting/monitoringmechanism for progress under CAT Plan has been put inplace.

2. The following action plan describes activities planned by the state government for immediate and
mediumterm implementation of catchment management activities (CAT+CA), works on which shall be
simultaneously taken up. The long terms plan also would include use o f NPV+ lease rent amount. These
actions will support increase in retention o f soil moisture, soil conservation and reduction o f silt inflows
to the rivers, besides increasing overall green cover.

1.       Background

Located inNorth India, Himachal Pradesh (HP) i s a small mountainous state bordering Punjab, Haryana,
Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. With a geographical area o f 55,673 sq. k m s and population o f 6.6
million, HP accounts for 1.6 percent o f the national geographical area and about 0.6 percent o f India's
population. It i s one o f India's leading states interms o f human development, and, inrecent years, HPhas
achieved higher growth rates than the rest o f the country - powered by rapid expansion o f the secondary
and tertiary sectors. HP i s a unique state because o f the success it has achieved over the past three
decades, despite severe structural disadvantages o f relative remoteness, environmental fragility, and a
difficult hill terrain which raises the costs o f service delivery - all characteristic o f Himalayan states in
India. At the same time, the state i s rich in natural resources with abundant water, minerals, forests,
biodiversity, and fertile soils, andjudicious and sustainable exploitation o f these resources could present
opportunities for further development.

The World Bank has been approached by the Government o f Himachal Pradesh (GoHP) to become a
partner inits development effort, and support a developing program o f policy and institutional reforms. In
light o f its articulated development objectives, GoHP has signaled willingness to adopt and continue
reforms in key areas to create fiscal space to finance critical investments, promote private sector
development, encourage sectors where the state can compete effectively by playing to its natural
strengths, strengthen governance and public service delivery, conserve and protect its environmental
heritage, and further improve social outcomes. To help underpin HP's reforms, the Bank has been
requested by both GoHP and the Government o f India (GoI) to provide support in the form o f a
Development Policy Loan (DPL).

HP has some distinctive characteristics that set it apart from other Indian states. Firstly, it i s a relatively
young state inthe Indian union. The state, currently comprising 12 districts, was granted full statehood in
1971. Secondly, HP i s a small state both in terms o f area and population. O f the population o f about 6.6
million, 90 percent still reside in rural areas. Interms o f area, it ranks seventeenth among India's states
and union territories - and i s one-sixth the size o f Rajasthan, India's largest state.         Thirdly, it is
geographically different from most Indian states located in the plains. HP is largely mountainous, but
exhibits extraordinary biological diversity. Except for a few pockets bordering Punjab and Haryana,
altitudes span from 400 meters to almost 7000 meters above sea level. O f the aggregate geographical area,
almost two-third i s officially classified as forests, although actual forest cover i s lower. The hilly terrain
and forest cover contribute to low availability o f land for traditional agriculture, and net sown area i s only
about 15 percent o f the total. The population density inthe state (at around 110 per sq. km.)i s lower than
the national figure o f 320 per sq. km., largely due to relatively low and scattered population inthe hill and
forest areas.

HP's rich and varied natural heritage provides both opportunities and risks to its development strategy.
Natural resources are a critical, if underutilized, engine for accelerating growth and poverty reduction.
Sustainability o f economic growth in HP i s contingent upon sustainability o f its environmental heritage.
HP's key growth and revenue drivers in the medium term are critically dependent on the state's natural
resource base. At the same time, resource dependence renders the economy highly vulnerable to the
consequences of environmental degradation. While some environmental degradation inevitably
accompanies growth, inaction or failure to balance the environmental costs o f development with the
benefits will have particularly serious consequences for the state - whose opportunities lie in sectors like
horticulture, tourism, and hydropower which depend on the environment. Given HP's unique geographic

                                                                                                   Annex D
                                                                                                  Page 2 o f I
situation and small resource base, protecting rich natural resources assume greater importance than in
other states. The state, therefore, recognizes the need to sustain its environmental resources.

2.       Objectives

With a long term perspective o f achieving environmentally sustainable development, GoHP has indicated
its intention to prepare an Environment Muster PZun (EMP) for the state, to be completed within the first
year o f the DPL. The EMP would be a guiding tool providing strategic direction with respect to all
encompassing environmental issues; a unique means for engagement between implementing agencies,
development departments and the local government to take action on environmentpriority issues o f local
concern; developed with community interests integrating feedback from residents and interested
stakeholders; and a tool to monitor environment performance and progress. This would be the first
attempt inIndia to develop an Environment Master Plan o f this nature.

The key objectives o fthe EMPwould be to enable the GoHP to:
     Simultaneously address issues o f ecological and environment restoration and bring convergence
     along with the development activities taking place inthe state;
     Engage and ensure close coordination with all the concerned development departments, both at the
     state and GO1level
     Decide future financing o f investments for development ina sustainable manner, and
     Develop suitable institutional arrangements inorder to implement the GoHP's policies and strategies.

3.       Scope of Work

The scope o f work to achieve the above stated objectives would involve the following: (these have been
further detailed as tasks in Section 4)
     1. identification o f different eco-zones with specific environment attributes ;
     2. preparation o f a detailedresource inventories covering all environmentparameters;
     3. inventorizationo fneeds o f different sections o f the population;
     4. trend analysis o f cumulative environment degradation;
     5. vulnerability assessment in the context o f air, water and land, to establish differential
         development zones;
     6. documentation o fpotential threats andnew development policies;
     7. formulation o f appropriate development criteria for optimization o fresource use;
     8.  establishing interlinkages between different sectors and points o f integrationbetween them;
     9. preparation o f sectoral guidelines to mainstream environment parameters in development
         activities;
     10. forecasting for externalities and planning for corrective measures such as those arising from
         climatic changes
     11. finalisation o f a comprehensive integrated EMP.


The major sectors and activities which would be covered (but not be limited to), by the EMP have been
broadly categorized under infrastructure, natural resources management (NRM), Services and Regulatory
and listed inthe following table:

                                                                                                         Annex D
                                                                                                       Page 3 of 7


     Infrastructure




The EMP will also provide an operational mechanism for issue identification, preparation and
implementation o f management plans, accountability mechanisms, monitoring, and enforcement
procedures, and roles for other department, to be coordinated by the Environment Department.
Once prepared, its implementation would be piloted during the DPL process, beginning with the
identification and implementation starting with the fragile areas and gradually scaling up to cover all the
sectors mentioned above, to the State level.

As requested, this noteprovides the IMF staffs assessment o fIndia's macroeconomic conditions,
prospects, and relatedpolicies for the FirstHimachal Pradesh Development Policy LoardCredit being
considered by the Executive Board o f the World Bank. The thrust o f our assessment remains the same as
inthe 2006 staffreport.

The economycontinuesto grow strongly, supportedby domestic demand.GDP growth has been
stronger than expected, but i s expected to moderate to 8% percent in2007/08, from a higho f 9% percent
last fiscal year. Headline inflation (WPI), at 4% percent, i s below the RBI's target although core inflation
i s higher. While the rupee has appreciated by 8 percent inreal effective terms this year, export growth
remains strong at 18 percent y/y. With imports also robust, the external current account deficit i s expected
to widen to 1%percent o f GDP in2007/08 (about % percent below the projection inthe 2006 staffreport).
The deficit i s financed by portfolio inflows and commercialborrowings, which could make India more
susceptible to a reversal inglobal investor sentiment. However, reserves stand at a record $222 billion
(about 8% months o f imports, and over 10 times short-term external debt), and external debt remains low
(about 17percent o f GDP, as of end 2006/07).

The immediatechallengeis managingthe near-termriskof potentialinflationarypressures.Short-
term interest rates remain low inreal terms, liquidity remains ample, and credit growth remains robust,

                                                                                                  Page2 of 4


The key medium-term priority is to address India's supply constraintson an aggressive footing.
This involves first reducing general government debt (about 79 percent o f GDP, as o f end 2006/07) and
creating room for social and infrastructure spending. The general government deficit i s expected to
decline further to 5% percent o f GDP in2007/08 (compared with a projection o f 6% percent inthe staff
report), on the back o f strong growth and improved statelevel finances. Provided consolidation continues,
staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio should fall to about 70 percent o f GDP by 2008/09, giventhe
backdrop o frelatively low interest rates and strong growth. However, achieving this and the central
government's target o f current balance by 2008/09 will require revenue and expenditure reform, including
the streamlining o f tax exemptions and subsidies.

Relieving supply constraintsalso requires greater progressin structural reforms to improve
infrastructure, create jobs, and reduce poverty. While special economic zones holdpromise to
stimulate investment and employment, the associated tax holidays could be costly, and better targeted tax
incentives would likely be more cost effective. Trade tariffs could be further reduced, buildingon recent
progress. Inaddition, steps to develop key financial markets (e.g., money, corporate bonds, and
derivatives) would facilitate investment (including infrastructure) and enable better riskmanagement as
the capital account opens further.

Overall, prospectsfor India's growth and macroeconomic stability remain good, and a higher
growth path could be achievedby acceleratingkey reforms. The staffreport on the 2006 Article IV
consultation with India was published on February 15,2007.
