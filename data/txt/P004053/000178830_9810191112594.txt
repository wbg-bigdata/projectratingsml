APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        A UNDP-financed study of Korea's 17 first class -/ ports, completed
by Lyon Associates (USA) and Economic Intelligence Unit (UK) in November
1972, has reviewed port traffic developments and concluded that containeriza-
tion will develop rapidly and that methods of handling dry bulk cargo need
to be improved. A first phase development was recommended for Busan and
Mukho as part of the 1972-76 Development Program. The need to change the
present organization of Korean ports was also emphasized.
ii.       Korea's 17 first class ports, including the proposed project ports,
Busan and Mukho, are presently operated under two independent bureaus in the
Ministries of Transport (MOT) and Construction (MOC) which broadly cover
the ports' operations and finances, and their development, construction and
maintenance. Additionally, the Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance
(MF) is closely involved in port operations. Budgets and expenditures are
controlled by the Government's Economic Planning Board (EPB). In practice
there is little control of operations, and too many operators are involved
in cargo movements, resulting in a low throughput capacity of the ports,
especially Busan. Development proposals are not always responsive to port
requirements and present financial arrangements are inadequate.
iii.      A Korean Port Authority (KPA) will be set up by June 1, 1975 with
jurisdiction initially over Busan and Mukho. By January 1, 1976 this juris-
diction will be extended to four other ports, and by 1978 to all Korean first
class ports. Port Units will be established to manage each of these ports.
KPA will report to the Minister of Transport who will approve the operational
budget which it prepares and the tariffs it proposes to finance its operations.
KPA will have the same autonomy as Korean statutory corporations and, through
its Port Units, be solely responsible for controlling cargo and shipping
movements. On January 1, 1974 a Busan-Mukho Project Unit (BHPU) will be
established to carry out the project and control Busan and Mukho until KPA
is established; it will be staffed from existing MOC and MOT units and report
to MOT. Until January 1, 1974 the preliminary phases of the project will
be carried out by MOT.
iv.       The project, estimated to cost US$131 million, covers the proposals
in the 1972-76 Development Program for Busan and Mukho and will meet traffic
requirements of these ports up to about 1986 by providing:
In Busan:
(a) a composite pier to handle containers and grain, with
storage silos, appropriate equipment and necessary dredging;
1/   Korea has designated its major ports as first or second class.



- ii -
(b) a dry bulk cargo-handling pier with integrated bulk-
handling systems, and necessary dredging;
(c)  international (Korea-Japan) and coastal ferry terminals;
(d)  rehabilitation of existing general cargo berths;
(e)  a new military berth to be financed in total by the Government;
In Mukho:
(f)  improvements to the coal-handling piers and the
mechanical loading system;
(g)  improvements to the existing breakwater;
(h)  minor improvements to general cargo and cement berths;
Consulting Services and Technical Assistance:
(i)  consulting services for the detailed engineering and
construction supervision of the above works; the deter-
mination of future development requirements. Technical
assistance to assist in establishing KPPA and training
some of its personnel.
The proposed Bank loan of US$80 million will finance the estimated foreign
exchange cost of all civil works, mechanical equipment and consulting services
except those involved in constructing the military berth at Busan. The
Government of Korea will finance the local currency cost, estimated at
US$43.5 million, and the foreign exchange cost of the military berth (US$7.5
million) for a total of US$51 million. The Bank loan will be to the Government
of Korea which will be responsible for project execution with the assistance
of consultants.
v.        With improvement in operational procedures under the new organi-
zation and the development of containerization foreseen in Korea, no new
general cargo berths will be required at Busan and Mukho and lighterage will
be eliminated.
vi.       Civil works and mechanical equipment procurement contracts will
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
vii.      The proposed project will earn an economic return of 32% calculated
in terms of the measurable direct economic benefits to the Korean economy.
The separately identifiable parts of the project will produce returns ranging
from 20% to 32Z, which have been established conservatively on the basis of
a 20-year benefit stream, 1977-96.
viii.     KPA will institute by January 1976 a cost-based tariff adequate to
produce revenue sufficient to meet its requirements and BMPU will apply agreed
interim financial measures by January 1974.



- iii -
ix.       The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$80 million to the Government of Korea for a term of 25 years, in-
cluding a five-year grace period, reflecting the average economic life of
the assets.






KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Korea has requested the Bank to assist in
financing improvements to the ports of Busan and Mukho which would consist
of new facilities for containers, dry bulk cargo handling and an interna-
tional ferry at Busan, and improvements to coal handling facilities at Mukho,
together with ancillary works, and some rehabilitation of existing general
cargo berths at both ports. The proposed project is based on a UNDP-financed
and Bank-supervised study by Lyon Associates Inc. (USA) in association with
the Economic Intelligence Unit (UK) (the Study Group) which drew up master
plans for the development of these two ports and Korea's 15 other first class
ports. The study was completed in November 1972.
1.02      The total cost of the proposed project would be US$131 million.  The
proposed loan for US$80 million would cover the foreign exchange component
of all project items except those pertaining to the construction of a new
military berth, to be financed by the Government. The loan would be to the
Government for a period of 25 years including a five-year grace period, re-
flecting the average economic life of the assets.
1.03      There has been no previous Port Loan to Korea; for Railways there
have been two Credits (25-KO and 110-KO), one Credit/Loan (183/669-K0) and
one Loan (863-KO).  There has been one Loan for Highways (769-KO).  Experience
on these transport loans has been satisfactory except as regards transport
coordination (paras 2.10-2.12).
1.04      This report is based on the report of the Study Group and the
findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. F. Higginbottom (engineer),
J.A. McCunniff (financial analyst - consultant) and 0. Rahkonen (economist)
which visited Korea in November/December 1972.  The mission was assisted in
the field by the Project Manager and Chief Economist of the Study Group.
II. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      Korea's GNP grew at an average annual rate of 11.7% between 1965
and 1971, and GNP per capita by 9.7% to reach US$280 in 1971. This rapid
economic expansion has been led by industrial development and the export of
manufactured goods. Investment increased from 11% of GNP in 1960 to 25% in
1971, while the share of exports in GNP went up from 4% in 1960 to 25% in
1971.



- 2 -
2.02      According to a recent Bank economic report on Korea - , economic
development is expected to continue at 8.6% annually during the Third Plan
period 1972-76. The Third Plan emphasizes stabilization of the economy,
reduction in the dependence on external savings for investments, and a
moderation in the growth rate of most national aggregates other than exports.
B.   Transport Sector
2.03      The rapid economic expansion in Korea during the 1960's has been
accompanied by growing transport demand. Domestic passenger traffic (pass-
km) in all modes increased by about 11% annually, domestic freight traffic
(ton-km) by about 13% and international freight traffic by 22%. But due to
relatively modest investments over the period 1962-66, the overall transport
system capacity was severely strained. The situation improved during the
second Five-Year Plan period, with investments in railways and highways, as
well as road transport and coastal shipping. Transport capacity still needs
to be augmented, however. Annex 1 presents the main features of the various
modes of transport.
2.04      The 1962-71 growth of traffic in each mode is shown in Table 1.
Railways have been handling substantial quantities of bulk, industrial com-
modities, and passenger traffic, although their share of total traffic has
been decreasing. Road transport has the largest share of passenger traffic
(71% in 1971) and has captured the bulk of this traffic's increase. Of the
total freight traffic (ton-km) increase, 40% accrued to coastal shipping,
34% to railways and 26% to highways. There was a spectacular growth in
port traffic, due mainly to increases in imports of oil, grain and lumber
and in coastal cargoes such as fuel, coal and cement.
2.05      Road transport is characterized by the limited length of paved
roads (10% of the total) and the relatively small number of motor vehicles
(Annex 1). Most roads are poorly designed gravel or earth roads. The limited
paving is due to the low priority given to roads until 1968 and concentration
on the toll expressways:  Seoul-Busan (428 km) and Seoul-Inchon (29.5 km).
2.06      In 1962, Korean National Railways (KNR) carried 87% and 51% of
total freight (ton-km) and passenger (pass-km) traffic respectively; by 1971
these had decreased to 49% and 27%. KNR will, however, continue to carry large
quantities of bulk commodities (notably coal, cement and oil) as well as
significant passenger traffic.  The capital, Seoul, is in urgent need of a
mass rapid transit system. For this purpose, and to improve freight traffic
services, KMR is electrifying the Seoul suburban and the main industrial
lines.

No. EAP-33a, November 3, 1972.



2.07      The expansion of port traffic has been larger than that applicable
to any other transport facility. In 1962 total freight handled was 7.5
million tons; in 1971 it was 51.0 million tons (Table 1). This growth is
mainly due to the expansion of foreign trade (Table 1), but there is a
similar trend for coastal trade which amounted to about 30% of total domestic
traffic (ton-km) in 1971, compared with about 5% in 1962. This rapid traffic
growth has resulted in port capacity problems, which threaten to become more
serious in future with the expected continued growth (para 5.04).
2.08      Korea's share of the merchant shipping tonnage handling Korea
traffic was a relatively modest 21% in 1971, about the same as in 1962. In
fact, the share has decreased from a high of 25% in 1969/70, indicating a
shortage of Korean tonnage; this is being alleviated with Bank (DFC)
participation.
2.09      Air transport is comparatively unimportant.  The privately owned
Korean Airlines provides domestic and some international flights; Korea is
also served by other international airlines. Most traffic is handled at
Seoul International Airport. Air freight traffic is minor.
C.   Transport Investment and Coordination
2.10      Recognizing the inadequacy of investments in transport during the
first Five-Year Plan period, which created transport bottlenecks, Government
increased the transport allocation in the second Five-Year Plan (1967-71)
to about 26% of the total capital formation. However, the use of funds was
not always in accordance with economic priority. Transport planning and
coordination have been inadequate, and responsibility scattered; MOC has
been responsible for road and port construction, and MOT for airports, the
railways, shipping and road transport regulations. The Economic Planning
Board (EPB) has been the only organization in a position to coordinate
transport investments, but it has not been staffed for this purpose.
Annex 2 describes the functions of the agencies related to the transport
sector, and the events leading to each organization's creation.
2.11.     About the end of 1969, the Government set up a three-tier organization
responsible for transport planning and coordination: the Transport Coordi-
nation Ministers Conference, the Transport Coordination Working Group and
the Transport Planning Office (TPO) within MOT. However, substantive issues
relating to investment planning and policy measures have not received ade-
quate attention (Annex 2).
2.12      This matter, which was dealt with in the Fourth Railway Loan,
signed in November 1972, requires continuous attention, as discussions be-
tween the Bank and relevant agencies indicates that transport coordina-
tion still receives relatively little attention by the Government. During
loan negotiations confirmation was obtained that the action program agreed
in the Fourth Railway Loan is proceeding on schedule.



III. PORT FACILITIES, ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
A.   Existing Facilities
3.01      The existing facilities at the project ports are generally unsa-
tisfactory for efficient operations. Quay aprons are narrow, the existing
paving poor, and lighting inadequate; maintenance is unsatisfactory.
(1) Busan (Map No. 2)
3.02      This is Korea's most important port and except for oil traffic, it
handled 35% of all Korean cargo in 1971. It has a natural harbor, further
protected by breakwaters, with commercial (Northern) and fishing (Southern)
sections. The entrance channel has 12 m depth of water (40,000 dwt ships).
Maximum tidal range is 1.2 m.
3.03      About 4,100 m berthage (Table 2) is available at four finger piers
and a central wharf; depth of water alongside is between 8.0 m and 10.2 m
(max. 15,000 dwt ships). Pier 3 (920 m) and part of the central wharf (190 m)
are used exclusively for military traffic, which restricts movement inside
the Customs fence. Oil traffic, mostly coastal, is handled in the outer
harbor. There are about 3,000 m of lighterage wharf and 25 ship anchorages
with 5 to 13 m depth. Adequate privately-owned lighters and tugs are availa-
ble; MOT has four ship-handling tugs. Container traffic is handled with
ships' own gear at the existing piers, by landing containers directly onto
semi-trailers. The process is slow.
3.04      There are 18 transit sheds with 48,000 m2 of floor area located
on the piers; they have no electricity or water, and all are in need of
maintenance. Open storage available is about 125,000 m2, some 15% of which
is paved. A total of 90 private warehouses are available outside the port
area 77 of which (72,000 m2 floor area) are bonded; they have no electricity.
3.05      Electricity and water are available on the piers, but lighting is
inadequate for night work. Maintenance is very poor, and rubbish needs to
be removed. Rail tracks and roads within the port are generally adequate,
but their standard of maintenance is poor.
3.06      There is one pneumatic grain unloader on lighter Wharf No. 7 which
feeds six private grain silos (10,000 ton total capacity). On Pier 4 there
is a cement handling system with two privately owned 10,000 ton silos; the
system is fed from specialized bulk cement ships with pneumatic unloaders.
Mechanical general-cargo-handling equipment is mostly privately owned
(Table 3).
(2) Mukho (Map No. 3)
3.07      Mukho is essentially a bulk coal and cement port, although some
general cargo is handled, and it is the base for a large fishing fleet. The
harbor is artificial, enclosed by two breakwaters, with a 9.5 m deep entrance



(10,000 dwt ships). Maximum tidal range is 0.2 m. Wave heights up to 0.9 m
maximum are experienced inside the harbor, and 0.5 m waves are common. Pre-
sently the harbor is unusable some 15-25 days per annum.
3.08      Berths available are (i) coal Piers A and B providing 87 m and
100 m berths with 6.5 m and 8.0 m alongside respectively (max. 8,000 dwt
ships), but foundation design forces ships to be moored off the berths,
(ii) a 330 m cement and clinker wharf with 9.5 m water (10,000 dwt ships)
and (iii) 130 m general cargo berth with 7.0 m alongside (6,000 dwt ships).
A further 130 m general cargo berth is under construction. Berth aprons are
adequate.  There are two transit sheds and six warehouses, the latter for
fisheries. Maintenance is generally poor.
3.09      Coal is delivered by elevated rail track into a 16 ha storage
area and conveyed by mechanical conveyors to mechanical loaders with fixed
arms on Piers A and B. The system's theoretical capacity is 600 tons/hr,
but difficulties in feeding the conveyors limit it to about 200 tons/hr.
3.10      For cement, also delivered by rail, there are three 10,000 ton
capacity silos and one of 10,000 ton capacity for clinker. Loading is by
pneumatic equipment (600 tons/hr) for cement and mechanical (300 tons/hr)
for clinker. All these are owned by Ssang Yong Cement Co. and are well
maintained.  There are two forklift trucks and two cranes, privately owned,
for general cargo.
B. Existing Organization, Planning, Finances and Procedures
(1) Organization
3.11      Korean ports are controlled by a number of agencies spread over
different Ministries; Law No. 1941, Ports Act, of March 30, 1967 divides
them into "designated ports" and "local ports". The 40 "designated ports"
are further divided into 17 first class and 23 second class; the latter are
operated by local government officials. The 17 first class ports (Table 4)
are placed under the Bureau of Marine Transportation of MOT for operational
and administrative control and under the Bureau of Harbor Development of MOC
for design and construction; the Customs Department of HOF is involved in
operations (para 3.14); port budgets are approved and controlled by EPB.
3.12      MOT operates through a headquarters organization in Seoul and nine
Marine District Bureaus at port level charged with management of ports and
direction of their use; safety, security, and navigation aids; licensing and
supervision of port operators and pilots; operation of railways within the
port area; and minor maintenance. The Hydrograpic and Communications Offices
of MOT are also involved in port matters.
3.13      HOC has a headquarters organization in Seoul, supervising five
Regional Bureaus and Harbor Construction sections; these in turn control
11 district port construction offices responsible for maintenance and repair



of the ports (by contract), dredging supervision, minor works design, cost
estimates, letting and supervising of contracts, MOC survey vessels, and
reclamation by private enterprise.
3.14      Annex 3 gives details of the organization and functions of MDT and
MOC for ports.
3.15      The Customs Department collects customs and tonnage dues, inspects
ships and cargoes, designates bonded areas, has custody of goods therein and
controls cargo movement in the ports (Annex 4). Immigration, health, quarantine
and police assistance are made available through the appropriate ministries.
3.16      This scattering of major port functions over three separate Govern-
ment agencies, plus EPB's budget control, results in weak, uncoordinated
management and adversely affects investment planning, finances, and opera-
tions, as noted below.
(2) Investment Planning
3.17      MOC gathers cargo m)vement data from MOT and the Customs Department,
develops plans, and submits these to the Central Port Committee 1/ for con-
sideration and finally to the Minister. *EPB makes a budget evaluation and
when this is approved by them and by the President of Korea, MOC executes
the projects. Upon completion it is handed over to MOT. This process results
in the effective exclusion of port operators' ideas, and the final product
is unlikely to ensure efficient port working. Transportation coordination
is poor (paras 2.10-2.12), and as a result port developments are often under-
taken without full consideration of alternatives for handling particular
traffic requirements. Proposals to change the procedures are discussed in
section C of this chapter.
(3) Finances
3.18      The present financial control is unsatisfactory.  It is organized
more for Government budget requirements than to assist port management. Ports
operate under budgets prepared by MOT and MOC and approved by EBP. Initial
budget recommendations are sought at port level but the headquarters' sections
responsible generally disregard these and use their own information. Inevi-
tably, discussions and revisions take place between the original proposal and
approval, but port staff is not kept informed. The result is a formalized
budget which is not properly attuned to port requirements. Application of
the budget allowance within each category is rigorously enforced and there is
little room for maneuver if unexpected expenditure needs arise. Port charges
(Chapter VI) are imposed by MOT, but are totally inadequate to cover expendi-
tures and are not cost-based. Presently tariffs can only be revised with
EPB's approval and increases are usually related more to national inflation
control than to the ports' requirements (Chapter VI).
1/   In theory only; in fact this committee has never met (Annex 3(2)(d)).



-7-
(4) Existing Operations
3.19      MOT is nominally responsible for operations but in fact exercises
little influence, and there are numerous organizations involved. Actual
physical cargo movement is undertaken by private licensed operators. Details
for Busan are in Annex 4. Currently Busan achieves a throughput of only
about 550 tons per m of berth per year on the available commercial berths;
this is low compared with other world ports where averages of about 850 tons
per m are common. There is no actual ship waiting time in the sense of a
queue of ships waiting, but this will develop if steps to improve the posi-
tion are not taken. About 40% of existing traffic is handled by lighter;
70% of all ships were worked less than 50% of the total hours spent in port
and half of these were worked at or below 30%. The reason for the low effi-
ciency can be summarized as follows: (i) responsibility for handling cargo
is fragmented and time and effort are wasted due to lack of coordination;
(ii) mechanical equipment and pallets are often used only when human labor
is incapable of the task; (iii) lighterage use is excessive and a signifi-
cant number of ships unload at anchorage and then move to a berth for loading;
(iv) transit sheds are often used as warehouses for long-term storage;
(v) documentation is excessive; Customs, for example, use 22 separate forms,
mostly to move items from one place to another within the port; and (vi)
Customs often controls cargo disposition and movements within transit sheds.
C. Proposed Reorganization
3.20      Existing fragmented control of ports will be replaced by a Korean
Port Authority (KPA) responsible to the Minister of Transport. KPA will be
operative June 1, 1975 with responsibility for the two project ports, to be
followed by Inchon, Kunsan, Masan, and Ulsan (the scheduled ports) on
January 1, 1976, and the remaining first class ports by 1978, in accordance
with the agreed plan of action in the Loan Agreement.
3.21      KPA's proposed structure is outlined in Table 5.  Essentially, it
will comprise a Director General and Deputy Director General with five main
departments responsible for planning, technical services, operations, ad-
ministration and finances, and with a separate internal audit section. A
computerized data processing center is foreseen, but this should be formed
only after KPA has gained operational and data collection experience, perhaps
two years after formation of KPA.
3.22      KPA will be subject to policy directives of the Minister but will
have independence and autonomy in its day-to-day operations similar to that
of statutory corporations in Korea. KPA will prepare its budget and will
have financial autonomy within the budget approved by MOT, subject only to
advising the Minister of EPB of substantial changes within the budget. It
will propose tariffs aimed at financing budget expenditures and the Govern-
ment will make good any revenue losses arising from its failure to approve
these tariffs.



3.23      The Director General will have the rank of Vice-Minister.  He will
advise the Minister on port matters and, in the Minister's absence, attend
cabinet meetings on such matters. Department Heads and Directors of Port
Units (para 3.26) will be appointed by the Director General subject to the
Minister's approval. All other staff will be appointed by the Director
General.
3.24      KPA will be responsible for (i) preparing port regulations,
(ii) formulating long- and short-term development plans, (iii) statistical
data collection and analysis, (iv) maintaining financial viability and
methods of accounting, (v) maintaining design and technical support services,
(vi) controlling inventory and purchases, (vii) formulating individual port
budgets and tariffs, (viii) establishing uniform costing procedures and
(ix) maintaining operational efficiency and documentation. The financial
aspects involved for the project ports and for KPA are further detailed in
Chapter VI.
3.25      The timetable for all necessary action to establish KPA, appoint
financial, operational and management/documentation consultants (Annex 5)
and introduce operating systems and procedures and new accounting methods will
be in accordance with the agreed plan of action. The specialist consultants
will train KPA's staff in the application of the new methods from mid-1975
to December 1976 except on specialized piers (para 4.02) where training will
have to follow completion of the works (Annex 5).
3.26      Each of KPA's first class ports will have a Port Unit headed by a
Port Director (Table 6). It may have sub-units to control adjacent ports.
Port Units will essentially comprise technical, operational, and adminis-
trative sections. The functions of the Port Units and proposed operating
methods are given in Annex 5.
3.27      The success of the advisory element of the specialist consultants'
work (para 3.25) will depend upon the Port Unit Directors taking timely action
on advice received. Any disputes at port level will be referred to the
Director General for resolution in consultation with the consultants'
Project Manager.
3.28      Pending the establishment of KPA, the Government has proposed and
the Bank has agreed that a Busan-Mukho Project Unit (BMPU) will be formed
not later than January 1, 1974 under MOT headed by a Director General
(Grade I - Civil Service) and comprising staff from MOC and MOT as required.
BMPU will, inter alia, be responsible for carrying out the project, operating
the project ports until June 1, 1975, and preparing terms of reference for
the specialist consultants (para 3.25) subject to approval by the Bank.
Until January 1, 1974, MOT will be responsible for carrying out the project.
Interim financial measures will be introduced by BMPU in January 1974 as
described in Chapter VI. It is anticipated that a nucleus of KPA staff will
come from this new bureau to ensure continuity. This is all set forth in
the agreed plan of action.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Korean Government Port Development Program
4.01      The Korean Government has prepared a Five-Year (1972-76) ports
program totalling Won 91,400 million (US$228 million). This was more than
the Study Group's recommendations by Won 19,300 million (US$48 million)
although about Won 10,500 million (US$26 million) of the excess involves
port developments at New Pohang to serve a proposed steel mill extension,
a project not included in the Study Group's recommendations. The Government
has now agreed to the Study Group's proposals except for a larger, Won 10,156
million (US$25.3 million) project at Inchon to be financed by Asian Development
Bank (ADB). The agreed program is now US$186 million. Details of the
Government and Study Group proposals are in Table 7.
B.  The Project
4.02      The project covers the Government's 1972-76 program for the ports
of Busan and Mukho, as proposed by the Study Group and amended following
the Bank's review of the proposals. Specifically the project will comprise:
(a) At Busan:
(i)  a composite pier with two 300 m container berths
and a stacking area, and a 260 m grain berth with
70,000 ton storage silos; all necessary equipment
for handling containers and unloading grain;
(ii) a bulk handling pier with one coal imports berth,
two for ores and mineral exports, and one for scrap
and heavy steel imports; appropriate cranes and
bulk handling systems;
(iii)  dredging to give a 13.5 m deep access channel, 10 m
depth alongside (15,000 dwt ships) at the bulk pier
and 12.5 m depth alongside (50,000 dwt and large
modern container vessels) at the composite pier;
(iv) a new international ferry berth with passenger and
roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) traffic facilities on
Pier 1 South; and rehabilitation of Pier 1 North
for general cargo;
(v)  coastal ferry berths with passenger facilities;
(vi) rehabilitation of Pier 2 for general cargo; and
(vii) a new military berth (not financed by the loan).



- 10 -
(b) At Mukho:
(i) new coal Piers A and B with improvements to existing
conveyor systems, and new mechanical loaders;
(ii) a new belt/reclaimer system in the existing open
storage area, for coal and limestone delivery to
the pier conveyor system;
(iii)  dredging at the new coal piers to give 8 m depth
alongside (8,000 dwt ships);
(iv)  raising the existing East breakwater to +5.0 m
elevation and strengthening the side slopes; and
(v) rehabilitation of existing cement and general cargo
berths.
(c) Consulting Services:
i)  for detailed design and supervision of construction
of the above; and
(ii) to prepare a Phase II development plan for the first
class ports.
(d) Technical Assistance:
to assist in formation of policies and procedures
in connection with and for KPA, and on-the-job
training of personnel in their application.
A detailed description of the project items is given in Annex 6 together
with an indication of the capacity of Busan and Mukho on completion of the
works.
4.03      The total estimated cost of the proposed project is Won 52,420
million (US$131 million equivalent) of which Won 35,000 million (US$87.5 mil-
lion) is estimated to be foreign exchange; the proposed loan would be for
Won 32,000 million (US$80 million) and would finance the foreign exchange
cost of all works except the military berth. The project's local currency
cost, Won 17,420 million, will be financed by the Government which wiln
also finance the foreign exchange cost of the military wharf, Won 3,000 mil-
lion equivalent. The Government has confirmed that the annual budget will
include the cost of the military wharf construction and allowance for con-
tingencies on the project.
4.04      Details of the cost estimates are given in Table 8 and summarized
below:

4.05      The cost estimates for civil works are based on unit prices for
similar works undertaken in Korea, or nearby countries, following preliminary
engineering design, and are considered adequate in the light of experience on
such works; estimates for mechanical equipment are based on recent purchases
of similar items or current manufacturers' quotations. Physical contingencies
have been calculated on the basis of 15% for civil works, and price con-
tingencies at 6% per annum of foreign exchange costs and 10% per annum of local
costs, to cover possible price increases from 1972. An allowance for the
effect of recent currency realignments has been included in the estimated costs.



- 12 -
C.   Project Execution
4.06      BMPU, to be formed on January 1, 1974 (para 3.28), will carry out
the project with the assistance of consultants until KPA takes over in
1975. The initial stages will be supervised by MOT until January 1, 1974.
D.  Consulting Services
4.07      Lyon Associates (USA) has been appointed by the Government for
final design and construction supervision. Specialist consultants in the
fields of port management/operations and port finances (para 3.25 and Annex
5) will be appointed to assist KPA and the Port Units and on-the-job training
of personnel. Consultants will also be appointed for a Phase II development
study of Korea's first class ports to conform with ecouoigic development
forecasts to about 1985 (Annex 7).
4.08      UNDP has indicated a provisional interest in financing the pro-
posed Phase II study with the Bank as executing agency, subject to the
Government's application. The Government's intention in this matter is
presently being clarified. In the event UNDP finances the study, the sum
included for it in the project will be transferred to coptiagncies.
E.   Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      The project will be executed under six civil engineering contracts,
five mechanical equipment procurement contracts and a grain silo civil/
mechanical contract (Table 9). All contracts will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding. The Government has indicated that no
import duties will be levied on items required for the project. It is not
likely that Korean industry will be able to supply any of the mechzanical
equipment required; however, provision has been made to allow a 15% preference
for local manufacturers.
4.10      The works are expected to be completed by mid-1978, assuming
effectiveness of the proposed loan by September 1973. Construction schedules
for Busan and Mukho are in Tables 10 and 11.
4.11      Disbursement for the project civil works will be p4 the basis of
61% of total costs, representing the estimated foreign   c p mponent.
If all civil works were let to Korean contractors, the foreign exchange
component would be somewhat less, and up to US$7.2 million couzLd be dis-
bursed against local expenditures in this event.  For consulting services
and mechanical equipment procurement, disbursement will be on the basis
of actual foreign exchange costs. Annual estimated project expenditure
is shown in Table 12 and the estimated schedule of disbursements for the
proposed Bank loan in Table 13.



- 13 -
F.   Expenditure outside the Project
4.12      The Government's agreed program is US$68 million in addition to
the proposed Bank-financed project at Busan and Mukho (para 4.01). During
the project construction period, investment in any one port will not exceed
that recommended by the Study Group, except for the ADB project at Inchon,
US$25.3 million, or as the borrower and the Bank may otherwise agree.
G.   Ecology, Urban Development and Employment
4.13      The proposed dredging and reclamation works at Busan would not
affect the ecology of the harbor; none of the dredged material is to be
dumped. None of the proposed works will affect any known urban development
plan, and the increased container traffic should result in an eventual
reduction in the total number of vehicles entering and leaving the port
and should reduce traffic congestion.
4.14      Inevitably the introduction of bulk-handling methods at Busan and
the increased efficiency at Mukho will reduce employment in the ports. Ac-
cordingly, recruitment to the existing labor force should be limited and
reduction achieved by attrition. The specialist consultants will make speci-
fic proposals for handling this problem. It is expected that the growth in
the area's economy will relieve the potential unemployment situation to some
extent.
H.   Future Development
4.15      Rehabilitation of Piers 3 and 4 and the Central Wharf, proposed
by the Study Group and agreed to by the Bank, cannot be undertaken before
the completion of the new military berth releases Pier 3 and the Central Wharf.
Furthermore, Pier 4 will be used for container traffic pending completion
of the composite pier. These rehabilitation works will be undertaken by KPA
from mid-1977 to end-1978 at an estimated cost of US$3.9 million and Won 1,240
million.
4.16      A proposed study to determine the development requirements of other
Korean ports in the light of the Government's industrial development proposals
will be undertaken with the help of consultants (paras 4.07 and 4.08 and
Annex 7).

V. TRAFFIC AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   The Project and the Third Development Plan 1972-76
5.01      The proposed project, which is part of the Third Development Plan
1972-76, has been designed (i) to reduce cargo handling and shipping costs
of existing exports, imports and coastal trade and (ii) to meet the require-
ments for increased port capacity resulting from implementation of the Third
Plan. The Government's overall development objective is to achieve a sustained
8.6% annual GNP growth during the Plan period 1972-76. This growth rate is
realistic (para 2.02). The 8.6% annual growth in GNP has been estimated to
result in a continued rapid expansion of Korean foreign trade, exports by
27.0% p.a. and imports by 11.5% p.a. In addition, coastal shipments are ex-
pected to show a high growth rate due to industrial expansion and an increase
in living standards which will generate a considerable demand for cement,
fuels and coal, the main coastal commodities. The Third Plan recognizes the
need for improvement of major ports, which in the past have received less
attention than highways and railways, as an important part of the overall
development strategy. The economic evaluation and traffic forecasts have
been based on the assumption that the overall development targets will be
achieved; the project has not been assumed to generate any development not
presently included in the Third Plan.
B.   Past and Present Traffic
5.02      During the period 1967-71, total cargo traffic through Busan port
grew 13.8% p.a. from 6.5 million tons to 10.9 million tons. Cargo traffic
through Mukho port grew during the same period from 1.7 million tons to
3.3 million tons or by 18.2% p.a. Details on shipping and past traffic
development are provided in Annex 8 and Table 16; Table 14 gives shipping
statistics; Table 15, combined ocean and coastal traffic.
5.03      At Busan, exports represented 2.0 million tons, or 18.3% of the
total of 10.9 million tons handled in 1971; imports were 4.9 million tons
(45.0%), and coastal shipping 4.0 million tons (36.7%) (Annex 8). General
cargo represented 3.9 million tons (35.8%), while dry and liquid bulk amounted
to 4.6 (42.2%) and 2.4 (22.0%) million tons, respectively. At Mukho, about
2.3 million tons (69.7%) represented dry bulk in coastal trade, while 0.7
million tons (21.2%) were exports of dry bulk; other cargoes were of minor
importance.
C.   Future Traffic Development
5.04      Details on future traffic development and containerization are
provided in Annex 8 and Tables 17 to 20. The forecasts indicate that the
total freight traffic at Busan will increase by 7.0% p.a. during 1972-86, while
the corresponding growth for Mukho port is estimated at 8.6%. Exports are
expected to increase at Busan to 4.3 million tons in 1986, or by 5.2% p.a;
at Mukho exports will reach about 3.6 million tons, growing by 11.5% p.a.
Imports will increase to 9.3 million tons (4.4% p.a.) at Busan but remain



- 15 -
unimportant at Mukho. Coastal shipments are expected to increase rapidly,
and reach 16.5 and 7.6 million tons in 1986 for Busan and Mukho, respectively,
corresponding to annual growth rates of 10.0% and 8.0%, mainly due to increased
demand for fuels and cement.
5.05      Exports and imports of general cargo are being rapidly container-
ized (Annex 8) at Busan and this development is expected to continue at an
annual growth rate of 19.0% and reach 3.8 million tons by 1986 when about
70% of the general cargo will be containerized at that port. In 1981, con-
tainerized cargo is estimated at 2.4 million tons with some 260,000 con-
tainers to be handled, including 56,000 on the international ferry berth.
The volume of general cargo at Mukho is small and is not expected to show any
significant future increase (Table 18). No containerization is anticipated
for this port.
D.   Economic Justification
(1) Calculation of Project Benefits
5.06      Project benefits have been calculated as the difference in
directly quantifiable port user costs with and without the project; indirect
benefits, if any, which may be induced within the non-port sector of the
economy were not quantifiable and have been excluded. The benefits have
been calculated separately by the following cost components:  (i) cargo-
handling costs in ports, (ii) costs of vessels in port and (iii) sea voyage
costs. Cost reductions, which may accrue in foreign ports through the use
of larger vessels and containers made possible by the improvements in the
project ports, have not been taken into account.
5.07      In both project ports, the proposed investments consist of a
combination of cost-reducing and capacity-increasing investments. Cost
reductions will be obtained for existing traffic through improved cargo
handling facilities. Increases in future user costs are avoided by invest-
ments in increased port capacity. Benefits have been calculated separately
for both of these components. It has been assumed that benefits resulting
from increased port capacity will accrue fully to the Korean economy because,
without the project, the shipping lines (freight conferences) would impose
surcharges, which would correspond to the increased ship waiting times in
port; the costs for charter would similarly increase. On the other hand,
benefits in the form of reduced costs to foreign carriers will be split
between the Korean economy and these carriers. The benefits to the Korean
economy will be recouped partly through the higher port charges which can be
applied (Chapter VI) and partly through reduced shipping rates for bulk exports
and imports (Annex 9). Benefits to Korean-flag vessels as well as reductions
in cargo handling costs in the project ports will all come to the Korean
economy. Coastal shipping is an integral part of the domestic economy and
is carried out by Korean flag vessels only.
5.08      The calculation of economic benefits resulting from, and attributed
to, the project investment has been detailed in Annex 9; the results of this
evaluation are summarized below. Investment costs in each case include all



- 16 -
works involved and the cost of design and supervision, but exclude cost
contingencies.
(2) Busan
5.09      The berth occupancy at Busan had reached a high level by 1971/72,
but was combined with a low operational efficiency (Annex 4). A rapid
increase in average ship waiting times is therefore to be expected if the
present operating conditions continue. The present operating conditions
have, however, not been used as a basis of comparison in calculation of the
economic return, because an improvement in cargo handling rates is assumed
to take place due to reorganization (Annex 5). The assumed operational
improvement does not require any investments other than some maintenance
dredging and rehabilitation of port facilities. The benefits have been
calculated from this improved operational base.
(a) Composite Pier
5.10      The Composite Pier, to be completed by the end of 1977, will provide
container and bulk grain handling facilities. The container facilities
will relieve the general cargo piers, while the grain handling facilities
will, together with Pier 7, replace the present uneconomic bulk handling
by lighters and at berths.
5.11      The investment in the Composite Pier will in 1977 result in
benefits to the Korean economy of US$2.73 per ton for grain (Table 21) and
of US$6.40 per ton for containerized general cargo (Table 22).   The total
benefits in that year are calculated at US$8.41 million (Table 26).
5.12      The investment cost of the Composite Pier amounts to US$47.7
million equivalent. In calculation of the economic return, dredging cost
required for deepening of the channel and port area - US$13.1 million - were
distributed between the Composite Pier and Pier 7, and 60% has been added
to the investment in the Composite Pier.
5.13      The first year return (FYR) will be 15.1% in 1977 on the basis
of the benefits and costs above. This return is satisfactory.
(b) Pier No., 7
5.14      Pier No. 7, to be completed by the beginning of 1977, will provide
facilities for bulk handling of coal, other minerals, ores, steel and
scrap.  This pier will, together with the Composite Pier, replace lighterage
and centralize the handling of dry bulk cargo.
5.15      Benefits to the Korean economy are calculated at US$1.49 per ton
for coal (Table 23) and US$1.03 per ton for other minerals, ores, steel
and scrap (Table 24).   Total benefits amount to US$3.67 million in 1977,
the assumed year of completion of Pier 7 (Table 26).



- 17 -
5.16      The investment cost of Pier 7 is US$18.3 million equivalent.  To
this cost has been added US$5.2 million equivalent, representing the remaining
40% of the total dredging cost.
5.17      The FYR in 1977 will be 15.6%, which is satisfactory.
(c) International and Coastal Ferries
5.18      The international and coastal ferry terminals will be completed
by the middle of 1976. The international ferry terminal will be used by
roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) ferries between Korea and Japan, which will mainly
ship trailer-fitted containers, and thus complement the container facilities
on the Composite Fier. In addition, the ro-ro ferries will serve a rapidly
increasing passenger traffic (Table 16). The coastal ferry terminal will
replace the existing facilities, which are scattered at various temporary
locations within the port area. They provide mainly passenger services
within Korean waters.
5.19      The savings in transport cost from the international ferry
terminal are calculated to be US$4.84 per ton, and US$3.00 million total
in 1977, for containerized cargo handled. As in the case of the container
traffic ever the Composite Pier, these savings will gradually increase
due to increased future traffic. Details of benefit calculations are in
Table 25 and Annex 9. The benefits of the coastal ferry terminal have
been estimated at US$0.20 per passenger, resulting in US$0.48 million total
for 1977. The estimate is conservative.
5.20      The investment cost in the international and coastal ferry terminal
amounts to US$13.2 million equivalent, and the estimated US$3.48 million of
benefits will give a high FYR of 26.4%.
(d) Total Project - Busan
5.21      The total project cost for the proposed works in Busan port
amounts to US$94.1 million equivalent. The corresponding benefits in 1977
amount to US$15.6 million (Table 26), resulting in a satisfactory FYR of
16.5%. The corresponding economic rate of return is above 30% (Table 26).
(3) Mukho
5.22      Mukho is essentially a two-commodity port, with substantial
shipments of coal and cement (Table 18). About 72% of the proposed works
relate to the improvement of coal handling facilities, while the remaining
part represents minor rehabilitation and dredging works and a major improve-
ment of the breakwater. The economic evaluation of the project investment
in Mukho port has been carried out in terms of the improvement of the coal
handling facility only, and the other improvements have been included as
associated improvements (Annex 9).
5.23      The improvement of the coal handling facilities will result in a
saving of US$0.61 per ton in 1977, the total savings being US$1.38 million



- 18 -
(Table 26). The corresponding investment cost amounts to US$9.3 million.
The FYR on this basis is 14.9% which is satisfactory. The economic rate of
return is about 20%, calculated on a conservative basis.
(4) Economic Evaluation Summary
(a) First-Year Rate of Return ;(FYR)
5.24      The total project cost is US$103.4 million, excluding US$12.8 mil-
lion in contingencies for price escalation and US$2.4 million for further
studies and technical assistance. The corresponding project benefits are
estimated at US$16.9 million in 1977 (Table 26), resulting in a FYR of 16.4%.
The breakdown by main project components is provided in Table 26.
(b) Economic Return (ER)
5.25      The ER on the project investment has been calculated as 32% (Table
26), including benefits which are estimated to be obtained during the period
1977-96. Benefits have, however, been considered as constant after 1986; by
that year the increased capacity provided by the project will be fully utilized
and another capacity increase will be required. Further, the ER expresses
the return to the Korean economy, because it excludes that part of the cost
reductions (about 27% of the total in 1977) which is assumed to be retained
by the foreign carriers and not passed on to the Korean economy (para 5.07,
Annex 9 and Tables 21-25).
(c) Sensitivity of Economic Return
5.26      The project feasibility is marginally sensitive to changes in costs and
benefits. In the case of a 15% increase in costs and a corresponding slippage
in benefits, the ER would still be 27%, which is satisfactory.
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.  Rates and Charges
6.01      Charges currently levied by MOT and MDF consist for the main part
of port dues, light dues, dockage, tug hire, transit shed and open storage
charges, and warehousing. Cargo-handling charges are applied by concessionaires
at rates approved by MOT. As the tariff system has evolved from various pres-
sures, mostly political and budgetary, costs have had little or no influence.
A summary of present port charges is set forth in Table 27.  Tonnage dues
(hereinafter called port dues) were increased by 100% on January 1, 1972.
Otherwise, charges have not been raised for many years. In comparison, whole-
sale prices have risen about 300% since 1960 and 84% since 1965. Port charges
therefore have been reduced substantially in real terms.
6.02      The level of charges is low and, in addition, the tariffs provide
exemptions and highly preferential rates for coastal traffic, which pays



- 19 -
no port dues, only one-fourth of light dues and no wharfage, so that except
for storage, most structures are provided free of charge. Thus, direct-
delivery cargo pays nothing to the Government. In 1971 coastal cargo
represented 37% of all cargo at Busan and 70% at Mukho.
6.03      Storage charges are inadequate either as revenue producers or as
incentives for fast clearance of goods. At Busan, transit sheds are in
effect used by Customs for warehousing, at rates far below those of private
warehousing.
6.04      To introduce more definitive cost-related rates for port services
by January 1, 1976, the costs of each principal tariff service will have
to be developed, including all cargo-handling services. The costing
procedures to be developed are to be agreed with the Bank and should be
basically uniform for all ports. The advantages of uniformity are obvious.
The basic classification of costs in conformity with the tariff cost centers
will provide guidelines for realistic ledger accounts for the accounting
system to be introduced. A modern commercial-type tariff containing definitions,
rules of application and rates for all services at each scheduled port is
required. The assistance of consultants will be provided for these tasks,
in accordance with the plan of action.
B.   Past Earnings
6.05      The status of port accounting procedures is currently inadequate.
No single and complete set of accounts is prepared for the ports sector.
The Study Group, over an extended period, was able to develop actual operating
expenses for the year 1971 only. They should be considered as approximations.
Revenues, however, are recorded in detail.
6.06      Table 28 shows operating revenues of the 17 first class ports over
the period 1967-71; the increase is almost 150%. Total Korean cargo traffic
rose by 178% during the same period. Revenues for 1972 are partly actual
and partly estimated, and incorporate the 100% increase in tonnage dues
on January 1, 1972.
6.07      Notional income accounts for 1971 and 1972 are in Table 29.  They
show that, for both Project ports combined, deficits of Won 341.4 million
and 35.0 million resulted in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Busan was in
profit (Won 110 million) in 1972 but only because maintenance was deferred
pending substantial rehabilitation or replacements during the project period.
6.08      This situation is clearly unsatisfactory, principally because of
the deficiencies in the tariffs referred to above. Remedial measures
are described below.
C.   Rate Policy
6.09      Charges assessed by the Government at Busan and Mukho are a small
proportion of the value of the cargo. The ports' zones of influence are
well defined, and the inter-port competition is small, resulting in an
inelastic demand for port serviees,- Thus, higher port charges ax  not



t
- 20 -
likely to divert port traffic; nor should it be expected that lower rates
would induce higher traffic volumes. Thus, a plan to achieve financial
viability would not reduce demand nor result in a distortion of economic
traffic distribution. The Government intends to pursue a policy of financial
viability for its ports with port charges reasonably related to fully dis-
tributed costs. In virtually all cases, since there appears to be little if
any difference between fully distributed and marginal costs for Government
services (port dues, dockage and wharfage), Government costs will be fixed
costs. Revision of rates for Government services, in accordance with these
concepts, will be accomplished on definitive bases by January 1, 1976.
Accounting consultants' services will be needed. The above uatters and the
need to introduce remedial measures as of January 1, 1974 to improve the
ports' finances on an interim basis prior to definitive action (para 6.16)
were discussed and agreed during negotiations.
6.10      Government services are a relatively small part of the total cost
of putting cargo through the scheduled ports, especially at Busan. A larger
portion stems from cargo-handling services performed by commercial operators
at rates approved by MDT. These charges should also be reasonably related
to their costs, including maintenance and depreciation of, and a reasonable
return on, the facilities now provided at no cost to the operators. It was
agreed during negotiations that, after determination of cargo-handling costs
by the consultants, and no later than January 1, 1976, a concession fee will
be charged to all operators based on their exclusive and/or proportionate
use of Port Authority facilities.
6.11      Progressive application of the foregoing rate policies to the first
class Korean ports, other than the project and scheduled ports, is included in
the agreed plan of action.
D.   Financial Obiectives
6.12      The project and scheduled ports should be financially viable, should
no longer rely on Government subsidies and should recover their fully dis-
tributed costs from port users based on their use of port facilities. To this
end, the internally-generated cash of each scheduled port should be sufficient
to cover ti) fully distributed cash costs (excluding depreciation); (ii) debt
service; and (iii) a reasonable portion of capital investments, including
replacements. Internally-generated cash should also cover adequate cash work-
ing capital and reserves for contingencies. The returns which would provide
adequate cash flow at both Busan and Mukho are discussed in paragraphs 6.18
and 6.24. The appropriate return on net fixed assets in use in 1978 for Busan
and Mukho, and for KPA as a whole, is given in paragraph 6.27.
E.   Future Earnings, Finances and Financing Plan
(1) Initial Authority Capitalization
6.13      The Government's opening equity in the Port Authority is considered
to consist of (i) the value of all assets, including land vested in the
Authority; these are presently estimated as shown on the balance sheets for



- 21 -
Busan and Mukho as of December 31, 1975; (ii) cash working capital, consisting
of about 10% of estimated annual cash operating expenses (excluding deprecia-
tion), now estimated at Won 130 million for Busan and Won 20 million for
Mukho; and (iii) the estimated value of stores to be transferred to the Port
Authority for commencement of operations.
(2) Valuation of Assets
6.14      The Study Group has provided present values (1972) of land and
other property used by each of Korea's 17 principal ports; consideration was
given to values prepared by the Korea Appraisal Board, details of recent
land sales in the vicinity, and the estimates of local officials. Engineer-
ing estimates were employed in respect to structures. Assets of great age
were considered valueless and those planned to be replaced during 1972-76
or by the project were written down so as to be of no value when replacement
occurs. Except as to land, the values presented have been accepted for the
purpose of project appraisal and are the bases of the fixed asset and Govern-
ment capital data shown in the balance sheets for 1973, after deducting
depreciation for 1972. Land values at Busan and Mukho were estimated by
the Study Group at Won 100,000 (US$250) and at Won 45,000 (US$112) per
pyong 1/, respectively. These values have been reduced to a more realistic
Won 30,000 and Won 12,000 per pyong, respectively.
6.15      Estimated income accounts, balance sheets and cash flow statements
for Busan are in Tables 30, 31 and 32, and for Mukho in Tables 33, 34 and 35.
Assumptions on which the forecasts have been prepared are in Annex 10.
(3) Future Earnings and Finances - Busan
6.16      Revenues will be much improved, beginning in 1974, when the follow-
ing two-stage rate adjustments are adopted. A new charge, wharfage (for
cargo passage over or through the terminal), will be introduced in 1974. No
cargo or other handling operation is included in wharfage. Present tonnage
and light dues, both of which are charged on the registered tonnage of ships,
will be combined and redesignated as port dues. A new "service charge"
against the ship should be introduced on January 1, 1976; this would recover
the costs of tallying and of cargo security as well as of general expenses.
The revenues per unit used in the financial projections are as follows:
Tariff Item          Unit          Effective January 1 (Won)
1974       1976      1978
Wharfage          Revenue Ton      50          100       112.5
Port Dues         Each GRT          5.0         20        22.5
Dockage           -Each GRT/Hr      0.65        0.65       4.5
Service Charge    Revenue Ton        -         50         67.5
1/   One pyong - 3.6 m2 (4 sq yd).



- 22 -
The 1976 adjustments relate to the completion of Pier 1, the coastal and
international ferries and general channel dredging as of January 1, 1976.
The dockage adjustment is deferred to 1978, when the Composite Pier, final
dredging and the grain silo are scheduled for completion, even though Pier
7 should be completed as of January 1, 1977. The service charge is increased
in 1978 when tonnage passing over the general cargo wharves will be reduced
(Annex 5). The reduction of chargeable units will increase the costs and
revenues per unit. Service charge revenues will decline substantially in
1977 and 1978. Forecasts are based on agreed tariffs for 1974 and indicative
tariffs for 1976 and 1978; actual charges for 1976 and after will be cost-
based with the assistance of consultants (para 6.04). Their implementation
and their timing was agreed during negotiations.
6.17      The operating ratios, times interest earned, debt service coverages
and rates of return for the years 1974 to 1981 are in Table 30 and are given
below for 1974 and 1981.
Operating     Times Interest      Debt Service
Year      Ratios            Earned           Coverages        Rates of Return
1974        67               1.6                2.9                4.0
1981        49               1.6                1.3                6.1
6.18      The capital-intensive nature of the port results in a high ratio
of revenue to investment, since the port only provides and maintains the
wharves and sheds while others actually perform the stevedoring and cargo-
handling. The operating ratios shown in Table 30, although they superficially
appear unduly favorable, are satisfactory for this reason.
6.19      The other ratios are good, except for the failure to earn all
interest payments in 1975, 1976 and 1977; this is acceptable, since there are
no debt repayments in these years and the debt service coverage is adequate.
6.20      The current, liquid, and debt/equity ratios are shown in the
balance sheet, Table 31, and are satisfactory. The debt equity ratio in
1977, 56/44, represents the portts peak liability in respect of the proposed
loan, and is acceptable. Cash flow data (Table 32) assume Government
grants to carry out the investment program up to December 31, 1975, as is
the present practice. A further grant on June 1, 1975 of Won 210 million
is assumed to cover stotes and to provide additional initial working capital.
Surplus cash would be generated beginning in 1979 and would amount to about
Won 700 million.
6.21      During 1974-81, internally-generated cash would be available to
cover 16% of capital investments.  This coverage would amount to 20% during
the first six years of the Authority's existence, 1976-81.  This is satis-
factory.  The Bank and Government loans cover 59% and 16% respectively.  Repay-
ment of the Government loans has been spread over eight years starting in 1979.
Thus in effect the Authority's contribution over 1976-81 is 43%. The financing
of the investments would be as shown in Table 32 and summarized below:

F.   Future Earnings and Finances - Mukho
6.22      In order to attain financial viability at Mukho, rates should be
so adjusted as to produce revenues per unit, as indicated below:
Tariff Item           Unit          Effective January 1 (Won)
1974      1976        1977
Wharfage           Revenue Ton       1.5        1.5        20
Port Dues          GRT              30        60           60
Dockage            GRT/Hr            1.5        1.5         3.0
Service Charge    Revenue Ton         -        6.25         6.25
6.23      In the case of wharfage and dockage, adjustment of the interim
tariff is deferred to 1977, because Coal Pier B and the rehabilitation of
the cement and central wharf will not be operational until January 1, 1977.
The breakwater improvements, however, will be completed early in 1976, thus
affecting costs related to port dues in that year. The service charge is
generally related to low-volume general-cargo traffic which is largely
coastal, and revenues are related to fixed labor force costs rather than
cargo volumes. Implementation and timing of these proposed tariff changes
was agreed during negotiations. Forecasts are based on agreed tariffs for
1974 as listed above and indicative tariffs for 1976/77; the actual values
for 1976/77 will be cost-based with assistance from consultants (para 6.04).
6.24      The operating ratios, times interest earned, debt service coverages,
and rates of return for 1974-81 are in Table 33 and are given below for
1974 and 1981.

The operating ratios, like those at Busan, superficially appear unduly favor-
able.  The same comments apply (para 6.18).  Earnings under the adjusted rates
would be satisfactory.
6.25      The balance sheet data (Table 34) reflect a good financial posi-
tion during the entire 1974-81 period. In 1976 there will be a cash shortage
amounting to Won 166.6 million; thereafter the current and liquid ratios are
satisfactory. Debt equity ratio would range from 16/84 in 1974, when debt
is lowest, to a peak 37/63 in 1976, 1977 and 1978, falling to 31/69 in 1981,
which is acceptable.
6.26      During the 1974-81 period, internally-generated funds would provide
38% of the capital investment requirements and would rise to 61% in the
1976-81 period. The financing of the investments would be as indicated in
Table 35 and is summarized below.

G.   Rate of Return
6.27      Pending assessment of actual costs and determination of appropriate
charges for the four scheduled ports and the other first class ports to be
included in KPA in addition to Busan and Mukho, an overall rate of return for
KPA cannot be determined. For Busan and Mukho a return of 6% on net fixed
assets in 1978 will be satisfactory. During negotiations it was agreed with
the Government that the rate of return on the net fixed assets at Busan and



- 25 -
Mukho will be not less than 6% in 1978 and thereafter, and that the return
in 1978 and thereafter for KPA as a whole will be agreed between KPA, the
Government and the Bank following completion of the financial consultants
report.
H.   Auditing and Insurance
6.28      The accounts and financial statements of the Port Authority when
established will be annually audited by independent qualified auditors
satisfactory to the Bank.
6.29      The Port Authority will provide adequate insurance through com-
mercial insurers or otherwise in accordance with sound business practices
and in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, as discussed and agreed during
negotiations.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      The following major items were discussed and agreed with the
Government during negotiations:
(a)  the execution of the project by MOT until January 1, 1974
by which date the Busan-Mukho Project Unit (BMPU) will be
established for that purpose. KPA will be established by
June 1, 1975 and will then take over the project from
BMPU (para 3.28);
(b) the form of KPA, its financial and operating status
and duties and the organization and duties of the Port
Units; dates for implementing and completing action to
establish KPA and individual Port Units, and extending
their jurisdiction to various ports in accordance with
the agreed plan of action in the Loan Agreement (paras
3.20-3.27);
(c) the Government's annual budget for local currency cost
of the project to include the Military Wharf and project
item contingencies (para 4.03);
(d) appointment of consultants for the aecond development
plan and to assist KPA in devising and introducing new
operating procedures and an accounting system (paras 4.07-
4.08);
(e) limitation of expenditure on ports other than the project
ports to that recommended by the Study Group except for
the agreed investment financed by ADB at Inchon (para 4.12);
and



- 26 -
(f) financial viability of KPA; introduction of interim
remedial measures by January 1, 1974, and further
permanent tariff increases in 1976 so that KPA will
earn a financial rate of return of not less than 6%
on the next fixed assets of Busan and Mukho by 1978,
and an overall financial rate of return for all KPA ports
in 1978 to be agreed between it, the Government and the
Bank on completion of the financial consultants report
(paras 6.16, 6.22 and 6.27).
7.02      The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank Loan of US$80
million to the Government of Korea for a term of 25 years, Including a five-
year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Transport Infrastructure, Equipment and Operations

APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Transport Coordination
1.        To provide a basis for improving transport planning and coordination,
a study was financed under Credit S-4 KO and carried out by consultants
BCEOM/NEDECO (France/Netherlands). Based on this study, Credit Agreement
183-KO provided that measures to achieve adequate coordination in transport
would be agreed with the Bank Group. The consultants' final report (May
1970) suggested, as a long-term solution, placing responsibility for all
transport modes under one Ministry. This was not acceptable to the Govern-
ment. Toward the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970, the Government
set up a three-tiered organization responsible for transport planning and
coordination: the Transport Coordination Ministers Conference (TCMC), the
Transport Coordination Working Group (TCWG) and the Transport Planning
Office (TPO) within the Ministry of Transport (MOT). The functions of these
agencies are described below:
(a) The Transport Coordination Ministers Conference (TCMC) was
established in January 1970 to coordinate and discuss trans-
port plans and policies at the ministerial level. TCMC
consists of the Ministers of EPB, MOC, MOHA 1/, MOF 2/,
National Defense, MOCI 3/, MOT and the Minister Without
Portfolio, and is headed by the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of EPB.
(b) The Transport coordination Working Group (TCWG) was established
in September 1970 as an instrument of TCMC and is intended
to provide liaison and information from the Ministries
concerned at the working level. This group also deals with
monthly traffic allocation between rail and coastal shipping.
(c) The Transport Planning Office (TPO) in MOT was organized
in December 1969 for appropriate coordination of the trans-
port sector and is designated as a permanent body to serve
as the secretariat of TCHC. It was intended that TPO should
be responsible for undertaking economic analysis and rendering
professional advice to TCMC on investment planning and
important transport policy matters, including licensing,
pricing and taxation.

3/   Ministry of Commerce and. Industry

2.        However, substantive issues relating to investment planning and
policy measures have not received adequate attention, despite their importance
in view of the expected large investments in the transport sector during
the 1972-76 Plan period (about 24% of total capital investment).
3.        The matter of transport coordination was discussed during nego-
tiations for the Fourth Railway Loan signed in November 1972, and an action
program was agreed upon. To make the work of TCMC, TCWG and TPO more
effective, even within the present organizational structure, the functions
and work program of TPO, including the collection and preparation of sound
data relating to costs and operation of all modes of transport, will be
reviewed and TPO will furnish periodical reports thereon to the Bank. Also,
there is to be an early strengthening of the economic expertise in TPO by
direct appointment and/or training. (This is also partly covered by the
financing of training of TPO staff under the First Highway Loan, Loan 769-KO,
1971.) Further, a Government directive will be issued to all relevant
Government agencies, including MOC, to ensure that all ma;or inveatment
proposals related to transport are passed to TPO for economic appraisal and
coordination purposes.

APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Present Port Administration
Functions of Government Departments Involved
A. Responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport
1.        The existing arrangements for port management undertaken by the
Ministry of Transport are included in the following staff-level offices,
bureaus and sections, supported by port-level executive branches. The
staff-level units concerned are:
-    Planning and Coordination Office
-    General Affairs Division
-    Bureau of Marine Transportation, Hydrographic Office.
The functions and duties of these departments are outlined below.
2.        The Planning and Coordination Office, which is headed by the most
senior civil servant within the Ministry, preides a secretariat service
to the Minister and Vice-Minister and develops, controls, and coordinates
overall transportation policy as approved by the Minister. These activities
are organized through:

ANNEX 3
Page 2
(f) Internal Audit and Inspection
(g) Legal Affairs.
3.        The General Affairs Division deals with personnel management within
an organizational framework devised by the Administration and Management
Division of the Planning and Coordination Office. It is thus concerned with
recruitment, training, pensions and associated personnel administrative
matters. Additionally, this division is responsible for general services
associated with a headquarters office, such as building administration, office
supplies, ceremonial duties, administrative vehicles, and documentation
control and flow. It is also responsible for financial control and liaison
over cash flow with the Ministry of Finance within the framework of the
budgets controlled by the Planning and Coordination Office.
4.        The Bureau of Marine Transportation is involved in a wide range of
marine transportation matters. Its responsibilities are carried out by the
following staff-level divisions and sections under thi control of the Director
with District Marine Bureau and port representation as needs demand:
(a) Coastal Division
Acts as secretariat to the Director.
(b) Port Division
Responsible for port matters, and through its Port Affairs,
Planning and Facilities Sections, is concerned with:
- Improvement of port management
- Control of port traffic
- Licensing of commercial business in port area
- Port traffic statistics
- Port development plans
- Supervision of pilots' activities
- Promotion, advertisement and training of staff
- Port facilities and equipment operation
- Port security
- Management of port assets.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(c) Vessel Division
Through the Vessel and Safety Sections:
-  Vessel inspection and survey
- Ship registration
- Improvement of vessel standards
- Liaison with MOCI over ship-building
- Sea accidents
- Licensing of salvage operators
- Pollution control of sea water
- Ship-building and repair standards and facilities.
(d) Crew Division
(e) Communications Division
This division was established two years ago following a marine
disaster and is in course of development. The aim is to
provide an adequate communication system to minimize the effects
of disasters at sea and to provide a flow of meteorological and
hydrographic information to vessel operators. Ultimately, it
is hoped to provide television dock surveillance and radio
communications to ship and port operators and associated
agencies.
5.        Hydrographic Office.  Through headquarters at Seoul and the
Busan Branch Office and additional navigational aids personnel controlled
by other District Marine Bureaus, this office carries out the following
functions:
-    Conducts hydrographic surveys and oceanographic observations
in Korean waters and adjacent seas.
-    Collects hydrographic and oceanographic information from all
available sources to promote safe navigation of vessels.
-    Provides for the national and international agencies concerned,
with accurate nautical charts, sailing directions, notices
to mariners and related navigational publications.
-    Contributes hydrographic and oceanographic information for
the exploitation of land cultivation, tidal-land reclamation
and marine resources.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
-    Authorizes and supervises the hydrographic survey and its
products carried out by other agencies.
-    Authorizes and supervises the reprinting or copy of
navigational publications issued by other agencies.
-    Maintains and establishes the navigational aids along the
coasts of Korea for safe navigation.
-    Acts as the national representative to the International
Hydrographic Organization and International Association of
Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) to encourage international
exchange of technical information for the development of
hydrography and oceanography.
6.        District Marine Bureaus. As seen on the enclosed organization
chart, the District Marine Bureaus report directly to the Vice-Minister.
They also, however, work through the Bureau of Marine Transportation. The
functions of the District Bureaus reflect, to a large degree, those of the
divisions of the Bureau of Marine Transportation. The organization chart
showing the divisions and sections of the Busan Marine Bureau, included
as an example, points up this similarity in structure and responsibility
assignment. It should be pointed out, however, that only in the ports of
Busan and Inchon are responsibilities of the District Bureaus so extensive
and so formally structured. Most of the other District Bureaus have only
Administration, Marine Affairs, and in some cases Maritime Safety and
Navigational Aids Divisions. No District Bureau, with the exception of
Busan and Inchon, has a Vessel Division or Crew and Inspection Divisions or
Sections. The ports of Busan, Inchon, and Mogpo do, however, have branch
offices of the Office of Marine Accident Inquiry, which is an agency within
MOT but separate from the Bureau of Marine Transportation.
B.   Responsibilities of the Ministry of Construction
7.        Bureaus at the staff level in the Ministry of Construction are:
-    Planning and Management Office
-    General Affairs Section
-    Foreign Construction
-    Resident Office
-    National Physical Planning
-    Housing and Urban Planning
-    Water Resources
-    Public Roads



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Harbor Development
-    Management.
In addition, the following specialist agencies and offices report directly to
the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Construction.
-    National Construction Research Center
-    Construction Officials Training Center
-    Heavy Equipment Plant
-    Major Expressway Construction Office
-    Kyongju Development Construction Office.
Of the above, the Planning and Management Office, General Affairs Section,
Management Bureau, and the Bureau of Harbor Development are presently
involved in port organization and management functions to some degree.
Unlike the first three, however, the Bureau of Harbor Development is largely
concerned with port matters.
8.        The Bureau of Harbor Development, Ministry of Construction, carries
out its work through a Harbor Planning Division, a Coastal Management
Division, a Port Construction Division and a Dredging Division. The Ministry
maintains a Port Construction Office in most ports administered by the
Port Section of the Regional Construction Bureau from which a number of
ports are administered. Thus, port planning, design and construction are
carried out within the individual port by assigned staff using local
contractors as appropriate. Major port maintenance and repair are performed
by employees of the local Port Construction Office; minor maintenance and
repair are the obligation of Ministry of Transportation. Dredging is done
by contract with Korea Dredging Corporation under the jurisdiction of HOC.
(a) Harbor Planning Division is responsible for
- Staff function - assist Harbor Bureau Director
- Developing the overall development plans for 40 designated
harbors and canals
- Annual project selection and budgeting
- Foreign loan procurement and technical assistance in
ports construction
- Port statistics
- Analysis and adjustment of port investment efficiency
(cost benefit work).

(b) Harbor Construction Division
- Construction of ports and canals; improvement planning
and surveying; and design research
- Port planning according to industrial development plans
in port area
- Directing and supervising port construction
- Maintenance of port and canal facilities (there are
currently no canals in Korea although some, notably
the Seoul-Inchon Canal, are being considered).
(c) Dredging Division
- Dredging, planning, and surveying of ports and canals
- Planning and surveying of port navigational channels and
mooring facilities
- Supply and demand and repair plan of dredging vessels
- Technical training and supervision of Korea Dredging
Corporation.
(d) Coastal Management Division
(i) Port Administration Section
- Establishment and research of port law, excluding
laws relating to fishing ports; submits MOT
coordinated law proposals to the Office of
Legislation in the Prime Minister's Office, who
in turn submits them to Congress
- Approval of private development in all 40 Korean
ports
-  Organizing port committees including the advisory
committee to the Minister of Construction and nine
regional committees. The Central Port Committee
has never met and only exchanges documents.  The
regional committees report to the Central Port
Committee.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
(ii) Public Water Area Management Section
- License reclamation proposals and utilization of
reclaimed areas
- License of private facilities using sea area (the
level of rental is set by Seoul Headquarters, not
by Regional Construction Offices).
(iii) Seashore Conservation Section - all Korea
- Statistics collection
- Establishment of oceanographic observation survey and
planning
- Survey of coastline for:
Tourism
Construction materials
Fishing
Development/construction recommendation.
9.        The Regional Construction Bureaus exercise their port responsibi-
lities through their Harbor Construction Sections. As shown on the
accompanying organization chart, the Harbor Construction Sections are
connected with the Bureau of Harbor Development as well as to their respective
Regional Bureaus. General administrative and executive control is provided
by the Regional Bureau while technical responsibilities for ongoing and planned
construction and maintenance projects are directed by the Harbor Development
Bureau. The Harbor Construction Sections of the Regional Bureaus are
responsible for the administration of the planning and construction of port
facilities, and they act chiefly as a consolidation point for information
and for management.
10.       The actual control and inspection of harbor construction projects
take place at the individual Port Construction Office level. The specific
responsibilities of these offices are summarized as follows:
(a) Construction Sub-section:
- Design of minor facilities based on Seoul Headquarters
criteria
- Cost estimates
- Supervision of contracts
Dredging
Public water area reclamation
General construction and maintenance



ANNEX 3
Page 8
- Control of MOC vessels engaged in sounding and survey work
- Supervision of activities at various ports.
(b) General Affairs Sub-section:
- Maintains accounts
- Purchases construction materials and office supplies
- Controls materials warehouse
- Issues public water area license (revenue collected and
controlled by Regional Bureau)
- Selects contractors for minor contracts (contracts
in excess of Won 1,000,000 are usually handled by Seoul
Headquarters).

ANNEX 4

KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Existing Port Operations at Busan and Present Port Capacity
A.   Existing Operations
1.        There is little control of operations by the Busan District Marine
Bureau, the local unit of the Bureau of Marine Transport, Ministry of Tran-
sport (MOT), other than provision of pilotage and tug services. Shipping
appears to elect to tie up at one of the anchorages or berths as may be
requested by the shipping agent although MOT approval is required. This
results in inefficient berth utilization and there are numerous cases of
ships discharging at anchorage and loading at a berth. About 80% of export
cargo is handled at the berths against about 45% of imports.
2.        Overall, about 38% of general cargo was handled by lighters in
1971/72; lighters are privately owned and rented directly by the shipping
companies. Cargo handled at the commercial berths in 1971/72 was about
1.2 million tons. Total break bulk cargo in 1971/72 was about 1.9 million
tons. However, because of the low throughput at the berths (about 550 ton/
rn/year - giving a maximum throughput of about 1.4 million tons through the
berths - approximately 30% of total break bulk cargo would have had to be
lightered in any case. Calculation of port throughput capacity is given later
in this Annex.
3.        All cargo is presently handled by 24 stevedore companies licensed
by MOT plus a further eight licensed for one commodity only. These companies
can be:
(a) allocated an area of the port and can handle all
cargo from ship to shed/storage area at that place
or make direct delivery from ship to consignee's vehicle;
(b) employed by a consignee to handle his goods ex-storage;
or
(c) employed by a shipping agent to discharge to lighter
and bring ashore; in this case they would hand over the goods
to the firm in charge of the area where they are landed.
The companies in fact undertake little more than tallying and management
and have no labor of their own. Labor is provided by the labor union
executive, on demand, in gangs of 16 men per hatch on board ship and 20
ashore. The total labor force available in the port is about 7,000 men.
Of the payment received by the company on the basis of the MOT-agreed tariff
and tonnage handled, 60% is paid to the union, which retains 2%
and pays the balance to the gang involved.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        Very little mechanical equipment is used except to handle some
grain and cement. General cargo is largely handled by men with "A" frame
packs on their backs; even coal traffic and minerals unloaded from rail cars
are for the most part handled in this way. The gangways provided for goods
being handled from lighter to quay are crude and difficult to negotiate.
Pallets are not used in the sheds. No pressure is applied to use equipment
available for hire (Table 3) and it is normally only employed when weight
precludes the use of manual labor. All handling of goods to and from ship
is by ship's gear, again except when use of the floating crane is necessary
due to weight limitation of the gear.
5.        Labor is disciplined and hard-working, and productivity on ordinary
break bulk cargo is about 8 tons/gang/hr, which is fairly good considering
that little mechanical equipment is used.   Generally only one 10-hour
shift is worked each day as there is no lighting in transit sheds and in-
adequate lighting on the piers. A large number of coastal vessels using
Busan have only one or two hatches, and the average tons discharged per
ship/day is about 250 tons. Calculation of berth occupancy on this basis
is given at the end of this Annex.
6.        Storage in the sheds is controlled by a separate non-profit
organization - the Wharf Operators Association - which is also responsible
for security. It employs some 200 men and obtains its income from a
separate levy based on invoice value of cargo stored. Six days' free storage
is allowed in sheds, but the charges raised thereafter do not increase with
time of storage, and an average cargo unit stays ia the sheds 15 days. This
is a major limiting factor on capacity of the port, as shown later. Storage
in the sheds is controlled and dictated by customs officers. Furthermore,
no movement of any discharged cargo even within the port, from place to
place, or from the port to bonded warehouse, can take place without written
approval of customs; in effect the disposition of all unloaded cargo is
determined by the Customs Department. MOT has no control over this aspect of
operations.
7.        Documentation is cumbersome and excessive, apart from the normal
requirements for health immigration and quarantine on the vessel's arrival.
MOT requires five forms and Customs Department uses 22 different controls
on ship and cargo movement in the port. In addition, the ship's agent
has to make all necessary contacts for stevedore services, lighters as re-
quired, and storage of cargo.
8.        About 25% of total tonnage arriving at and leaving the port is
handled by rail and 75% by road. Access within the port is made difficult
by the occupation of Pier 3 and part of the Central Wharf by the military.
Apart from this aspect, which will be corrected under the proposed project,
road and rail access can be regarded as satisfactory. There are, however,
two matters for consideration: (1)  traffic congestion exists in the town,
and it is thought that a new access road to bypass city traffic may be
required. This is under investigation; and (ii) a logical system needs to
be developed for calling forward, and movement on the piers, of bulk rail
and road traffic.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
9.        At the present time, considerable cargo is delivered directly,
due in part to the increased costs incurred when placed in storage; this is
largely due to the use of different stevedore companies for handling cargo
ex-lighter, in the shed, and for delivery from shed. Direct delivery does,
of course, tend to increase port throughput and is to be encouraged; however,
it must be carefully planned and controlled; ships are presently being kept
alongside berths unnecessarily while awaiting either arrival of cargo for
export or lorries into which direct import deliveries can be placed. (See
also 8(ii) above.)
10.       Essentially, the poor operating results are due to an almost
complete lack of any central control or direction, and to cargo being handled
by too many separate organizations. This is particularly bad in view of
the physical restriction (narrow aprons, no lighting, etc.) which currently
exist, and results in the low overall throughput of 550 tons/meter pre-
viously mentioned.
11.       Petroleum products traffic at Busan consists for the most part
of coastal movements. It is handled in the outer harbor at off-loading
facilities provided by the oil companies, and presents no problems.
B. Present Port Capacity
12.       The estimated maximum capacity of the port at present, calculated
on the basis of 0.6 tons/m2 of storage capacity and 15 days' average storage
(24 turnovers per annum), plus 25% of the total direct delivery, is as follows:

A calculation of the berth occupancy to be expected in the port corresponding
to the 1.2 million tonnage handled over the wharves as follows:

Total available berth space              =  2,445 m
Average length of berth                  =    120 m
Number of available berths               =      20 /1

/1   The number of berths calculated on 120 m berth; i.e.,
an average ship size of 5,500 dwt.
13.       This gives a theoretical berth occupancy of over 90%, but statistics
available are insufficient to place much reliance on the actual percentage.
For example, ships waiting for cargo collection may have been waiting at
anchorage.   However, this calculation and that preceding do show that the
1.4 million overall capacity is a reasonable estimate in present conditions.
On 1.4 million tonnage over the wharves, the occupancy would be a possible
75% (for 20 berths) if all the time spent waiting for cargo was spent at
anchorage in the harbor. There is in fact no waiting time in the port at
present (in the sense of a shipping queue) due to the ability to handle
cargo at anchorage by lighters.

ANNEX 5

KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Proposed Operational Procedures; Duties and Time
Allocation of Specialist Consultants, and Training
1.        The Port Units should directly control and be responsible for
(i) allocation of berths and shipping movements; (ii) allocation of private
operators to berths or areas of the port, supervision of their operations
and agreement on their charges; (iii) all cargo movement within the customs
area; (iv) storage of cargo in transit sheds; (v) tallying of cargo and
statistical data collection; (vi) safety, security and insurance; (vii) main-
tenance of port assets; (viii) use of tugs; (ix) pilotage; (x) leasing of
port property; (xi) preparation of operational budget and investment pro-
posals; and (xii) documentation. The need to introduce new accounting
methods, costing procedures, and adequate tariffs to ensure the viability
of the ports is discussed in Chapter VI.
2.        It is not proposed to change the present methods whereby cargo
handling is carried out by private operators, but they should be reorganized
so that only one company is responsible for all movements on a single berth
or a group of berths and more efficient handling methods introduced. The
specialized berths to be provided under the project should be handled by
concessionaires. The present method of providing labor is satisfacotry
(being in effect a labor pool) but operators must provide properly trained
foremen to control the gangs.
3.       -Within the general framework outlined above, the operational and
management consultants to be provided under the project should prepare
detailed port regulations, operational procedures, staff requirements and
documentation procedures, to implement the new organization and recommendations
for dealing with the expected surplus labor. The financial consultants
should determine costs of operations and prepare the new accounting system
to be installed and the new tariff schedule. It is also foreseen that
a number of specialists would be available over the period from about September
1975 to about the end of 1978 to familiarize the Port Unit directors with the
new procedures and assist them in their implementation.
4.        Allowance has been made for 220 man-months of consultants' time
to be available. Between mid-1974 and mid-1975 it is foreseen some 60
man-months would be spent on the preparation of the new procedures, including
the Project Manager, and 48 man-months for the financial experts to
determine costs, set up a new accounting system and propose the new tariff
schedule.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
5.        The balance of 112 man-months will be used to assist in implementing
the new procedures between September 1975 and January 1977 for cargo handling,
financial and management documentation specialists; after January 1977 for
bulk handling specialists; and after January 1978 for the contciner operation
specialists. The Project Manager for the second phase should be the Manage-
ment/Documentation specialist.

6.        It is proposed that these specialists should work as expert
advisers to the Port Unit/KPA director as the case may be and advise him
on the day-to-day problems arising from application of the new procedures
and operating methods. The success or otherwise of this technical assistance
will depend on the directors concerned taking appropriate action on the advice
received and the Director General of KPA will have to ensure that this is done.
7.        Specialized training of labor in the handling of general cargo is
not necessary at this time, since improved management practices and procedures
are the major requirement for improved productivity. Similarly, overseas
fellowships for individuals are not necessary at least until the new procedures
and methods have been brought into use and experience with them has been
gained. It will however, be important that appropriate staff members of KPA
and/or the Port Units should work with the specialist consultants, to be
trained by them during the implementation stage of the procedures.

Port Capacity under Revised Organization
8.        The capacity of the container and bulk handling piers are dealt
with in Annex 6. Insofar as the general cargo berths are concerned it
is calculated that the overall capacity of the port under the new systems
(and allowing for the minor improvement to general cargo berths proposed
in the project) will be:

3,505         2 820 000              810             -
9.        In general the proposed operational improvements will bring the
throughput of the port to 850 tons/lin m/berth, except on Pier 2 where only
one new transit shed is being provided and the Central Wharf which will
handle sawn timber imports. These are expected to achieve 750 tons/lin m.
The improvements largely reflect the improved flow of traffic expected to
result from the reorganization, plus the ability to work some overtime with
the aid of improved lighting, if required. The overall capacity for break
bulk cargo will therefore be about 2.8 million tons. This will be available
about January 1979 (work on Piers 3 and 4 cannot commence until mid-1977).
The anticipated break bulk cargo to be handled over the general cargo
wharves will decline in 1978 as a result of increased containerization; in
1979 it will be about 2.15 million tons, if containerization proceeds at
the predicted rate. There will therefore be spare capacity. It should be
noted, however, that no new break bulk cargo handling facilities are being
provided, the proposed works being limited to new transit sheds, paving,
and improved track layout on existing piers. Lighterage will not be required
when Piers 3 and 4 come into service after rehabilitation, but will be
necessary over the period 1977/79, while work on these piers is in progress.

APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Project Details at Busan and Mukho, and
Capacity of Specialized Berths
Busan (Map No. 2)
1.   Dredging (Map No. 2)
1.        The dredging to be undertaken is to provide access to the
Composite Pier (Item 2) and Pier 7 (Item 3). In the outer harbor, the
existing entrance channel is to be deepened to 13.5 m. Inside the two
breakwaters a channel is to be dredged to the Composite Pier with 12.5 m
water and this will be widened to provide turning space; the new container
and grain berths will be dredged so as to have 12.5 m water alongside (50,000
dwt ships). A separate channel is to be dredged leading from that described
above to the new Pier 7 and will have 10 m water (max. 15,000 dwt ships);
berths at Pier 7 will be dredged to give 10 m and 7.5 m water alongside.
2.        Only minor dredging is being undertaken to the existing piers
and their approaches.
3.        The total quantity to be dredged is 8.4 million m2.
2.   The Composite Pier (Maps Nos. 2 and 4)
4.        This new 315,000 m2 reclaimed area at the Northern end of the
inner harbor will be used for handling containerized traffic and incoming
bulk grain.
A. Bulk Grain Berth
5.        Approximately 15,000 m2 will be used to build grain storage silos
of 70,000 ton capacity fed by an elevated conveyor from two 400 tons per hour
(TPH) grain unloaders. A 260 m berth with 12.5 m depth of water alongside
will permit 50,000 dwt bulk carriers to be accommodated. Delivery will be
either bulk or bagged to rail or truck at 250 TPH. With an average of 40,000
dwt vessels about 50 ships per annum will call by 1986. Assuming 80%
efficiency of the unloading system and 20 hours available per day, 12,800
tons can be offloaded per day and total time required will be about 156 days,
equivalent to 40% berth occupancy.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
B. Container Berths
6.        The pier will provide 300,000 m  storage area and 600 m of
container ship berths with 12.5 m water alongside.  This can accomodate
two large 2,000 container capacity vessels (275 m long) or four 200 container
capacity feeder vessels (130 m long). Both these berths, and that for the
bulk grain ships, will have cellular concrete block quay walls, filled with
quarry rubble and founded on rock, with quarry rubble provided behind the
wall for stability. The fill required for the reclaimed area will be
obtained from the dredging (Item 1) and pumped into place. The fill material
is not of high quality and will require special drainage techniques (sand or
paper drains) and to be surcharged, after placement of sand and gravel
blankets, in order to ensure sufficient consolidation for container storage.
Surplus spoil from dredging over and above that required for the Composite
Pier and Pier 7 (see 3 below) will be pumped alongside the Composite Pier
behind a temporary sea wall, and can be used as a basis for any extension
of the container berths required in future.
7.        Four 30 ton container cranes, supported on tracks on the quay
wall and the rubble fill behind it, will be provided on the 600 m berth.
Approximately 50% of containers handled are expected to be chassis type and
the balance will need to be stacked. For stacking, seven 30 ton transtainers
together with 16 tractor/trailers and three 20 ton forklifts to place containers
into stack and remove them for delivery or vice-versa, will be provided.
8.        The area available for stacking about 20 ha is calculated on the
basis of a requirement for 8 ha per berth for chassis type and 3.5 ha per
berth for stacking. Thus, the available area will provide adequate space
based on an approximate 50/50 division between stacking and chassis type
containers.
9.        The reclaimed area will be paved and will have adequate rail tracks
and road vehicle access. A building (20 m x 50 m) for stuffing and unstuffing
containers with loads for more than one consignee will be provided together
with customs and operating buildings.
10.       The berth occupancy of the 600 m container berth is expected to be
45% and the tonnage handled per 300 m berth about 900,000 p.a. in 1981 as
calculated below:
Total loaded containers per annum in and out           164,000
Total tonnage in and out                             1,815,000
Average tonnage per container                               11
Overall total containers, including empties            204,000

With 400,000 containers in 1986 as forecast, berth occupancy will clearly
be too high but there is ample time for expansion before that date, if
required, and the Bank considers that experience on the actual rate of
expansion of containerization should be obtained before additional invest-
ments are made.
3.   Pier No. 7 (Maps Nos. 2 and 5)
11.       This pier, with a total area of 35,000 m2, is to be built out
from the shoreline in the northern part of the harbor. It will have one
135 m berth for coal imports and one 185 m berth for scrap metal and heavy
steel billet imports, each with 10 m water alongside (6,000 - 15,000 dwt
ships) on the southern face, and two berths totalling 180 m for minerals and
ore exports with 7.5 m water alongside (2,000 - 5,000 dwt ships) on the
western face. There will be no berths on the east side, which will have
only a temporary rubble sea wall to retain the fill.
12.       Construction will be generally as described for the Composite
Pier, using hollow concrete block walls for the berths, and hydraulic fill
from the dredging to reclaim the required area; but selected fill will be
used in some areas under the heavy stacker/reclaimers. Coal shipments, with
the short sea haul from Mukho, can be scheduled.  Storage areas and handling
systems for the different materials to be handled will be provided as
follows:

4.   Pier 1 and International Ferry Terminal (tlaps Nos. 2 and 6)
13.       The new International Ferry Terminal on the south side of Pier 1
will require a widening of the existing 95 m wide pier structure by a further
101 m. The structure will be of reinforced concrete deck supported on
concrete piles in view of the heavy loads that will be imposed by the
terminal building.
14.       A ramp to accommodate roll-on/roll-off, truck/trailer container
traffic has been provided, with parking areas for transit storage. The
ferry terminal building (220 m x 45 m) is a three-story structure containing
cargo storage areas, offices, space for shops and other concessions and
facilities for customs and immigration processing. The building and land
access ways have been designed so that handling of passenger vehicles, foot
passengers, and cargo vehicles will be kept separate to the greatest degree
practical. Cargo handling will take place on the ground floor level.
Incoming foot passengers and passenger cars will utilize separate ramps on
the second floor level, and outgoing foot passengers will be processed on
the ground floor and will board the ferry from the third floor level.
Outgoing passenger vehicles will board on the second floor level after all
incoming vehicles have been cleared.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
15.       In order to increase the efficiency of the north side of Pier
1 for handling general cargo, repairs are to be made, lighting installed,
and resurfacing of backup areas carried out where needed. In addition,
the existing transit sheds will be replaced by two new enclosed sheds of
steel frame type construction. The new sheds will be placed so that improved
(20 m wide) apron space for cargo handling is available. Relocation of rail
and road access to the storage areas on the north side of the pier is
included. Fencing will be provided to separate the new ferry terminal from
other wharf operations.
5.   Coastal Ferry Terminal
16.       The coastal ferry terminal to be provided at the Pukbin Wharf
adjacent to Pier 1 comprises two new 135 m x 50 m finger piers and two new
ferry terminal buildings, each about 50 m x 20 m.  The two piers are open
type construction with a reinforced concrete deck supported on concrete
piles. The piers have been set at an angle to the Pukbin Wharf in order
to insure unimpeded maneuvering for the ferry boats. In addition to the
two piers, several small floating pontoon piers, currently located nearby,
are to be relocated to the Pukbin area for use by smaller harbor vessels.
17.       The Pukbin area itself will be cleared of existing structures
to make way for the new terminal buildings and for land transport and
pedestrian access. Repairs to seawalls and other remaining structures will
be effected where needed and the backup area and access roads paved and
laid out to ensure smooth traffic flow. The two terminal buildings are
reinforced concrete post and beam type construction with concrete brick
filler walls.
6.   Pier 2
18.       Upon completion of the new International Ferry Terminal, use of
the old terminal on the north side of Pier 2 will be discontinued and the
terminal building converted to a transit shed.
19.       The remaining work on this pier, which is 420 m long by 120 m wide,
comprises improvement to rail trackage, removal of some tracks, repairs to
sheds and installation of electricity, and improvements to the paving and
utilities. The pier has 9 m of water available alongside (8,000-10,000
dwt ships).
20.       The revised capacity of the port for general break bulk cargo,
after completion of the project, is discussed in Annex 5.
Mukho (Map No. 3)
1.   Coal Piers and Mechanical Loading Equipment
21.       The existing arrangement comprises two central structures on which
feed conveyors are mounted and two coal berths built out from these, formed
of concrete caissons on a rubble stone foundation; the foundations project



ANNEX 6
Page 7
beyond the base of the caisson and prevent the deeper drafted ships tying
up alongside.
22.       The center structures will be retained, but new loading piers of
cellular concrete blocks will be constructed in front of the existing berths;
these will be 135 m long and varying width; the wider portions to accommodate
the radial track of the new loaders; depth of water alongside will be 8.5 m
(8,000 dwt) ships. Necessary dredging (29,000 c3) to give the required
depth will be done.
23.       Three - 300 ton per hour loaders with telescopic arms to
accommodate the varying width of ships used in the coastal coal trade
(max. 6,000 dwt) are to be provided on the new berths. These will be fed
from the existing feed conveyors, which require some rehabilitation. A
further loader can be provided on Pier "B" if and when necessary.
24.       The existing coal yard is adequate in size as are the means of
delivery materials thereto, but the existing conveyors which feed the
conveyors to the loading piers are not satisfactory and limit the loading
rate. Two new reclaimers and conveyors will be provided, one 600 and one 300
ton per hour capacity. These will handle coal or limestone. The present
method, whereby coal is stored in separate piles for each owner (producer),
is to be discontinued with appropriate alteration in documentation.
25.       Traffic in 1981 and through to 1986 is estimated at 3.1 million
tons, including limestone. Loading capacity at 80% mechanical efficiency
is 720 tons per day, and with allowance for 20 hours daily operation some
10,000 tons per day can be handled at Pier A and 5,000 tons per day at Pier B.
Thus, with 2/3 of total tonnage loaded at Pier A, occupancy of each pier will
be about 200 days from 1981 to 1986 (56%). These are high occupancy figures
for single berths, but given the short sea distances involved for each trade,
limestone to Pohang and coal to Busan, schduling of sailings will be
possible.
2.   Breakwater
26.       The existing breakwater consists of an old section of concrete block
work and caissons on a rubble base with a +2.8 m elevation crest; and a new
section with a concrete cap on rubble foundation, protected on its outer slope
by 20 ton tetrapod units with an elevation of about +4 m. The old section
will be raised by constructing a rubble mound over it to +5 m elevation (after
removal of some of the existing concrete) and a layer of tetrapod (or equiva-
lent) units will be placed on the seaward side and carried over into the harbor
to dissipate the energy of any overtopping waves.
3.   Rehabilitation
27.       The rehabilitation works on the general cargo and central wharves
are largely paving improvements, with removal and replacement of some bollards.

ANNEX 7
KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Proposed Development Study
1.        The proposed project will provide all necessary development of
the port of Busan and Mukho to handle forecast traffic to 1986, except for
the rehabilitation of Piers 3 and 4 and the Central Wharf which is expected
to be carried out by KPA when the Military Wharf has advanced sufficiently
to permit work.
2.        Economic development in Korea is expected to continue during the
Third Plan Period 1972-76 at the rate of 8.6% per annum. This will involve
development of industries in different parts of Korea and is expected to
require development of some of Korea's first class ports other than Busan and
Mukho.
3.        A study is therefore proposed to be undertaken by consultants, to
commence January 1974 and report by December 1974 which should:
(a) update the traffic estimates for Korea's first class ports
which were prepared by the Study Group, in the light of the
Government's proposed development and location of industries
under the Third Five Year Plan, 1977/81 and to 1986 to the
extent this information can be ascertained;
(b) consider the best methods of handling the resulting increases
in imports and exports through Korean ports, having regard
to available rail, road and port facilities, and so as to
give the least economic cost;
(c) advise on the appropriate developments of Korea ports with
sufficient preliminary engineering to enable costs to be
determined within + 20%; and
(d) estimate economic benefits of any proposed investments, the
actual economic return, and the effects of the proposals
on KPA's finances.
It is expected that sufficient information to indicate a likely future
project will be available by September/October 1974.

KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Traffic and Containerization
A. Shipping and Passenger Traffic
1.        4,451 ocean going ships called at Busan during 1971 with a total
gross registered tonnage (GRT) of 15.3 million tons, corresponding to an
average 3,450 GRT per ship. The number of coastal ships was 15,171 with a
total GRT of 3.6 million (average 260 GRT per ship). The average size of
coastal vessels has increased together with growth in port traffic. Table 14
gives details on the development of vessels during the period 1962-71.
2.        In 1971, a total of 3,194 vessels called at Mukho, of which all
except 311 were classified as coastal (Table 14). As for Busan, the average
size of coastal vessels has increased considerably during the period 1962-71
(Table 14), indicating a relative decline in the share of small (fishing) ves-
sels with a GRT of less than 100 tons. Practically all vessels calling at
Mukho had a GRT less than 5,000 tons, while vessels exceeding 5,000 GRT
represented about 55% of the total tonnage calling at Busan in 1971.
3.        Busan serves a substantial coastal passenger traffic (2.0 million
passengers in 1971), and is the Korean terminus for the rapidly expanding ferry
traffic 1/ between Korea and Japan. Busan increased its share of the total
coastal passenger traffic from 20.4% in 1967 to 31.5% in 1971 with an annual
growth rate of about 10%, while the total coastal passenger traffic decreased
slightly (Table 16). The ferry traffic between Korea and Japan remained fair-
ly stagnant during the initial years of operation, but since 1970 there has
been a rapid increase in number of passengers, which are expected to amount
to almost 50,000 in 1972.
4.         Coastal passenger traffic through Busan is expected to increase
annually by about 4% during the period 1972-86, and amount to about 3.5 mil-
lion by 1986. The passenger traffic between Korea and Japan is expected to
increase by 10% a year during the same period and amount to 185,000 in 1986
(Table 16).
5.        There has been no passenger traffic through Mukho port in the past
and it is most unlikely that such traffic will develop in future due to (i)
the continued improvement of the land transport connections between Mukho and
the major population centers and (ii) geographical features.
1/   The ferry carries both passengers and freight (roll-on/roll-off);
freight traffic is discussed in paragraph 36 below.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
B. Freight Traffic
Present and Past Traffic
6.        In 1971, Busan port handled 10.9 million tons of freight, of which
2.0 million tons were exports, 4.9 million tons imports, and 4.0 million tons
coastal shipments. These volumes represented 47.1% of total Korean exports
(4.2 million tons) in 1971, 17.2% of total imports (24.3 million tons) and
18.0% of total coastal shipments (22.5 million tons) (Tables 1 and 15).
7.        In the same year, Mukho port handled 3.3 million tons of freight,
ot which exports, imports, and coastal shipments represented 0.7, 0.2, and
2.4 million tons, respectively. Mukho's share of the Korean foreign trade was
negligible, but it accounted for 10.9% of the total coastal shipments.
8.        Table 15 gives details on the composition of freight traffic through
Busan and Mlukho ports during the period 1967-71; the composition for 1971 is
summarized below:

9.        At Busan, exports, consisting mainly of general cargo, ores, and
cement, grew about 17.5% p.a. during 1967-71, compared with 24% p.a. for total
Korean exports. During the same period, imports, consisting mainly of timber,
grain, general cargo and scrap iron, grew at a rate of 7.9% p.a., while coas-
tal shipments, consisting mainly of petroleum products, coal and cement, in-
creased at a rate of 23.9% p.a., consistent with the rapid expansion of indus-
tries in the Busan area.
10.       At Mukho, exports, consisting of cement and coal, grew at a very
high rate of 42% p.a. during 1967-71; however, this growth rate is not verv
meaningful because of the low level of exports in 1967 (173,000 tons). The
growth has been a result of an increase in cement exports; the export of coal
has remained constant. Imports more than doubled during the same period, but
for similar reasons, establishment of any growth rate is not meaningful.
Similar to exports, practically all coastal shipments at Mukho consist of
cement and coal (92% of total). These shipments grew at an annual rate of
13.9% during 1966-71 1/ and were mainly directed to Busan.
Traffic Forecasts and Containerization
11.       The freight traffic forecasts 1972-1986 for Busan and Mukho ports
have been presented in Tables 17 and 18, respectively. They are also presented
in Tables 19 and 20 for the period 1972-81, but regrouped by type and facility
of cargo handling in each of the two ports. These forecasts are summarized as
follows:
1/   Year 1967 is not representative due to exceptionally high shipment of
coal, 1.6 million tons in that year compared with 1.1 million tons
in 1968.

The basis of the forecasts is provided in Section C below.
12.       The forecasts have been based on an average overall economic growth
rate of 8.6% p.a. (para 2.02), and on the detailed evaluation made by the
Study Group, which has been reviewed and updated by the Bank. According
to these forecasts, the freight handled at Busan will increase at
an annual rate of 7.0% during the period 1971-86, compared with a growth
rate of 13.8% p.a. experienced 1967-71. The exports are estimated to
increase annually by 5.3%, while the growth rates for imports and coastal ship-
ments have been estimated at 4.4% and 9.8%, respectively. The high growth rate
in coastal shipments is explained by the rapid increase in inbound and domes-
tically supplied coastal shipments of cement and petroleum products. Develop-
ment of general cargo containerization is discussed separately in paragraph 14.
13.       At Mukho, the total freight handled has been estimated to increase
annually by 8.6% over the period 1971-86 with a major increase of 13.6% p.a.
during the first five year period 1971-76, due to the expansion of the Ssanyong
cement plant, followed by a lower growth rate of 5.9% p.a. during the remaining
period 1976-86. The annual growth in exports, imports and coastal shipments



ANNEX 8
Page 5
has been estimated at about 11.4%, 4.0% and 7.8% respectively over the whole
period 1971-86, but with coal exports remaining constant at 2.1 million tons
after 1976.
Containerization
14.       The exports and imports of general cargo at Busan are being rapidly
containerized. The number of loaded containers was 1,427 in 1970 with about
15,000 tons of cargo. In 1971, the number of loaded units had increased to
13,443 with about 150,000 tons of cargo.  The rapid increase continued during
1972 with an estimated number of 21,500 containers excluding empty containers
loaded with 275,000 tons of cargo (Table 17). At the initial stages of con-
tainerization, the number of loaded inbound containers was about twice the
number of outbound units, reflecting the advanced containerization level in
the major industrial countries (Japan and U.S.) exporting to Korea. This
situation is, however, being reversed with the rapid increase in exports of
products highly suitable for containerization (textiles, electronics) and the
increasing preference for unitized cargo handling. As elsewhere in the world,
two distinct container shipping patterns have emerged:
(a)  roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) type of services for the
short-to-medium distance shipments between Korea and
Japan. These services are provided by a combined
passenger/motor vehicle ferry (para 3); and
(b)  shipment of containers on longer routes by use of
specially designed vessels, or by use of conven-
tional general cargo vessels, some of which have
been converted to suit the particular requirements
of container transport.
In 1972, about 2/3 of the total container traffic at Busan was handled by
the ro-ro ferry service, while the remaining 1/3 was shipped by ocean going
vessels (Table 19).
15.       The estimated development of container traffic at Busan 1972-86 is
given on Tables 17 and 19, and summarized below:

The volume of general cargo 1/ is estimated to increase from 1.8 million tons in
1972 to 4.5 million tons in 1976 (Table 17), implying an annual growth rate of
6.2%. The container traffic will increase at a considerably higher rate of
14.0% p.a. since increasing proportions of general cargo exports and imports
will be containerized. The forecasts assume that specialized container vessels
will handle the increase in traffic after 1976, while the traffic on the
Korea-Japan ro-ro ferry will remain constant at the 1976 level. This will pro-
vide the least cost solution.
C. Basis for Freight Traffic Forecasts
16.       The bases for the traffic forecasts, as summarized in para 11, are
discussed by main commodities in the following. The estimated future develop-
ment is essentially based on the evaluation made by the Study Group as re-
viewed by the Bank and on information obtained from relevant industries and
Governmenr agencies. As a whole, the forecasts have been geared to the Third
Five Year Plan development targets.
I. BUSAN
Exports
17.       Between 1967 and 1971, exports increased annually by 17.5%, from
1.04 million tons in 1967 to 1.98 million tons in 1971. The exports are esti-
mated to increase to 4.27 million tons by 1986, giving an annual growth rate
1/   Excludes scrap metals, steel and pulp which were included in general
cargo volumes summarized in paras 8 and 11.



ANNEX 8
Page 7
of 5.3%. The high growth rate during 1967-71 is explained by: (i) the low
initial level of exports in 1967, and (ii) a rapid increase in exports of var-
ious manufactured products, notably of textiles and electronic components.
The estimated future growth of exports is summarized in Table 17.
18.       Cement:  The export of cement through Busan port was 315,000 tons
in 1971, and is expected to continue at its present level; Mukho will handle
most of the export volume. Cement exported through Busan is mainly destined to
Southeast Asia and is shipped as backhaul on log carriers.
19.       Coal:  Minor quantities of coal, 30,000 tons in 1970, have been
exported through Busan. This export movement is expected to discontinue and
will be concentrated at Mukho.
20.       Ores and Minerals:  Exports of ores and minerals, comprising such raw
materials as quartz, feldspar, kaolin, tale, etc., totalled some 650,000
tons in 1971. More than 90% of these quantities have been for Japanese
destinations, with Busan as the most important loading port. This situation
is not expected to change. The shipments through Busan are expected to be
750,000 tons in 1986, in line with a slight overall increase in exports of
these commodities.
21.       Plywood:  The export of plywood through Busan totalled 220,000 tons
in 1970. The volume increased at the high rate of 25% p.a. during the latter
part of the 1960's and was directed mainly to the U.S. market. The rapid
increase took place at the expense of Japanese exports; by beginning of the
1970's, the expansion possibilities were, however, considerably reduced, and
any future increase will be dictated by the growth in demand in importing
countries. Moreover, it seems likely that the Government will be less
inclined to give high priority to this part of the exports due to its high
foreign raw material content, while plywood industries are being developed in
the major timber exporting countries. Therefore, plywood exports have been
predicted to increase at a much lower rate of 3.0% p.a., reaching about 335,000
tons at Busan in 1986.
22.       General Cargo:  The export of general cargo as a total is expected
to increase from 340,000 tons in 1970 to about 2.9 million tons in 1986, im-
plying an annual growth rate of 15.4%. The high growth rate is in line with
the general development policy to promote manufacturing industries which will
capture an increasing share of total exports. The major export commodities
with an estimated high annual growth rate are:
(a) Fish and fish products; Korean exports are estimated
to increase from 108,000 tons in 1970 to 316,000 tons
by 1976; projections are difficult beyond 1976, but
the growth trend is expected to continue due to the
strong demand on the Japanese market;
(b) Textiles; Korean exports of textiles were 68,000 tons
in 1970 and are expected to increase at an annual rate
of 21.5% reaching 220,000 tons by 1976;



ANNEX 8
Page 8
(c) Glass, refractories, ceramics, porcelain: The manu-
facturing of these products started on a larger scale
in the late 1960's, with exports as low as 1,000 tons
in 1968. However, it had increased to 40,000 tons by
1972, and is expected to reach 170,000 tons by 1976;
thereafter a growth in exports of some 20% p.a. has
been assumed. As for most of the Korean exports, the
main markets for these products are Japan and US;
(d)  Electronic components, electrical machinery and appliances:
Electronic components represent, besides textiles, the
most important growth industry in Korea. Export was
only US$7 million in 1967, by 1970 exports had increased
to US$55 million and exceeded US$100 million the next
year. These exports are expected to reach US$450 million
by 1976, and may, under favorable circumstances, be even
higher. In addition to electronics, the electrical machinery
and appliances industry is expanding rapidly and is ex-
pected to show a similar growth in exports; and
(e) Others: Other products with an expected rapid export growth
are various products of petro-chemical industry, including
chemical elements and materials which are expected to
grow from 32,000 tons in 1972 to 163,000 tons in 1980, and
artificial plastics increasing from 115,000 tons in 1972
to 415,000 tons in 1980. Leather products and footwear, as
another example, will increase from 44,000 tons in 1972 to
257,000 tons in 1980.
Imports
23.       Between 1967 and 1971, imports increased annually by 7.9%, from
3.59 million tons in 1967 to 4.86 million tons in 1971. Two products, grain
and timber, together increased from 1.09 million tons in 1967 to 2.42 million
tons in 1971 and accounted for most of the growth. The estimated future
growth in imports is summarized in Table 17. By 1986, the total imports
through Busan should approximate 9.25 million tons, giving an annual growth
rate of 4.4%.
24.       Coal:  Coal produced in Korea is not bituminous; and is therefore
not suitable for coking purposes. In addition, it is not of high quality and
is used mainly as briquettes for domestic purposes.  Bituminous coal has there-
fore been imported through Busan in minor quantities; this is expected to
continue, amounting to about 200,000 tons in 1986. Shipments from Mutaho,
about 900,000 tons in 1972 are expected to rise to 1.45 million by 1981 and
remain constant thereafter.
25.       Ores and Minerals:  The imports of ores and minerals will increase
from about 50,000 tons in 1972 to about 160,000 tons in 1986, and consist main-
ly of salt and asbestos.



ANNEX 8
Page 9
26.       Scrap metals:  In 1970, 588,000 tons of scrap metal were imported at
Busan, mainly for the Busan steel mill. This level is expected to decline
slightly to about 470,000 tons in 1986 due to increased use of iron ore
and the major expansion of other steel mills in the country.
27.       Steel:  The import of steel is expected to decrease from some
420,000 tons in 1972 to 240,000 tons in 1986 due to the commencement of
domestic production in 1972. However, imports of some types of steel will
still be required.
28.       Grain:  Grain imports are estimated to increase from a level of
about 1.1 million tons in 1971, to about 2.0 million tons by 1986, implying
an annual growth rate of 4.0%. The import of grain is expected to continue,
even acknowledging the Government's plan to reach self-sufficiency in the
major food grains.  However, part of the estimated grain import during
1972-86 may represent coastal shipments, because Busan represents an
important distribution center of both imported and domestic grain.
29.       Timber:  The import of timber amounted to 1.17 million tons in 1970
and is expected to increase to 3.2 million tons by 1986, giving a growth
rate of 6.5% p.a. The increase is warranted because of a continuous expansion
of woodworking and construction industries and depletion of domestic forest
resources.
30.       Pulp:  Import volumes of pulp will more or less remain constant at
their present level of about 140,000 tons. Although Korea is expected to
import more pulp the increase in imports will take place through other ports.
31.       General Cargo:  In 1970, 1.3 million tons of general cargo was
Imported.  It is expected to increase to 1.6 million tons by 1986, or by a
low 1.4% p.a., which reflects the expected rapid development of import
substitution industries and the Government's efforts to curb growth in
imports.
32.       Petroleum Products:  Most of the fuels represent coastal shipments
from the refinery at Ulsan. About 230,000 tons, or 12% of the total, was,
however, imported. The import of petroleum products is expected to continue
at a level of 10% of total shipments through Busan. By 1986, about 1.25
million tons will be imported, giving an annual growth rate of 11.1%.
Containerization
33.       The Study Group based its recommendations on containerization
on extensive studies on the structure, future development and transport
costs of general cargo. The conclusions are sound, though conservative.
The actual development during 1972 resulted in a considerably larger
container traffic than predicted. Discussions with representatives from
shipping lines and manufacturers indicate that this growth trend will
continue. On this basis the Bank adjusted the forecasts to reflect a
faster rate of increase.



ANNEX 8
Page 10
34.       Containerization results in substantially reduced transshipment
costs for most products with relatively high value-volume relationship
(US$200 per ton and above). The Study Group's evaluation indicates that
about 85% of the general cargo shipped through Busan consist of containerizable
products with the following estimated containerization rates:
1972      =    15%
1976      =    50%
1981      =    75%
1986      =    85% (full containerization)
35.       The reduced transshipment costs result from the application of mass
or systemized handling techniques to the distribution of goods with the
following main results:
(i) standardization of product handled;
(ii) faster movement between points of transshipment;
(iii)  faster transshipment; and
(iv) reduced damage and pilferage.
Containerization results in cargo handling costs, which are considerably lower
than those for conventional general cargo handling and shipping. However,
these lower handling costs are obtained through substantially larger invest-
ments in equipment and ships. Further, the cost savings depend on the trade
route in question. In the Korea-Japan trade where the port and other handling
costs represent more than 50% of total transport costs, the relative cost
savings are substantially higher per ton handled than in the Korea-US trade,
where the direct shipping cost is the largest item. The Study Group's evalua-
tion, with which the Bank concurs, resulted in following relative total system
costs for the two main trade routes:
Korea-US             Korea-Japan
Trade                  Trade
Conventional shipping
-  present cargo handling                    100                    100
-  optimum cargo handling                     88                     92
Pallets                                        70                    76
Lash                                          84                     44
Ro-Ro                                                                37
Containers, optimum ship size                 40                     28



ANNEX 8
Page 11
Thus, containerization will reduce the total transport costs per ton to about
1/3 of its present level. The cost savings between conventional and contain-
erized shipping were calculated to be distributed between the various cost
components as follows:
Korea-US             Korea-Japan
Trade                Trade
Shipping                                    16.1                   49.0
Port                                        10.4                   26.8
Inland                                       2.9                    4.0
Inventory                                     1.7                   4.0
Packaging                                     1.7                   3.0
Others                                      67.2                   13.2
Total Cost Saving                          100.0                  100.0
The cost item "Others" refers to cargo handling costs in overseas ports.
These costs are very high for breakbulk in U.S. West Coast ports, i.e., US$35.00
for loading and US$44.00 for discharging, compared with US$8.20 and US$4.75
respectively in Japanese ports.
36.       As shown in Table 19 the increase in container traffic between
Korea and Japan after 1976 is allocated to specialized container ships,
while the container traffic on the international roll-on/roll-off ferry would
remain constant. This allocation was carried out on basis of a cost advantage
of about 20% in terms of total system costs (from point of origin to point of
destination). The Study Group correctly concluded, however, on basis of
experiences from several similar trade routes in Europe, that the total
cost advantage may not be that high. The cost difference in favor of contain-
er ships arises mainly from an assumed use of trailers in shipping the contain-
ers on the ferry. In actuality, the containers may be shipped in a similar
way on both types of ships, and the cost difference may largely be compensated
by faster turn-around times and a reduced need for large back-up areas. No
revision was, however, made in the container traffic allocation, because the
same port facilities may be used by both systems.
II. MUKHO
37.       Mukho is essentially a two-commodity port.  In 1970, about 93% of
the total traffic consisted of cement and coal. By and large this situation
will continue in the future as discussed below.
Outbound Shipments
38.       Between 1967 and 1971, outbound shipments increased from 1.61
million tons to 2.97 million tons or by 16.5% p.a. The whole of this in-
crease was accounted for by cement shipments. In 1967, about 46,000 tons
of cement was shipped, all in the coastal trade. By 1971, the shipments of
cement had increased to 1.48 million tons, of which 700,000 tons was



ANNEX 8
Page 12
exported. Coal shipments showed a considerable fluctuation, but remained
essentially constant at an annual level of about 1.5 million tons. Out-
bound shipments of other commodities amounted to an insignificant 53,000 and
27,000 tons in 1967 and 1971 respectively.
39.       The total outbound shipments are expected to increase to about 9.5
million tons by 1986, implying an annual growth rate of 8.1%. Cenent, coal
and limestone will account for the whole of this increase (Table 18).
40.       Cement:  The present capacity of the Ssanyong cement plant is about
2.^ million tons, which was fully utilized in 1972.  The expansion of the
cement plant will be completed by the beginning of 1974, when the total pro-
duction capacity will be about 3.0 million tons. A further expansion is
planned to be completed by the early 1980's. Until 1970, cement export was
insignificant. Since then exports have increased very rapidly and almost
equalled the coastal movements in 1972. The increase in cement exports is
expected to continue and reach 3.25 million tons in 1986. The forecast
for the next few years is based on relatively firm export contracts. However,
the long term export possibilities also appear to be promising due to economies
of scale and limitations in the expansion possibilities of cement plants in
Japan and US. However, domestic shipments are expected to expand noticeably
as well, with an annual volume of 2.75 million tons in 1986, and growth rate
of 6.4%, compared with 8.8% for exports.
41.       Coal:  The export of coal (to Japan) will remain constant at an
annual level of 300,000 tons over the whole period. The coastal shipments
are expected to increase over the period 1971-86 and reach 2.5 million tons
by 1981 which corresponds to the expected increase in domestic (household)
consumption and remain constant thereafter.
42.       Limestone:  Limestone shipments are expected to start during 1973
to meet part of the total requirements of the Pohand steel mill. These
shipments are expected to reach 265,000 tons by 1976, and stabilize at a
level of 565,000 tons by 1980.
Inbound Shipments
43.       Between 1967 and 1971, inbound shipments increased from 90,000 tons
to 346,000 tons, mainly as a result of a rapid increase in fuel movements,
which amounted to half of the total inbound cargo in 1971.
44.       The inbound shipments are expected to increase to 1.86 million
tons by 1986, giving an annual increase of 11.8%.  Fuels and iron ore will
account for all of this increase. Both of these commodities will be required
as production inputs for the cement plant.

KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORT PROJECT
Calculation of Economic Return
A.  Procedures
1.        The calculation of Economic Return (ER) involved two main steps:
(i) quantification of project benefits, and (ii) distribution of project
benefits between the Korean economy and other beneficiaries. The procedures
are summarized in the following.
Quantification of Project Benefits
2.        Project benefits have been calculated as the difference in
directly quantifiable port user costs with and without the project; indirect
benefits, if any, which may be induced within the nonport sector of the
economy were not quantifiable and have been excluded. The calculation of
costs with and without the project have essentially been based on the Study
Group's evaluation in which they applied cost minimization programs, dividing
the total cost into the following main components:
(a) cargo handling costs in project ports;
(b) ship costs at berth;
(c) ship waiting time costs;
(d) sea voyage costs;
(e) cost of cargo handling in foreign ports; and
(f) land transportation costs.
The calculated project benefits include only cost reductions in components
(a) to (d); components (e) and (f) were, however, used for selection of the
optimum port and shipping system, i.e., in determination of:
(a) number of berths;
(b) loading and unloading rates of mechanical cargo handling
equipment; and
(c) average ship size.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
3.        Cargo handling costs in port, ship costs at berth, and sea voyage
costs were quantified by the consultants on basis of empirical data, which
are well documented and generally reliable. These costs have been calculated
as constant per ton of cargo handled over the project life. On the other
hand, ship waiting time for berth is highly dependent on the ratio between
traffic volume and port capacity and in addition the assumed arrival pattern
and service time of ships in port. The consultants applied standard programs
in the calculation of ship waiting times, according to which the waiting
time is based on a Poisson (random) distribution of ship arrival times,
while the ship service time was based on empirical observations, using
coi,stant service times for each major type of cargo.  This program is fully
acceptable at low berth occupancy ratios; however, an indiscriminate
application would result in infinite ship waiting times if the traffic were
allowed to exceed the actual port capacity. Infinite ship waiting times
will, however, not develop in the real world, because mounting shipping
costs would preclude a continuous growth in traffic and result in losses
to the economy, viz:
(a) diversion of traffic to other ports at a higher cost;
(b) export opportunities lost; and
(c) slower economic growth in the port influence area.
Port traffic and ship waiting times have therefore been calculated to increase
until the port capacity has been reached and thereafter remain constant.
This is a valid, if conservative approach; a further increase in traffic will
require additional port capacity in the form of a new investment. The
benefits from such traffic increase cannot, therefore be, assigned to the
port project under evaluation. Full utilization of the project ports is
anticipated by 1987, and as explained above, ship waiting time costs have
been kept constant for the remaining part of project life 1986-96.  The result
of the calculations are reflected in subsequent sections of this Annex and
in Tables 21 to 26.
Distribution of Project Benefits
4.        The project investment will result in considerable benefits, all
of which have not been allocated to the project in the calculation of the
Economic Return (ER). Only those direct benefits which are quantifiable and
attributable to the Korean economy have been included, while benefits to
other (foreign) beneficiaries have been excluded.
5.        Benefits which are readily identified as attributable to the
Korean economy represent:
(a) savings in cargo handling costs in the project ports; and
(b) savings in port and sea voyage costs of Korean flag
vessels, which carry all of the coastal trade and about
25% of the dry cargo exports and imports.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
In 1972, about 40% of the 8.9 million tons of dry cargo at Busan was carried
by Korean flag vessels; at Mukho this percentage was practically 100%.
6.        Benefits, readily identified as attributable to foreign
beneficiaries consist of cost reductions in foreign ports through the
use of larger vessels and containers, made possible by the improvements
in the project ports. These cost reductions can be substantially higher
than all the other benefits combined. As shown in Annex 8, para 35, 67% of
the total cost reductions resulting from containerization in the Korean-US
trade are obtained in the US ports due to significantly reduced labor costs.
These benefits have been excluded in the return calculation.
7.        The extent to which the Korean economy will benefit from current
savings accruing to foreign vessels arising from the project will depend on
the type of service involved. Benefits accruing to vessels chartered by
Korean interests on a daily basis for the carriage of large volumes of bulk
freight (e.g. grain) will be fully recouped by the Korean economy to the
extent that port time is reduced. About 1/4 of all grain, minerals, ores,
steel, scrap and general cargo is carried by foreign chartered vessels.
Savings to liner vessels will accrue to the foreign carrier, but about 20%
of this will be recouped through revisions in the port charges. The above
distribution implies that, on an average basis, about 50% of the savings in
current costs to foreign carriers will accrue to the Korean economy. For
ocean traffic as a whole, this percentage would be 67%, because of the
number of Korean flag carriers involved in this trade (33% of the total
ocean traffic). Benefits arising from savings in additional costs in the
future represented by the liner service surcharges or longer charter times
which would result if the project were not undertaken will, of course, accrue
fully to the Korean economy. The above distribution of cost savings applies
only for Busan; the traffic through Mukho is carried by Korean flag vessels
in coastal trade. Cost reductions to these vessels will naturally accrue
in full to the Korean economy.
Summary of Benefit Allocation
8.        In summary, the economic calculations utilize the benefits
resulting from the project investment as follows:
(a) benefits to the non-port sector are excluded as non-
quantificable;
(b) benefits in the form of cost reductions in foreign
ports are excluded;
(c) cost reductions accruing to coastal traffic have been
included fully because all freight is carried by Korean
flag vessels;
(d) cost reductions in cargo handling in the project ports
have been fully included;



ANNEX 9
Page 4
(e) cost reductions in ocean freight under Korean flag
have been fully included; this represents about 1/3
of the total ocean freight affected by the project
investment;
(f) about 20% of the cost reductions to ocean freight
carried by foreign liners has been Included in the
economic return calculation; this amount will be
recouped through revised port charges; this traffic
represents about 60% of the total non-Korean ocean
freight traffic through Busan; and
(g) about 40% of the foreign flag ocean freight is
carried by chartered vessels; cost reductions relating
to the movements have all been included.
Economic Return Calculation
9.        The benefits have been calculated over the period 1977-96, which
may be considered as the economic life of the project. The economic return
(ER) is about 32% (Table 26). With a 15% increase in costs and a correspond-
ing slippage in benefits, the ER is about 27%. As discussed in paras 1 to 8
above, this return is based on estimated benefits to the Korean economy;
the total benefits would have resulted in a considerably higher return.
The first year economic return (FYR) is 16.4% for 1977 (Table 26), and the
benefits for each subsequent year will increase at a rate higher than the
FYR.
10.       The investment cost used in the economic evaluation excluded
contingencies for price escalation, is net of direct taxes and duties
and represents, therefore, a real cost. Interest has been calculated during
the construction period.
B.   Busan
(a) Composite Pier
11.       The Composite Pier, to be completed by late 1977, will provide
container and bulk grain handling facilities. The container facilities
will relieve congestion on the general cargo piers, while the grain handling
facilities will replace the present uneconomic lighterage system for handling
grain cargos.
(i) Grain
12.       Grain is at present imported by use of 24,000 dwt ships, which
are mainly unloaded at anchorage and lightered to shore. The average
unloading rate is 1,200 tons per day (TPD). Improvement will take place
without the project, however, which will result in use of 32,000 dwt vessels
and an unloading rate of 1,500 TPD. With this improvement, the costs per
ton handled will in 1977 be:



ANNEX 9
Page 5
(a)  cargo handling costs           US$ 1.22
(b) vessel costs
i.   cost of vessel in port   US$ 3.07
ii.   sea voyage costs          US$ 7.26
Total per ton       US$11.55
13.       Evaluation indicates that the most economic future grain handling
system will consist of:
(a) shipment with 50,000 dwt ships, with 40,000 ton
average loads; and
(b) unloading at a rate of 800 TPH, by use of the new
bulk handling facility located on the proposed
Composite Pier.
With this system, the costs per ton handled will be as follows:
(a)  cargo handling costs US           US$0.20
(b) vessel costs
I.   cost of vessel in port       US$0.47
ii.   sea voyage costs             US$6.45
Total per ton           US$7.12
The cargo handling costs do not include capital costs for mechanical equipment
and grain silo, as these items have been included in the total investment cost
of the Composite Pier.
14.       As shown above, the savings per ton of grain handled will amount to
US$4.43 in 1977. The grain is at present shipped by foreign carriers on
contract, and it is unlikely that this will change, because of the large size
specialized ship required. The savings to the project and the Korean economy
amount, therefore, to US$2.73 per ton excluding half of the savings in ship
costs.  With 1.3 million tons of grain handled in 1977 (Table 19) the benefits
in that year will amount to US$3.55 million. There will in future be a
further increase in benefits as detailed in Table 21, due to an increase in
traffic and avoided ship waiting time.



ANNEX 9
Page 6
(ii) Container Facilities
15.       The estimated future development of containerization of general
cargo has been shown in Table 19 and detailed in Annex 8. The Composite Pier
will handle all container traffic except that shipped through the interna-
tional ferry terminal (para 25). Without the project, there would be only
limited possibilities for containerization and therefore the benefits arise
from the difference in costs of handling the freight as general cargo of
containerized traffic.
16.       Containerization of general cargo will result in savings of US$8.74
per con in 1977, which will increase gradually in future due to increased ship
waiting times if the project is not undertaken; details on the composition of
savings is provided in Table 22, which also indicates that the savings
allocated as project benefits amount to US$6.40 per ton in 1977. Total
project benefits due to containerization amount to US$4.86 million in 1977,
with 799,000 tons of containerized cargo.
(b) Pier No. 7
17.       Pier No. 7, to be completed by beginning of 1977, will provide
facilities for bulk handling of coal, other minerals, ores, steel and scrap.
This pier, together with the Composite Pier, will replace the use of lighterage
facilities and centralize the handling of dry bulk cargo within the port area.
(i) Coal
18.       Under the present system, coal is shipped from Mukho by 5,800 dwt
vessels and unloaded by lighterage at a rate of 1,800 tons/day. The cost
per ton handled is US$2.58. Details are provided in Table 23.
19.       The proposed bulk handling facility for coal at Busan has been de-
signed to provide an optimum system when operated together with the mechanical
loading facility at Mukho (para 23). Specifically, the Busan system consists
of:
(a)  inbound shipments with 6,000 dwt ships; and
(b) unloading at a rate of 600 TPH which may be increased without
substantial additional investment if so required.
20.       It is estimated that the cost per ton handled will be reduced to
US$1.09 per ton representing a saving of US$1.49.  This benefit is fully
allocated to the project since the coal is shipped under Korean flag. The
total saving in costs is US$1.95 million in 1977, with 1.31 million tons of
coal handled. Details on the composition and development of transport costs
under the present and proposed system are shown in Table 23.
(ii) Ores, Minerals, Steel and Scrap
21.       Under the present system, ores, minerals, steel and scrap are shipped
utilizing ships of 5,000 dwt average size, which are handled at berth and by



ANNEX 9
Page 7
lighterage in approximately equal numbers. The cargo handling rate is about
100 TPH and the handling cost per ton is US$1.25.
22.       The project will provide specialized export and import berths at
Pier 7, which will allow handling rates of about 240 TPH. The new mechanized
facilities will reduce the handling cost to US$0.46 per ton.
23.       The total port costs per ton are US$2.05 under the present system,
including handling costs and ship costs in port while the corresponding cost
with the new operations will be US$0.83, resulting in a cost reduction of
US$1.22 per ton. Details on the costs and savings are provided in Table 24.
(c) Coastal and International Ferries
24.       The international and coastal ferry terminals will be completed by
the middle of 1976. The international ferry terminal will be used by roll-on/
roll-off (ro-ro) ferries between Korea and Japan, which will mainly handle
trailer-fitted containers, and thus complement the container facilities on the
Composite Pier. In addition, the ro-ro ferries will serve a rapidly increasing
passenger traffic (Table 16).   The coastal ferry terminal will replace the
existing coastal operations, which are scattered at various temporary locations
within the port area, and provide mainly passenger services between Busan and
the coastal areas.
(i) International Ferry
25.       The estimated container traffic on the ro-ro ferry is shown in
Table 6, while details on containerization are provided in Annex 8. Evaluation
indicates (Annex 8), that the shipment of containers will result in slightly
lower overall transport costs by using specialized vessels and facilities
provided on the Composite Pier than by using the ro-ro ferry. Therefore, it
has been assumed that the increase in container traffic will take place on
the Composite Pier, while the international ferry terminal will provide a
constant once-a-day service over the period 1976-1986.
26.       The savings in transport cost allocated to the project have been
calculated to be US$4.84 per ton of containerized cargo handled and US$3.00
million total in 1977. Savings from the container traffic over the
Composite Pier, will gradually increase due to increased congestion if the
project is not constructed. Details are provided in Table 25. It has not
been possible, for lack of data, to calculate savings to passenger traffic.
These would, however, be very small compared with savings to containerized
cargo, as it is calculated that savings due to ten passengers would correspond
to savings on one ton of cargo. On this basis the number of passengers will
be about 10% of the cargo volume in 1977.
(ii) Coastal Ferry Terminal
27.       According to Table 16, the coastal passenger traffic volume through
Busan was 2.0 million in 1972, and is expected to increase to 2.4 million in
1976 and to 3.6 million by 1986. No detailed information on the cost structure



ANNEX 9
Page 8
of the coastal traffic is available. It has been conservatively estimated
that the project will not increase ship costs, while the saving in port hand-
ling costs has been estimated at US$0.20 per passenger, which saving would
remain constant over the period 1976-86. The total savings would thus be
US$0.48 million in 1976, increasing to US$0.72 million by 1986.
Mukho
28.       Mukho is essentially a two commwdity port, with substantial shipments
of coal and cement (Table 18). About 72% of the proposed works relate to the
irprovement of coal handling facilities, while the remaining part represents
minor rehabilitation and dredging works and a major improvement of the break-
water. The economic evaluation of the project investment in Mukho port has
been carried out in terms of the improvement of the coal handling facility
only, and the other improvements have been treated as associated improvements.
(a) Coal
29.       The project involves improvements to existing berths to accommodate
6,000 dwt vessels and an increase in the capacity of the mechanical loading
facility to 1,200 TPH by early 1976. After improvement, the facility will
handle, in addition to coal, increasing shipments of limestone to the steel
mill at Pohang.
30.       Under the present system, the average loading capacity is about 300
TPH, and in 1972, average waiting times per vessel of 35 hours were experi-
enced; not, however, only because of the high level of berth occupancy, but
also because of the lack of sufficient stock of a particular type of coal.
31.       Evaluation indicates that the present coal handling cost is US$0.22
per ton, while the cost for vessel service time at berth or anchorage is
estimated at US$0.35 per ton. The cost of waiting time was calculated to be
US$0.52 per ton in 1972, which would indicate that the waiting time exceeded
the time spent at berth.
32.       The Study Group's studies on cost optimization indicated that a
transport system with 6,000 dwt vessels and a loading rate of 1,200 TPH would
provide the least cost solution. Even with this system, the berth occupancy
would be a high 66% in 1976 and 70% in 1981, with waiting time costs per ton
of US$0.05 and US$0.10 respectively. The handling costs would remain unchanged
at US$0.22 per ton while the cost for vessel service time would decrease to
US$0.27 per ton.
33.       On the basis of the above, the cost per ton of coal handled would
decrease from US$1.09 to US$0.54 in 1976, representing a saving of US$0.55 per
ton. The total savings in 1976 are US$1.38 million on the basis of an esti-
mated shipment of 2.51 million tons of coal and limestone in that year. The
calculation of cost reductions for any subsequent year is not possible because
the waiting time costs will approach infinity.

KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST PORTS PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Financial Forecasts
A.  General
1,        It has been assumed that the proposed Port Authority will commence
operations   in  accordance with the plan of action.
2.        Other assumptions are:
(a) the proposed Bank loan of US$80 million equivalent will
be made to the Government and made effective about October
1, 1973;
(b) the amount of the Government loan for the Ports of Busan
and Mukho will be paid back to the Government by KPA on the
same terms as the loan and on the same amortization schedule;
(c) the Authority will not be required to pay income or
property taxes, or import duties on equipment purchased
with the proceeds of the loan;
(d) the Authority will provide and maintain all port facilities
but will not conduct cargo-handling operations; it will
either grant a concession, at a fee reasonably related to
the proportional cost of the facilities used, or rent
facilities exclusively used at a rental reasonably
related to cost; and
(e) a team of Authority personnel will, as required, coordinate
labor and mobile equipment, control and supervise the
movement, receipt and delivery of cargo on wharves and
in sheds. They will check or tally cargo and be responsible
for cargo documentation, security, cleanliness of the facilities
and the efficient use of shed and cargo open areas. A
"service charge" will be assessed by the Authority
beginning on January 1, 1976 for these and other related
services provided by miscellaneous dock labor.
3.        Other factors affecting the forecasts are:
(a) traffic forecasts referred to in Chapter VI. For wharfage
revenues, general cargo traffic has been converted to
revenue tons from metric tons by application of a conver-
sion factor of 1.5;



ANNEX 10
Page 2
(b)  capital investments referred to in Chapter IV, and estimated
nominal investments outside the project. The latter have
been estimated conservatively, as exact information is
lacking at this time;
(c)  future improvements in operations, cargo handling, ship
turnaround time and other changes in operating prodedures
referred to in Chapter III and Annex 5;
(d)  constant 1972 prices for materials and wages;
(e)  straight line depreciationi and rates of annual depreciation,
as follows:
Years
(i)  Breakwaters                                    1%
(ii) Wharves and Piers, including Transit
Sheds not separately stated                   3%
(iii)  Buildings, Navigation Aids, and Tugs          5%
(iv)  Equipment, Roads and Paving                   10%
(f)  elimination, as of January 1, 1974, of favorable rate
treatment granted without financial or economic justification
to a substantial portion of traffic through exemption from
charges and/or preferential rates;
(g)  the assessment and collection of all charges, including
port dues and service charges, by the Authority in
accordance with the plan of action; and
(h)  full responsibility for cargo control to be vested in the
Authority, to the exclusion of all others, on non-rented
facilities; and as a result, removal of long-term ware-
housing operations in transit sheds to more appropriate
facilities.  This involves the establishment, no later
than January 1, 1976, the date assumed in the projections,
of adequate cargo-demurrage rates to be applied after
a six-day free-time cargo holding period.  These rates
are assumed to contain an adequate penalty element so that
earned demurrage revenues are not substantial.
B.   Particular
BUSAN
Specific assumption in respect of the Port of Busan are as follows:



ANNEX 10
Page 3
(a) land value of Won 30,000 per Pyong in lieu of Won 100,000
as suggested by the consultants;
(b)  completion and/or commencement of operations of new
facilities will be on the followingdates:
June 1, 1976    - Coastal and International Ferries
Pier 1
Dredging - general waterways only
January 1, 1977 - Pier 7
Dredging, in part
January 1, 1978 - Composite Pier
Balance of dredging
Grain silo
(c) the ferry facilities and the new Composite and No. 7 piers
will be rented to private enterprises, which will operate
them;
(d) pier 3, (Presently Military), will be vested in the Authority
on January 1, 1978; and as a consequence, its value of an
estimated Won 2,930 million will be added to the Authority's
assets and Government capital; and
(e) the "expansion area" of reclaimed but unimproved land which
is a part of the Composite Pier set aside for future expansion,
will remain unused through 1981, it is therefore retained in
the Authority's assets as work in progress throughout the
forecast period.
MUKHO
Specific assumptions in respect of the Port of Mukho are as follows:
(a) land values of Won 12,000 in lieu of 30,000 as suggested by
consultants; and
(b)  completion and/or commencement operation of new facilities
and equipment on the following dates:
January 1, 1976 - Coal Pier "A"
Breakwater Improvements
Dredging - Existing Coal Pier
