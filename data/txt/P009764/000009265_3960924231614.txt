PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
THIRTEENTH INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT PROJECT
LOAN 1843-IN
EVAIUATION; SUAR
(M)      This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the thirteentn Bank
loan -- approved in May 1980 -- to Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India Ltd. (ICICI). With this loan of $100 million, the
total Bank assistauce to ICICI reached $615 million. The project aimed at
continuing the use of ICICI as an efficient channel of resource transfer
for financing high priority industrial projects in India; assisting ICICI
in diversifying its sources of foreign borrowings; and encouraging ICICI to
do industrial studies and other developmental activities that would
complement its mains-ream activities (paras 2 and 3).
(ii)     The above objectives were achieved during the project period
(para 23). The loan was committed and disbursed ahead of schedule and
closed on the due date of December 31, 1985 (para 25). While lending is
still concentrated in Western India, some progress has been made in
expanding the geographical coverage (para 18). A total of 121 projects
were assisted, including 36% to units in industrially backward areas.
About 14% of the amounts lent were for new projects, while the balance were
for modernization, re.lacement, expansion or diversification (para 26).
Sub-loans for metal products and machinery manufacturing projects accounted
for 28% of total lendinS, chemicals and petroleum products 26%, automobile
and ancillaries 12% and cement 9% (para 27). About 55% of the assistance
went to projects in high priority industries. Some 75% of the total number
of projects received average assistance of less than one million dollars;
on the other hand 25% of the projects received about 60% of the total
assistance in value (paras 26-28).
(iii)    Based on data for fifty-three companies, twenty-nine of them (55%)
are currently not earning a minimum financial rate of return on investment
of 12% and twenty-two of these companies incurred losses in the projected
normal year of activity (when assets are ready for full production). In
addition, forty-three sub-loans (36% of total) have been re-scheduled due
to difficulties faced and eighteer. sub-loans (including 16 rescheduled)
were in arrears at December 1987. The problem is largely due to poorer
than expected performance by the sub-borrowers following liberalization of
the economy and increased competition. Sub-borrowers' difficulties were
compounded and loan repayment burden was made heavier because of: the
charging of fixed interest rates during a period of high interest rates;



and the bt.:ing of the foreign exchange risk by them - the Indian rupee has
progressively depreciated against foreign currencies (presently about 60%
against the US dollar compared with the rate during loan effectiveness)
(paras 32-34).
(iv)     Based on results to date, project performance has been mixed.
Although some of the rescheduled companies' performance has improved
subsequently, it is too early to predict the overall financial performance
under the project. Bank and ICICI should exchange information on project
related sub-borrower performance more frequently (para 37). Ex-post
economic rates of return on a limited sample of sub-projects ranges between
18% and 39%. ICICI is preparing additional data on the economic perform-
ance under the project. About 8770 jobs were created under the project at
an average cost per job of $37,900. The sub-projects' contribution to
exports has not been significant (para 35).
(v)      ICICI continues to assume a major role in India's financial system
and now accounts for some 45% of institutional foreign exchange financing
for industry. Over the last few years it has diversified its activities,
and now provides a broad range of financial services including wortking
capital finance, mergers and acquisitions, export finance, supplier credit,
underwriting, guarantees and leasing. Many of these activities have been
quite remfterative and contributed to ICICI's profitability.  ICICI has
only limited authority to finance working capital and there may be a case
for expanding its ability to do so to help ensure that project financing is
adequately financed. The corporation has also diversified its resource
base and is now an established borrower in international financial and
domestic markets. In addition, ICICI is playing an active role in
assisting the government in formulating industrial policies, especially
those relating to the private sector (para 10).
(vi)     With Bank support, ICICI has also undertaken a broad range of
complementary activities and services such as industrial sub-sector and
policy studies; identification and promotion of new projects; and training
and advisory support for other domestic and foreign financial institutions
(para 20).
(vii)    Aided by a dynamic management team ICICI continues to earn
satisfactory profits and maintain a sound financial condition. However
more recently, reduced access to concessional funds and growing reliance on
financial markets has begun to reduce lending margins.  The overall arrears
rate of the Corporation (before rescheduling) has risen in recent years -
from 2.4% in 1982 to 2.8% in 1987 - a reflection of the more competitive
changing environment.  ICICI management is conscious of this aspect and
continuously reviews the recovery status of sub-loans and takes appropriate
follow up action. An effective loan recovery plan together with collection
targets is in place.  Continral attention to this issue will be essential
(paras 21 and 22).



-vi-
(viii)   ICICI is a highly sophisticated organization which has responded
to increased competition in the financial sector by effectively
diversifying both its resources and its activities. However, this
environment has also created more challenges in terms of more complex
problems of foreign resource mobilization and management; need !or greater
flexibility in setting domestic lending rates given greater reliance on
commercial sources of finance; more difficult portfolio management problems
and need for better information on borrowers and sub-projects; and a need
for better project appraisal to assess technology and economic returns as
well as risk. The challenges have created a need for acquiring certain
specialized skills for which ICICI ;roposes to use the technical assistance
component under the Industrial Finance and Technical Assistance Project
(Loan 2928-IN) (para 40).
(ix)     Bank continues to be associated with ICICI, and four subsequent
loans have been given to the institution; ICICI XIV - Loan 2051-IN for
$150 million (completed); part of Industrial Exports Project - Engineering
Products - Loan 2630-IN for $160 million (ongoing); part of Cement Industry
Project - Loan 2661-IN for $35 million - ongoing; and part of Industrial
Finance and Technical Assistance Project - Loan 2928-IN for $105 million
(approved in March 1988). The proposed Industrial Technology Project and
the proposed Export Development Project will be vehicles for further
assistance (paras 40 and 41).
(x)      The principal lessons learned from the project are:  projects
which are attractive during periods of protection can face problems with
liberalization and increased competition; and schemes involving fixed
interest rates and the sub-borrowers' bearing the foreign exchange risk may
work fairly well during periods of stable currencies and interest rates but
have adverse effects when both currencies and interest rates are highly
variable (as in the early nineteen eighties). And, based on experience,
Government has tried to evolve more satisfactory arrangements for relending
to sub-borrowers. It is presently finalizing a variable foreign exchange
risk absorption scheme together with currency pooling to minimize the risks
borne by Government as well as the Development Finance Institutions and
their sub-borrowers (paras 43-45).



EROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDI
THIRTEENTH INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT POECT
LOAN 1843-IN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       The Bank assisted twelve industrial credit and investment projects
implemented by the industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Limited (ICICI) between 1955 and 1980. Total credits/loans during this
period amounted to $615 million. This project completion report (PCR)
covers the thirteenth loan to ICICI - for $100 million - which was signed
on May 16, 1980 and became effective on June 27, 1980. ICICI has prepared
a detailed PCR, which is attached as Appendix A, and this report summarizes
the main features, problems and achievements of the project.
II. THE PROJECT
2.       Obiectives of the Project.  The objectives of the project were to:
build on the progress achieved in previous operations by continuing to use
ICICI as an efficient channel of resource transfer for financing high-
priority industrial projects in India; assist ICICI in progressively
diversifying its sources of foreign exchange by facilitating blending of
Bank and commercial funds in its operations; and encourage ICICI in
carrying out its program of industrial studies and other developmental
activities that would complement mainstream finaticing operations.
3.       Proiect DescriRtion.  The project was designed to finance the
foreign exchange cost of industrial projects carried out by productive
enterprises in India. By helping to fill a gap in the availabilitv of
foreign exchange resources to finance capital goods imports, the project
was expected to contribute to investment in the modernization and expansion
of productive.industrial capacity in India.
III. ENVIRONMENT
4.       Industry has played a central role in India's development efforts
since independence. The country's aspirations for industry are firmly
rooted in the nation's most basic goals--economic growth, self-reliance and
social justice. During the early 1950s, a framework of trade and regula-
tory policies was established by the Indian Government for the industrial
sector with the following goals in mind: (a) the promotion of heavy
industry with an emphasis on the public sector; (b) a quest for economic



-2-
self-reliance, which translated into broad efforts at import substitution
and restrictions on imports of foreign technology to promote indigenous
innovation; (c) subsidies to and protection of the small-scale sector; and
(d) balanced regional development.
5.       Policy FraMework.1  The system of trade and industrial regulations
originated with the import controls introduced during the Second World War.
These controls subsequently bcame a permanent instrument of centrally
planned industrial development for achieving self-reliance. In addition,
resources were allocated according to detailed regulations, which were used
to allocate resources to subsectors whose output was intatded to replace
the most costly and visfible imports, largely capital and consumer goods.
Later, detailed regulations, especially licensing, were used to regulate
capacity. Until very recently, these licenses restricted firms to narrowly
specified lines of production.
6.       The industrial regulatory system reduced domestic competition and
limited the ability of firms to improve their performance. Firms had
limited flexibility in choosing plant size, altering product lines, reduc-
ing the workforce, selecting a location, and making many other choices that
are taken for granted in other countries. The above constraints seriously
affected industrial performance during the 1970's and in the early
eighties. Thus, during the Government's Sixth plan FY81 - FY85, which
corresponded to the period of the project, industrial and trade performance
was below the targets set in the plan. GDP growth in real terms averaged
about 58 p.a. Industrial output grew at an average annual rate of 6.9%
which was below the plan target of 7.7%. The growth in the index for
manufacturing alone averaged 5.7% as against the target of 7.6%. In value
terms the annual average growth rate of exports was 15% and in quantity
terms 2.9%; in case of manufactured exports, it was 13.5%.
7.       Recognizing the need to improve industrial performance, the Gov-
ernment has revised its industrial development strategy to place greater
reliance on price signals and market forces. Since the early eighties, the
Government has been moving towards a supporting and guiding role through
provision of incentives, infrastructure and institutional services. The
policy reforms represent a marked change in substance and direction from
past policies, and have fostered a more competitive environme,nt and more
collaboration with foreign investors, and the rate of growth of both manu-
facturing production and exports has risen perceptibly in recent years.
8.       The reform process has also stimulated private investment and
created a need for industries to adjust to greater competition through
modernization of plant and equipment and more efficient management.
Liberalization has also affected the development finance institutions
(DFIs), which need to respond by diversifying their financial sources and

services, improving their capacity to select and appraise economically and
financially competitive projects and strengthening the management of their
loan portfolios during the adjustment process.
9.       The Financial Sector.2  India's monetary and financial policies
reflect a strong commitment to macroeconomic stability which has contri-
buted to high savings rates and financial deepening. The Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) acts as the central bank and the regulatory agency for the
financial system. Holdings of its currency issues account for 17% of
financial assets. The commercial banks, primarily government-owned,
account for 40% of total financial assets, and lend to the agricultural,
industrial and commercial sectors on both short and medium term. Govern-
ment and privately--sponsored retirement schemes account for 23% of
financial assets while 10% correspond to government-owned life and general
insurance companies. The equity, debenture and short term money markets
have grown rapidly in recent years and these instruments now account for
10% of the assets of the financial system. The DFIs are not significant
direct mobilizers of financial savings, obtaining their funds from the
central and state governments, the RiI, the commercial banks, and the life
insurance companies through loans and bond issues. They are, however,
important term lenders to industry contributing some 14% of total
industrial financing in the country since 1980.
IV.  INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA (ICICI)
10.      ICICI, established in 1955, has grown to assume a major role in
India's financiai system, accounting for 45% of institutional foreign
exchange financing for industry.   Over the last few years, ICICI has
diversified its activities, and provides a broad range of financial
services including working capital finance, mergers and acquisitions,
export finance, supplier credits, underwriting, guarantees and leasing. In
addition, ICICI is playing an active role in assisting the government in
formulating industrial policies, especially those related to the private
sector. ICICI also has diversified its resource base and is now an
established borrower in international financial markets. From 1981 through
1987, ICICI raised the equivalent of about US$700 million from the inter-
national financial markets.
11.      Ownershig.  Ownership of ICICI is dominated by public sector
corporations, including the Life Insurance Corporation, the Unit Trust of
India and a number of nationalized commercial banks. Of ICICI's issued
share capital of Rs 800.5 million, public institutions hold 80.8%, foreign
shareholders (mainly commercial banks) hold 9.3% and the remaining 9.9% is
held by more than 7,000 private Indian investors.

(Report No. 6661 dated February 27, 1987) for a fuller discussion of
the subject.

12.      Oganization.  ICICI is well-managed and operates effectively
under a competent and experienced Board. The fifteen members of the Board
represent GOI (2 members), public financial institutions (1), foreign
shareholders (1), the professions and business (8), and include three full-
time executives of ICICI: the Chairman and two Deputy Managing Directors.
The Board meets regularly to set out ICICI's overall financial and opera-
tional policies and to decide on individual project proposals resulting in
single enterprise exposure over Rs 35 million. Mr. N. Vaghul, an
experienced banker, became Chairmar. and Managing Director in September
1985. Under him the Corporation continues to benefit from the able
leadership that has characterized it for many years.
13.      Organizationally, ICICI is divided into various groups headed by
senior executives under the overall supervision of the two Deputy Managing
Directors. Mr. B. V. Bhargava supervises the Project Finance group which
is responsible for appraising new projects and monitoring the loan
portfolio. This group is the largest in terms of professional staff as
well as volume of business. The Branch Co-ordination group and the
Operations Coordination & Policy group coordinate the project finance
activities of the branches and fulfill MIS requirements respectively.  The
Administration and Services Group is responsible for the Secretarial,
Administrative and HRD activities. Mr. N. J. Jhaveri supervises the
Financial Services group which includes Merchant Banking, Leasing and
Venture Capital activities. The Finance group is responsible for all
accounting and billing functions, foreign exchange operations, and the
Corporation's investment portfolio.  Mr. Jhaveri also supervises the
Corporate Planning & Policy and Resource mobilization activities,
Rehabilitation and Corporate Legal Advisory functions as also Technology
Development activity.  The Technology Adviser and the Internal Auditor
interact directly with the Chairman.
14.      Operating Policies and Procedures.  Prior to 1977, ICICI had no
formal policy statement, but relied on its Memorandum of Association,
together with Government guidelines and the periodic resolutions of its
Board, to provide a satisfactory operating policy framework. That year,
ICICI's Board adopted a Statement of Financial and Operational Strategy in
which six broad areas were specified for priority attention: export indus-
tries; power and transport; agriculture related enterprises; industries
basic to industrial growth; mass consumption goods; and balancing and
modernization projects. With the Fourteenth Loan (Loan 2051 IN - approved
in June 1981), ICICI updated this Statement principally to reflect ICICI's
intention to diversify its foreign exchange resources. Subsequently, under
the Industrial Export Project, (Loan 2629/2630 IN - approved in October
1985), ICICI placed expanded emphasis on export-oriented projects, with a
particular focus on engineering products. ICICI's current Corporate Policy
Statement, updated during appraisal of the Industrial Finance and Technical
Assistance Project (Loan 2928 IN, approved in March 1988), continues
ICICI's earlier basic lending policies, but gives new importance to
supporting sunrise industries, fostering technology development and
protecting the environment. It also places added emphasis on contributing



-5-
to the modernization of existing industries.  Internally, the build-up of
capital reserves, the adequacy of provisions for doubtful accounts, and
minimization of the foreign exchange risk on its operations are all more
clearly defined.
15.      Appraisal and Supervision Standards:  ICICI's appraisals continue
to be of a high standard and incorporate a thorough treatment of technical,
financial, market and economic aspects. Follow-up procedures and project
supervision standards also are satisfactory. Clients submit detailed
quarterly progress reports to ICICI for review and follow-up. Projects are
visited at least once a year and a satisfactory system of reporting and
management review exists. ICICI also reserves the right to appoint a
director on its clients' board and has done so selectively to intensify the
supervision of certain projects.
16.      On-lending Terms.  ICICI's standard rate of interest for subloans
from euro-currency sources bear a spread of 1.5% over the borrowing cost.
Interest rates on domestic currency loans also range from 11.5% to 14% with
a 1% p.a. surcharge on interest levied on companies whose shares are not
listed on a stock exchange. ICICI charges a 1% p.a. commitment fee on
foreign currency loans, and a commitment fee ranging between 0.25% and 1%
p.a. on domestic currency loans. ICICI's standard terms provide for maxi-
mum loan maturities of up to 15 years, including up to 3 years grace, which
conform to those offered by the other all India term-lending institutions.
Until recently (this includes the project under review), ICICI's sub-
borrowers bore the exchange risk on foreign currency loans, but recently,
Government has decided to assume this risk under some foreign loans.
17.      Recent Performance.  A summary of ICICI's operational performance
for the last five years (1982-1986) is shown in Annex 1. Table 1. As of
December 31, 1986, ICICI had approved cumulative financing since its found-
ing totalling Rs 54 billion for some 4,850 projects. For the year ending
on that date, disbursements were Rs 6.0 billion, reflecting a 25% average
annual growth over the level of disbursements in 1982. The sub-sectoral
distribution of assistance reflects ICICI's concentration on non-tradi-
tional and technologically more advanced industries. The engineering
sector, including metal products, mechanical and electrical machinery and
transport equipment, accounted for about 25% of the total, followed by the
chemical and petrochemical industries (22%). Other more traditional sub-
sectors receiving a significant proportion of ICICI financing were: tex-
tiles (13%); basic metal (9%); and pulp and paper (6%). ICICI's clients
are predominantly medium to large-sized private enterprises. In 1986,
ICICI's average assistance per project was about Rs 13.9 million
(US$1.1 million). However, only 45% of the firms financed had net fixed
assets of less than Rs 100 million (US$7.8 million).
18.      ICICI has emphasized the modernization and upgrading of clients'
plant and equipment to improve overall industrial efficiency and improve



-6-
competitiveness. These efforts involve advising clients at the appraisal
stage on technology choice. ICICI also provides technical assistance,
through its merchant banking and rehabilitation divisions, to industries
which need financial restructuring. The geographical distribution of
assisted projects is somewhat skewed toward the more industrialized states
in Western India; however, ICICI is making progress in diversifying its
portfolio geographicallv.
19.      ICICI carries out an annual. review of the financial performance of
companies in its portfolio. Of the sample of 417 companies analyzed for
the year 1985-86, the average return on equity after tax was 15.3%, and
return on capital employed was about 15.7% which is an improvement over the
return of 14.9% obtained in 1984-85. Most companies financed by ICICI have
a sound capital base with an average debt:equity ratio of 0.68. The
economic impact of ICICI financed projects has also been satisfactory. The
simple average ex-ante economic rate of return for 80 projects approved in
1986 was 34%. These investments are expected to create about 38,000 new
jobs at an average investment cost per job of about US$19,400; this is
reasonable in view of the concentration on balancing and modernization.
Furthermore, a significant proportion of ICICI's clients export at least
part of their output, contributing 20% to India's manufactured exports.
20.      Other Developmental Activities.  ICICI undertakes a broad range of
complementary activities and services aimed at enhancing its overall devel-
opmental impact. These activities include: industrial subsector ;-Id
policy studies; Identification and prcmotion of new projects; and training
and advisory support for other domestic and foreign financia'l institutions.
Most of these activities were initiated following the joint Bank/ICICI
study of ICICI's development impact in 1973. The Technology Development
and Information company of India Limited (TDICI) has been established to
assist existing industry in adopting advanced technologj ventures. Venture
capital operations were started in 1986.  In addition, a credit rating
agency has been promoted.
21.      Financial Results and Position.  !CICI's financial results for the
1981-1986 period are summarized in Annex 1 Tables 2 and 3. ICICI's total
assets passed the Rs 20.0 billion mark for the first time in 1985 and
increased further to Rs 28.0 billion at the end of 1986. Assets were
financed by rupee borrowings (54%), foreign currency borrowings (33%),
other liabilities (4%) and net worth (9%). The rapid growth in assets
correspond to the surge in ICICI's business since 1981. This was due to an
improved investment climate and ICICI's concerted efforts to diversify and
promote new business. Net profits after tax as a percentage of average net
worth during the 1982-1986 period averaged 20% compared with 16% in 1980.
The Improvement in net profit was due to higher volume of operations and
lower effective tax rate on profits. The interest rate spread increased
from 2.5% in 1980 to 3.2% in 1983 and declined to 2.8% in 1986 due to the



-7-
rapid increase in ICICI's borrowing from commercial markets at higher costs
and increased interest rates on GOI-guaranteed bond issues. Administrative
expenses measured as percentage of average total assets declined from 0.6%
in 1981 to 0.3% in 1987-88. Due to the increase in profit, ICICI's debt:
equity ratio as defined in the latest Bank loan agreement, declined from
10.5:1 in 1981 to 9.8:1 by the end of 1984, and to 9.5:1 by the end of
1986. The debt service coverage ratio also remained favorable at 1.7.
22.      These results have been supported by the general high quality of
ICICI's portfolio. Principal in arrears at the end of 1987, at
Rs 620 million, is about 2.2% of total loans outstanding (2.8% before
rescheduling). However, there is an emerging unfavorable trend in
collection performance. The arrears ratio indicated above has actually
climbed steadily in recent years. The collection ratio before rescheduling
has dropped from 75% in 1983 to 74% in 1987-88 (details are in Annex 1,
Tables 4 and 5). Industries in the cotton and synthetic textiles, cement,
paper, chemicals and sugar subsectors account for 68% of portfolio in
arrears. ICICI identifies adverse market developments, prolonged labor
trouble, inadequacies in management and low capacity utilization as the
prilicipal causes of companies falling back in their payments. Rapid
corrective measures to prevent further deterioration in these companies
have not always been possible because of difficulties in agreeing with
other creditors and the enterprises' management of actions necessary. As
of the end of 1986, 24% of accounts in arrears were behind payments for
more than 12 months and an additional 28% were behind for more than 24
months. These figures represent a hard core of difficult accounts and are
receiving ICICI's intensive attention, particularly in view of more
difficult competitive conditions for Indian industrial enterprises.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
23.      Objectives.  During implementation close contact continued to be
maintained between ICICI and the Bank. As reflected in the project
objectives (para 2) several non-Bank commercial loans were raised by ICICI
thus diversifying its resources (para 10). Industrial studies in "Energy
Utilization in Industry", "Electric Equipment Industry" and Automotive
Products were also carried out and discussed with the Bank. In addition
ICICI, with Bank support and assistance developed new initiatives
particularly in policy-oriented sector work. Such work has served as a
basis and led to the formulation of the Bank's Industrial Exports Project -
Engineering Products - Loan 2630-IN and to a Cement Industry Project -
Loan 2660-IN.



.8-
24.      Interest Rates.  On-lending rates to sub-borrowers were raised to
11.85% in July 1980 and later to 14% in March 1981 (from 11% at appraisal)
to provide a reasonable spread to ICICI following imposition by Government
of an interest tax and increased borrowing costs. This increase took place
during a time of high global interest rates which however fell sharply
during succeeding years.
25.      Loan Commitment and Disbursements.  Due to strong demand for for-
eign currency assistance, the entire loan was committed by ICICI during
1980 and 1981. Net of cancellations, a total of 121 projects were
assisted. Diabursements amounted to $95.7 million ($91.5 million or 96%
were disbursed by end 1983) and were completed by September 1985. The
balance $4.3 million was cancelled and the loan was closed on schedule on
December 31, 1985. Details are in the basic data sheet. The foreign
currency loan assistance was supplemented with rupee assistance in some
cases in the form of loan and underwriting and/or direct subscription of
shares/debentures. Such assistance by ICICI was small compared to the
foreign currency loans - a ratio of 1:9.
26.      Assistance By Location and TyIe.  Of the 121 projects, 43 or 36%
of the total number were located in industrially backward areas and
received 40% of the foreign exchange assistance provided. Details of
assistance by type of project are given in table 1.

Thus, expansion, modernization and balancing/replacement (including equip-
ment for research and development) accounted for 71% of the total number of
projects and 65% of the foreign currency assistance, while new projects/new
companies (17% of projects and 14% of foreign assistance) and diversifi-
cation (18% of projects and 21% of foreign exchange) accounted for the
balance.

Sub-loans for basic and fabricated metals products and machinery
manufacturing received the largest assistance - Rs 460 million or 28%,
followed by chemicals and petroleum products (Rs 424 million or 26%),
automobile and ancillaries (Rs 200 million or 12%), and cement (Rs 156
million or 9%). These four groups together accounted for some 75% of the
total assistance.

28.      Assistance bX Loan Size.  An analysis of sub-loans by size is
given in Table 3.

4.001 to  6.000
Above 6000
The average size of assistance per project was about $791,000. Twenty-six
projects (21% of total) received assistance of less than $250,000 ane
30 projects (25%) received assistance between $250,000 million and
$500,000. A further 30 projects were provided assistance of more than
$1 million. Thus, a large number of projects were extended small amounts
of assistance mainly for replacement, modernization and diversification;
on the other hand, 25% of the projects received about 60% of the total
assistance in value.
29.      Based on Government's guidelines for assistance to priority
sectors (export orientation, backward areas, etc.) assistance was given to
62 projects in high priority industries (Rs 903 million or 55% of total
assistance) and to 30 projects in other priority industries (Rs 432 million
or 26% of total assistance).
30.      Time and Cost Over-runs  Based on data for 113 projects, 53
projects (47%) were completed on scb -,le, while 18 (16%) were completed
with a delay of over 12 months. The other 42 projects (37%) were completed
with delays ranging up to one year. 46 projects (41%) had cost over-runs,
while 53 (47%) had no over-runs and 14 (12%) hal savings. The aggregate
over-runs for the 113 projects was about 19% while for the specific
projects having over-runs the percentage was almost 30%. Intensity of



-11-
over-runs has been marked in the case of new and diversification projects
due largely to lack of comprehensive details at the time of sub-project
appraisal.
31.      The delays in implementation were due to problems such as arrang-
ing necessary governmental approvals, obtaining financing including
promoters' contributions and equipment delivery schedules. In addition to
these delays, cost over-runs were due mainly to increases in excise and
customs duties, price increase of steel and cement and lack of detailed
engineering designs during sub-project appraisal.
32.      Financial Performance.  Based on available data for 53 companies,
31 earned profits as estimated while 22 incurred losses in the projected
normal year (when assets are ready for full production). Thirteen of the
22 companies have actual capacity utilization of less than 50%. Of the 31
profit making companies 24 are estimated to earn a return on investments of
over 12%. Thus, 29 (or 55%) of the 53 companies are currently not earning
a minimum return of 12%, which is not satisfactory.
33.      Sub-loan Repayments.  Fourteen of the 121 project sub-loans have
been fully repaid. Of the balance of 107, forty-three sub-loans (or 36% of
total loans) were rescheduled due to difficulties faced by them. Eighteen
sub-loans (including 16 rescheduled) were in arrears as of December 1987.
The most common problem faced by the majority of the 43 cases is marketing.
Seven of these are in the textile industry (clothing and machinery) while
three are in the jute industry and both industries were affected by
recession. Other problems reported include time and cost over runs and
technical. Although some of the rescheduled companies' performance has
improved subsequently, it is too early to judge the overall results.
34.      The princJpal reason for sub-borrowers' difficulties is poorer
than expected performance largely due to the consequences of liberalization
and increased competition. However their loan repayment burden is heavier
because of two reasons: the charging of fixed interest rates to them at a
time when global interest rates were high (para 24); and the bearing of the
foreign exchange risk by them - the Indian rupee has depreciated by about
60% against the US dollar since loan effectiveness.
35.      Economic Indicators.  Annex 2 gives data on economic rates of
return for 6 projects financed under the loan. Those range from 18% to 39%
and are satisfactory. However the sample is small and further evaluations
are being worked out by ICICI for the othez projects. Data on employment
in 33 cases was estimated at 8,771 workers at a cost per job of about
Rs 474,000 or $37,900 (compared with $32,000 under the previous two ICICI
loans financed by the Bank) which is reasonable. The sub-projects'
contribution to exports has not been significant.



-12-
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMKENDATIONS
Project Performance
36.      Loan sanctions and commitments were completed by 1981, less than 2
years after effectiveness; and the bulk of disbursement were also completed
by 1982 (para 25) - a noteworthy achievement. New capacity has been
created in different priority sectors of the industry, new units have been
set up in backward areas and modernization of existing units has been
assisted (paras 26 through 29).
37.      Financial performance of the project sub-borrowers, however, is
not satisfactory (para 32). In additioa, under the project, 43 accounts
(35% of total number) had to be rescheduled (para 33) and this is high.
Sixteen of them are still in arrears. The problem is largely due to poorer
than expected performance largely due to the consequences of liberalization
and increased competition; but the difficulties have been compounded and
the loan repayment burden made heavier because of fixed interest rate
charging and the bearing of the foreign exchange risk by the sub-borrowers
(para 34). Although it is too early to judge the overall project financial
performance, the results so far have been mixed. Bank and ICICI should
exchange information on project related sub-borrower performance more
frequently.
38.      ICICI.  ICICI's overall portfolio arrears rate (before
rescheduling) has also risen in recent years - from 2.4% in 1984 to 2.8% in
1987 - a reflection of the changing environment. ICICI management is
conscious of this aspect and continuously reviews the recovery status of
its sub-loans. Where a client encounters difficulties, relief (including
rescheduling) is allowed; at the same time concerted efforts are made to
improve the operations of the clients.
39.      Institutionally, ICICI diversified its sources of foreign exchange
and carried out industrial studies as desired (para 23); and, as indicated
in previous PCRs, ICICI has continued to develop well and to expand its
operations. Led by a dynamic management team, the Corporation continues to
earn satisfactory profits and maintain a sound financial condition. ICICI
continues to fulfill its role as a leading development bank and to promote
the acceleration of industrial development of the country.
40.      ICICI is a highly sophisticated organization which has responded
to increased competition in the financial sector by effectively
diversifying both its resources and its activities. However, this
environment has also created more challenges in terms of more complex
problems of foreign resource mobilization and management; need for greater
flexibility in setting domestic lending rates given greater reliance on
commercial sources of finance; more difficult portfolio management problems



-13-
and need for better information on borrowers and sub-project; and a need
for better project appraisal to assess technology and economic returns as
well as risk. These challenges have created a new need for institution
building which is being provided under a technical assistance component
under the Industrial Finance and Technical Assistance Project (Loan
2928-IN).
Bank's Role
41.      Bank has been associated with industrial development in India for
over three decades. In addition to financing specific projects, it has had
an active industrial sector work program and prepared a number of sector
reports. It has also supported and assisted ICICI in its policy-oriented
sector work, which led to the formulation of some of the more recent
projects. Following the present pLOject, four subsequent loans have been
given to the ICICI: ICICI XIV - Loan 2u51 for $150 million (completed);
part of Industrial Exports Project - Engineering Products - Loan 2630 for
$160 million (ongoing); part of the Cement Industry Project - Loan 2660-IN
for $81.75 million (ongoitig) and Loan 2661-IN for $35 million - ongoing;
and part of Industrial Finance and Technical Assistance Project -
Loan 2928-IN for $105 million (approved in March 1988).
42.      Three new projects involving ICICI are also being prepared:  an
Industrial Technology Development Project, an Export Development Project
and an Electronics Industry Development Project. Government is keen to
obtain Bank support for building the links between the technology
infrastructure and the industrial sector and for developing effective
financial instruments and institutions for technology financing. The
Export Project will, in addition to giving finance for viable projects,
provide technical assistance to ICICI's staff for training in the
administration of Export Development Funds, and to purchase information and
consultancy services in appraising export programs and investments.
Lessons Learned
Projects which are attractive during periods of protection with
strong demand for foreign exchange assistance can face problems with
liberalization and increased competition. This problem was not foreseen at
appraisal.
44.      Schemes involving fixed interest rates and the sub-borrowers
bearing the foreign exchange risks worked reasonably well during periods of
stable currencies and interest rates. However, this policy has had adverse
effects during the nineteen eighties when both currencies and interest
rates have been highly variable.



-14-
45.      Bank adopted the variable interest rate policy from July 1982.
And, based on the experience gained from the present and subsequent loans
(Loans 2051, 2630 and 2661 - para 41), Government has tried to evolve more
satisfactory arrangements for relending to sub-borrowers. As an interim
measure, the Government, for a fixed foreign exchange premium, has recently
absorbed the foreign exchange risk for the ongoing Bank funded projects
involving DFIs. In addition, Government is finalizing a more general and
flexible system covering all foreign exchange borrowings involving the
DFIs. This system will be a variable foreign exchange risk absorption
scheme together with currency pooling so as to minimize the risks borne by
the Government as well as the DFIs and their sub-borrowers. The details
will be discussed with the Bank shortly.

ISRD THIRTEENTH LIND OF CREDIT (1843-IN)
I. INTRODUCTION
A loan of USS 100 million (Thirteenth Line of
Credit)   carrying  interest  at  8.25%         per  annum   was
sanctioned by the World Bank (Bank) to ICICI in 1980 for
augmenting its foreign exchange resources required for its
operations.   The  loan agreement was signed on May 16,  1980
and the loan came into operation with effect from June 27,
1960.   The origihal terminal date for completing withdrawals
was December 31, 1985. However, the Bank authorised the last
payment  to be effected on March 4,  1986.   The total amount
disbursed under this line was USS 95.671 million and the
balance amount of USS 4.329 million was cancelled.
Annexure I gives the list of sub-projects. commitment
dates and the amount disbursed and outstanding under the
Thirteenth Line of Credit. Though the assistance under the
Thirteenth Loan was originally sanctioned to 132 projects
comprising 2 A projects and 130 B projects, the actual number
of projects utilising the assistance (after exclusion of 8 3
projects for which assistance was cancelled / transferred and

3 r projects which have been given two subloans each for the
same  project  -   ACC Sabcock,    Nicco Orissa and  Crompton
Greaves) amounted to 121.
I. PROJECT IDENTXFICATFN
A. Obiectives and Expectations
Negotiations for the Thirteenth Line of Credit from
IDRO  were held in Washington oan Aril 9-11.  1980  following
technical  discussions  on April 7-8.   The major  points  of
understandings   reached   by  the  delegation   representing
Government of India, ICICI and IBRD were as follows
1.  2iversificat4qn of rareign Exchanae Resogrcest The ICICI
representatives confirmed that ICICI would continue to
see opportunities to diversify its sources of foreign
currency,   within   the  guidelines  laid  down  by  the
Government o;1 India, wherever resources could be obtained
on   terms   and  conditions   appropriate   to   ICICI's
operations.   In  this regard,  the ICICI representatives
reported that negotiations had been completed to raise a
syndicated euro-currency loan of approximately S 30
million equivalent.   Based on its financial projections,



- 29-
APPEDIX A
Pale 3 of 41
and taking into account the amount of the prop'sed IIRD
Loan   and   amounts  expected  to  be   available   from
traditional sources such as KIM ICICI would expect to
raise at least another 5 25 million from commercial or
other sources before September 1982.
2.  Dlendina  o   Ln           Commercial  funds:  The   ICICI
represntatives   presented   memorandum   outlining   the
procedures ICICI intended to adopt in the utilization of
its different sources of foreign exchange to avoid
incurring foreign exchange risks in respect of its
commercial borrowings and to provide adequate repayment
terms to its clients. In some cases, this would mean
making parallel subloans for the same project out of
commercial  funds  and  out  of  the  IBRD  loan.    IBRD
confirmed that procedures set out in the memorandum were
acceptable   and  that  in  those  cases  where  parallel
subloans were made for the same project, IBRD would allow
ICrCX to set the repayment schedule of the IBRD financed
subloan so that the shorter maturity commercial funds
would be repaid relatively more rapidly.   In such cases.
ICICI   would  allocate  relatively  rore  of  the  early



-30-
APPUDZX A
Page 4 of 41
disbursements to the commercial subloans so as to permit
the commercial borrowings to be drawn down within the
specified contractual period.   The ZCZCZ representativeu
confirmed that in the case of Bank financed subloans for
projects not involving a parallel commercial subloan,
ICICI would follow its normal practice of setting the
repayment schedula so as to require approximately equal
somi-annual payments of principal or approximately equal
semi-annual payments of principal and interest.
3.  IC  C     Us Statement  L ofinancial and  Coeratina  Stratoav:
The Bank had desired ICZCX to adopt a Statement of
Financial and operating Strategy relating to its lending
policies satisfactory to the Bank, not later than July
31.   1960.   The  ZBRD  team  confirmed that  the  draft
statement  submitted  by  IClCI  would  be  regarded   as
satisfactory  by  the Bank for the purposes.   The  ICICI
representatives stated that it was their intention to
submit  the   revised statement to th-  ICICI  Board  for
formal approval before the end of April 1980.
4.  Protect  Comoletion Reort:   The IBRD confirmed that the
report referred to in Section 3.03b of the Draft Loan
Agreement need not incorporate a full ex-post evaluation



- 31-
PaMg 3 of 41
of all subprojects financed out of the Loan. ICICI would
consult with ZURD regarding the choice of a suitable
sample out of the subprojects in operation for full ex-
post analysis.
5. Industrial Studies: The ICICI representatives presented
outline descriptions of two major industrial studies that
ICICI intended to undertake during the course of the next
two years and confirmed that they would continue to
discuss with the Bank the design of detailed terms of
reference for theso studies.   The ICIC1  representatives
also confirmed that they would continue to discuss with
the Bank possible extensions to their recent studies of
the automotive products subsector.
6. Interest Rates: The IBRD team raised the question of tihe
recent rises in the annual rates of inflation in India
and abroad and rising world interest rates and their
possible  effects on ICICI's borrowing costs.   The ICICI
representative stated that ICICI had recently initiated a
review of its rupee and foreign currency lending rates
taking  into  account  the above  factors.   However  the
timing of any action to make an upward adjustment in
ICICIVs lending rates would have to be determined in
consultation   with  the  other  financial   institutions
serving the industrial sector in India.

APPENDIX A
Pal. 6 of 41
7.  .C; Cs  Free LimiSt:   It was agreed that the free  limit
for sanctions by ICICI would be USS 6 million.   For  the
purpose of determining whether a proposed subloan is
below or above the free limit of USS 6 million. the
amount of such subloan or investment shall be aggregated
with "any other amounts financed or proposed to be
financed out of proceeds of the loan or prior loans for
the   same  project  or  for  any  project  directly   or
materially related thereto". it was also agreed that the
broad criteria for deteraining as to whether the project
is materially related to the earlier projects are
(a) the project under reference will be substantially
under the same corporate structure as the earlier
project(s);
(b) the success or failure of the project under
reference will have a direct effect on that of
the earlier project(s):
(c) the   project  under  reference  relates  to  the
expansion, replacement. improvement of facilities
financed under the earlier project(s) or to the
production of similar or complementary items or
items forming part of a vertically integrated
production process:



- 33-
APPENDTX A
Psie 7 of 41
(d) the date of sanction of the subloan for the
project under reference is withit 3 years of
completion of the last of the earlier project(s);
(e) in cases where the Bank has already approved a
subloan for an investment project and ICici
proposes to make a further subloan for the same
investment project to cover minor cost overruns
or equipment changes, the Bank's prior review and
approval of the further subloans would not be
requireed if the amount of the further subloan is
less than S 500.000 equivalent.
8.Date wh,en Exoenditurus ar  Made:  The IBRD team confirmed
that the date on which expenditures would be deemed to
have been made would be the date on which payment is made
to the supplier for goods and services required for an
Investment Project. In the case of letters of credit for
payment on a post-shipment basis. IBRD would interpret
the date of expenditure to be the date on which payment
is actually made to the supplier and not the date of
opening of the letter of credit.

9.   ssegial  Disbursement Procedur:  The Indian  negotiating
team  brought  up  the  quegtion of  continuance  of  tho
Special  Disbursement  Procedure (SDP) announced  by  the
Dank  in  March  1979  in  regard  to  disbursements   on
outstandinag  DFC loans beyond July 1,  1980 when the  new
currency  pooling  system was to be  given  effect.   The
rndian team indicated that most ICICI clients were aware
of the SDP, and that availability of facilities under SOP
had been a factor inducing revival of foreign currency
applications during the last year, as also helping in
r*etoration of the confidence of ICXCI clients in using
the World Bank funds, as in their perception SOP helped
to contain the exchange risks on the funds so borrowed.
The Indian teas, therefore, strongly urged that the
foregoing be pointedly brought to the attention of the
Bank's  management  so  that  ICICr*s  anxiety  on   this
important question receives due attention when the matter
comes up for review. ICICI's team's specific proposals
wero that:
i)  all  the  undisbursed portions of existing  World
Bank loans to ICICI up to and inclusive of the
12th  loan  should  continue to qualify  for  SOP
beyond July 1, 1980;



- 35 -
APPENDIX A
Pate 9 of 41
ii) availability of SOP be ensured for the 13th loan
as  most  of  ICICI clients who  were in  zcicr .
application   pipeline  would  have  taken   into
account availability of this facility, and that
many others intending to approach ICICI for
financial assistance would be making their plans
on that basis.
The IBRD team took note of ICXCI's concern
regarding the continuance of the SOP scheme and confirmed
that the concern would be brought to the attention of
Bank management.
An per the understandings at the time of negotiations for
the loan, ICICI took the following steps to implement or comply
with the same.
1.   Diversification of fgreian exchanae resources:  AS indicated
at the time of negotiations. ICICI concluded a borrowing of
syndicated Euro Currency Loan for DM 20 million and USS 20
million  in  April 1980.   In addition.  ICICI raised   Euro
Currency loan in three currencies viz. DM 30 million. SF 30
million and JY 3000 million in October 1981 and US $ 30
million by way of Floating Rate Note issue in December 1981.
Further, ICICI arranged for an ECGD export line of credit



- 36-
APPENDIX A
Page 10 of 41
for  Pounds  S million in March 1982.   In  addition,  IcICI
raised  USS  12  million in September  1982  to  prepay  the
outstanding loan raisod ifn 1978 and thus roduced the
interest rate from "LIBOR + 1%" to "SIBOR + 3/8V.
Apart from commercial borrowings, ICICI signed three
agreemonts of DM 5 million,  DM 25 million and DM 25 million
with KfW in 1980,  1981 and upto September 1982 respectively
to augment the resources for meeting its increasing needs.
2.   Blendina  of  Bank  and  Commercial  Funds:    As  indicated
earlier,  ICICI raised funds from commercial sources.   With
the funds available from both the sources, ICICI did provide
funds for some projects, whose requirement vas sizeable,
from both the sources and thus resorted to blending of Bank
funds  and commercial funds.   Whenever funds were  provided
under both the sources for the same projocts, repayment of
commercial borrowings had shorter maturity period than IBRD
sub-loans.   If the sub-loans were provided entirely out  of
Bank finances, ICICI followed the normal practice of setting
the amortization schedule in such a manner chat amounts were
moro or less recovered in equal semi-annual payments.

3*   xCIC2  Statement o  FIinancial and O2pratina  LUate. y:  As
indicated to the Bank, ICICI placed before the Board in
April  1980  a  paper    'ICZCX's  Financial  and  Operating
Strategy' relating to its lending policies and the same was
approved by the Board.   It was indicated in the paper  that
as in the past, ICICI would continue to follow financing
strategy,   aimed  at  subserving   national  objectives  in
industrial  sphere  and needs of the  economy.   It  further
stated  that ICICI's financial assistance would be  directed
towards
a) priority sectors of industry;
b) modernisation of existing industries;
c) fulfillment of socio economic objectives such as
assistance   to   projects   in   backward    areas,
encouraging    new   entrepreneurs   and   providing
assistance to such industries which show favourable
economic indicators.
The priority sectors identified for assistance are (i)
export oriented industries and supporting activities,   (ii)
power   and   transport  including   ancillaries   connected
therewith, (iii) industries related to agricultural inputs
and  outputs,   (iv)  industries  basic  to  industrial  and
infrastructure expansion (v) petrochemicals and down stream

units and (vi) mass consumption goods which need to be
available in adequate quantity for the general well being
and  containing inflation.   Likewise.  to fulfill the socio
economic objectives, it was decided to extend continued
assistance  for  (a)  backward  area  development  and   (b)
encouragement of new entrepreneurs.
4.   Prolect  COM210tion  report:    rCICI  has  taken  steps  to
undertake ex-post analysis of selected projoct financed out
of the 13th line of credit.   A sample of projects has  been
selected   and   a  questionnaire for  eliciting   necessary
information  has  been  sent  to  the  concerned  units.   A
reminder letter has also been sent to them and response to
the same is awaited.
5.    Industrial  studies:   As  suggested  by  the  Bank,  ICICI
carried out studies on Energy Utilisation in Industry' and
Electric  Equipment  Industry'.       The  former  study  was
undertaken in the areas of (i) paper and cement industry:
(ii)  caustic  soda,   soda  ash   aluminium,  ferro  alloy.
electric arc furnace and stoel industries and (iii) energy
utilisation and conservation equipment, boilers, furnaces.
electric  motors and instrumentation.   Seminars  were  also
organised to discuss the studies, detailed proceedings cc
which were published. ICICI also undertook a study -n
Automotive Products'.

Page 13 of 41
6.   larest Rates:   ICICI reviewed the interest rate structure
of  its rupee and foreign currency loans in the  context  of
increase  in cost of borrowing and inflation in  India.   In
consultlation with the Reserve Bank of India, the Central
Government and the other financial institutions,   the  rate
of interest on rupee and foreign currency loan was raised
from 11% to 11.85S from July 1. 1980 (to cover the interest
tax imposed by the Central Government) and later to 14% from
March 2, 1981 mainly to cover the increase in cost of
borrowings.
7.   ICICV s Free Limit: It would be observed from the Annexure I
that of the assisted projects, only two projects were 'A
category projects i.e. beyond the free limit'-t 6 million,
while all the other projects were within the free limit.

B Scngmic Environment
The period 1980-81 to 1984-85 during which the 13th
line of credit was utilised by ICICl, coincided with the
country's  Sixth  Five Year Plan.   During this  period  th-
economy achieved the growth target of 5.2 per cent set for
the  plan   period.   While the growth  rate  of  industrial
production   was   below  the  plan   target,   agricultural
production was broadly as anticipated and the plan target
was, by and large, achieved.
Gross National Product at constant (1980-81 - 100)
prices grew at an annual average rate of 5.2 per cent.
However, there were wide annual variations. The highest
growth rate of 7.7 per cent was achieved in 1983-84 and the
lowest of 2.6 per cent in 1982-83. the previous year.
Aarclu1tral Production
The average annual growth rate in agricultural
production was 3.5 per cent between 1980-81 and 1984-85.
However,  as   a  result  of  uneven  rainfall   conditions.
agricultural production exhibited sharp annual fluctuations.
Agricultural production which was depressed in 1979-80 due
to  severe drought recovered fully in 1980-81 and the grcwth
rate was 15.6 per cent when the weather conditions were



-41-
APPENDIX A
Page 15 of 41
normal in most part of the country.   In 1981-82 the rate of
growth  in agriculture was 5.6 per cent.   In the  following
year,   1982-83.   agricultural   production  suffered  from
unfavourable weather conditions and insufficient rainfall
with the result that agricultural production declined by 3.3
per cent.   The exceptionally good monsoon in the next year.
1983-84. took the growth rate far above the long term trend
to  13.7  per  cent.   In  1984-85  agricultural  production
increased marginally by 1.2 per cent.
Industrial Production
Industrial production averaged an annual increase of
around 7.7 per cent between 1980-81 and 1984-85.   The index
of industrial production (1980-81 - 100) rose by 9.3 per
cent in 1981-82 on top of the growth of 4.0 per cent in
1980-81. This turn around was mainly due to the substantial
improvement in the availability of power and coal and better
movement of goods traffic by railway.   Substantial recovery
in agricultural production leading to improved availability
of agricultural inputs also provided impetus to industrial
production.   The  year 1982-83 marked by a  severe  drought
affecting   agricultural  performance  cast  its  shadow  an
industrial production and the growth rate decelerated to 3.2

per cent during the year.   Thg textile strike which started
in  January 1982 also had its  adverse  impact-   Industrial
growth accelerated in the next year, 1983-84. to 6.7 per
cent; this momentum was maintained in 1984-85 when the
growth rate reached 8.6 per cent.
Prices
In  1979-80  severe  drought  resulted  in  a  fall  in
agricultural   and  industrial  production;   this  led   to
wholesale prices rising by about 20 per cent during the
year.   The upward trend in prices which began in March 1979
continued in 1980 also, though the intensity of inflationary
pressures was significantly reduced in 1980-81 and the rise
in the wholesale price index (1970-71 - 100) was contained
at 16.7 per cent in 1980-81 despite the fact that the full
impact of the doubling of the OPEC oil prices was felt
during  the  year.   Control   of inflation  was  the  major
objective of economic policy and tho impact could be seen in
1981-82 when the wholesale price index moved up only
marginally  by 2.4 per cent.   During the next  three  years
ending 1984-85. stability in prices has been maintained with
the index moving up by about 8 per cent in each of the
years.

International Traed
As regards interntional trade, in value terms.exports
have  risen  from  Rs.  67107.0 million in  1980-81  to  Rs.
117437.0 million in 1984-85, that is, by almost 15 per cent
per annum despite unfavourable international environment.
Exports grew marginally in 1980-81 by 4.6 per cent above the
1979-80 level.   However, export activity picked up in 1981-
82 with exports rising by 16.3 per cent. There was an
increase  in exports of 12.8 per cent and 11.0 per  cent  in
1982-83 and 1933-84 respectively.  In 1984-85,  the terminal
year of the sixth plan, exports increased by 20.2 per cent
to reach Rs. 117437.0 million    Although imports have grown
at a slower rate than exports, the adverse trade balance has
been-  at  about Rs.  60000.0 million in each  of  the  years
between   1980-81   and  1984-85.    However,   due   to   a
sizeable inflow of invisibles, the current account deficit
was much less at Rs.  34590.0 million in 1984-85.   Also the
country's foreign exchange reserves (including gold and
SDRs) which declined from Rs. 55440 million in 1980-81 to
Rs. 40240 million in 1981-82 has since been continuously
rising each year reaching the figt-e of Rs. 72430 million in
1984-85.

It will be observed from Table I that the entire amount
of the 13th Line of Credit was sanctioned by ICICI during
1980   and   1981.    This  was possible because  there  was
strong demand for the foreign currency loans for projects
awaiting sanctions. After adjustments for cancellation made
during the subsequent years, the net sanction from the line
aggregated to VSS 95.671 million.   it is noteworthy that as
in the case of sanctions almost the entire loan was
committed by 1981. Likewise, major part of the disbursement
was  completed by 1982.    The terminal date for  completing
the  withdrawals  was  December  31.   1985  and  the  final
disbursement was made by the Bank in March 1986.

APPENDIX A
Page 21 of a1
It would be observed from the Table that of the
121 projects assisted under the 13th line of credit, 17
were new projects by new companies, 18 were new projects
by existing companies by way of diversification; 28
projects  were  for  expansion,  28 projects   were   for
modernisation  and 30 projects were for  replacement  and
balancing equipment, including equipment for research and
development,  quality  control  etc.    In terms  of  the
quantum of foreign currency assistance provided,  the new
projects   by  new  companies  accounted  for  14.0%   of
assistance,   new  projects by way of diversification for
21.4%  and  those  under  expansion,   modernisation  and
balancing   equipment   for  29.6%.   22.3%   and   12.7%
respectively.
In addition to foreign currency loan assistance.
ICICI also provided rupee assistance to some of the
121 projects covered under the 13th line in the form of
loan and underwriting and/or direct subscription of
shares/debentures to meet a part of the rupee requirement
of the cost of project. Such assistance was of the order
of  Rs.  160.482  million  comprising   of   Rs.  107.786
million      ^ee    loans,      Rs.      36.696     million

uncerwriting/direct subscription of shares and Rs. 16.0ou
million underwriting/subscription of debentures.
It would be seen that out of the rupee loans
assistance   extended   to  projects  under  13th   line.
assistance  to new projects promoted  by  new   companies
was 38.5% of the total rupee assistance whereas for
diversification, it was about 27.5% and for expansion,
maodernisation  etc.  the assistance was  34.0%.          The
rupee  loan  assistance from ICICI to the  projects   was
rather small as compared to the foreign currency loans.
it may be noted that out of the 18 new projects by
new companies assisted out of this line of credit, 2
projects were set up by new entrepreneurs who had no
previous experience of setting up an industrial unit.
The  foreign  currency assistance sanctioned to  these  2
projects amounted to Rs. 15.089 million which formed 7.2%
of assistance sanctioned to new projects.

The average size of assistance extended per

the table that 26 projects (21.5% of total projects)
received assistance of less than S 0.250 million and 30
projects (24.2w) received assistance between S 0.25'
million and S 0.500 million. 30 projects (24.8%) were
provided  assistance of more than S 1.000 million.   It
would thus be seen that large number of projects were

Out of 121 projects assisted under the 13th line of
credit data regarding actual time taken for completion of
projects  are  available in respect of 113  projects.   An
analysis of time taken by these projects indicated that 53

were completed with a delay of upto 6 months, 21 projects
were completed with a delay of 6 to 12 months and 18
projects were completed with delay of over 12 months.

Delays in the project implementation have been
normally upto 12 months; but in some cases inordinate
delays have taken place due to a combination if factors
major among them being time taken in raising necessary
finances including promoters' contribution, long delivery
schedules,    modifications   in   the   scheme   at    the
implementation stage, labour problems power shortages and

Out  of  113 projects,  46 units had  overrun  in
their project costs, 14 units had savings while in the case
of 53 units actual cost was equal to the estimated cost.
Total actual cost of 113 projects amounted to Rs. 8272.84
million against the estimated cost of Rs. 6952.91 million
showisng  an overrun of 18.98%.   A comparison of estimated
and actual cost of 46 projects which had overrun indicates
that the overrun was 29.73% with estimated cost of 4597.0O
million and actual cost of 5963.62 million.  The perctr.ta;-.

of overrun in respect of new and diversification Projects
was 22.53% and 36.99% respectively whereas in case of
expansion and modernisation projects the percentage of
overrun was 4.59% and 2.94% respectively.
Intensity of cost overruns has been marked in the
case of new and diversification projects. This is because
comprehensive   detailing   in  such  cases  is   generally
incomplete at the time of appraisal and hence project cost
was based on available estimates. Further, due to long
implementation period, these projects were subjected to
inflationary factors.
An analysis of cost overruns reveals that it
was   more   pronounced  under  cerain  heads  like   civil
construction, plant and machinery and preliminary and pre
operative expenses.   Overrun has been mainly due to rise in
prices   of   cement  and  steel.      Absence  of   detailed
engineering in the initial stage also added to the quantum
of overrun as larger built up areas were to be provided in
certains cases.   Cost of plant and  machinery has increased
mainly due to inflationary factors as also on account of
increase  in excise and customs duties.   Large increase  in
preliminary and preoperative expenses has been on account of
delays in implementation.

V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMANE
Annex III gives data on the financial performance in
respect  of  53  companies.    It  may  be  added  in   this
connection, that several companies have not maintained
separate data on the financial performance of projects and
hence  the same are not available.   As a result in some  of
these cases the data have been given for the company as a
whole rather than for the specific project.
It may be observed from the Annexure that of the 53
companies, actual sales in the normal year were more in 29
companies than the estimated sales while they were less in
24 companies as compared to their estimated sale.   Likewise
of  the -53  companies,   31  companies  earned  profits  as
estimated   while  22  companies  suffered  ldsses  in   the
projected  normal year
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

VII. CURREN STATUS OF PROJECTS:
Of the 121 projects assisted under the 13th line, 14
project sub-loans have been repaid fully.   Of the balance
107 projects 18 projects were in arrears as on December
31,   1987  and  in  respect  43  projects  (including  16
companies which are presently in arrears) revision in
repayment schedule was granted in view of the difficulties
faced  by  them.   A statement giving the details  of  the
current status of arrears against the foreign currency
loan under the 13th line of credit is enclosed (Annexure
V).
The companies in arrears were Coimbatore Pioneer
Machine, ACC-Babcock, Asian Bearings, Shriram Bearings,

Champion  Industries.   A  brief account of  the  problems
faced by these companies and the present status is given
in the paragraphs that follow :
Operations of Coimbatore Pioneer Machine, engaged in
the manufacturing of grey and spheroidal iron casting were
affected  due to high rejection rate and power  cuts.   As
the unit suffered heavy losses, ICICI proposes to recall
the  loan.   ACC-Babcock,  engaged in the  manufacture  of
boilers for power plants, suffered set-back in operations
because of lack of adequate orders for boilers as the
orders are diverted to Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd.
(BHEL). a  Government company.   The  strained  liquidity
position of the State Electricity Boards (SEB), who are
the prime clients of the company has caused cJterioratiolv
in  the liquidity position of  the  company.    Industrial
Development Bank of India (IDBI), the lead institution.
has finalised rehabilitation scheme for the revival of the
operations of the company. The scheme involves additional
finance from institutions'and Government and sharing of
orders  with BHEL.   Asian Bearings,  which has set  up  a
plant for the manufacture of different tyDes of bearings.
has been operating at a lower capacity.   A rehabilitation
package is under consideration by the lead institution.

Shriram Bearings, another unit engaged in the production
of bearings, suffered due to technical problems which
resulted   in   lower   quality   of   its   products;   a
rehabilitation-cum-modernisation   scheme  is  now   under
implementation   which   is  expected   to   improve   its
operations.
Hukumchand Mills, Ahmedabad Mfg. & Calico and Swan
Hills  are old textile mills.   They have suffered a  set-
back in operation mainly because of industrial recession,
increase   in   cost  of  production  and   low   capacity
utilisation   in   the  textile   industry   in   general.
Institutions have earlier formulated rehabilitation scheme
for  Ahmedabad  Mfg.  &  Calico  and  the  same  is  under
implementation.   In  case  of Hukumchand Mills  and  Swan
Mills, a rehabilitation scheme is under preparation by the
lead institutions.
Operations of Volrho, a company set up for the
manufacture of pesticides, were not satisfactory because
of market constraints.   The company is, however,  taking
steps  to diversify its product range.   Kanoria Wisconsin
Centrifugal, engaged in the manufacture of alloy srtee
casting, faced marketing difficulties, working c3pitA.
power  and management problems.   As the viability of  t

project has been impaired, ICICI proposes to exercise the
security.
X.J. Clad, a company set up for the manufacture of
clad metal strips, faced, apart from the problem of
overrun in the project, serious market problems because
this is the first unit producing this product in the
country. Company, proposes to diversify its product range
with institutional assistance. PAMWI Specialities, set up
to manufacture foundrinier wired cloth and speciality
paper, got a set back in operations since begining because
of  lower  quality of output and  competitive  market.   A
rehabilitation scheme has now been finalised by the
lead institution.
Angus Co., Victoria Jute, Delta Jute & Titaghur
Jute, all engaged in the production of jute goods, are
suffering due to industrial recession.   ICICI proposes to
recall the loans from Angus Co., Victoria Jute, and
Titaghur Jute as the units have suffered heavy losses.
Nirlon   Synthetics   producing   nylon,   polyester   and
industrial belts suffered a set back in operations in the
last two years becAuse of difficult market and cheaper
imports.   Institutions  have recently approved a  revival
scheme for the company.

Southern Pesticides, a new company set up for the
manufacture of benzene hexachloridq, faced both time and
cost overrun, its implementation was delayed because of
technical   problems   and  delay  in  obtaining   certain
government clearances.       Champion  Industries engaged in
the   manufacture  of  dry  cells  suffered   because   of
competitive  market and management problems.   Because  of
the heavy losses suffered and the dim prospects of revival
of the unit a settlement has been reached with the
management of the company.
As indicated earlier, ICICI has granted revision
in repayment schedule in respect of 43 cases. Of these 16
companies   defaulted  even after reschedulement and  were
in arrears as on December 31, 1987: comments with regard
to these companies have been given in earlier paragraphs.
A brief account of remaining 27 cases is given below
Chowgulo & Company, engaged in iron ore mining has
been facing problem due to recession in general all over
the  world.   Alkyl  Amines which  manufactures  aliphatic
amines  faced  problems  due  to  demand  corstraint,   it
undertook a balancing scheme to produce tri-ethylamine for
which there is better demAnd.   Its operations have  shown
improvements.      FAG Precision Bearing, a company engaged

in the manufacture of various types of bearings, faced
cost  overrun in its expansion-cum-nodernisation  project.
Its operations were affected adversely in the last two
years  because  of high input cost.   Operations  of  P.G.
Foils were unsatisfactory because of low quality of its
product  .  It has since introduced new product range and
this led to improvement in its operations.
Secals Ltd., which has an alloy iron and steel
casting plant, faced problem of demand recession on one
hand  and high input cost on other.   Its operations  have
since  improved.   Karnataka Aluminium suffered because of
non availability of raw material. With the improvement in
the supply position, it has shown improvements in recent
past.
Simplex  Mills  faced       problem  of   industrial
recession   in  textile  industry;   its  operations   are
presently satisfactory. Plant of Mipco Seamless Rings
faced technical problems initially and later problem of
supplies of raw material and adequate power.   Siltronics,
engaged  in  the  production  of  silicon  wafers,   faced
competition from cheaper imports.    It.  however, expects
to fare well because of boost to electronic indutry.

had also to face competition from imported components in
the  limited  total  market.   Its operations  have  shown
improvements  in the recent past.   Revision in  repayment
schedule was granted to Bombay Dyeing as its project for
the  manufacture of Dimethyl Terephthalate (DMT)  faced  a
time and cost overrun basically because of technical
problems.   It,  however,  has  overcome all the technical
problems and the plant is working with a high capacity
utilisation.   The  project  of Nicco Orissa,  set  up  to
produce XLPE/PVC cables. faced problem because of delay in
commercial production and depressed market.   It has since
improved in its operations.   Kunal Engineering.  Hafatlal
Engg.. and Suessen Textile Bearings, engaged in the
manufacture of textile machinery, have been adversely
affected because of industrial recession in the textile
industry.
Ghatgo   Patill   engaged  in  grey  iron   casting,
industrial clutches and brake assembly, faced a set-back
in  operations  because  of  recessionary  conditions   in
automobile  industry.    Recently,  its   operations  have
improved.    Madhya  Bharat  United Polypropylene,  a  new

It might be mentioned that whenever an assisted
unit faced problems of longer duration, ICICI closely
examines the reason underlying the same and taken steps to
extricate  the  project  from  difficulties.   The  relief
extended to the unit in such cases depend on the gravity
of  the problems faced and the needs of the project.   The
relief extended can be deferment of interest, revision in
repayment schedule, reduction in rate of interest, waiver
of commitment charge, conversion of interest into loan or
equity. At times additional assistance is extended to the
unit for revival. While extending reliefs to the company,
ICICI also makes all efforts to improve the operations of
the company by way of change in management or merger with
healthy units.   If despite all efforts the viable of  the
unit is not restored, ICICI does resort to exercise its
security to safeguard its interest.
Vill . CONCLUSTON
Though there have been both time and cost overruns
in   respect  of  some   of  the  projects,   the  overall
performance of the projects financed under the 13th loan
can be said to be fairly satisfactory.   The loan from th-
Bank  has facilitated  new capacity creation in  different

priority sectors of the industry, develop backward areas
by setting up new units, modernise the existing units and
has thus helped acceleration of the industrial development
of the country.   It has simultaneously helped achieve the
socio-economic objective in line with the government
guidelines  in  that  behalf.   On  the  whole,  the  Bank
assistance has helped ICICI to fulfill its role as a
development bank and act as a catalytic agent in promotion
of industrial development of the country.
