                         volunteers, 256 of which also received specific pedagogical training on EIB techniques; and (ii) increased support for PROHECO schools through: (a) the training of 3,705
                         PROHECO teachers in multigrade teaching techniques, including 245 EIB PROHECO teachers who were given additional training in EIB pedagogical techniques; and (b) 2,748
                         PROHECO schools that were provided with educational materials, included textbooks and teacher guides, in the Natural and Social Sciences. All this educational package has

                         already been adapted to the Basic National Curriculum that was introduced by the Ministry of Education (Secretaría de Educación or SEDUC) in 2005.

                         •        Component 2: (i) increased support for PROHECO promoters and coordinators, through the training of 469 PROHECO promoters and coordinators in financial management
                         and book-keeping capabilities at the level of the Community-based Educational Association (Asociación Educativa Comunitaria or AECO); (ii) increased support for PROHECO
                         teachers, through the organization of 4 regional workshops to disseminate information related to the pension benefits and rights; and (iii) increased support for rural school networks,
                         through technical assistance that helped schools in rural networks prepare already 70 School Network Educational Projects (Proyectos Educativos de Red, or PERs).

                         •        Component 3: (i) significant support, in terms of capacity building activities and core equipment, to strengthening the Monitoring and Evaluation web-based tool of SEDUC
                         (Information and Technology, Statistics, Strategic Planning, Payroll Management); (ii) support for the participation of Honduras in standardized international student assessments, like
                         the 2011 TIMSS (Trends in Mathematics and Science Study) and PIRLS (Program for International Reading Literacy) studies and the upcoming 2013 TERCE (Tercer Estudio
                         Regional Comparativo y Explicativo or Third Regional Comparative and Explicatory Study); (iii) support SEDUC’s efforts (technical studies and training) to improve the systems for
                         management of human resources; and (iv) increased support for the deployment of Transparency School Boards (Murales de Transparencia or TSBs) in 12 Departments of the
                         country, with TSBs already installed in 4,854 schools.

                         The Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) Grant No. TF094670 (“Piloting New Forms of Community-administered Education for Socially Vulnerable Communities Project?)
                         associated with the Education Project (US$1,714,300), has also made significant progress. The goal of the JSDF Grant is to pilot the expansion of the community-based education
                         model (PROHECO) to lower secondary education and to pilot learning centers in selected communities (e.g. creating/strengthening 7-9 grade classes within PROHECO schools,
                         creating/strengthening some learning vocational/technical centers), especially for vulnerable and at-risk youth population. As of today, SEDUC completed 4 of the 5 Transfer
                         Agreements with the AECOs for the school’s strengthening of 3 schools and 2 vocational centers in Comayagua and Roatán. It also resolved the pending legal issue (property of the
                         land) needed to be able to do civil works in one of the schools in Roatán (Elfrida Brooks).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured on June 29, 2012. The main reasons behind the restructuring were:

                         •         a waiver of the withdrawal condition affecting Component 2 (Community Participation in School Management for Better Performance) insofar as the spirit behind the
                         withdrawal condition - the reinstatement of pension benefits to teachers from the Honduran Program for Community-based Education (Programa Hondureño de Educación
                         Comunitaria or PROHECO) - has been met;
                         •         a revision of all the remaining dated legal covenants (Other Undertakings) in light of the set of administrative acts undertaken by the Government to regularize the social
                         security situation of PROHECO teachers;
                         •         a revision to Project activities to adjust them to: i) a shortened implementation period due to the 2009 “pause? and delay in satisfying the Project’s withdrawal conditions; ii)
                         funding from other sources outside of the Project, and iii) the Government’s strategy;
                         •         a revision to the indicators in the Results Framework and Monitoring to reflect the changes in Project activities;
                         •         a revision in Project costs consistent with the revised Project activities and scope; and

                         •         a reallocation of Credit proceeds across all 5 categories that reflect the changes in Project activities and costs.
