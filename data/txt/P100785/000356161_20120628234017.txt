    WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA AIR TRANSPORT SAFETY AND SECURITY
                  PROJECT - APL PHASE 2 (P100785)
                      IDA CREDIT 4364-AFRICA



1.      The closing date for the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety and
Security Project (WCAATSSP), second-phase of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL2),
related to the Federal Republic of Nigeria (P100785, IDA Credit 4364-AFRICA) will be
extended from June 30, 2012 until May 31, 2013.

2.     This project was approved on October 2, 2007 for an amount of SDR30.9 million
(US$46.65 million equivalent) and became effective on June 24, 2008. After the
declaration of mis-procurement for the acquisition of two ILS/VOR/DME systems in
November 29, 2010, an amount of SDR1.53 million (US$2.35 million equivalent) was
cancelled and deducted from the initial Credit amount. Therefore, the updated Credit
amount is SDR29.37 million (US$44.3 million equivalent).

3.      The project development objective (PDO) of the WCAATSSP as originally stated
and approved in 2008 is “to support the Recipient in improving compliance of its civil
aviation authority and principal international airports with International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards?. The project is benefiting five
parastatal agencies involved in civil aviation, namely: NAMA1, NCAT2, NCAA3, FAAN4,
and NIMET5.

4.      The following key realizations have been achieved: (i) parastatal agencies
technical staff trainings; (ii) delivery and payment of 10 fire tenders vehicles for FAAN
and NCAT; (iii) and, more significantly, Nigeria’s achievement of United States Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) and International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA)
Category 1 rating since August 2010, meaning that Nigeria’s Civil Aviation Authority is
capable of enforcing international air safety standards set by the ICAO for aircraft
operations and maintenance, and that the country has the laws and regulations necessary
to oversee air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards.
Correspondingly, Nigeria’s registered carriers, such as Arik Air can now offer direct
flights from/to the USA for the first time in nearly 30 years. The following activities are
in-progress: refurbishing of flight simulator for NCAT; re-certification of the Nigerian
aviation industry; design of information technology system at NCAA and FAAN.
Therefore, the project objectives continue to be relevant and achievable.

5.      Progress towards achievement of the PDO for APL2 is rated “Satisfactory?
because: (i) the performance indicators of the project continued to remain at or are above
target values, (ii) the disbursement rate since the project mid-term review in June 2010
increased from 38 percent to 67 percent as of June 6, 2012, which indicates a satisfactory
implementation of the procurement plan and agreed activities, and (iii) achievements in
safety oversight has been recognized through the US FAA IASA Category 1 rating, as
stated in the Implementation Status Report dated March 2011.

6.      Implementation arrangements and capacity were reviewed during the last
supervision mission from June 2 to 9, 2012 and were found to be satisfactory, as the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and each Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established
within each parastatal agency, after difficult start-up, are now familiar with Bank
financed projects management and fewer delays have been experienced in the
implementation of the project’s planned activities.

7.       The proposed extension is necessary to allow: (i) the continuation of previously
scheduled activities that are under procurement process and would consolidate safety and
security concerns (such as the acquisition and installation of closed-circuit television for
Abuja and Lagos international airport) and the completion of the acquisition and
installation of equipment that have been previously defined after design studies financed
by the project for some parastatal agencies; and (ii) the possible review of the priority
activities if the Government agrees to do so. Otherwise, the project will continue to
finance the previously agreed activities presented in the revised procurement plan
submitted by the PCU during the recent supervision mission (from June 2 to 9, 2012),
and which was found to be satisfactory if the previously scheduled activities are kept.

8.     There are no outstanding audits or financial management issues.

9.     This will be the second extension of the second phase of the project for Nigeria,
as the project has already been extended for a total of 12 months. With the proposed
eleven month extension, the cumulative total length of extension is 23 months.
