EKPRESA DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA DE BOGOTA
BOGOTA DISTRIBUTION II PROJECT
Project Summary
Borrower:      Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB)
Guarantor:     Republic of Colombia
Amount:        US$171 million equivalent
Terms:         Repayment in 17 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at
the Bank's standard variable rate.
Project        Sectoral Ohjective: The Bank's principal objective in the Colombian
power sector is to achieve greater efficiency in the operation of the
country's electric utilities. The substantial energy losses prevalent
throughout the sector constitute one of the major deficiencies in the
current operations of these utilities (EEEB's energy losses have
reached almost 23% of gross generation). Improved
subtransmission/distribution system and theft prevention measures
represent an effective method for reducing such losses. Since EUEB is
one of the largest power utilities in Colombia, improved efficiency in
EEEB's distribution system would have a major impact on total losses
experienced by the sector.
Project: The principal objectives of the project are to achieve
greater etficiency in EEEB's operations and to extend electric service
to a larger segment of Bogota's population. The project consists
mainly of the 1985-90 time-slice of EEEB's distribution and
subtransmission program, including the expansion and improvement of
Bogota's network, studies to improve EEEB's distributlon and
operational planning, a training program for EEEB's staff and a
program for reducing the system's losses. Around 240,000 new
customers will be connected to the power service, 1,100 MVA in
subtransmission substations will be built, and about 10 km of 230 kV
and 75 km of 115 kV lines will be constructed, together with 350 MVA
in distribution substations and 1,000 MVA of distribution transformer
capacity and more than 1,400 km of new primary and secondary
distribution circuits.
Risks:         No technical risks are anticipated although timely completion of the
project will depend upon EEEB's project management ability.
Establishment of a project coordination unit and acceleration of the
impleuentation of a training program for the improvement of EEEB's
organization and management are expected to reduce this risk.

BOGOTA DISTRIBUTION II PROJECT
1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources and Policies
1.01      Colombia is rich in energy resources, particularly in
hydroelectricity and coal. Its reserves of oil and natural gas are modest by
international standards, yet significant at the national level. The
country's recoverable coal reserves are estimated at 16 billion tons (441.6
EJ) and its hydropower potential, at 100 GW, is capable of yielding about 440
TWh (4.62 EJ) per year (231 EJ over 50 years). Compared to this, gas
reserves are only 4.07 trillion cubic feet (5.1 EJ) and oil reserves are 734
million barrels (4.3 EJ). As regards the latter, on the basis of recent
success encountered by Occidental Petroleum in its oil exploration in the
Llanos area, preliminary estimates now suggest that Colombia's oil production
will exceed its internal consumption in the near future. Further detail on
the size and past development of Colombia's energy reserves is contained in
Annex 1.1.
Estimated Recoverable Reserves and Production (1983)
Reserves             Production      Reserves/Prod
EJ    Mtoe    (X)    GJ      Mtoe   (X)       (years)

Natural Gas           5.1     121     0.8   167      4.0   22.5         30.3

682.0  16,164   100.0   745    17.8  100.0
As the table above shows there is an imbalance between reserves and
production for different sources of energy.  For example, the huge reserves
of hydroelectricity and coal account for only 21.4% and 12.9% respectively of
annual production while the rather modest gas and oil reserves contribute
22.5% and 43.2% respectively to annual production. Current consumption of
commercial energy relies primarily upon oil products (41%) and less on gas
(17%), coal (15Z) and electricity (27%). The table below shows.the
distribution of this consumption by sector.

1.02      Colombia traditionally enjoyed a posltive trade balance in energy
because of its relatively rich energy endowment and modest yearly per capita
consumption which, at about 0.7 ton of oil equivalent, is below average for
middle-income developing countries. However, in 1976 the country became a
net importer of energy, and by 1981 the (net) cost of oil imports reached
almost US$400 million. This came about because of a decline in total
domestic energy productlon, resulting from a 7% annual fall in oil output
between 1970 and 1979. As this situation was threatening to compromise
balance of payments prospects, the Government moved in the late 1970s to
redress the negative energy trade balance through: (i) pricing measures
designed to increase the overall cost of energy to consumers, change relative
prices to encourage consumers to move away from oil, and provide incentlves
to producers; and (ii) direct public sector investments in the energy field,
particularly for petroleum exploration and secondary petroleum production,
hydroelectricity and coal. As a result, since 1980, the previous trend has
been reversed: petroleum production has Increased, GDP has grown faster than
aggregate energy consumption, and petroleum's share of total primary energy
consumption has fallen while that of hydroelectricity, coal and natural gas
has increased.
1.03      As shown in Annex 1.2, primary energy output has increased about 3%
per year since 1978, while final energy consumption rose by about 3.8Z per
year.
1.04      In Colombia, electricity, petroleum and natural gas prices are set
by the Government; coal prices are market-set. The price levels for
petroleum products are close to international prices, while natural gas is
sold at low prices, as a financial incentive to consumption. The development
of an integrated energy investment program and adequate incentives for each
subsector will depend on the availability of reliable information regarding
the investment requirements of dlfferent energy sources, particularly coal.
To this end, the Government has undertaken a major effort to improve sector
knowledge through a National Energy Study (ENE). Its first stage was carried
out during 1979-82 by the National Planning Department (DNP) with the help of
local consultants and technical assistance from the Federal Republic of
Germany. This study provides significant information needed for energy
planning, including a preliminary evaluation of energy demand growth and
investments that could best serve such growth.



1.05      A second stage of the ENE, consisting of several specialized
studies, is almost complete 1/. This current effort has elicited
considerable foreign technicial assistance from officlal sources. The Federal
Republic of Germany is providing assistance on modeling and data gathering,
France on industrial energy savings, Italy on energy studies for isolated
regions, the Organization of American States (OAS) cn energy use in
transportation and the European Economic Community on industrLal uses of
energy. Several energy sector agencies provide counterpart staff and DNP
coordinates the external assistance. The third phase of the study, concerned
with energy strategy formulation, is about to start. Work in this phase will
be focussed on identification and comparison of the costs and benefits of
developing each of the country's energy resources. Once such work has been
completed, selection among alternative energy sources will be possible and a
long-term strategy for development of Colombia's energy resources can be
formulated. Recently, DNP has asked that the Bank assist In its revLew of
these studies and help in the formulation of a strategy for the energy
sector. These tasks will be accorded high priority 'n the context of the
Bank's country and economic sector wcrk for Colombia.
Sector Financing
1.06      Over the past five years, Colombia has been successful in
mobilizing external resources to finance energy development. This has been
achieved through direct foreign investment (in oil and gas first and lately
in coal) and external loans to the energy agencies, includlig power
companies. However, the current conditions in the LaternatLonal lending
markets are making external financing more difficult to obtain. Local
financing requLrements are covered primarily by internally generated
resources and Government contributions, with the incipient local capital
market traditionally providing only a marginal share of financing.
1.07      The establishment in 1982 of a financial institution for the power
sector (Financiera Electrica Nacional-FEN) designed to mobilize domestic as
well as foreign funds for the sector's utilities has increased the
contribution of the domestic capital market to the sector's financing and
enabled the sector to maintain a presence in the increasingly cautious
international capital markets. Despite its recent creation, FEN has become
one of the largest financial institutions in the country. It has already
recorded notable success in the domestic market and served as the borrowing
agency for a major power development finance loan from the Bank (2401-CO) and
various cofinanciers. By going to capital markets on behalf of the
consolidated power sector, FEN has mobilized resources which the indlvldual
utilities would not otherwise have been able to access and this institution
promises to make a substantial contribution to the alleviation of the
financial constraints currently confronting the sector. As regards more
traditional sources of local cost financing, in order to increase internal
resource mobilization by the main energy sector agencies, prices charged to
consumers of petroleum products and electricity have been increased
significantly in real terms. Furthermore, in 1980, the Government created
the National Coal Fund (FNC) which receives revenue from a tax on coal
production valued at the mine-head. This revenue is currently allocated to
finance coal exploration (80%) and to assist small and medium-scale coal
mining operations (20%).

fertilizer production and coal exploration studies to assess the
economic potential of several promising areas in the Atlantic and
Central Regions.

Institutional Arrangem nts in the Power Sector
1.08      Sector Organization.  At present, public electricity servlces are
provided by:
(a) municipally-owned companies, of which the largest are EEEB (in
Bogota), EPM (in Kedellin) and EMCALI (in Call);
(b)  national enterprises whose principal purpose is the distr:bution
of power to particular regions (ICEL, CVC and CORELCA); and
(c) a generating and transmission company (ISA).
These are described ln Annex 1.3 and the electric power systems are shown in
Map IBRD-17690R.
1.09      Through the 1950s, a large number of power companies were set up by
local governmental authorities and, lacklng interconnection with each other,
were operated independently. Less than 20 years ago, the country's total
electricity capaclty stood at a mere 1,681 MW (equivalent to about 88 watts
per inhabltant) and reached only about 35% of the population. Although large
hydropower sites held the potential of Lncreasing substantially the supply of
electricity at lower cost than otherwlse possible, they were too blg to be
tapped by any one company. With encouragement from the Bank, the Government
persuaded the regional power companies to break with tradltion and pool their
resources in a shared effort to plan and to develop the country's large
hydroelectric potential. To accomplish this, Interconexion Electrica S.A.
(ISA) was created as an Independent, national generation and interconnection
company, whose shareholders now include all the largest municipal power
utilities and the Government-owned power companies. By 1984, Colombia's
instaLled capacity had cliabed to 5,049 KW - more than triple the pre-ISA
level - and reached 54X of the population. The successful execution of a
series of major power generation projects had produced an experienced and
highly-regarded local engineering/construction industry and the planning
methodologies employed iD the sector had achieved an enviable level of
sophistication. In addition to its planning and plant construction
functions, ISA operates the interconnected power system. Though adequately
staffed and technically capable, ISA lacks a homogeneous decision-making
process. Its shareholders (EEEB, EPM, CORELCA, ICEL and CVC) are inclined to
allow their regional and sometimes conflicting interests to take precedence
over national goals. Furthermore, the financlal constraints that most of the
companles are facing have caused them to reduce their contrlbutions to ISA.
The resulting arrears had reached about US$170 million equivalent by
end-1984. In an effort to advance national interests in ISA, the Government
has decided to strengthen its representation on ISA's Board. In addition,
the Government intends to penalize the companies that have debts to ISA, by
impeding their access to FEN loans.
1.10      Several other actions have been taken by the Government to improve
the sector's institutional structure and hence its prospects for efficient
growth. It established the National Tariff Board (JNT) in DNP to approve
requests from the power companies for tariff increases; and it has fostered
the consolidation of numerous small utilities, particularly in the North
Atlantic Region. The Government has also recognized the constraint on sound



- 5 -
sector development and finance represented by the current organization of
ICEL - a holding company which groups together twelve largely rural-based
utilities (electrificadoras) - and It has explicitly confirmed the need to
restructure the ICEL group.
1.11      As the discussion above suggests, the current sector organization
does not provide for effective operations. The sector lacks a central
authority to enforce planning and tariff decislons, based on a national
plan. The decision-making process is tortuous and slow, and dependent on
negotiations between the central government, the utilities and the local
governments. The current resource constraints have highlighted the need for
change, but the importance of the power sector in the country's economy, its
substantial share ln Colombia's foreign indebtedness (25X of the public
foreLgn debt) and the magnitude of its investment program clearly require
that any improvements in the sector's institutional organization should only
be adopted in the context of a thorough review of overall sectoral policy.
The Government recognizes this and has requested that the Bank assist in
carrying out such a review. To this end, the Bank has been supporting
efforts by both che Government and ISA to develop and monitor sector-wide
financial projections, more flexible investment plans and other data.
Acknowledging the long-standing and deeply entrenched tradition of reglonal
autonomy that underlies the sector's existing organizational structure, the
Bank and the Government have agreed to approach the institutional problems
through a workshop designed to marshall the skills and resources of those
familiar with the sector to consider the objectives of the power sector and
strategies that might achieve them.
1.12      Planning and Coordination.  The Ministry of Mines and Energy is
charged with formulating national policy for the generation, transmission and
distrLbution of electricity, including coordination and supervision of power
sector planning. It shares with the National Social and Economic Policy
Council (CON?ES), DNP and ISA the responsibility for defining investment
priorities. ISA defines a generation and transmission expansLon program for
the interconnected system; after approval by the Ministry, DNP and CONPES,
this becomes the National Power Expansion Program. The Program is revlewed
annually by ISA and revisions, if necessary, are proposed. On the basis of
requests from the companies, JNT approves rate increases. Although the
Government cannot enforce its policies directly on the municipally controlled
power companies, ISA is intended to provide a mechanism for reaching
agreement on major issues affecting the sector. Sector planning and
coordination have improved markedly since ISA's creation and Bank lending has
strongly supported this evolution; although, as was mentioned In paras. 1.10
and 1.11, some further improvements in the sector's institutional
arrangements will have to be implemented before the planning, priclng and
coordination system can function satisfactorily.
1.13      Least-Cost Power Development Program.  Colombia's economic gr_th
was affected by the world-wide economic recession from 1981-83.  Taking
account of the consequent slowing of electricity demand growth, on May 16,
1983, CONPES approved a revised National Power Expansion Program for plants
entering into service during 1987-96. In October 1984, ISA presented the
latest revised Program with a two year deferment on all major future
projects. The plan is based upon a gradual and phased resumption during
1985-2000 of the long-term average annual economic growth rate of about 5%



- 6 -
achieved from 1965-80; estimated fuel prices; and a projection of 6.5Z growth
in average gross annual electricity consumption during the 15-year period
from 1985-2000. To ensure that significant variations in demand are suitably
taken into account, ISA together with the Government and the Bank (as
provided under Loan 2401-CO), will continue to review and update the
Program. The Bank is currently reviewing with DNP and ISA the financial
implications of this revised investment Program.
1.14      In support of ISA's efforts to strengthen its planning methodology,
a UNDP-financed study, for which the Bank acted as the executing agency, was
completed by end-1984. The study was devoted to the refinement of ISA's
existing planning models. Another UNDP and Bank-financed study providing
assistance in construction management is now underway and it is anticipated
that its benefits will extend, through ISA, to its shareholders as well.
Power Market and Supply
1.15     Electric power has become the fastest-growing form of energy, use in
Colombia.  Its share of total energy consumption has risen from 6.5Z in 1970
to 27% in 1983. Generation increased by an average of about 10% annually
during 1970-1980, although it has slowed over the last years to 5.8Z per
annum in 1980-83 (details of past and projected growth in both supply and
demand for electric power are contained in Annex 1.4).
Effective installed capacity at the end of that year was 5,049 KW, including
self-producers, with public entities accounting for 95Z of the total
installed capacity and generation. Peak demand was about 4,530 KW, and total
electrical energy generation in 1983 amouuted to 22.7 TWh. Hydroelectric
plants accounted for about 65% of the total electricity generated.
1.16     About 54Z of Colombia's 27.5 million population has electric power,
compared to 26% in 1950 and 45% in 1970. The urban population, comprising
about 65% of the population, has greater access. In 1976, for example, 90%
of households in large cities (population of 50,000 or more) had electrical
service while in rural towns (popullation between 500 and 2,500) the
corresponding figure was 36%; in other rural areas, 16%. Various prograus
including the Bank-financed First and Second Integrated Rural Development
Projects and the Village Electrification Project as well as programs financed
by IIUB, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Colombia Coffee Growers
Association, are aimed at increasing rural coverage. In 1983 there were
about 3.3 million electricity subscribers of which 89.9% were residential and
7.7% comercial. Residential consumption accounted for 48.6% of 1983
electricity sales (which totalled 17.4 TWh) and industrial consumption
accounted for 28.2%. EEEB generated 172 of the total electricity supply, EPM
22%, CORELCA 20%, CVC and ICEL 20Z, ISA 19%, and others the remaining 2%.
1.17     During 1978-1983, gross production of electricity increased at an
annual average rate of about 7.3% compared with a GNP growth rate of 4.3%.
However, sales increased at an annual average rate of only about 6.0% because
energy losses increased from 18.4% in 1978 to 22.6% in 1983. Approximately
half of these losses are technical (network) losses in the distribution
system, while the remainder are thefts. A portion of the energy thefts can
be traced to large consumers but theft by sqtatters tapping into lines is
also presumed to be substantial in some areas. In 1984, a joint DNP/ISA
comittee was established to study the issue of energy losses and to



-7-
recommend solutions for the problem.  In addition, the proposed project is
designed to assist EEEB in reducing both technical losses and theft (para.
4.04 (f)).
Recent Developments
1.18      By the early 1980's Colombia 1had already embarked upon an extensive
investment program for the power sector - concentrated primarily on several
large-scale generation projects requiring substantial long-term financial
commitments. Since then the availability of both external and domestic
financing has been severely reduced and the stabilization of Colombia's
external and fiscal balances has become one of the most urgent issues facing
the country at this time. As a consequence of the power sector's substantial
share in both Colombia's anticipated investment requirements (28% of total
public investment) and its foreign indebtedness (over 25% of public sector
foreign debt), the sector has also been obliged to shoulder its share of the
burdens imposed by the resource constraints that confront the country.
Specifically, during the past three years, the sector has suffered from
financial problems caused mainly by insufficient availability of
financing, slower than anti:ipated demand growth and delays in rate
adjustment. Local borrowings needed by the sector have outpaced the domestic
banking system's lending capability. Varlous shareholders lacked funds to
pay fully for the electricity supplied to them by ISA and their share in the
cost of ISA's development program. As a consequence, ISA has fallen behind
in its contractual payments to suppliers and contractors and this, in turn,
has caused construction delays.  In addition to similar problems, CORELCA and
ICEL have not received their budgeted Government contributions on schedule.
Moreover, the sector has suffered because Government-related lending has been
held back and the financing of local costs with external b)rrowings
authorized only on a highly selective basis.
1.19      The developments described above, combined with the 1982 civil
disturbances reflecting consumer discontent with increased electricity
charges and the quality of service, have led the Government to review the
investment program and the financing plan for the sector. Through the
exercise of redefining the sectoral financing program, the Government has
focused increasingly on the macroeconomic and institutional implications of
the 1984-90 power investment program. In May 1983, it reviewed in detail the
justification for, and financial feasibility of, all new investments in the
aforementioned program, taking account of competing demands from other
priority sectors; and in December 1984, the Government decided to.reduce by
about one-half the previous planned capital outlays for the sector (see
para. 1.13). In the context of the Government's overall review of its
policies for the sector, both ISA and the Government will continue to monitor
the current investment program to ensure that it remains consistent with -he
evolving sectoral strategy.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
1.20      The Bank has made 29 loans since 1950 for the Colombian power
sector totalling US$1,739 million. Several OED reports have found previous
Bank lending to the sector to have been generally successful. One of these
reports 'Power Interconnection (575-CO) and Chivor Hydroelectric Projects
(681-CO)' (Report No. 2720, October 29, 1979) commented upon the Bank's



- 8 -
participation in Colombia's efforts to evolve a stronger and more efficient
power sector organization. Through the creation of ISA in conjunction with
these projects, and the steps taken to overcome financial and institutional
difficulties, progress was made toward more coordinated sector development.
Despite implementation delays and increased costs both projects were
successfully executed. In the past, the bulk of Bank lending for power was
devoted to the expansion of Colombia's generating/transmission capacity.
While Bank-financed power projects have often contained distribution
components, the initial Bogota Distribution Project (1807-CO, 1980) was the
first Bank loan to Colombia to support exclusively distribution expansion.
In continuing the efforts successfully initiated through that first
distribution project (and expanded in subsequent rural electrification
projects) the Bank will be reaffirming the importance of a smoothly
functioning distribution system for the efficient utilization of Colombia's
existing generation capacity. Broadly stated, the Bank's objectives for the
power sector are: (a) to achieve greater efficiency in the operation of
Colombia's electric utilities; (b) to improve resource mobilization for the
sector as a whole; and (c) to improve the sector's institutional
arrangements. Until recently, the Bank sought to promote development of
sector-wide strategies for the power sector by addressing these broad
sectoral issues in the context of lending operations with individual
utilities. This lending strategy has however, been evolving toward a greater
focus on sectoral lending. Reflecting this evolution, the Bank has oriented
its most recent efforts towards the establishment of a sector-wide financing
facility (FEN) and plans to extend these efforts through a future power
sector loan, to be channelled through FEN, and focused primarily on improving
the efficiency of the distribution system by reducing energy losses*

2. THE BORROWER
General Descript Lon
2.01      The proposed Borrower, Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota
(EEEB), is an autonomous company owned by the Municipality of the Special
District of Bogota. It was established by private Colombian interests and
has operated the city's electric service for the past 85 years, since 1951
under municipal ownership. It has an installed capacity of 1,288 MW, 1,151
MW of which is hydro and the balance coal-fired thermal. It served about
700,000 subscribers at the beginning of 1985.
Prior Bank Lending
2.02      The Bank has made six loans totalling US$615.6 million to EEEB:
(see Annex 1.7) 246-CO in January 1960, 313-CO in May 1962, 537-CO in June
1968, 1628-CO in November 1978, 1807-CO in March 1980 and 2008-CO in March
1982. The first two loans helped to finance 304 MW of hydro and thermal
generating plant additions, including the Sesquile Dam for the Guatavita
Reservoir, and transmissiou and distribution system extensions. The third
loan helped to finance the 150 MW El Colegio hydroelectric plant and
associated substations, construction of the 50 MW Canoas hydroelectric plant,
expansion of the transmission and distribution systems and engineering
services. The fourth loan helped to finance part of the 1978-1982 national
power expansion program including the 600 MW Mesitas hydroelectric plant.
The fifth loan for Bogota's first Distribution Project (US$87 million) was
used by EEEB to expand and improve the existing Bogota subtransmission and
distribution systems. Finally, the sixth loan of US$359 million is earmarked
for the financing of the Guavio hydroelectric plant now under construction.
Works financed by the first three loans were completed successfully although
with delays (of about one and a half years for the first two, and three years
for the third). The Project Performance Audit Report (Report No. 1654) for
Loan No. 537-CO was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 29, 1977.
The disbursements of the fourth loan (Mesitas - 1628-CO) suffered a total
delay of 2 years; the project as such was completed with a 30 month delay,
with a cost overrun of around US$150 million (55X higher than the initial
estimate). This was due to technical problems related to geological
conditions for the civil works (tunnel construction and others) and to
difficulties with civil work contractors. Loan 1807-CO is being disbursed
with some delay but no cost increase. The project is to be completed by
mid-1985, about 30 months behind the original schedule.  Finally, Loan
2008-CO (Guavio) started disbursements in 1982, well behind schedule, since
the project suffered several delays, such as effectiveness because of tariff
action and difficulties in land purchases.

Organization and Administration
2.03      EEEB is directed and administered by a seven-member Board of
Directors headed by the Mayor of Bogota. Two members are elected by the
Municipal Council, three are chosen by the Council from lists submitted by
associations representative of banks, commerce, and industry in Bogota, and
one is chosen by the President of Colombia. This composition was worked out
in connection with the Bank's initial loan to EEEB (246-CO) and has generally
proven to be satisfactory.
2.04      EEEB's management is entrusted to a General Manager (appointed by
the Board) assisted by four (4) Deputy Managers, respectively responsible for
(a) Administration and Supplies; (b) Financial; (c) Technical; and (d)
Operations. The General Manager is also supported by 2 staff units: a
Planning Division and a Legal Division. The current organization chart
(Nov. 84) is shown in Annex 2.1. There is perhaps an excessive number of
ads. Aistrative units, roughly 270 divisions, departments and sections, and
this has led in some cases to a lack of communication and coordination among
them. But at the top level, the company has had a competent and stable
management during most of its association with the Bank. There was some
turnover of senior personnel in 1976-78, but this has diminished considerably
and at present it is very low since the company offers interesting fringe
beneflts.  Most of the senior and mid-level management staff are young (under
40) and dynamic. With the construction of one big hydroelectric plant and
one large distribution program, there is a need to adapt the current
structure, mianly the technical and operational organization. For this
purpose, the company has engaged in a study, assisted by consultants and
partly financed by the Bank (Loan 2008-CO). On the financial side, the study
on managerial, budgetary and accounting systems prepared by Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell and Co., management consultants, was completed and its
recommendations implemented gradually during 1983 and 1984. The accounting
system was the last to be introduced (May 1984). Financial administration
and planning are carried out by a small but competent staff.
Employment
2.05      EEEB had 3,397 employees at the end of 1984, of which 38 were in
the Planning and Legal Division; 905 administration personnel, 467 financial
personnel, 1,706 operational and 281 technical personnel. The company's
historical staff growth over the past years in relation to the number of
consumers served and energy sold is shown below: (Source: EEEB)

The total number of EEEB's employees is projected to grow at an average of
less than 4Z per year. Thus, the actual trend of declining ratios of number
of customers per employee and of sales per employee will stabilize and start
to improve from 1985 on (see Annex 2.2). With the Bank's support (Loans
1807-CO and 2008-CO), EEEB is maintaining a training program for its
technical staff. This program should be continued and extended to other
areas of the company, mainly for the financial and administrative personnel.
Accounting and Auditing
2.06      EEEB's accounting procedures were revised in the beginning of 1984,
following the consultant's recommendation (see para. 2.03). Accounting is
highly based on computer data processing and integrated with personnel,
supplies and the other financial computer systems used by the company.
Internal Auditing is carried out by a separate department, the "revisoria
fiscal", under a General Auditor responsible to the Board of Directors and
appointed by the Mayor of Bogota. This department has a staff of 40 and acts
both as a financial and administrative procedures auditor. The function of
external audjtors was carried out until 1979 by the 'Contraloria del Distrito
Especial de Bogota", the auditing body of the Municipal Government of Bogota
for all its public utilites. To ensure a greater degree of independence
between auditor and 'auditee", under Loan 1807-CO, EEB agreed to appoint
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. In mid-1980, the independent
auditor firm of Liborio Cuellar & Asoclados was hired to perform the
company's audits starting in fiscal year 1980. Their performance was
considered satisfactory and their contract was renewed in successive years,
the last time in November 1984 for another 2 years.
Billing and Collection
2.07      The Company is using a bi-monthly billing system for the bulk of
its consumers. Exceptions are the big industrial consumers (about 350,

representing 20% of total revenues) which are billed monthly and a group of
low consumption (under 100 kWh/month) users in rural areas, where meters are
read every 4 months and bills issued every 2 months. A computerized billiug
process is used and bills are delivered by specially hired personnel directly
to the consumer. This, according to EEEB, is both cheaper and safer than
using the local mail service. Bills must be paid within 10 days, either at
one of about 900 bank offices located all over the city of Bogota and
surroundings, or at an EEEB office, of which there are 10 at this moment.
After 10 days, there is a penalty of 2.5% and bills can only be paid at
EEEB's offices. After another 14 days, the penalty is increased to 10Z of
the total amount due and the subscriber is subject to having the service
suspended. At the end of 1984, there were about 30,000 late payers among the
total 699,000 consumers, most of them residential, and the total accounts
receivable was 25% (about 88 days billing) of total annual sales. This is
higher than the 17% target covenanted under the Guavio (2008-CO) loan. EEEB
is constantly improving their billing and collection system, seeking greater
efficiency and flexibility. A study has just begun to identify the
shortcomings of the present procedure and to incorporate new techniques in
meter-reading as well as extended collection agreements with financing
entities.
Insurance and Taxes
2.08      EEEB's main assets are insured at book value, i.e. below their
replacement cost. In a study performed by Commercial Union Risk Management,
following a covenant in Bank Loan 1628-C0, replacement costs for najor
equipments were calculated and an indication of the values to be insured was
given. Until now, the premiums paid by EEEB are low (around Col$20
million/year), but if the new values were used this cost could attain a range
of Col$100 to Col$200 million per year. Since very few accidents have
occurred in the last year, coverage has been good and there is no consedsus
in EEEB about raising dramatically the annual premium; the company has
evaluated the risk of future accidents and decided to adopt the
recommpndations of the above-mentioned study. At present, a prequalification
of insurance companies is under way, to provide better coverage for EEEB's
assets under the new values.
2.09      Under the current legislation, EEEB is exempt from any direct
taxes, including import duties for equipment to be installed in its projects.

3. EEEB'S MARKET
Background
3.01      EEEB's service area includes the District of Bogota--the capital of
Colombia- and the areas of influence of more than 55 municipalities within
the nearby departments of Cundinsuarca and Meta in the central zone. EEEB's
estimate of the service area population is 5.5 million, about 20Z of the
total population of Colombia. The service area accounted for about 24Z of
the national gross electric energy requirements in 1983.
Historic
3.02      EEER's 1978-1983 consumption and supply data are shown in Annex
3.1. They exclude the supplies from ISA's system to other utilities via the
EEE  system, for which no charge is made.  A summary of the consumer data for
1978 and 1983 is given below:

The annual demand growth over the past five years slowed to only 5.7%, while
in the previous period 1973-1978, this growth rate was a yearly 9.7%.  This
decrease oc'lrred as a consequence of the overall economic recession in the
country.  Industrial and commercial consumption were the most affected by
this recession, and their market share decreased substantially, while



- i4 -
residential consumption increased commensurately, mainly due to the
continuous growth of the city of Bogota. EEEB's energy losses increased
dramatically from 1978-83, rising from 16% to 23% of gross generation.
Although the investments in the company's distribution system initiated under
the first Bogota Distribution Project were effectve in containing some
technical losses, that project was devoted primarily to the expansion of the
system and improvements in the quality of service. Investments for
rehabilitation of deteriorated and/or overloaded circuits to maintain
technical losses at acceptable levels, were to be financed with EEEB's own
resources as part of normal maintenance. However, these investments have
been largely insufficient and the rapid growth in the size of the company's
generation and distribution capacity since then has engendered a steady
increase in energy losses- a sizable proportion of which can probably be
traced to increasing energy theft. Generally, energy losses result from a
combination of factors whose relative importance is rather difficult to
measure. These include: (i) deterioration of the existing distribution
circuits, (ii) increased circuit loads and losses because of larger consumer
demand; (iii) lack of means to detect and to control energy thefts; and (iv)
urban squatters illegally connected to the distribution system. A specific
program to deal with the problem of energy losses is included in the proposed
project.
Forecast
3.03      Projected annual growth of EEEB's energy requirements is 5.7% over
the period 1985-1990. This growth is based on ISA's forecast of an average
6.5% annual growth for the whole country and on the fact that historically,
ZEEB's energy growth has been slightly lower than the country's average.
This forecast is compatible with the projected GNP growth (see para. 1.13)
for the country.
3.04      EEEB's sales are expected to grow faster than the demand, at an
average annual rate of 8.2%, because the Project includes a specific program
to reduce energy thefts. Consumers were dLvided into five main categories,
residential, commercial, industrial, Government and bulk (sales to rural
cooperatives). Trend curves were derived to project requirements by
categories for the period 1985-1990 which were subsequently adjusted to
reflect population trends and ISA's sector forecast. A comparlson of the
1985 and 1990 forecasts with the 1983 figures (see para. 3.02), are
summarized in the following table:

3.05      Industrial and Comuercial consumers are expected to increase their
share of the market because the forecast of the GNP growth is based mainly on
a substantial growth of the GIP (Gross Industrial Product). Residential
consumption growth is estimated to follow the trend of the 1978-1983 period.
The number of consumers is expected to Increase by about 5.0% per annum,
slightly lower than the historical trend over the past five years (5.9%).
The adopted 5% takes into account the continuing expansive trend of the city
and the incorporation of the current illegal consumers, as well as the
progressive market saturation. Losses are expected to decrease from 22Z in
1985 to 13% in 1990, with the planned improvements of existilg circuits and
actions to be taken agaLnst thefts. The load factor is expected to rise from
61% to 62% during the period (see Annex 3.2) because of small changes in the
load pattern, resultLng in a growth of maximum demand commmensurate with the
energy requirements growth.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
EEEB's Expansion Program
4.01      By 1990, EEEB's system will have to be expanded to serve about
940,000 customers with a peak load of about 1,470 MW and an annual energy
demand of about 7,900 GWh. This will mean an increase of 240,000 customers,
410 14W and 2,200 GWh from estimated 1984 levels. The 1985-1990 expansion
program designed by EEEB to meet these requirements is well-balanced, with
appropriate emphasis given to generating plants, subtransmission facilities
and both rural and urban distribution. The generation expansion plan is very
ambitious and represents the largest investment of EEEB's expansion program -
(60Z). It includes construction of two major hydroelectric plants - Mesitas
(600 MW) and Guavio (1,000 MW) - both with the Bank's financial support; and
acquisition of two thermal plaxts - Zipa IV and V (132 KW) from ISA.  The
distribution expansion program is an indispensable complement to this
generation expansion, as the efficient delivery of generated electricity
depends beavily on the quality and reliability of the distribution network.
The distribution program consists of the final stages of the Bogota
Distribution I Project, which included EEEB's 1979-1985 subtransuission and
distribution program (partially financed by Bank Loan 1807-CO),. the proposed
project, and a rural electrification program for the area surrounding Bogota,
partially financed by KfW and for which EEEB will seek the Bank's
participation. One further component of BEEEB's expansion program is a
control center to be completed by mid-1988 and financed by the Bank under the
Guavio Loan (2008-CO). The investment program necessary to carry out this
expansion program is. summarized below. Annex 4.1 shows the detailed
investment costs in millions of current dollars, and Anaex 4.2 in current
Colombian pesos.

The above estimate was prepared on the basis of prices prevailing in mid-1984
and includes 1OX of physical contingencies. The cost estimate also includes
appropriate price contingencies (see para. 4.07). Generation costs consist
of: 1985-1989 investment for Mesitas and Guavio; and total cost of Zipa IV
and V thermal plants (132 MW), which will be acquired by REEB from ISA in
1986. This plant is currently being constructed by ISA and has two 66 MW
units: the first one was completed in 1983 and the second one should be
completed by June 1985. Distribution costs consist of investments for the
ongoing Bogota Distribution Project, the 1985-1990 rural distribution program
and the proposed Project. The Control Center cost consists of its investment
over the 1985-1990 period.   An estimate for investments in EEEB's future
expansion program, not yet fully defined, and to start by 1988-89 is also
included. Finally, the program includes expenses for general facilities and
other investments, mainly for studies and vehicles.
The Project
4.02      General and Objectives.  The project proposed for Bank financing
consists of EEEB's 1985-1990 program for the expansion and improvement of its
subtransmission and distribution system and modernization of the existing
system for the urban areas. This project builds on the first Bogota
Distribution Project (1979-1985), which is being financially supported by the
Bank, under Loan 1807-CO and it is a fundamental component of EEEB's
1985-1990 expansion program. The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to enhance the benefits derived from the power sector's investments
(in generation, transmission and distribution) by ensuring
efficient delivery of generated power;
(b) to extend the benefits derived from EEEB's investments to the
majority of Bogota's population, including a large number of
low-income new customers; and
(c) to improve the efficiency of EEEB's operations by reducing energy
losses (both technical losses and theft).
The project has been designed to achieve these objectives through investments
in the subtransmission and distribution system and by strengthening EEEB's
organizational structure, and its technical and managerial capabilities.
4.03      Description.  The project consists of the following;
(a) Subtransmission: Installation of about 1,100 MYA of substation
capacity at 230/115 kV and related equipment, about 10 km of 230 kV
lines and about 75 km of 115 kV lines;
(b) Distribution:
(i) installation of about 350 MVA of distribution substation
capacity 115/11.4 kV, 115/34.5 kV and 230/11.4 kV;



- 18 -
(li) line extensions of about 750 km and Liprovements to about
1,600 km of lines at 11.4 kV and 34.5 kV;
(111)  installatLon of about 650 km and improvements to about 900 km
of secondary circuits;
(lv)  lnstallation of about 1,000  [VA of dlstribution transformer
capacity;
(v)  installation of about 10 MVA of voltage regulators and 60 MVAR
of capacLtors;
(vi) installatlon of about 300,000 meters; and
(vii)  public lighting.
These quantities should be annually adjusted ln accordance with the
actual demand growth and demographLc expanslon.
(c) Acqulsition of maintenance equipment for substations, lines and hot
lines, and laboratory equipment for testing low, medium and high
voltage equipment;
(d) consulting engineerLig servlces for: (L) illegal customers
evaluation; (li) a study on dlstribution system reliability; (iii)
a study on subtransmission system operation; and (iv) losses
control systematizatLon;
(e) a training and technical asslstance program to improve EKEB's
technLcal and managerial skills; and
(f) a program for reductlon of energy losses.
4.04      The project's components have been deflned on the following basis:
(a) The substatlon expansion has been defined on the basis of the
system's capacLty balances, whlle subtransmission llnes included in
the Project are to connect existing plants and substations to the
present subtransomission system.
(b) The dlstrlbution component was designed to extend the servlce to
about 240,000 new customers and to Lmprove the existLng system.
Planning and engineering studies were made to define primary
cLrcuLts voltage, and standards for design and construction of
primary and secondary clrcuits, feeders, distrLbutLon substatlons
and public lighting (see para. 4.05). Substatlon capacltles have
been defined on the basis of annual capacity balances for each
substatlon. Voltages selected for primary circuits are 34.5 kV for
Lndustrial and !1.4 kV for the resldentlal and commerclal loads.
The Lprovement of existlng clrcults will Lmprove quality and



- 19 -
reliability of service to residential, commercLal, industrial and
low-lncome urban customers, and reduce energy losses. Circults to
be improved have reached their economic Llfe; they have high losses
and frequent outages due to an extremely hlgh number of splices.
EEEB would employ the results of the studles described ln sectLon
(d) below in formulating plans to maximize beneflts through
lnvestments to achleve energy losses reductlon.
Additlon of voltage regulators and capacltors will Liprove servlce;
targets are to have not more than 10 of voltage reductlon at the
end of any clrcult and to maLntaLn a power factor of 90X.
Acqulsitlon of meters will allow the extenslon of service to new
customers and reduce thefts by installing meters to now illegal
customers.
(c) AcquisitLon of maintenance equlpment Is to replace old equLpment
and expand maLatenance capabilltles, mainly for hot lne...
Laboratory equlpment wll allow EEEB to test medlum and high
voltage equipment.
Cd) The four studLes Lncluded in the project are to liprove EEEB's
distribution and operation planning, already successfully Initiated
through the Bogota Dlstrlbutlon I Project.
(e) The traLning and technLcal assistance component (whLch builds on a
program financed under Bank loan 2008-CO) consists of a traLuing
program for managers and professlonal staff to Improve UEB's
organLzation planning and operational practlces.
(f) The program for reductlon of energy losses ls a partLcularly
important feature of the project; whlle technical losses would be
reduced by subtransmLssion expansion and dlstrlbutlon Liprovements
descrlbed in sectLons (a) and (b) above, EEEB should assign an
administratlve unit to take charge of plannLig and lmplesenting
actions to reduce thefts. This unit would also monitor KEEEB's
progress ln reachlng target levels for losses reductlon (see para.
7.01(a)). Targets for losses, both theft and technical, are to
reduce such losses from 23% in 1984 to 21% in 1986, 16% In 1988 and
13% in 1990. EEEB will send to the Bank annual reports on Lts
system energy losses, detaliLng types of losses and consumer
sectors (see para. 7.01 (b)). The establishment of this unit
is a condltion of effectlveness of the proposed loan (see para.
7.04).
4.05      Design.  PlanLnig and Design Procedures have been defined on the
basis of two studies: (a) 'EstudLos de Planeamiento del Sistema de
Subtransmislon y Distribucion", carried out under the ongoing Bogota
Distribution Project. It was completed in May 1981 by the consultants
Gilbert Associates Inc. and Salgado, Melendez y Asociados; and (b)
Ingenieria de DLstribucLon' completed in July 1983, by Salgado, Melendez y
Associados. The first study was a revisLon of EEEB's planning and design



- 20 -
practices, and was commented on and approved by the Bank. The second study
complemented the first one and prepared standards for distribution design and
construction. These studies cover all the basic engineering needed for
defining the distribution system expansion, mainly: economic subtransuission
and distribution voltage; economic conductor size; economic circuit loading
policies; substation arrangement; transformer loading criteria; system
protection, and public lighting system criteria. The Planning Study
(Estudios de Planeacion del Sistema de Subtransmision y Distribucion) also
covered the economic analysis for converting the distribution system voltage
from 11.4 kV to 13.2 kV. The studies defined the least-cost solution in each
case, which was adopted for the design standards. Although the studies
mentioned above covered all the main issues for a distribution system, future
in-depth studies are necessary for a continuing improvement of the system;
they are included in the Project (see para. 4.09).
4.06      Engineering.  EEEB's practice is to use local engineering firms to
assist its staff as needed for detailed design, procurement, and supervision
of construction; this practice would also be followed for the project. As
indicated above (see para. 4.05), FEE has completed basic distribution
studies and design standards. Therefore. oarticipation of local firms will
be restricted to some complementary designs and supervision of construction.
Most of the construction would be performed by local contractors, including
230 kV and 115 kV substations, 115 kV lines and primary distribution
circuits. EEEB, like most utilities in Colombia, does not maintain a staff
to implement and supervise large construction projects.  The practice of
utilizing local engineering and construction firms has proven successful in
the past and no major problems are expected in using this method of project
implementation. However, the distribution expansion involves many
inter-related activities such as procurement, design, material inventory,
management of construction and consultants contracts. At this moment, there
is a certain lack of coordination among the units dealing with these
activities. This may have been one of the causes for delays in the first
Distribution Project (Loan 1807-CO). It is therefore necessary that a strong
unit with experienced staff be created to coordinate all the distribution
activities in EEEB. Before effectiveness, an administrative unit in charge
of this task and with powers and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank
should be in operation (see para. 7.04).

These costs were prepared on the following basis:
(a)  The base cost estimates were prepared by ESEB using mid-1984 price
levels. These costs do not include any direct taxes nor duties since EEEB is
exempt from them (see para. 2.09).  They do, however, include the indirect
taxes that EEEB's contractors have to pay.  Subtransmission, Distribution,
Maintenance Equipment and Laboratory costs are based upon actual costs for
the ongoing Bogota Distribution Project, which has very similar works to the
proposed project. Training costs were estimated at US$2,000,000, of which
US$800,000 are to cover part of ANSALDO's assistance and training program and
US$1,200,000 are the estlmate for training courses for professional staff.
The remaining ANSALDO's program cost will be financed under Guavio Project
(Loan 2008-CO), by a grant of the Italian Government and EEEB's own
resources. Study costs were based upon EEBB's man-months estimate and actual
Colombian Consultant's salaries. Costs for the Energy Theft Reduction
Program were based on EEEB's estimates for vehicles, equipment and services
to carry out this Program. Engineering and administrative costs are
estimated at 5% of total equipment and construction costs; this is lower than
the 8% estimated at the ongoing Distribution Project, because most of the
engineering studies made under the former Project will be utilized on the
proposed project.
(b) A 10% physical contingency is included for both foreign and local costs.
(c) A price contingency has been added to the estimated base cost. Because
of the significant divergence between local and foreign inflation, different
inflation rates have been estimated and applied separately to local costs (in
Colombian pesos) and to foreign costs (in US dollars). After that, Colombian
pesos were transformed to US dollars using a forecasted exchange rate for
each year. Local cost, in Colombian pesos, was assumed to increase 20% per
year from 1984 to 1986, and 18% per year thereafter; foreign cost, in US
dollars, was assumed to increase -2.8% in 1984; 5% in 1985; 7.5% in 1986; 8%



- 22 -
per year from 1987 to 1990; and 5X in 1991; the average exchange rate was
assumed to increase from Col$101.19 per US$ ln mid-1984 to Col$219.35 in
mid-1990 (see Annex 5.11).
Financing
4.08      A US$171 milliou loan is proposed to finance 90% of the foreign
exchange or the 44Z of the total cost (see Annex 4.4).

About US$18.6 million equivalent would be sought through suppliers credits
and the remaining US$200.0 million would be financed by EEEB. The proposed
loan would include the financing of the Bank's interest and commitment fee
charges accrued during the construction period (from 1985 to 1991). This is
warranted in view of the foreign exchange constraints currently facing
Colombia; EEEB's own inability, as a domestic-based utility, to generate
foreign exchange; and the considerable size of Bank support for EEEB's
capital development program, when compared with the size of the borrower's
fixed assets in operation.
Consulting Services
4.09      The proposed project includes the services of consultants, which
will be engaged by EEEB under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, to
assist EEEB with respect to: (i) illegal customers evaluation (see para.
4.04 (d)); (ii) distribution system reliability; (iii) subtransmission system
operation; and (iv) losses control systematization.
(i) Ulegal Customers Evaluation: This evaluation will allow EEEB to
improve its program of illegal customer incorporation into its
billing system. Consultants should evaluate types and location of
illegal customers and analyze and recommend the strategy for
connecting them to EEEB's normal service and design a system to
keep this inventory updated. This evaluation will start by July
31, 1985.
(ii) Distribution System Reliability: Costs for improving EEEB's system
reliability and outage statistics will be analyzed in order to
recommend to EEEB the optimal reliability level. Consultant
services should include the elaboration of a methodology for KEEB
to apply in the future to evaluate its system's reliability. The
consultants will be engaged not later than December 31, 1985.



- 23 -
(iii)  Subtransmission System Operation: Under this study, consultants
will analyze existing circuit loads and technical energy losses in
order to review circuit design, mainly economical conductor size,
capacitors required for normal and critical conditions and
equipments' short-circuit capacity. Consultants for this
assignment will be engaged by December 31, 1985.
(iv) Losses Control Systematization: The objective of this study is to
establish a methodology for measuring and estimating EEEB's system
technical losses and determine optimal level for the system's
losses . Although a national energy losses study was carried out
by ISA'S consultants in 1978, current status needs to be analyzed
and systematization for periodic control is necessary. In addition
to this, the study should evaluate the optimal level of losses for
EEEB's system on the basis of economic and social costs of these
losses and implementing costs of energy reduction measures.
Consultants for this assignment will be engaged by December 31,
1985.
Training and Technical Assistance
4.10      The training and technical assistance component of the project has
been designed to improve the company's organization and staff skills in order
to equip BEEB to handle the demands of a rapidly expanding distribution and
generation network and to adapt smoothly to changes in its operating
environment. This component consists of two programs:
Ci) Technical assistance for improvement of EEEB 's organization,
managerial skills, technical and operational planning, system
operation and human resources management, and for expansion of the
existing internal training unit. This program, which grew out of
technical assistance financed under the Guavio project (Loan
2008-CO), has a total cost of US$7.2 million, the bulk of which is
being financed under the Guavio project by EEEB (US$2.9 million),
the Government of Italy (US$2.9 million) and the Bank's Guavio loan
(US$0.6 million); the balance, US$0.8 million, is included in the
proposed project. With the Bank's approval, REEB has selected
consultants to assist them in this program. The consultants should
be engaged by March 31, 1986. EEEB should submit for Bank approval
the consultants' detailed program for this technical assistance and
to ensure that the program includes appropriate provision for
active participation by EEEB's staff in the assessment of the
existing organizational structure and in the formulation of
measures for the improvement of EEEB's organization and
management. (See para. 7.01(c)).
(ii) Training and specialization courses for professional staff.
Training for EEEB's staff of competent professionals is being
provided both in Colombia and abroad. However, foreign exchange
constraints have prevented EEEB's administrators and engineers from



- 24 -
benefitting from many courses, seminars and fellowships available
outside the country. Since several of these foreign training
opportunities offer exposure to technological advancements and
technical specializations not yet available in Colombia, the
proposed loan would finance the foreign component of the training
program-about $1.0 million for five years. The following subjects
would be covered in the courses offered through the training
program:
(a) Planning
- Optimum planning for distribution systems
- Load management and energy conservation
- Reliability and marginal costs for generation and
distribution systems
(b) Engineering
- Protection, digital control and supervisory systems
- Load-flow management
(c) Distribution system operation
- Dispatch centers management and operation
- Optimization of urban distribution network operation
- Telecommmications
Sd) Finance and Management
- Advanced finance and economics
- Advanced manageient
- Development of Information System
The program will provide courses for about 15 staff members per year from
1986 to 1990. Participants will be selected by EEEB in the context of its
overall staff development program.
Implementation Schedule
4.11      The project implementation schedule envisages completion by
June 30, 1991, which is a 5.5 year project execution period. The
disbursement program (see para. 4.14) corresponding to this implementation
schedule fits the recommended Bank-wide standard profile for distribution and
transmission projects. The key dates as shown in Annex 4.5 would be used to
monitor progress during project implementation.
Procurement
4.12   - Procurement of goods with a value of over US$100,000 to be financed
by the proposed loan, except for vehicles for the Energy Losses Reduction
Program will be through international competitive bidding (ICB) under Bank
guidelines for procurement. Goods, estimated to cost the equivalent of



- 25 -
US$100,000 or less, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$2,000,000,
would be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB), to allow
faster purchases in the case of additional goods needed due to final
adjustments to the project. Goods and software estimated to cost less than
US$100,000, up to an aggregate Amount equivalent to US$500,000 would be
procured by Direct Contracting, mainly to acquire spare parts, standard
laboratory equipment and software. EEEB will procure vehicles for the Energy
Losses Reduction Program through local competitive bidding (LCB) to
facilitate timely project execution.   The cost of these vehicles would total
US$100,000, less than O.1X of the proposed loan. As the amount allocated to
vehicles is so small, their procurement through ICB will not affect the
project cost, but an early start of the Losses Reduction Program is important
for the Project. LCB procedures, which do not preclude foreign contractors
from bidding, have ben reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank.
Consultant's services to carry out the studies included in the Project would
be contracted under the Bank's guidelines. Consultants for technical
assistance and training have already been selected with the Bank's approval.
Contracts for goods in excess of US$500,000 will be subject to prior review
by the Bank. This shouid permit Bank review of approximately 80% of goods
procurement. The table of Annex 4.7 summarizes the procurement arrangements
for the project.
4.13      The goods to be financed from suppliers credits without associated
Bank financing will also be procured under international competitive bidding
(ICB) limited to the suppliers offering credit under acceptable terms and
conditions. Procurement of poles and minor distribution accessories to be
financed by EEEB's internal sources, will be through local competitive
bidding (LCB). Costs of these local goods are competitive with foreign ones
and their procurement by LCB will not affect the project cost. Procurement
of civil works to be financed by EEEB's internal sources will also be through
LCB. Local contractors have proven to be successful and competitive for
subtransmission and distribution civil works.
Disbursements
4.14      Funds from the proposed loan will finance:  (a) 100% of foreign
expenditures for imported equipment and materials; (b) 94% of the ex-factory
cost of locally manufactured equipment and materials; (c) 100% of foreign and
50% of local expenditures for consultant's services and training; and (d)
interest during construction and commitment fee for the period 1985-1991.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is based on the formulated
procurement program and is in accordance with the corresponding Bank-wide
standard profile. Loan proceeds would be disbursed into a US dollar
denominated revolving fund in a special account in Banco de la Republica to
be established, by EEEB, solely for the purposes of the Project. The Bank
would make an initial deposit into the fund of US$9 million, equivalent to
the estimated disbursements during the first 120 day period after loan
effectiveness. The bulk of the project is expected to be executed by
December 31, 1990 with minor works and testing to be completed by June 30,
1991 (see para. 4.11). The closing date should be December 31, 1991, six
months after the last contract's final liquidation to allow for payment of
retention monies and unforseen delays. The estimated schedule of
disbursements is shown in Annex 4.5. All disbursements will be fully



- 26 -
documented except for contracts with values of US$200,000 equivalent or less,
for which disbursements would be based on statements of expenditures.
Documentation for these expenditures will not be submitted to the Bank, but
will be retained by EEEB for periodic review by the Bank.
Environmnt
4.15      EEEB has carried out previous projects with due regard to
environmental protection. The proposed project wlll not negatively affect
the environment because it consists only of extension of existing high
voltage substations, short hlgh voltage lines adjacent to existing hlghways,
aerial distribution clrcuits under international standards for urban
distribution systems,, and underground circuits to replace old aerial circuits
in downtown Bogota and of extending the distribution system in selected
areas.
Project Risk
4.16      The procurement and construction schedule asssumed for the project
is reasonable and takes into consideration normal engineering, administrative
and construction procedures; no unusual delays are anticipated. Timely
completion of the project by EEEB will depend to a large extent upon project
management ability, mainly to coordinate design and procurement activities.

5. FINANCE
Summary
5.01      EEEB has maintained a satisfactory fLnancial position through its
25-year relationship with the Bank, with a slightly declining trend since
1979. The construction of the Guavio Project (started In 1982) is imposing a
heavy burden on the company. In spite of substantial tariff adjustments,
EEEB has not been able to generate sufficient funds for its Investment
program. The average tariffs are among the highest in Colombia (USc6.1/kWh
In 1984). The extra-fiscal measures taken in conjunction with Bank-financed
projects, including revaluation of assets for monitoring financial
performance, have considerably strengthened its financial structure. The
investment for the 1985-90 period amounts to US$2,243 million as shown in
Annex 4.1. For the purpose of a financial analysis, the period 1984-91 is
used. During this period, EEEB's total financial requirements, Licluding
investments in ISA, interest during construction and working capital
requirements amount to Col$889.5 billion, (US$4,793 million) of which
Col$64.2 billion (US$349 million) correspond to the proposed Distribution II
Project. EEEB's net Lnternal cash generation would finance Col$342.9
billion, (US$1,789.4 million) or 39% of the total requirement of this
program, ISA's contribution (Guavio Project) is expected to cover about
Col$13 billion (US$79 million) (1X), and the balance of Col$533.5 billion
(US$2,925 million) (60%) would be covered by loans both external and
internal. The present flinncial projections are based on an annual sales
growth of 8.2% for the 1985-1990 period (7.8% for 1984-1991) and on nominal
tariff Increases of 37% in 1985 and 1986, 23% ln 1987 and a constant 18Z
(equal to estimated local inflation) from 1988 on. Net operatlng Lncome with
the above plan is expected to produce annual rates of return on revalued
assets ranging from 17.3% in 1985 to 16.6% in 1991 and the company is
expected to maintain an adequate flnancial position throughout the projection
period.
Earnings History
5.02      Over its 25-year relationship with the Bank, EEEB has maintained a
sound financial position. During the period 1969-1978, its internal cash
generation provided more than 50X of annual investments on average, including
substantial contributions to ISA. This may be attributed in part to the high
density of Its market and low-cost facilities, given the area's geographic
advantages for hydro generation. The balance of the company's investment
funds has been obtained through borrowings, generally at reasonable cost; no
Government financing was required during that period.
5.03      In the years from 1979 to 1983, EEEB's financial situatlon was
somewhat more difficult as a consequence of several factors, not all within
the company's control: first, delays in obtaining authorization for timely



- 26 -
tariff increases in 1980 and 1981. Second, the lack of local financing for
its rapidly expandLng investment requirements Ln the begLnning of the
eighties - mainly the Guavio and Mesitas Projects. As a result, in 1981,
EEEB had a deficit of Col$3,400 million (US$62 million equivalent) financed
with arrears in its payments to ISA and to contractors. Third, the
percentage of unpaid bills ln relation to total annual sales showed a
regressive tendency in 1979 and 1980 when compared with the 18% stipulated in
the Loan Agreements for Guavlo: 25S In 1979 and 29% in 1980. These arrears
added to the already existing cash probles. Further, in 1981 a rationing of
power occurred in the interconnected ColombLan system due to poor
hydrological conditions which diminished EEEB's sales by about US$40 million
below the expected figures. The tariff situation improved in 1983 and 1984
when EEEB's average tariff attained Col$4.66 per kWh (USc5.9), and Col$6.17
(USc6.1) the highest average in the country. The financial needs were
covered with borrowing both from local and external sources but those loans
were still insufficient to meet the investment program. At the end of 1983,
the company had accounts payableof Col$8.3 billion (US$93 million
equivalent), mainly represented by arrears to contractors (Guavio and
Mesitas) and to ISA (EEEB's share In energy purchases and in ISA projects).
This debt will be gradually reduced to normal levels until December 1987 and
EEEB shall furnish to the Bank an acceptable program for this by December 31,
1985 and carry out such program. The starting operations of Financiera
Electrica Nacional (FEN) in 1984 is enabling EEEB to obtain the required
additional long-term funds in local currency, to meet its investment
program. It is interesting to follow the evolution of certain financial
parameters in the period 1980 to 1983. The following table shows a
comparison between actual and Guavio SAR forecasted values (in December
1980), which are expressed as indices based on the SAR's 1980 values (SAR's
1980 values - 100).
1980      1981      1982       1983
Sales (kWh) - Forecasted              100       110        122       135
Actual                  99         96       105        103
Tariffs - Forecasted                  100       147        193       254
Actual                      101       142       203        322
Net Operating Income - Forecasted    100        199        348       555
Actual         85        134       254       502
Net Internal Cash Generation- Fore.  100        162        296       428
Actual  65        60        206       287
Investment Program - Forecasted       100       249        30;       371
Actual          106        175       195       340
From the above table It can be seen that sales in 1983 were well below the
forecast values, while tariffs had increased more than initially foreseen.
The combination of these two resulted in that both the net operating income
and net internal cash generation were lower than expected. EEEB's investment
program, on the other hand, started with somewhat lower figures in 1981 and
1982, but reached the expected level in 1983.



a                          - a~~~~~~~~9 -
5.04      The 14% average rate of return on net fixed assets covenanted under
the Guavio Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2008-CO) was met in 1982 and 1983,
when values of 16.2Z and 14.8Z were attained. From 1983 on, asset figures
revalued according to more satisfactory procedures were used (see para.
5.05). The increase in the rate base caused by these revaluation procedures
is about 3S% and a further rate base increase due to further revaluation to
better reflect replacement costs is to take place in 1985 and, consequently,
it would be sufficient to adopt a lower rate of return, of 12X. At
negotiations, it was agreed that the previous covenant would be changed
accordingly in the present loan. Under the same Loan 2008-CO, self-financing
ratios of 35% in 1982, 1983 and 1984 and of 55% from 1985 to 1987 were
stipulated; these very higi' figures were adopted at that time to ensure a
substantial internal cash generation. This covenant would be somewhat
changed in the proposed project (see para. 5.15). The covenanted values for
accounts receivable (as a percentage of annual sales) were not achieved in
the 1980-83 period: instead of 23%, 21%, 19% and 17%, the actual figures were
42Z, 52Z, 41% and 38% respectively. The main responsibility for these
arrears belongs to private subscribers, with 55Z of the total while official
entities represent 33% and the remaining 12X are several debtors. The
company is engaged in a publicity campaign, combined with stricter penalties
to late payers, to reduce these arrears; with the major official entities,
arrangements are made to compensate their arrears with existing credits as
for instance with the local water and sewerage company, EAAB (see para.
5.10). The company's debt/equity ratio was 41% at the end of 1983, and the
debt service coverage was 1.3 times in that year., The current ratio exceeded
1.4 since 1974 and reached 2.0 but dropped to 1.5 in 1982 and 1983.
Rate Base
5.05      For public accounting purposes, Colombia's public utility
regulatory law (Decree Law 444/67) does not allow full revaluation of fixed
assets but only a partial one, to match foreign exchange losses caused by the
revaluation of outstanding foreign debt due to changes in exchange rates.
Under the Mesitas loan (Loan 1628-CO) in April 1979 it was agreed to reflect
the international and domestic inflation, an agreed fixed value of EEEB's
assets and accumulated depreciation was assessed as of December 31, 1976.
Starting from this date, EEEB revalues its assets quarterly by the Colombian
blue collar cost of living index for the Bank's purpose of monitoring its
financial performance. Furthermore, under the Mesitas and Bogota
Distribution Projects, EEEB agreed to commission a consultant's study to
establish the value of its assets on the basis of a more detailed
assessment. The study was to be completed and made available to the Bank by
March 31, 1981. However, it took longer than expected to select consultants
(Gilbert Commonwealth in consortium with Consultores Regionales Asociados
Ltda.) who were hired at the end of 1980. The Bank extended the presentation
date and for various reasons, mainly the lack of local experience in this
field, the study was not completed until mid-1984. It was sent to the Bank
at the end of 1984 for comments. The main conclusion is that the revalued
total assets of EEEB as of December 31, 1982 are Col$134,153.6 million,
compared with a book (and balance sheet) value of Co.1$62,599.6 million.
Using the revaluation system which is now being applied, the value is
Col$96,849 million, about 28% below the correctly revalued figure.   It
would therefore appear that the index now used for asset revaluation does not



- 30 -
ref lect correctly the real construction cost of hydroelectric and other power
projects in Colombia. Under Loan 2401-CO (FEN), the Government agreed to
prepare an appropriate price index for the power sector. This index could be
used in the future to revalue EEEB's assets. EEEB is consulting with its
auditors (Revisoria Fiscal) as to how this new asset value can be
incorporated into their accounting base, both from a legal and accounting
standpoint. For the reason above, EEEB's assets have been undervalued and
this explains to some degree the relatively high rates of return obtained in
the last years. During negotiations, agreement was reached that by December
1985, EEEB shall present their 1984 financial statements with the new asset
base (see para. 7.01 (d)).
Tariff Structure
5.06      EEEB's average rate has improved significantly in the last years,
and at the end of 1984 it was among the highest in Colombia (Col$6.17/kWh).
The tariff structure, however, lacks appropriate balance among major
categories of consumers; this tendency has been increasing in the last 3
years and should be corrected (see Annex 5.6). To induce consumers to be
legally connected to the grid, EEEB has a low tariff, and connection charge
for low-consumption customers. The connection charge may be financed by
EEEB.
5.07      The Government issued Decree No. 2545 on October 12, 1984 which
established a new national tariff structure. This decree, though legally in
force, will be gradually put into practice, according to the particular
condition of each utility. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan, EEEB shall begin to carry out a restructuring of its tariff structure,
within the framework of this decree (see para. 7.04 (b)).
Fiuancial Structure
5.08      As a result of the extra-fiscal measures taken under the Mesitas
loan, including pro-forma revaluation of assets for monitoring financial
performance, EEEB's financial structure has been strengthened. As of
December 31, 1983, its capitalization was:
Col$ million           z

5.09      eEEB's principal creditor is the Bank: in 1983, debt under its six
loans amounted to Col$10,511 million (18% of total long-term debt). The
second largest creditors are two private banks: Lloyds Bank Iaternational
wlth Col$8,424 million (15%) and Bank of America with Col$8,433 million (15%)
followed by IDB wlth Col$6,094 million (11%) and other private banks, bothi
foreign and local (see Annex 5.5). The pension and other liability reserves
(non-current and contingent liabilities) are estimated at Col$8,837 million.
Investment and Financing Plan
5.10      EEEB's 1984-1991 investment program (see para. 5.01), including its
own construction program, investments in ISA and EAAB, interest durLng
construction and requirements for working capital amounts to Col$889.5
billion (US$4,793 million equivalent) of which only Col$64.2 billion or 7%
correspond to the proposed Distribution Project; the ongoing works which
encompass mainly the Guavio project, the purchase of Termozipa IV and V
plants and rural distribution amount to Col$198.4 billion (22%); other future
construction, including the expansion of both rural and urban distribution
after 1990 as well as the projected investments for an additional generating
plant and provision for future expansion, not yet fully defined,
(disbursements after 1988) need an investment of Col$305.8 billion or 34% of
the total. Interest during construction, several studies, capital and bond
investments in ISA and in Empresa de Acueductos and Alcantarillado de Bogota
(EAAB)2/ amount to Col$279.3 billion (32%) and finally the working capital
requirements amount to Col$41.8 bllion, or 5X of the total.  The investment
program and its respective financing plan is summarized on the next page and
shown in Annex 5.3.
5.11      EEEB's net internal cash generation would finance Col$342.9 billion
or 39% of the total requirements of the 1984-1991 program; ISA's contribution
would fund Col$13.0 billion or 1% of the total and the remaining 60% would be
covered by loans both foreign and local amounting to Col$533.5 billion. Of
this figure, Col$125.8 billion comes from undisbursed proceeds of existing
loans, including Col$49.1 billion from the 1628-CO (Mesitas), 1807-CO
(Distribution I) and 2008-CO (Guavlo) loans. The Bogota Distribution II
Project would require the proposed loan of Col$31.6 billion (US$171
million) plus an additLonal US$18.6 mllion from suppliers credits. Other
future loans would be required for the rest of the program, mainly for the
Guavio plant, during the 1985-1991 period: (a) US$137 million from several
suppliers; (b) US$340 million from IDB, already signed in 1984 and to be
disbursed from 1985 on, combined with commercial bank co-financings of US$42
million in 1986 and US$112 million in 1988; (c) the utilization of EEEB's
share of US$106 million from the Bank loan to FEN in 1984 and 1985; (d) a
planned new Bank loan of about US$44 million for EEEB's rural distribution
project; (e) local funds from FEN for about Col$37 billion, averaging Col$6.2
billion per year from 1985 to 1990; (f) Col$175.3 mllion from ISA for
financing the purchase of Termozipa IV and V in 1986, together with the
transference of 5 external loans already contracted by ISA; (g) Col$2.9
billion from FONADE for several studies; and (h) about US$557 million and
Col$130 billion for the future expansion program, starting in 1988-89. The
country has had problems during 1984 In obtaining foreign currency.
2/  This contribution to EAAB was agreed between the two companies to settle
EKEB's debt with EAAB regarding the Chingaza Reservoir.

Therefore, the Government has restricted the use of foreign currency to
priorlty projects including the proposed project. If the situatlon does not
deteriorate for Colombia, it Is reasonable to expact that LEES be able to
obtain the financing listed above.
5.12      EESB would generate sufficient internal cash which together with
ISA's contribution and planned borrowings, would enable timely carrying out
of the proposed project, as well as the balance of KEElBs 1984-1991
Investment program. The three year (1984-1986) program of tariff increases
(see para. 5.14) would represent an important contribution to this cash
generation.
5.13      Adequate availability of local financing seems to be existing fro
1984 on with the full operation of FEN. Its capacity in raising funds in the
local capital market plus its retained earnings could result in a total
availability of ColSIS to 20 billion per year initially, part of which would
be available for EEEB. As a financlg agency for the Colombian power sector,
FEN would also be in a favorable position to secure now credits in foreign
currency, In addition to its first co-financIng operation with the Bank.
Future Finances
5.14      Present financial projections (1984-1991) in Annexes 5.2, 5.3, and
5.4 are based on: (a) updated assumptions for inflation and rates of exchange
devaluation (see Annex 5.11); a peso devaluation mch greater then the
projected one would influence EEEB's financial posLtion because of Its debt
iin foreign currencies; (b) the energy balance as agreed by ISA and Its
shareholders in Idd-1984; and (c) EEEB's plan of tariff increases (see Annex
5.6) which assumes the following rates of noaminl Increases: 1985 and
1986-37% (about 2.7Z per month); 232 in 1987 and 18% (about 1.4% per month)
In 1988 and thereafter. The financial forecast assumes a Bank loan of US$171
million for the proposed project, with an interest rate of S.29% and a term
of 17 years including a 4-year grace period, to finance foreign direct cost
plus interest daring construction.
5.15      EEDB's net operating income with the above plan is dxpected to
produce annual rates on revalued assets ranging from 16.8% in 1984 to 16.6%
in 1991 (see Annex 5.5). The increasing values from 1984 to 1989 are caused
by the delay in the incorporation to the rate base of the Guav'io Project,
which accordIng to local practice ls kept as work In progress and only
capltalized when In operation (in 1990). It is of extreme importance that
EEED generate a sufficient portion of its investment needs from its
operational income; the tariff evolution should be closely monitored by the
Bank. As for the cash generation ratio, EEES is currently generating (1984)
22%, instead of the covenanted 55Z, which is very high. The projections show
increasing values but always in the 35% range maluly due to the very high
Investment program the company has during the 1984-1988 period. Accordligly,
at negotiations tbh ratio was lowered to 352 which is reasonable (see para.
5.18 (a)).
5.16      Under the three previous loans (Kesitas, Bogota Distribution I and
Guavio), EEEB agreed to furnish to the Bank quarterly financial reports on
cash generation, rate of return and adequacy of Its tariffs; these covenants
Including the provisions for submitting annual financial forecasts, will be
repeated for the proposed loan. The investment limitation covenanted under



- 34 -
the Guavio loan would also be maintained (see para. 7.03 (a) and (b)).
5.17      EEEB's financial position as measured by the debt/equity ratio
(41/59 in 1983) would be maintained at safe levels, with a high of 49/51 in
1986 but decreasing to 35/65 in 1990 (see Annex 5.5), despite the borrowings
required for the ongoing construction of Guavio and the distribution
investment, both urban and rural. Debt service coverage would not descend
under 1.8 (in 1987 and 1988) which is very satisfactory; the limitation
covenanted under the Guavio loan would be repeated for the proposed loan (see
para. 7.03 (e)).
Financial Covenants
5.18      The following financial covenants under the previous loans would be
changed:
(a) The cash generation ratio shall be not less than 35Z in the years
1986 to 1991, instead of the 55% self-financing ratio covenanted in
the Guavio (2008-CO) loan (see para. 7.02(a)).
(b) Rate of Return, as covenanted under the Bogota Distribution Loan
(1807-CO) and repeated under the Guavio loan, shall be not less
than 12% on the net current value of its revalued assets in
operation (see para. 7.02(b)).
5.19      The following financial covenants from previous loans shall be
maintained:
(a) Reporting Requirements as covenanted in the Guavio loan (2008-CO),
EEEB shall submit to the Bank its audited financial statements, a
report on its past performance and a report on up-to-date
projections of its future financial statements for the following
seven-year period (see para. 7.03 (a)).
(b) Investment limitation substantially as covenanted under the Guavio
loan (see para 7.03 (b)).
(c) Accounts Receivable: EEEB's accounts receivable as a percentage of
the total annual sales will not exceed 17% in 1986 and thereafter
(see para. 7.03 (c)).
(d) Debt-service coverage, as covenanted under Loan 1807-CO and
repeated untder Loan 2008-CO, i.e. EEEB's debt service coverage
shall not be inferior to 1.5 (see para. 7.03 (d)).
(e) Reporting on Adequacy of Tariffs: EEEB shall review the adequacy of
its tariffs to meet the requirements established in item (c) above
and shall furnish to the Bank the results of such review. If found
insufficient, action shall be taken to adjust tariffs accordingly
(see para. 7.03 (e)).

6.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solutions
6.01      The 1985-1990 subtransmission and distribution program was designed
on the basis of EEEB's load forecast (see para. 3.03). Since the objective
is to provide electric service to some 40,000 new consumers each year and to
improve service coverage and quality through improvement and expansion of the
existing system, reasonable alternatives are limited. However, EKEB has made
valuable studies and Bank supported planning efforts to determine least-cost
solutions for the main components, and standards for distribution design and
construction. Economic comparisons to determine the least-cost solution have
been made for selecting voltage levels for subtransmission and distribution
primary circuits and for substation arrangements. On the basis of these
comparisons, EEEB selected the 230 kV and 115 kV voltage for subtransmission,
and 34.5 kV and 11.4 kV for distribution primary circuits. The 230 kV
voltage is for the main subtransuission grid surrounding the city; the 115 kV
voltage is used for subtransmission lines inside the city, to connect the
main grid to distribution substations; 34.5 kV is adopted for distribution to
industrial loads and 11.4 kV to residential and commercial loads. The
existing 57.5 kV lines will be converted to 115 kV under the proposed
project. Under the ongoing Bogota Distribution Project, EEEB studied the
conversion of the primary distribution circuits from 11.4 kV to 13.2 k'S
because the system was designed to operate at this voltage; the study ahowed
that this conversion would be uneconomical because of the cost of
transformers. Distribution design standards were prepared for BEEB on the
basis of the ongoing distribution project. Preliminary conductor sizes have
been assumed for cost estimate purposes; economic comparisons to determine
definitive sizes must be made during project execution. However, the
following two important system aspects will require technical and economic
evaluation for future expansion programs: (a) analysis of the economic
reliability level for EEEB 's system, including the analysis of social and
economic cost of electric service outages on one hand, and costs for
improving the existing system reliability on the other; and (b) analysis of
the economic level of technical losses, based on real prices for energy,
equipment and material. The studies to carry out both of these analysis are
included in the proposed project (see para. 4.09).
Return on Investment
6.02      The return on investment was calculated as the discount rate
equalizing the present values of the streams of benefits and costs associated
with EEEB's 1985-1990 development program of which the proposed project is a
part. The cost streams comprises the capital costs of this development
program and incremental operation and maintenance costs related to the
incremental sales associated with the program. Capital costs include EEEB's



- 36 -
total 1985-1990 investment program, but they do nut include provision for
future expansion not yet defined (see Annex 6.1). As an estimate for
benefits, revenues derived from incremental sales associated with the program
and tariffs derived from current values and approved tariff increase policy
up to December 1986 were used (see Annex 5.6 and para. 5.14). Tariffs are
supposed to be constant in real value thereafter (see Annex 6.2). The
calculations are based on a 30-year period, because this was assumed to be
the average life-time of EEEB's installations included in the 1985-90
investment program.
6.03      The rate of return is about 12.1Z which compares favorably with the
opportunity cost of capital for Colombia estimated to be 11%. This rate
understates the socio/economic justification of return of the program, as
revenues from sales of electricity may not fully measure social and indirect
benefits. Shadow prices analysis for local costs components were disregarded
because Colombian shadow-prices parameters are very close to unity, but if
these shadow prices were taken into account, the rate of return of the
project would be somewhat higher.
6.04      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the impact of
major uncertainties underlying the return calculations. The parameters used
In the analysis were tariff, cost of the proposed project and the total
development program cost. The analysis shows the following:
Rates of Return
-----Change from Base (Z)
Prameters            -20      -10      Base       +10       +20
-----Rate of Return (X)----
Tariff                  7.9     9.0    12.1        13.5      14.9
Project Cost           12.5    12.2    12.1        11.7      11.5
Total Costs            15.2    13.6    12.1        10.5        9.2
The results indicate rates of return which compare favorably with the
opportunity cost of capital except in the case of a reduction in tariff.
With a 10% tariff reduction, the rate of return is lower than the opportunity
cost. However, conditions are favorable to apply the approved tariff
increase policy until December 1986 as EEEB has planned. The rate of return
is higher than the opportunity cost of capital even for a 20% project cost
increase.

COLONBIA
EMPRESA DE ENERGIA ELgTRICA DE BOGOTA
BOGOTA DISTRIBUTION II k:iCJ_T
Energy Resources - Background
Oil
1.       Known oil reserves at the end of 1983 totalled about 4.3 EJ (102
Mtoe) or only about 13 years at the present rate of production. Policies
pursuing artificially low prices during the 1960. and the early 19709
contributed to a deteriorating oil situation. In recent years, the
Government has moved forcefully to remedy this by bringing internal consumer
prices closer to international levels (internal prices were increased by more
than threefold in real terms between 1974 and 1980, and, lately, have
fluctuated around 80-90 of international prices) and by enabling producers
to benefit from a large part of the price increases. As a result,
exploration increased from 20 wells per year in 1975 to 100 in 1981 and
despite a subsequent decline In activity (to 37 new wells in 1983) as a
consequence of the deterioration in global oil prices, a total of 346
exploratory wells were drilled from 1977 to 1983. This heightened
exploratory activity led to the expansion of known recoverable reserves by
about 343 million barrels between L978 and 1983, after several years of
steady decline. In addition, crude oil production has been increasing at
almost 8Z per year since 1980, reaching 152,000 bbl/d at the end of 1983
(equivalent to about 912 of domestic consumption). Since average growth in
consumption did not surpass 2.41 per year during 1978-1983, self-sufficiency
in oil may be within reach by the end 1980s. In the near future, oil export
appears likely, as new discoveries by Occidental Petroleum in the Llanos
region have been very encouraging.
Natural Gas
2.        Measured natural gas reserves stood at about 4.07 trillion cubic
feet (5.1 EJ) at the end of 1983, or almost 30 years' consumption at present
rates of production. Most reserves, production and consumption are
concentrated on the nortbern coast, with natural gas being piped to the main
population and industrial centers along the coast. Growth in gas consumption
(which averaged about 7%/a over the last five years) has been provided a
major push by fuel conversion of power plants from oil to gas. Thermal power
plants now account for about half of total gas consumption. Industry
represents the bulk of the remainder with oil refineries also Important
consumers. At present there is significant excess supply in the northern
region. Further important increases in gas consumption are tied largely to

ANNEX 1.1
Page 2 of 3
several new gas-processing options currently being studied. The best
alternative appears to be an ammonia-urea plant for which the Bank is the
Executing Agency of a UNDP-financed feasibility study.
3.        As a consequence of the natural gas surplus on the northern coast,
the Covernment has oot yet defined a clear pricing policy for natural gas.
Prices for new deliveries are negotiated ex-post with producers on a case by
case basis. This acts as a disincentive for exploration. Although consumer
prices are currently relatively low (less than US$2 per 1,000 cubic feet) the
extent to which they result in misallocation of resources is not clear
because the viability of future gas-consuming projects remains to be
established.
Coal
4.        Colombia's coal resources are substantial, with reserves estimated
at some 16 Gt, of which only about 20% can be classified as measured. At
present rates of utilization, reserves would last hundreds of years. In view
of the magnitude of these reserves, Government policy is to encourage
domestic consumption of coal, both alone and in combination with natural gas
and fuel oil, and to promote coal exports, mainly from El Cerrejon but also
from other deposits located near the Atlantic Coast. Since 1979, the UNDP
and the Bank have been working jointly with the State coal corporation,
CARBOCOL, that together with an EXXON subsidiary is developing a 15 Mt/year
production facility at El Cerrejon North. A proposed Bank-financed Coal
Exploration Project will assist in assessing the economic potential of
several other promising areas in the Atlantic and Central Regions.
5.        Coal production grew at an average of about 4X per year over the
1978-83 period to reach a level of about 5.8 Mt in 1983. Production came
from some 400 small and medium-rscale mines, virtually all of which are
non-mechanized, run by the private sector and located in Central Colombia.
More than half the production and consumption of coal is concentrated in the
highlands of Bogota. Sixty percent of all coal is consumed by industry, and
most of the rest by the power sector. Residential consumption and exports
represent only a small share of total output. Colombian coal is bituminous,
of high calorific value (around 27.6 NJ/kg) and with low sulphur content
(mostly less than 1%). Some coal in central Colombia possesses coking
properties. In 1984, domestic coal prices, which are freely set by market
forces, typically ranged between US$20-30/t delivered to large consumers in
the industrial centers of Bogota, Medellin and Cali. These are well below
international prices, but high internal transport costs, imposed by the long
distance to ports and difficult terrain effectively preclude the export of
coal from the interior of the country for the present.
Hydroelectric Power
6.        Colombia's hydroelectric potential, at about 100 SW, is amongst the
largest in the world. Although the country has made strides in developing



- 41 -
ANNEX 1. I 
Page 3 of 3
this potential (hydroelectric power generation grew at about 10 per annum
during the 1970s), total instalLed hydro-capacity by end-1983 was only 3.5
GW; however, by 1990, installed hydro-capacity is expected to increase to
about 8 CrW. Hydroelectric plants currently represent about 66% of total
electric power generation and thermal plants the rest. The largest part of
the thermal capacity is located on the northern coast where hydro potential
is limited, but where coal and natural gas are abundant. Since plentiful
hydro-reserves can be developed at relatively low cost, they represent an
option of high priority. However, the optiual mix of hydro, coal and
gas-fired plants needs to be determined ia order to take advantage of the
projected increased supply of coal and the existing natural gas surplus.
This matter is currently being addressed in the context of the Covernuent's
National Energy Study.

EMPRESA DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA DE BOGOTA
BOGOTA DISTRIBUTION II PROJECT
Public Electricity Service in Colombia
1.        Public electricity service is provided in Colombia by:
(a) municipally-owned companies, independent of the National
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia Electrica
de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), and Empresas
Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b) national enterprises such as Instituto Coloubiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), and Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
(CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA). ICEL and CORELCA have a total of 20 electrificadoras,
subsidiaries which mainly distribute power at the local level; and
(c) a generating and transmission company, ISA, the main shareholders
of which are EEEB, EPM, CVC, ICEL and CORELCA.
The Ministry of Mines and Energy owns part of the sector directly through
ICEL and CORELCA.  EEE  and EPM, currently the largest utilities, are
controlled by autonomous municipal governments.  CVC reports to DNP. A brief
description of each principal utility follows below.
2.        ISA. Established in 1967 as a public corporation, IMA has provided
a cohesive framework for sector development by creating a national grid
capable of transmitting large amounts of power and energy at 220 kV and 500
kV between the regions. Because ISA undertook development of large
hydroelectric resources on behalf of its shareholders, the latter have been
able to share the costs and benefits of the country's low-cost hydropower
potential, which is geographically concentrated in the areas of Bogota (EEEB)
and Medellin (EPM). The holdings of ISA's shareholders as of December 31,
1984, are:

Headquartered in Medellin, ISA is administered by its Shareholder Assembly, a
5-member Board of Directors and a General Manager supported by a competent
technical staff. The Assembly must act on all major issues and, to ensure
that decisions are based on a consensus, ISA's bylaws specify that the
Shareholders Assembly achieve the concurrence of 75Z of the shares.
Decision-making tends to be slow when the interests of the various
shareholders differ. ISA has constructed the 500-MW Chivor I (681-CO, 1972)
and 500 MW Chivor II hydro plants, as well as 133 NW of thermal capacity at
Zipaquira and 133 NW in gas turbine capacity at Chinu. It has completed
in 1984 the 1,240-MW San Carlos I and II hydro plant (1582-C0, 1978, and
1725-CO, 1981) and the Jaguas hydro plant (170 NW), as well as the 500-kV
line, financed by the Government (1583-CO), interconnecting the northern
system (CORELCA) with the central system.
3.        EEEB.  An autonomous company, EEEB is owned by the Municipality of
the Special District of Bogota, which generates, transmits and distributes
electricity. It serves some 575,000 consumers in metropolitan Bogota
directly and sells power in bulk to a local distributor in the department of
Cundinamarca. EEEB is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors and a
General Manager. The Mayor of Bogota serves as the Chairman of the Board of
Directors. The General Manager, who is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the company, is appointed by the Board subject to the Mayor's
approval. EEEB has an installed capacity of 1,288 MW (1,158 MW hydro and 130
MW thermal). The company has under construction the 600 MW Mesitas (1628-CO,
1979) and the 1,000 NW Guavio (2008-CO, 1982) hydro project, as well as a
Bogota Distribution Mroject (1807-CO, 1981).
4.        EPM.  An autonomous company, EYff is owned by the Municipality of
Medellin, which provides power, water, sewage, and telephone services for the
city of Medellin and vicinity. It serves some 350,000 power consumers and
229,000 water consumers in metropolitan Medellin and sells in bulk to a
distributing company in the department of Antioquia and has 256,000 telephone
subscribers. EPM is headed by a 7-member Board of Directors and a General
Manager. The Mayor of Medellin, or his representative, is the Chairman of
the Board of Directors. The various services of EPH are managed as separate
entities with separate accounting systems. EPM has an installed capacity of
998 MW which will Increase to 1,211 NW with the completion of the Guadalupe
IV project in 1985. The Bank is providing financing for Guadalupe IV
(1868-CD, 1981) and the 200 MW Playas hydro project (1953-CD, 1982) and the
322 MW Rio Grande Project (2449-CO).
5.        CVC. An autonomous multipurpose State corporation under DNP, CVC
is responsThTe for developing the Cauca Valley and has been discharging its
mandate with notable success. One of its main activities is generating and
transmitting power in the Valley, undertaken In part through CHIDRAL, which
is owned by CVC (65%), the Municipality of Cali (17X) and EMCALI (18%).
CVC-CHIDRAL sells power in bulk to EMCALI and other distributing companies
(subsidiaries of ICEL and CVC) serving a total of some 400,000 consumers.
CVC is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors and an Executive
Director appointed by the President of the Republic. CVC's various



ANNEX 1.3
Page 3 of 3
activities are managed as separate enterprises with independent accounting
systems. CVC-CHIDRAL has received five fully-disbursed loans from the Bank
totalling MUS$44.6 (the last of which was made in 1963). It has an installed
capacity of 579 MW (534 MW hydro, 45 MW thermal). CVC's multipurpose
Salvajina project (intended mainly for flood control and Lrrigation), when
completed in 1985, will provide 270 MW of generating capacity and
corresponding transmission facilities.
6.        CORELCA. An autonomous corporation since 1972, CORELCA has been
responsible for power generation and transmission in 7 departments of the
Atlantic Coast. The 7 distributing companies in the area are subsidiaries of
CORELCA and buy power in bulk from it. Together they have an installed
capacity of 766 MW (all thermal) and serve about 425,000 consumers. A 170 KW
steam station fueled by coal from El Cerrejon was commissioned in 1983, and a
second 170 MW unit is being installed. CORELCA is administered by a 7-member
Board of Directors and a Managing Director. It has implemented construction
programs within its service area that included thermal plants with units in
the range of up to 150 MW, high voltage interconnecting transmission lines,
distribution system expansion, rural electrification and works to improve its
operating efficiency. Under Loan 1583-COJ ISA connected CORELCA to the
central grid at 500 kV (the temporary operation at 220 kV will be changed to
500 kV in 1985).
7.        ICEL. A government institute, ICEL reports to the Ministry of
Mines and Energy and provides electric power services largely to small towns
and rural areas of the country not served by the other main utilities. It
does so with the assistance of Government contributions through 11 subsidiary
companies in which it is the majority shareholder (the others are the
respective local governments). ICEL's subsidiaries have an installed
capacity of 652 NW (329 MW hydro, 327 MW thermal) and serve about 933,000
customers. ICEL and some of its subsidiaries are expanding generation
facilities, the largest of which is the Betania hydro plant which is to add
500 KW to the national system in 1986. ICEL is also responsible for the
investment program of lost of its subsidiaries, comprising essentially
expansion of the various subtransmission and distribution systems and their
connection to the inter-connected system, together with generating additions
to isolated systems. The projects carried out by ICEL are generally
transferred to its subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions. ICEL
is administered By a 5-member Board of Directors (chaired by the Minister of
Mines and Energy) and a General Manager appointed by the President of the
Republic.

Power Market and Supply 1/
Current and Historic
1.        Electric power has become the fastest-growing form of energy use in
Colombia. Its share of total energy consumption has risen from 6.5X in 1970
to 23% in 1978 and 27Z in 1983. Generation increased by an average of about
10% annually during 1970-1980, although it has slowed over the last years to
5.8Z/a in 1980-83 (see para. 3 below). Annual per capita generation In 1983
was about 840 kWh, which is below the average for Latin America. Effective
installed capacity at the end of that year was 5,049 NW, including
self-producers, with public entities accounting for 95Z of the total
installed capacity and generation. Peak demand was about 4,530 MW, and total
energy generation in 1983 amounted to 22.7 TWh. Hydroelectric plants
accounted for about 65.4% of the total energy generation.
2.        About 54Z of Colombia's 27.5 million population has electric power,
compared to 26Z in 1950 and 45% in 1970. The urban population, comprising
about 65Z of the population, has greater access. In 1976, for example, 902
of households In large cities (population of 50,000 or more) had electrical
service while in rural towns (population between 500 and 2,500) the
corresponding figure was 36%; in other rural areas, 16Z. Various programs
including the Bank-financed First and Second Integrated Rural Development
Projects and the Village Electrification Project as well as programs financed
by tDB, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Colombia Coffee Growers
Association, are aimed at increasing rural coverage. In 1983 there were
about 3.3 million electricity subscribers of which 89.9% were residential and
7.7Z commercial.
3.        During 1980-83, gross generation increased at an average annual
rate of about 5.82, compared to the 102 annual average during the 1970s. The
lower rate was brought about by economic recession In 1981 that affected
adversely all economic sectors in Colombia, compounded by drought conditions
that reduced generation from the hydro plants. This caused power
restrictions and brownouts in the cities. Rate increases on the order of
15-20X above the consumer price index throughout the sector in that year may
have further decreased demand. As mentioned in the Appraisal Report (see
para. 1.12), the new National Power ExpansLon Program takes account of these
factors.

During 1978-1983, gross production of electricity increased at an annual
average rate of about 7.6% compared with a GNP growth rate of 4.3%.
Meanwhile, sales increased at an annual average rate of only about 6.0%
because technical losses and energy thefts increased from 17.2% in 1978 to
22.7% in 1983. The proposed project wlll assist EEEB in reducing both the
technical losses and theft.
Sector Forecast
7.        Demand and Energy. Projected demand and energy requirements are
based on the analysis of ISA and its shareholders of past consumption and on
a study of the correlation between power sector growth and growth of GNP.
Expected growth of GNP is 1.5Z in 1984 to 5Z in 1988 and thereafter.
Projected growth of energy requirements is 6.5% over the period 1984-2000.
It takes into account the recovery of technical losses. Total projected
demand and energy requirements are:

8.        Supply. In order to meet forecast requirements, an additional
installed 4,450 MW is planned to be added by 1990 to the existing 1983
capacity of 5,049 MW. Details of the generation expansion program are shown
in Annex 1.5. The 1983-1990 balances for energy and capacity for the sector
are summarized below:

Z Thermal                            34            30           24
Because of the large percentage of hydro capacity in the system, total
effective capacity could be reduced by as,much as 20Z during dry years.
Hydroelectric generation is expected to increase its share in the total
energy production from 66% in 1983 to 83% in 1990.

BOGOTA DISTRIBUTION II PROJECT
Bank P&rticipation in the Colombia Power Sector
1.        The Bank has made 29 loans to Colombia's power sector, totalling
US$1,739 million (see Annex 1.5). Loans have assisted the expansion of
generating capacity, and transmission and distribution facilities in the
systems serving Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena, Bucaramanga and Manizales,
including expansion of electricity distribution to low income areas (874-CO,
1973; 1807-CO, 1980; and 1868-CO, 1980). The Bogota Distribution Project
(1807-CO, 1981) has been the first Bank loan to Colombia to support
exclusively distribution expansion and, in addition to other beneficiaries,
would directly benefit about 340,000 lower income consumers. In addition,
the Bank has supported rural electrification under 256-CO (1960) and 313-CO
(1962), the First aad Second Integrated Rural Development Project (1352-CO,
1977; 2174-CO, 1983), and the Village Electrification Project (1999-GO.
1983). Other recent loans have been indicated above (see Annex 1.2, item 2)
which complete the task of interconnecting the country's regional power
systems begun under 575-CO (1968), and add a total of 3,253 MW of capacity to
the national interconnected system. In additiou to coordinating a technical
assistance project to strengthen system planning, the Bank is the executing
agency for another UNDP-financed project which would enhance the sector's
construction management capability for large hydroelectric facilities
(see paras. 1.15, and 1.16). Further, in connection with Bank lending,
marginal cost tariff studies have been carried out for the major markets by
ISA's shareholders. The adoption of the results of the study into the
various tariff structures is being carried out by JNT, after the edition of
Decree No. 2545 (see Annex 5.6). Taken together, the above-mentioned
projects reflect the Bank's participation in overall power development in
Colombia, from the planning stage through financing and construction of
generation and transmission facilities, to delivery of service to the final
consumer.
2.        Previous Bank lending to Colombia's power sector has been found
generally succesful in several OED reports. For instance, the most recent
report, 'Power Interconnection (575-CO) and Chivor Hydroelectric Projects
(681-CO)" (Report No. 2720, October 29, 1979), commented upon the Bank's
participation in Colombia's effort to evolve a stronger and more efficient
power sector organization. Through the creation of ISA in conjunction with

ANNEX 1.6
Page 2 of 2
these projects, and the continuous efforts to overcome financial and
institutional difficulties, real progress was made toward more coordinated
sector development. Despite Implementation delays and increased costs, both
projects were successfully implemented. Also, the report entitled "Bank
Operations in Colombia, an Evaluation" (Report No. Z-18) of May 25, 1972,
concluded that Bank financing was successful in assisting the power companies
to develop hydroelectric plants at lower unit cost than they otherwise would
have been able to do. In turn, this permitted greater urban coverage as well
as cheaper and more reliable electricity supply to industry. The report
commended Bank efforts in the establishment of JNT and the central
interconnected system, which facilitated further power sector development.
Among other things, the report recommended that in the future the Bank pay
increased attention to the companies' financial planning, tariff structures,
distribution programs and energy losses. These points have been addressed
under the aforementioned recent loans, which have been the first Bank
operations since late 1972 because sector financial difficulties precluded
needed expansion of generation facilities in the interim. Complementary
measures to sustain investment capability, and thus ensure completion of high
priority projects in a reasonable period, and to strengthen financial
planning are in constant focus and, most recently, have been supported by the
Power Development Finance project (2401-CO, 1984).

Tariff Structure
1.       EEEB's average rate has Improved significantly in the last years,
and at the end of 1984 it was among the highest in Colombia (Col$6.17/kWh)
and very close to the medium term national average marginal cost.
Historically, it evolved (in 1983 constant US dollars) from 2.51 USc/kWh in
1976 to 5.86 USc/kWh in 1983, roughly 13Z per year. The tariff structure
however lacks appropriate balance among major categories of consusers; this
tendency has been increasing in the last 3 years and should be corrected.
These tariffs are:
Average Rate per Year          Average Annual
Increase

2.       Within the residential sector, E   has been favoring the lower
consumption classes against the higher ones: a consumer with up to 100
kWh/month paid an average Col$0.7 (UScO.9) per kWh, while a consumer with
3,000 kWh/sonth had to pay as much as Col$13.1 (USc16.5) per kWh. REED had a
total of 24 residential consumer groups at the end of 1983 (see Annex 5.1)
each with a different rate. This rate is applicable for the total
consumption range, and whenever a subscriber raises into a higher range, be
will be penalized with a higher tariff for his whole consumption. Under this
system, the lower side of the table (up to 200 kWh/nonth) had 341 of the
subscribers that were responsible for 121 of the sales but provided only 3.72
of the company's yearly income.  On the other side of the table, the higher
raking consumers (above 2,000 kWh/month) are only 0.31 of the total, but
they consumed 3.5Z of the total sales and generated 15Z of the income.

3.        In December 1983, EEEB was allowed by JNT to raise its residential
tariffs by 1.5% per month and all its other tariffs by 2.752 per month. This
will allow an average yearly increase of about 32% in 1984, well above the
actual inflation of approximately 18%. The permission to continue these
increases was granted by JNT in June 1984, and no time-limitation given at
that moment.
4.        The table in para. 1 of this Annex shows how EEEB's tariff
structure is imbalanced, where residential and block rates (to rural
municipal consumers) are significantly lower than industrial and commercial
rates, despite the lower cost of providing electricity to large consumers.
It can be noted that although all rates increased in real terms since 1976,
the distortions among categories also did. A study recently prepared by ISA
and its shareholders has determined the medium term national average marginal
costs (1983-93) for power generation, transmission and distribution. These
costs, in end-1983 prices, are:
Grid
Isolated   Supplied
Urban           Rural       Rural
Relative
US         Level        US         US

Transmission                           6.00       116          6.15
Subtransmission                        6.39       124          7.34       -
Primary distribution                   6.79       131          9.20        6.79
Secondary distribution                 7.63       148          -          7.90
Downtown primary distribution          6.87       133                      -
Downtown secondary distribution        8.93       173
A comparison of EEEB's average rates and the above marginal cost allows for
some broad conclusions:
(i) block supplies to municipalities, which are at the level of
transmission and subtranamission (average marginal cost some 6.2
USc!kWh) at a revenue of 2.8 USc/kWh have an average level of about
45% of the national marginal cost;
(ii) industry, similarly connected to transmission and subtransmission
lines at a revenue of 7.7 USc/kWlT are already 13% above the
national marginal cost;
(iii) commercial consumers averaging an estimated marginal cost between
USc7.6 and USc8.9 per kWh; the actual tariff is 29% above the
higher of these figures; and
(iv)  residential supply on average collects 3.5 USc/kWh, compared with a
marginal cost in the order of 9 USc/kWh the average revenue level;
in this case is about 39% of the national marginal cost.

5.        The Government has issued on October 12, 1984 Decree No. 2545 which
establishes a new and nationally valid tariff structure. The existing
system, it was recognized, lacks consistency and has no homogeneous basis.
This new decree, though legally in force, will be put into practice
gradually, according to the particular condition of each utility. Its main
provision and innovations are as follows:
(a) Consumers are divided into residential and non-residential.
(b) Residential consumers are to be charged a fixed basic tariff plus a
variable tariff based on their actual consumption. The basic
tariff has 6 levels, according to the classification of the
residential district. The variable portion is based on 5
consumption blocks:
No.                         Range (kWh/month)
1                              0-200
2                              201-400
3                              401-800
4                              801-1600
5                      above   1600
(c) Tariffs are to be applied by block, i.e., there will be 5 different
tariffs and consumers will be billed accordingly.
(d) Non-residential consumers are divided according to their voltage
level into:
(i) high-voltage (above 110 kV);
(ii) medium-voltage (between 11.4 kV and 110 kV); and
(iii) low-voltage (below 11.4 kV).
These consumers will have a consumption based tariff and a demand charge if
applicable; a monthly minimum charge is pxyable for each consumer class.
(e) Connection charges higher than the installation (including
metering) cost are not allowed. The present procedure is to be
reviewed and changed.
(f) Maximum tariff levels will be established by JNT for each company.
These tariffs will take into consideration the marginal cost
principle of generating, transmitting and distributing power in its
system. These levels will be periodically adjusted, employing a
-national power service cost indexw or another index that takes
accontnt of internal and external inflation.
6.        Taking into consideration the existing discrepancies of EEEB's
tariffs and the existence of the new decree, EEEB sbould as soon as possible
comply with it and change their tariff structure.
