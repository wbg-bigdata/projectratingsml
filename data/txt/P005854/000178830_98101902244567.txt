INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMIENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECODIUENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVF DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YFEN
FOR AN ADEN PORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), for
the equivalent of US$3.2 million on standard terms, to help finance an Aden
Port Rehabilitation Project. The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Develop-
ment (Arab Fund) participating in the financing of the project with a loan
of $13.6 million equivalent, for a term of 20 years, including 3 years of
grace with interest at 4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONnOMy
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen" (189n-YDR), dated November 7, 1973,
was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 15, 1973 (R73-262).
A small mission visited the country in February 1975 and its findings are
reflected below. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        PDRY became independent in 1967.   Building effective Government
administration in and outside Aden then became an immediate need. With a
sudden loss of expatriate administrators, and the subsequent emigration
(mainly to YAR) of a number of educated Yemenis following internal political
struggles, this was a difficult task in the short-term. However, consider-
able progress has been made in recent years. Government policies give a
leading role to the public sector. Nationalization of the banking and in-
surance sectors, of port services, of virtually all petroleum distribution,
and of office and residential buildings, combined with the establishnment of
state trading companies, brought almost all service activities into the
ptublic sector. Agrarian reform has also been introduced.
4.        Political and social change since independence coincided with an
economic recession.   The withdrawal of Britishi forces in 1967 and the closure
of the Suez Canal in the same year, left the modern service-oriented economy
in and around Adeni withl an approximately 30 percent smaller regional income
and roughly 20,000 people without employment.    Total GDP dropped by perhaps
20 percent between 1966 and 1968 and virtually stagnated in subsequent years.
Ilowever, agriculture, the subsistence mainstay for over two-thirds of PDRY's
estimated population of 1.6 million, was little affected.    CNP per capita
was probably about $100 in 1972.
5.        In the face of these difficulties, fiscal performance has been
remarkable. Budgetary policies have been effective. Revenue increased from
$15 million in 1968/69 to an average of $36 million in 1971/72 and 1972/73,



- 2 -
following new taxes. Severe measures were taken to reduce expenditures, part-
ly through heavy salary cuts imposed on the- civil service and the armed and
security forces. In recent years, however, the need for expansion of educa-
tion, health, social services and government administration outside Aden has
absorbed the rise in revenues; as a result, budget deficits have been widen-
ing. The budgetary deficit averaged about S9 million in 1969/70-1971/72 and
about $26 million in 1972/73-1974/75.
6.        The cessation of British budgetary grants and the withdrawal of the
British forces immediately following the coUntry's independence in 1967 put
the balance of payments under severe pressure. This pressure was subsequently
reduced by the substantial inflow of transfers from Yemenis working abroad,
some foreign aid, stringent import control measures, and the establishment of
small import substitution industries. However, the rise in oil prices and the
international inflation which affected the prices of imports in the last two
years have resulted in a worsening of the balance of payments. The current
account deficit for 1974 is estimated at $89 million, compared to $52 million
in 1973 and $29 million in 1972. Net inflows of non--monetary capital of about
$35 million and the utilization of the IMF Oil Facility could not fully offset
the current account deficit, and net foreign assets of about $73 million at
the end of 1973 declined by an estimated $33 million in 1974.
7.        With its heavy dependence on imports, PDRY's economic difficulties
have been accentuated since 1973 by the rise in international prices, parti-
cularly of imported fuels and foodstuffs. Thev have increased domestic in-
flationarv pressures, worsenedi the budgetary situation because of the in-
crease in subsidies for some mass consumption items and affected unfavorably
the feasibility of implementing essential development projects, as their for-
eign exchange costs increased sharply. Domestic prices rose 25 percent in
1974, compared with 16 percent in 1973 and 5 percent annually in previous
years. PDRY's net imports of petroleum were estimated to have increased to
about $33 million in 1974 frort $9 million in 1973, despite the Government's
effort to keep the volume of imports in 1974 at the same level as in the pre-
vious year. Measures to curb demand included increases in gasoline prices,
higher power rates and cutbacks in power supplies. The PDRY has been included
in the list of Most Seriously Affected Countries and received from the IMF an
Oil Credit Facility of $11 million in 1974. OAPEC also provided another $11
million to finance oil imports.
8.        To lessen the country's dependence on the service sectors, the
Government has been making serious efforts to diversify the economy. In
view of the scarcity of known natural resources and inadequate infrastructure,
particularly roads, the process has been both slow and difficult. Agriculture,
includiing the fisheries sub-sector, is one of the few areas which offer devel-
opment opportunities. There is also scope for small-scale industrial activity,
which would help broaden the productive sector of PDRY's economy and reduce
unemployment in urban areas.
9.        PDRY's first Three-Year Development Plan (1971/73-1973/74) and its
current Five-Year Plan (1974/7'i-1978/79) seek to expand agricultural produc--
tion (including fisheries) and establish light industr-ies using local raw



- 3 -
materials. The Five-Year Plan allocates almost 40 percent of the total Plan
investment of $219 million for agricultural and fisheries development. It
also envisages the construction of roads to connect the various governorates
with Aden, as well as to link towns in the hinterland; about 21 percent has
been allocated for road construction. About 19 percent of planned capital
outlays are allocated to education, health and housing, 9 percent to public
utilities and 5 percent to industry. In view of the fiscal constraints and
rapid price changes, the Government has adopted a system of annual plans to
ensure flexibility in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan. The revised
allocation for the year 1974/75 is $80 million, i.e., about $26 million high-
er than what was envisaged in the Five-Year Plan. This increase reflects
partly the rise in cost, but largely the inclusion of externally financed,
short gestation period projects in fisheries and agriculture.
10.       Since domestic financial, as well as managerial and technical, re-
sources are extremely limited, much of the public investment has in the past
been financed and implemented with foreign assistance. The Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development is engaged in financing a project to increase pro-
duction, especially of cotton, in the Abyan Delta. The Arab Fund for Social
and Economic Development is also financing a fish processing project in Al
Mukalla. The People's Republic of China is constructing the Am Ayn-Mukalla
road, to be completed in 1977. The USSR has financed major irrigation works
in the Wadi Tuban area. A textile factory has just been completed with Chinese
assistance and a flour mill with East German help. Oil exploration with the
collaboration of the Algerian company SONATPACH, and mineral exploration with
help from the USSR, are underway. Serious efforts lhave been recently made to
promote oil and mineral exploration by American and other Western oil compa-
nies. About 54 percent of the investment under the current Five-Year Plan
is to be financed by foreign sources. PDRY has recently launched a number of
initiatives to mobilize these resources. Socialist countries, notably the
People's Republic of China and the USSR, are being urged to step up project
support. Efforts have also been intensified to obtain aid from Western
Europe and Arab oil-producing countries under what is officially termed "the
new outlook" in PDRY's foreign relations. Diplomatic relations with the
Federal Republic of Germany, severed during the 1967 Middle East war, have
been resumed recently, and contacts have been made with Saudi Arabia and other
Arab oil-producing countries in the Gulf. However, these efforts are likely
to produce significant results only over time. Meanwhile, PDRY continues to
depend heavily on the aid flows provided by socialist countries and the Asso-
ciation.
11.       The rate of implementation of the first Three-Year Plan was slow.
Only 52 percent of the planned amount was actually spent. The lag in imple-
mentation reflected difficulties in project preparation and in negotiations
with bilateral aid donors, as well as scarcities of local skills for efficient
project execution. These difficulties are likely to be reduced only gradually.
12.       In the last two years, the Government intensified its development
efforts with emphasis on quick yielding projects. Investment in 1973/74 rose



to $30 million, and investment allocatior For 1974/75 was increased to $80
million, partlv to offset price rises.    These expenditures stimulated the
economv, created new capacitv and increase, value added.     In fisheries, the
most dvnamic sector, output has expanded and its qtiality has improved, and
the future is promising as a number of prolects (e.g., two fishmeal projects)
have heen recentl completed.    Agricultuire has benefited from the expansion
of the road network, completion of several projects to increase cultivated
and irrigated areas, intensification of cropping pattern, and improvement of
seed varieties.   In industry, 13 new, mostly import-substituting factories
have been established (e.g.., textile, plastic wares, aluminum housewares).
13.       The authorities expect that in 1975/76 there will be a noticeable
pickup in economic activity with GDP increasing by about 5 percent in real
terms.  The increase in traffic in Aden Port as a. result of the reopening of
the Suez! Canal is expected to give considera-bhle boost to the BP refinerv,
wqhiclh accounts for 2/3 of industrial outpit in PDRY, and wlhich has been operat-
ing far below capacity largely due to deprossed activitv in Aden Port.      How-
ever, the balance of payments situation In 1075 would continue to be difficult.
A current account deficit of about $100 million is anticipated.      On the basis
of the current level of foreign assistance, the expected level of capital
inflow will not be sufficient to offset the projected current account deficit.
Consequently, a further decline in the official foreign reserves is expected,
after taking into account PDRY's recent drawing of SDR 7.2 million ($8.7 mil-
lion equivalent) from an IMF credit tranche and expected drawing on the IMIF
oil facility.
14.       PDRY's total external debt at the end of 1974 was about $94 million
of which $81 million was disbursed. In addition about $155 million are in-
cluded in bilateral frame agreements but were not yet committed. All aid to
PDRY has been extended on concessionary terms and the debt service ratio on
bilateral and multilateral debt is estimated to be less than 8 percent. About
two thirds of foreign assistance was provided in the form of capital goods for
specific projects. It is evident that in view of the extremely limited re-
sources of the country, low per capita income, and the severe constraints on
the Government budget and the balance of payments, Bank Group assistance to
PDRY should continue to be on IDA terms. For the same reason local cost
financing by IDA credits would be justified.
15.        In 1969, under the Nationalization Law No. 37, the Government na-
tionalized most of the foreign-owned enterprises except the refinery (mainly
banks, insurance companies and port services). This Law provided for compen-
sation in the form of 20-year Government bonds bearing interest of 2 percent.
TAenty-five percent of the net annual profits of all these nationalized com-
panies were to be used for servicing these bonds. In response, some of the
foreign banks which were nationalized froze substantial Yemeni deposits which
tlhey had transferred abroad.   Immediately after the promulgation of Law No. 37,
the Government appointed a British firm of accountants of international repute
to audit the accounts of all tlhe nationalized companies and evaluate their
assets. The audit report was submitted to the Government in September 1971.
Settlements have since been reached with three of the foreign banks involved.
Some claimants have not found the conditions offered by the Government to be
satisfactory, and yet others have made no response to the Government's efforts



- 5 -
to settle all claims. Nevertheless, the Government: is continuing its efforts
to reach a mutually satisfactory solution with all claimant companies. It
has offered to negotiate with the governments of the companies concerned on
the understanding that all claims on and of the Government on these companies
are settled once and for all. It has also .-xpressed its willingness to con-
sider such settlement outside the terms of t'he 1969 Nationalization Law.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       The proposed credit will be the Association's sixth operation in
PDRY, bringing the total IDA commitments to $30.8 million. PDRY joined the
Bank in 1969 and IDA in 1970. Assistance to PDRY commenced in 1971, under
the First HIighway Project ($1.6 million) which provided funds for feasibility
studies and detailed engineering, some maintenance equipment and technical
assistance to the Ministry of Public W4orks. A Highway Engineering Credit
($0.6 million) in 1972 financed an extension of the technical assistance and
the detailed engineering of additional roads, and was later refinanced under
the Second Highway Project.   The Fisheries Project: ($3.5 million) in 1973 and
the Education Project ($5.4 million) in 1974 were the Association's first
investment projects in PDRY. A Supplementary Credit ($1.6 million) for the
Fisheries Project to help finance anticipated cost overruns was approved by
the Executive Directors in January 1975. Subsequently, a credit for a Second
Highway Project ($15.5 million), which includes construction of 358 km of
road prepared under the First Highway Project and the Highway Engineering
credit, was approved in May 1975. Annex II contains a summary statement of
IDA credits as of June 30, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       The Association's program in PDRY aims mainly at supporting the Gov-
ernment's long-range economic objective of broadening the base of the service-
oriented and geographically limited economv in and around Aden, by developing
the productive potentials of the other parts of the country. Thus, efforts
have been directed towards projects iin the transport sector, which would not
only help to integrate the disparate regions of PDRY, but more importantly,
link production areas with the main markets. Other sectors where the Associa-
tion has assisted and is expected to continue to assist, are in the fields of
human resource development and the exploitation of the country's agricultural
potential, including the key fisheries subsector. With this Aden Port Rehabil-
itation Project, the Association will help PDRY to take advantage of the oppor-
tunities offered by the reopening of the Suez Canal. The project is expected
to benefit the economy in the short- and medium-term by providing additional
employment and badly needed foreign exchange earnings, which dropped substan-
tially after the Suez Canal closed in 1967. Technical assistance and insti-
tution-building will continue to be an integral feature in the Association's
projects in PDRY.
18.       As regards future operations, the Association has already appraised
an agricultural project in the Wadi H-ladramaut region prepared by the FAO-IBRD
Cooperative Program. This project could be readv for presentation to the
Executive Directors in the first half of FY76. A second fisheries project



- 6 -
in a less-developed region of ?DRY, is bein,; studied for possible lending in
future years. Since the costs of these projects are likely to be substantial-
ly over the amounts that the Association can provide to PDRY, efforts will be
continued to encourage Arab and other donor agencies to join the Association
in their financing, as was done in the Second Highway project and in this
Port project. In this way IDA projects would act as a catalyst for increasing
the inflow of development aid to this county-. PDRY is not a member of IFC.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR A>.D THIE PORTS SUBSECTOR
Background
19.       Ws'hen PDRY became independent in 1967, the transport system consist-
ed of a well-developed port in Aden, a few good roads around the capital and
limited connections by coastal shipping and air to the other centers of popu-
lation and economic activity, which are scattered along the country's long
coastline and in a few fertile--but remote--areas. The Government regards
the provision of an efficient country-wide land transport system as essential
to its efforts for national and economic integration of the country. A start
in building up such a system was made durinp the Three-Year Plan (FY1971/72-
1973/74), and efforts are continuing under the current Five-Year Plan (1974/75-
1978/79). In line with this strategy of the Government, the Association's
previous transport projects were for highways which are the principal mode of
internal communication in PDRY. These projects address the institutional and
staffing needs of this subsector, help in the improvement of road maintenance
and in the planning, preparation and implementation of extensions of the road
network.
20.       Historically, the port of Aden has been one of the country's most
important sources of foreign exchange and employment, and the economic act-
ivity generated by it dominated the economy prior to 1967. Located at the
southern entrance to the Red Sea adjacent to the main shipping lane from
Europe, through the Suez Canal, to Asia and further to the Pacific, Aden, with
30 berths and over 6,000 ship calls per year, had in the mid sixties developed
into one of the world's largest bunkering and entrepot ports. The closure of
the Suez Canal, which coincided with the country's independence, left this
huge asset largely unused, serving only a small amount of remaining bunkering
traffic, reduced volumes of domestic imports and exports, and some cargo
through-traffic to North Yemen, in all only about one-fifth of the previous
traffic level. Outside Aden, there are several cabotage ports along the coast,
the largest of which in Mukalla has regular service. Most of these ports
onlv consist of open beaches from which cargo is lightered to occasionally
visiting ships.
21.       The Government's Five--Year Development Plan did not foresee any
major capital outlays in Aden Port, but provided for some investment in the
coastal ports to support the growth of the local fishing industry.    Vhen the



-7-
prospects for the reopening of the Suez Canal improved, the Government and
the Association discussed the best course of action to prepare Aden Port for
resumed Suez Canal traffic and a two-pronged strategy was adopted, consisting
of (i) a port rehabilitation project which would enable the port to provide
essential services to ships during the initial years after the reopening of
the canal and thus to reestablish relationships with the shipping companies
from the outset; and (ii) a broadly based port development study which would
review port organization and operations and determine investment requirements
in the long-term. With financial support by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Econo-
mic Development, the port development study was comnenced by consultants
(Coode and Partners, U.K.) in February 1975, in accordance with terms of re-
ference to which the Association contributed. As noted below, many of the
study's recommendations will be implemented under the proposed project.
Prospects
22.       Provided Aden is adequately equipped, it is once more likely to at-
tract a substantial proportion of Suez Canal traffic for bunkering and other
port services, since it still has substantial advantages over the neighboring
ports of Djibouti, Hodeidah, Assab and Jeddah, and the Suez Canal ports. In
none of these competing ports has bunkering capacity increased since 1967,
and most of them have higher port charges than Aden or suffer from congestion
due to heavy import/export movements resulting in long waiting times for bunk-
ering. Dry cargo movements in Aden are unlikely to increase dramatically
from their present low level and the port can therefore concentrate on the
bunkering services and should be able to recapture its historic share of
about two-thirds of this market in the region. Although average ship size
has increased since 1967 and the larger ships have become more independent
of service calls enroute, a significant number of ships remains that will
make stops for bunkering and other services. On the basis of available
traffic and voyage cost data particularly those developed in connection with
the Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project in Egypt (Ln. 1064-EGT) and the above
assessment of Aden's competitive position, it seems likely that Aden will
receive all passenger vessels and virtually all vessels of less than 8,000
NRT that will transit through the Suez Canal, but only about 10 percent of
the larger tramps, liners and bulk carriers. On this basis, the total number
of ships in Aden would increase to about 5,500 per year in 1979, compared
with about 1,300 in 1973.
Organization
23.       Bunkering services for ships in Aden are provided by four interna-
tional oil companies and a Yemeni-Kuwaiti joint venture. These companies have
long-term leases for jetties, berths and oLher port facilities, but own tanks,
pumps, pipelines, barges and equipment. The facilities have been well main-
tained by the oil companies since the closure of the Suez Canal and their
capacity is sufficient to handle forecast traffic.



- 8 -
24.       The Yemen Ports and Shipping Corporation (YPSC), under law 19 of
1973, is responsible for all ports and shipping activities in PDRY, including
Aden. It is a corporate body with financial and administrative autonomy, con-
trolled by a Board whose present chairman is the Minister of Communications
and which includes the Directors General of YPSC's four operational units as
members. The operational units, over which YPSC exercises policy and budget-
ary control, but which have freedom in their day to day operations, are the
Port of Aden Authority (PAA), the National Shipping Company (NSC), the Nation-
al Dockyard Company (NDC) and the Aden Coasters Company. The assets of NSC
and NDC were among those nationalized by the Government in 1971 under Law No.
37 of 1969 (para 15). YPSC was established only in 1973 and does not yet have
a full complement of management staff. To fulfil its tasks, it still relies
largely on the senior personnel of the previously independent working units,
some of whom it has taken over to the benefit of the port as a wqhole. In
view of the expanded port activities, some areas of YPSC responsibility re-
quire urgent attention. Appointment of a managing director in YPSC is re-
quired to ensure efficient coordination of the daily work of the operational
units, and a planner will have to be added to YPSC staff to provide for ade-
quate corporate planning at YPSC. The Government has agreed to establish the
positions for and appoint the managing director and the planner, prior to
credit effectiveness (Section 6.01(d), draft Credit Agreement). To oversee
the formulation, and later, the implementation of the staff training program
which is being developed as part of the port development study (para. 21), a
training adviser will be appointed to the staff of the YPSC. Provision for
such an expert has been made ur.der the project. In addition, the Government
has agreed that YPSC will retain appropriate arrangements for ready access
to legal advice (Section 3.02 and Schedule 2, draft Credit Agreement; and
Section 2.02, draft Project Agreement).
25.       The PAA operates and maintains berths, sheds, buoys, and other
equipment required for the control and handling of ships in the harbor. It
provides pilotage services and is responsible for safe navigation and use of
the port. The NSC is responsible for all ship agency work, supplying all
services to ships except fuel bunkers (handled by oil companies with facili-
ties in the port area), and for all cargo handling on board ship and on shore.
To carry out these functions, NSC owns and maintains a fleet of tugs, launches,
cargo lighters and water barges. For the time being NSC manages the Aden
Coasters Company as a subsidiary. The NDC offers ship and machine repair
services in a heavy machine shop equipped with a large! broadside slipway.
The operational units are in general well-organized and operate efficiently.
However, economies could be achieved by redefining the responsibility for
cargo handling, which at present is divided between PAA and NSC and by central-
izing equipment maintenance anci repair work, currently being carried out
separately in each operational unit. Appropriate measures to this end will
be recommended in the port development study. YPSC has agreed that it will,
in agreement with the Association, make arrangements for the consolidation of
cargo handling facilities and operations in PAA or another entity of YPSC,
and implement procedures to ensure the rationalization of workshop activities
(Sections 2.06(i) and 2.07, draft Project Agreement).



- 9 -
26.       To cope with increased port activities, all operational units nieed
strengthening.  Although in the light of PIPIY's overall fiscal and personnel
constraints, the units are relatively well staffed, most of the technical
and administrative personnel is young and, while energetic, is lacking the
experience to handle the volume of work that can be expected with the re-
surgence in port traffic. To meet the staffing requirements in the short-
term, the Government has secured substantial commitments for technical assist-
ance from Egypt, India, German Democratic Republic and USSR. Complementary
to this, a small technical assistance element is included in the proposed
project (para. 32). Most of the foreign experts will be employed in executive
positions and, with the above strengthening of YPSC management, the ports or-
ganization will be able to use their services efficiently. For the long run
a training program, related to the work load and staffing needs of each unit,
is being developed as part of the port development study. Adequate training
opportunities exist both from bilateral and multilateral sources. Equipment
and facilities of all units are generally well maintained. However, much of
the equipment is over-aged and substantial investment for replacement and ad-
ditional equipment is required for all units to enable them to serve increas-
ed traffic. Productivity of labor is generally satisfactory and with a view
to further improvement, the Government is currently considering introducing a
bonus system. However, different payment systems are presently used for car-
go handling labor. YPSC agreed to establish a system of payment on a common
basis for both ship gangs (currently paid on an hourly basis) and shore gangs
(currently paid piece rates) (Section 2.06 (ii), draft Project Agreement).
Finances
27.       The YPSC Board defines financial policy for all operational units.
YPSC has the legal obligation to establish charges and tariffs for all port
services after consent of the Minister of Communications. Annual budgets are
prepared by each unit and monthly, quarterly and semi-annual reports measure
progress against the budgets. However, financial measures are not used to
monitor the efficiency of the units. A committee exists to introduce a
commercial-type accounting system in PAA which already has been adopted by
NSC and NDC. YPSC confirmed that it will establish a management accounting
system for PAA which will be compatible with those used in other YPSC units
(Section 4.07, draft Project Agreement).
28.       The NDC and the NSC have operated profitably since their formation
in 1969. PAA made profits in most years with the exception of 1968 following
the closure of the Suez Canal. An overall current assets to current liabili-
ties ratio for the 3 units together of 3.5 and satisfactory liquidity of each
unit are a good achievement, in view of PDRY's economic difficulties, and in-
dicate the effectiveness of the budgetary control over expenses. The NDC has
debts amounting to 32 percent of invested capital, the other two units being
debt free. Fixed assets accounts do not present the value of assets using
cost-based depreciation and a meaningful statement on the financial return
on the assets of YPSC and its subunits is therefore not possible. A revalua-
tion of assets at replacement cost is being carried out as part of the port
development study and would be followed by a detailed revaluation by YPSC



- 10 -
with thie assistance of experts provided under the project. YPSC has agreed
that further revaluations of assets will be carried out from time to time for
the purpose of adjustment of tariffs in the future. YPSC also agreed that
it will appoint independent auditors to review its accounts and will establish
asset-based indicators of financial efficiency (Sections 4.02, 4.03 and 4.04,
draft Project Agreement).
Tariffs
29.       Tariffs and rates of port services offered by the YPSC units have
not been revised for many years and no cost information exists to judge their
adequacy. The port development study will recommend a suitable tariff stra-
tegy to maximize foreign exchange earnings to PDRY by determining minimum
tariff levels required to cover the costs of particular services and maximum
levels from a comparison of tariffs for similar services in competing ports
in the region. The Government and YPSC agreed on the principles of this
strategy, and undertook to review with the Association the tariff recommenda-
tions of the study and agree on bases and levels of revised tariffs and have
also agreed to implement these revised tariffs by February 29, 1976. The
Government and YPSC will carry out tariff reviews once the detailed revalua-
tion of YPSC assets is completed and thereafter revise tariffs periodically
as necessary (Section 4.01, draft Credit Agreement; and Section 4.05, draft
Project Agreement). Technical assistance in cost accounting is provided under
the project to produce the necessary cost data for tariff-setting on a con-
tinuing basis (Schedule 2, draft Credit Agreement; and Section 2.02, draft
Project Agreement).
PART IV - TIIE PROJECT
Project History
30.       The project was identified during a mission which visited Aden in
May 1974 and further prepared by staff of the Ministry of Communications and
YPSC for appraisal in November/December 1974. An Arab Fund mission, joined
by an IDA staff member, visited Aden in Mav 1975 and collected additional
information.  Credit negotiations were held in Washington in July 1975.
PDRY's negotiating delegation was headed by M1r. Yousuf Ali, Acting Director
General of YPSC and included representatives of the Ministries of Planning
and Transport and Communications, Messrs. 11ubaishi and Al-Kathiri. The Arab
Fund negotiated its loan with the Government in Kuwait, immediately prior to
IDA's negotiations. An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Aden Port
Rehabilitation Project" (No. 761a-YDR), dated August 4, 1975 is being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately. A Credit: and Project Summary is
attached as Annex III.
Project Description
31.       The project provides for (i) floating equipment for PAA, NDC and
NSC; (ii) cargo handling equipment for PAA and NDC; (iii) workshop equipment



- 11 -
and spare parts for all units; (iv) diving equipment for PAA and NDC: (v)
navigation equipment for PAA; (vi) technical assistance to YPSC, PAA and NDC;
and (vii) dredging of several lenses (mounds) in the main harbor (PAA). The
exact scope of the dredging works to be carried out under the project will be
determined in the port development study and, if required, further studies by
YPSC.
32.       The project will assist in the rehabilitation of the port of Aden
to enable it to resume safe and adequate servicing for the initial increase
in shipping traffic following the reopening of the Suez Canal. Most of the
increase in traffic will be for bunkering and servicing. However, improve-
ments in presently inefficient ship loading and unloading operations are re-
quired to avoid their becoming a bottleneck for the primary bunkering trade.
Most of the equipment provided under the project is for the replacement of
overaged and non-repairable items. The evaluation of floating craft require-
ments for ship handling is based on the procedures and efficiency level of
1966 as applied to the traffic forecast. The technical assistance under the
project is complementary to expert services obtained by the Government from
bilateral sources, and is required for the implementation of this project and
of key recommendations of the Port Developnient Study. It consists of a pro-
curement expert, a training advisor, and two asset evaluation experts for
YPSC, a cost accountant for PAA, and a cost accountant and a naval architect
for NDC, totalling 138 man-months. The dredging would remove existing lenses
from the bottom of the harbor channel and make Aden port safe for all ships
that can pass through the Suez canal (38 ft.).
Project Cost and Financing
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $17.6 million, of
which the foreign exchange component would be $16.8 million (96 percent).
The foreign exchange cost of the project would be financed by the proposed
credit of $3.2 million and a loan of $13.6 million equivalent to be provided
by the Arab Fund. The Arab Fund loan would be for a term of 20 years, includ-
ing 3 years of grace and bear interest at 4 percent per annum. The conclusion
of the loan agreement between PDRY and the Arab Fund will be an additional
condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit (Section 6.01 (c), draft
Credit Agreement). Both the IDA credit and the Arab Fund loan would be to the
Government of PDPY which will relend the funds to YPSC under a single subsi-
diary loan agreement (Section 6.01 (b), draft Credit Agreement). The terms
and conditions of the subsidiary loan have been agreed with the Arab Fund,
the Government and YPSC at 15 years, corresponding to the life of the assets
financed, including 2 years of grace, with interest at 10 percent p.a. (Sec-
tion 3.01 (b), draft Credit Agreement). YPSC will contribute $0.8 million
equivalent from its reserves to finance the local costs of the project.
34.       A financing plan has been discussed and agreed with the Arab Fund
and the Government, according to which the Arab Fund would finance the foreign
cost of most of the floating equipment, of all workshop equipment and civil
works; IDA would finance the foreign cost of all remaining project items.



- 1 2 -
Arrangements for project administration andl coordination will be agreed with
the Arab Fund.
Project Execution
35.       The project will be carried out by the YPSC which will be assisted
in the preparation of tender documents and in the tender evaluation by a
procurement expert provided under the project. To enable prompt preparation
of the tender documents, the Government plans to enter into a contract with
a consulting firm for the procurement expert in early August and retroactive
financing for this purpose up to an amount of $25,000 for expenditures incur-
red after August 1, 1975 is recommended. Procurement is expected to be com-
pleted by December 1977.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Procurement of the equipment items financed by IDA, with the ex-
ception of small items (estimated to cost less than $10,000) of diving and
navigation equipment, will be through international competitive bidding in
accordance with thie Bank Group's procurement guidelinesj procurement of the
equipment financed by the Arab Fund will be through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Arab Fund procedtures.
37.       Disbursements from the credit account will be made on the basis of
100 percent of the cif cost of equipment and of 100 percent of the foreign
exchange costs of technical assistance. A projected disbursement schedule is
given in Annex III.
Financial Forecast
38.       PAA, NDC and NSC together are expected to show a profit in all years
except 1976, even without an increase in tariffs; the loss in 1976 would be
due mainly to the impact of additional staffing costs and debt and capital
charges prior to the build-up In Suez canal traffic in Aden. Individually,
both NSC and NDC are expected to continue operating profitably. PAA would
initially operate at a loss, but still generate sufficient cash to meet debt
repayment requirements without a tariff increase.
39.       It is conservatively estimated that YPSC could increase its net
cash position by YD 6.1 million (US$17.7 million equivalent) over the period
1975 to 1981 after meeting debt obligations (but before any capital expendi-
tures subsequent to this project, and before application of the Government's
profits distribution law No. 11 of 1973). To ensure that YPSC as a whole
remains financially viable:   (i) the Government has agreed that it will take
all necessary action required to enable YPSC to retain net disposable re-
sources of at least 1.5 times its maximum debt service requirements; (ii)
YPSC has agreed to obtain the Association's agreement before it incurs new
debt if net revenues are less than 1.5 times the resulting maximum debt serv-
vice requirements, and that all units of YPSC will have an adequate risk in-
surance (Section 4.02, draft Credit Agreement and Sections 3.01 and 4.06,
draft Project Agreement).



Economic Justification
40.       Within its overall strategy to diversify the economy, the Govern-
ment seeks to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the reopening of
the Suez Canal for the Port of Aden to earn vital foreign exchange and gen-
erate employment. The project will relhabilitate key elements of Aden port
which, in addition to its good location, had made it attractive to internation-
al shipowners prior to the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967. The equipment
provided under the project in conjunction with the technical assistance ob-
tained from bilateral sources will ensure that the use of the port is both
safe and quick and that a complete line of ship services, including bunkering
and ship and machinery repair and maintenance can be offered. Since without
this essential rehabilitation, ships are unlikely to return to Aden, the fore-
cast increase in YPSC net revenues before tax, which has been forecast con-
servatively, has been taken as a measure of the economic benefits attributable
to the project investment. On this basis, the economic rate of return over
an average 15 year economic life of the investment would be well above 25
percent.
41.       In addition to the direct benefits, the project is expected to
stimulate economic activity in the country In general. The overall impact of
the resurgence of port traffic on the economy is difficult to estimate and
lack of data makes the accurate quantification of total benefits of this
project to PDRY impossible, but they can be expected to substantially exceed
the direct benefits of the increased YPSC revenue. With the bunkering require-
ments well taken care of by the BP refinery and other oil companies, the
Government's efforts are concentrating on making adequate arrangements for
providing ship supplies. Initially much of these supplies will have to be
imported from abroad, but as state farms and agricultural cooperatives become
capable over time of producing goods of the quality and in the quantities
required, the domestic content of the supplies should increase. Also, partly
prompted by the resumption of Suez Canal traffic, the Government has embarked
on various service sector projects in the Aden area, which together with the
increased labor demand of the port should result in reemployment of a signifi-
cant proportion of the 20,000 persons who lost their jobs in 1967 (para. 4).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANI) AUTHORITY
42.       The drafts of the Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Association, and of the Project Agreement
between the YPSC and the Association, the Reconmendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of the resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
43.       Features of special interest are described in paragraphs 24 through
29, 33, and 39 of this Report are reflected respectively in Sections 2.05,
2.06, 4.07, 4.03, 4.02, 4.04, 4.05 and 4.06 of the draft Project Agreement,
Section 4.02(a) of the draft Credit Agreement, and Section 3.01 of the draft
Project Agreement.



- 14 -
44.       Additional conditions of effectiveness are that a managing-director
and planner be appointed by YPSC and that the Loan Agreement between the Arab
Fund and PDRY has been concluded (Sections 6.01(c) and (d) of the draft Credit
Agreement).
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOIENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

Cr. No. 240-YDR - Highway Project; US$1.6 i'iillion Credit of April 21, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976
This project consists of (a) feasibility studies of selected roads;
(b) detailed engineering of about 240 km. of roads; (c) highway workshop and
communications equipment and spare parts for existing highway maintenance and
workshop equipment; (d) provision of technical assistance team to advise and
assist in improving the organization, operations and methods of the Public
Works Department (PWD); and (e) overseas fellowships for PWD local staff.
Technical assistance by consultants and overseas staff training was financed
by UNDP with the Association acting as Executing Agency. The consultants'
services, the staff training and the feasibility studies have been satis-
factorily completed. Delays have occurred in equipment procurement, largely
due to the Government's cumbersome purchasing system. To allow full utiliza-
tion of credit funds, the original closing date of June 30, 1974 has been
postponed to March 31, 1975. Spares for road maintenance equipment have been
delivered; the workshop equipment has been ordered and is being delivered.
However, since not all items arrived in time, the Association agreed to a
further extension of the closing date to March 31, 1976.
Cr. No. S-12-YDR - Highway Engineering Project: US$0.6 Million Credit of
November 17, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
This engineering credit was provided to help finance (a) detailed
engineering of about 110 km of roads, review and amend existing detailed
engineering of about 35 km; and (b) extension of technical assistance which
already started under the previous project. The detailed engineering has
been satisfactorily completed. The original closing date of June 30, 1974
was postponed to March 31, 1975, to accommodate a further extension of tech-
nical assistance by consultants to the Public Works Department. The credit
has been fully disbursed and the credit account was closed as of March 31,
1975. Refinancing of this credit is provided under the Second Highway Project
Credit 560-YDR.
Cr. No. 370-YDR - Fisheries Project: US$3.5 Million Credit of April 12,
1973 and $1.6 Million Supplementary Credit of February 6, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Due to delays in finding a suitable Project Manager, the original
credit became effective only on February 12, 1974. Since then, project
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular, to report
on problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

implementation on the whole is proceeding satisfactorily. A supervision
mission in June 1974 reported that price and physical contingencies included
in the project were insufficient to cover increases in project cost, which
were mainly due to both foreign and domestic inflation. Since the scope
of the project could not reasonably be reduced and no other sources of fi-
nancing were available, the Association agreed to a supplementary credit of
$1.6 million to cover the increased foreign cost of the project. This sup-
plementary credit became effective on April 29, 1975. Bids for the shore
facilities in Al Mukalla and Ash Shihr were due on February 14, 1975, but no
bids were received. The design consultants investigated the reasons and their
proposals for modified procurement procedures were discussed during a supervi-
sion mission in March 1975. As a result, the Association agreed that the
original turnkey contract be split into several smaller contracts, of which
the larger ones would be tendered internationally. The Government's Public
Corporation for Fish Wealth, which is the main beneficiary of the project,
with the assistance of the consultants, assumed the overall responsibility
for supervision and coordination of these contracts.
Cr. No. 494-YDR - Education Project; US$5.4 Million of July 12, 1974:
Closing Date: September 30, 1979
This credit, which will assist the Government in making qualita-
tive improvenients in the educational system and to meet priority manpower
needs, became effective on February 5, 1975, after slight delays in setting
up the project unit. Project implementation has now commenced.
Cr. No. 560-YDR - Second Highway Project:   US$15.5 Million Credit of June 20
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1980
This project, which will be financed jointly with the Kuwait Fund
for Arab Economic Development, comprises (a) construction of 358 km of roads
between the Wadi Hadramawt agricultural area and the coast, which were pre-
pared under Credit 240 and Engineering Credit S-12; (b) economic and engineer-
ing studies for 320 km of roads; (c) purchase of maintenance equipment and
spares; (d) technical assistance to the MPW, including fellowships for MPW
staff abroad; and (e) refinancing of Engineering Credit S-12. Since interna-
tional competitive bidding of the construction element of the project did not
lead to an acceptable bid, arrangements have been made for the works to be
carried out by a government construction unit which will be assisted by the
UK - Crown Agents. This credit was approved on May 22, 1975. It is not yet
effective.
