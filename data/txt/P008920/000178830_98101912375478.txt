I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey and Eregli Demir ve Celik Fabrikalari,
Turk Anonim Sirkeki (Erdemir) have requested the Bank's participation in
the financing of the Stage II Expansion of the existing Erdemir Steel Plant
at Eregli, about 270 km east of Istanbul (Map IBRD 3827R). The project would
increase the annual liquid steel production capacity from 1.5 to 2.0 million
metric tons per year (tpy), equivalent to 1.1 to 1.5 million tpy of finished
products, respectively.
1.02      Erdemir, which started operations in 1965, is Turkey's only inte-
grated steel plant for production of flat products, and its production is
expected to continue falling short of domestic marlket demand even after com-
pletion of Stage II.
1.03      Total financial requirements for the project, including incremental
working capital and interest during construction, are estimated to be US$342
million, with US$173 million in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan
(US$95 million) would therefore provide 28% of the total and 55% of the
foreign exchange needs of the project. Bilateral financing sources, primarily
European banks, internally generated funds, and in case these are insufficient
- newly paid up equity would provide the remainder of the funds required.
1.04      In 1972 the Bank granted its first loan (Loan 817-TU of US$76
million, April 28, 1972, now 92% disbursed) for Erdemir's Stage I expansion
project, nearing completion. The present project (Stage II) was presented
to the Bank in December 1976 and appraised in October 1977 by a mission
consisting of Messrs. O'Neil (Chief) and Roet of the Industrial Projects
Department and Mr. Maffei of the Legal Department.
II. THE TURKISH STEEL INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANY
A.  The Turkish Steel Industry
2.01      The beginning of a modern steel industry in Turkey goes back to
the 1930's with the construction of the Karabuk integrated steel plant in
northern Turkey (Map IBRD 3827R), followed by Erdemir, the second integrated
steel producer which began operating in 1965. A third plant, Isdemir at
Iskenderun in South Turkey, constructed with Russian assistance, started
production at the end of 1976. A fourth plant is in an early planning
stage. Besides these large integrated plants, all of which are majority
owned by the State and which use mainly blast furnace and basic oxygen fur-
naces (BF/BOF), Turkey has about 20 smaller plants, most of which are
privately owned with electric furnaces using scrap as raw material; most of
these plants are located in Western Turkey. The Emnual production capacity of
the three integrated steel producers is at present 2.4 million tons of liquid
steel - of which 1.6 million tons is for non-flat products and 0.8 million
tons is for flat products. The 20 smaller plants have together an annual
liquid steel production capacity of 950,000 tons i-or non-flat products.



2.02      Consumption and production of steel in Turkey have increased rapidly
with annual growth rates of about 13% since the early 1960's. In 1976 Turkish
steel. consumption reached 3.5 million tons and production 2.6 million tons,
part of which was derived from imported semi-finished products. Throughout
this period, Turkey had to import between 0.1 and 1.6 million tpy of steel
products to cover the domestic supply gap.
2.03      Until recently Turkey's steel industry relied exclusively on domes-
tic coal which, although rather high in ash content, is suitable for the pro-
duction of metallurgical coke. With the start of production of the Isdemir
steel. plant, however, the country has - at least temporarily - begun import-
ing some coal. A large part of Turkey's iron ore requirements (75%) are sup-
plied domesticallyr by private companies. The local ore has, however, a low
iron content (typically 52 to 58%) and is blended with imported ore of a higher
iron content. Limestone comes from nearby deposits while tin, manganese and
other miscellaneous materials needed in steel making are imported. While the
integrated steel polants are virtually self-sufficient in meeting their own
scrap requirements, the small electric furnace plants are fed by domestic and
imported scrap. As noted above, all the country's steel products are consumed
domestically.
B.   The Company
1.   Origin
2.04.     Erdemir was established in 1960 by a Parliamentary Act which, inter
alia, provides that, regardless of the size of the public shareholding, the
Company will be run according to private commercial law. The Company started
operating in 1965 with a rated annual raw steel production capacity of 470,000
tons (378,000 tons of finished steel products) and a total investment in fixed
assets of US$255 million. With relatively minor additions included in its
"truncated expansion" of 1969-1972, its annual liquid steel capacity was
increased to 800,000 tons (545,000 tons of finished steel products). It
operates its existing facilities at essentially full capacity. In 1973 it
embarked, with the Bank's financial participation, on its first major expan-
sion (Stage I) which will shortly bring its annual liquid steel production
capacity to 1.5 million tons (1.1 million tons of finished steel products).
2.   Stage I Expansion Project
2.05      The Stage I Expansion Project has suffered serious problems - a
delay of over three years in completion and a substantial cost overrun. These
problems were caused in large part by: (i) frequent changes at top management
and Board levels; (ii) unsatisfactory working relationship with its Engineer
which was not conducive to strict control of project implementation; and (iii)
delay in initiation of procurement, coupled with the sharp worldwide inflation
that Eollowed the oil price increases in 1973/74 which affected this project
as it did others that were implemented at about the same time. While this
latter cause was outside Erdemir's control, the Company has made a serious
efforit to analyze the reasons for the other problems and has developed a plan
to avoid repetition of similar occurrences in future expansions, as explained



-3-
in para 5.01. Also, the new government appreciating the need for efficient
management, has appointed experienced persons to t:op positions; this is
expected to ensure avoidance of similar problems for Stage II. Major
facilities in Stage I, including the Dock equipment, Coke plant, Blast Fur-
nace, B.O.F. shop, Slab Caster, Hot Strip roughing mills, Pickle Line, and
Cold Mill have been completed. The Hot Strip Mill complex and plant services
are expected to be completed in August/September, 1978, permitting the Stage I
facilities, as a group, to be operating in October, 1978.
2.06      The estimated investment in the Stage I expansion project is US$425
million, about 75% higher than the appraisal estimate in US$ terms, and
110% higher in local currency terms. The overrun resulted from: (i) the
abovementioned much longer than expected implementation period and a much
higher than expected inflation, particularly in local expenditures; and (ii)
an increase in scope from 915,000 tpy of finished products to 1.1 million tpy,
or by about 20%. The cost overrun required a change in the financing plan.
It was originally foreseen that all local costs ci'uld be financed by inter-
nally generated funds. However, to finance the portion of the cost overrun
not covered by internally generated funds, the Government had to make avail-
able to Erdemir LT 1,600 million. Since steel prices have also increased
internationally, the presently estimated economic rate of return of the Stage
I expansion is roughly 10%, as compared to 18% at the time of appraisal.
3.   Ownership
2.07      Fifty-one percent of the Company's shares are held in equal parts
by two state-owned companies, Karabuk Steel (para 2.01) and the Sumerbank,
an industrial holding company whose main interests are in consumer goods in-
dustries. The Turkish private sector, including the Is Bank, the Ankara
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and private shareholders hold about 32%
of Erdemir's shares. A U.S. engineering company, Koppers, which assisted
in the construction of the original plant and in its expansion, sold its
shares (17%) in 1976 to the Desiyab (State Industry and Labor Investment
Bank) which, although set up and financed mainly by the Government, oper-
ates according to private commercial law, and its own special by-laws.
4.   Management and Labor
2.08      Erdemir's Board of Directors consists of nine members who are
elected by the shareholders for periods of three years. Executive manage-
ment of the Company is vested in the President, who attends Board meetings,
but is not a Board member. The President is assisted by six Vice Presi-
dents, responsible respectively for Operations, Sales, Finance, Purchasing,
Industrial Relations, and Expansion. The Chairman and members of the Board
and the President have frequently been changed. As noted, this has caused
management instability and delayed implementation of the Stage I project.
However, due to competent and stable management at the plant level, no major
adverse effect has been seen in plant operations. The middle management team,
comprised mainly of qualified and efficient personnel, benefits from a good
management information system, and satisfactory operational controls.



- 4 -
2.09      The plant is run by a local labor force totalling about 6,100
at end 1977, and has only two expatriates on its permanent staff. Opera-
tional labor efficiency has improved but, with about 21 man-hours per ton
of steel products in 1976, was still low as compared to 8 to 12 man-hours
in similar thoug'h larger plants in developed countries. Workers are organized
in one strong labor union, which every other year negotiates a new work
contract. Wages have gone up rapidly and workers (as in other companies in
Turkey) have been more than compensated for inflation. While labor relations
are, on the whole, satisfactory, a breakdown in the collective bargaining
process in 1969, 1973 and 1978 caused the closing down of the factory for two
weeks, over two months, and two days, respectively.

Erdemir has run its steel making facilities close to capacity, except during
strikes, as mentioned above. Since the Company has been unable to meet
the entire Turkish demand for flat steel from its own steel production, it
has from time to time imported finished products and has processed imported
semi-finished products for further transformation in its finishing facilities
which presently have some excess capacity. Profitability during 1975-77
did not reach the high level of 1974, primarily because of increased financial
charges on borrowings for Stage I (whose assets are not yet operative) and

steel price increases which did not fully reflect cost increases during this
period. At present, however, after the latest steel price increase in March
1978 Erdemir's prices (before a special production tax levied on domestically
produced steel) are about 15-20% above depressed donmestic West European prices
and give the Company a safe profit margin.
2.11      During Stage I project implementation, the financial position of the
Company has been unsatisfactory, with a debt/equity ratio peaking at around
83:17 in 1977, and a decreasing current ratio and debt service coverage. The
Government and Erdemir's shareholders have now, however, agreed to the Bank's
request to improve the financial structure by an infusion of LT 1,200 million
in the form of paid-up equity. Such an increase requires, however, an amend-
ment to the Parliamentary Act which established Erdemir and limited the sub-
scribed and paid-up equity of the Company. The Government, in 1977, submitted
to the Parliament the necessary amendment but because of last year's election,
delays in reconvening of Parliament, the amendment has not yet been discussed
and approved. Hence, the Bank agreed, as an interim solution, to a Government
5-year zero interest loan of LT 1,200 million (expiring in 1982) to be con-
verted into equity, subsequent to Parliamentary approval of Erdemir's increase
in equity.
2.12      Erdemir's equity enabling legislation is at an advanced stage in the
series of steps required for its enactment. The legislation is now expected
to be passed in fall of 1978 or earlier. If, however, for any reason the
legislation does not pass, or the Company does not act to increase its equity
for any reason, the Government agreed to convert the LT 1,200 million loan
into quasi equity (interest free loan - repayable after 20 years).
6.   Erdemir's Status as a Private Companv
2.13      A special law, No. 7462 dated February 28, 1960, in combination
with the articles of association, assures that Erdemir will be managed as a
private company, regardless of the proportion of the public sector shares in
the Company. Furthermore, Article 3.05 of the Project Agreement and Section
4.03 of the Loan Agreement for Stage I require that any changes in Erdemir's
by-laws and the semi-private status need Bank approval. With the conversion
of the 1977 Government loan of LT 1,200 million to equity or quasi equity, the
direct and indirect Government ownership will exceed the present 51%.
Although the Government has clearly stated that it favors continuation of
Erdemir's private status, and does not foresee a cbhange in that status, the
increasing dependence of Erdemir on Government financing can be expected to
result in steadily growing pressure to treat Erdemir as a State Economic
Enterprise, as opposed to a "semi"t private one. This could have long-term
negative implications since Erdemir is presently managed more efficiently than
the Turkish state-owned steel companies. Therefore, the Stage I covenant that
any change in the semi-private status of the Company must be agreed with the
Bank will also apply to the proposed loan for Stage! II (through its life).
During negotiations the Bank reiterated its view thLat it considers maintenance
of Erdemir's present status of great significance to the long term success of
the project.



III. THE MARKET IN TURKEY
A.   Historic Consumption of Steel and Flat Steel Products
3.01      The past growth in steel consumption has considerably exceeded
the growth of other economic indicators. From 1963 to 1976, GNP grew annually
by 6.9%; industrial output by 9.9%; and construction by 7.9%, while steel
consumption increased by 12.3% and jumped by another 22% in 1977. Also during
this period steel consumption in Turkey increased faster than in most other
countries of the world. Nevertheless, Turkey's 1976 per capita liquid steel
consumption of 1110 kg is still low compared with 500-700 kg per capita in the
USA, Germany and Japan, and with 350-450 kg in the UK, France and Italy.
3.02      The main consumption of steel products in Turkey has been for non-
flat products; this reflects the general pattern of a still developing in-
dustrial economy in which non-flat products, mostly used in infrastructure
and Iheavy construction related investments, predominate. However, with
increasing industrialization in Turkey the share of flat products in the
consumption of all steel mill products has been growing from 32% in 1962
to 35% in 1977, as the table below indicates.

1966            1,128                   375                  33
1970            1,718                   553                  32
1972           2,188                    797                  36
1974           2,631                    920                  35

Although these historic data list apparent Turkish consumption of steel
products in the years shown, there is no firm basis for estimating how close
they came to meeting actual needs. Because of restrictions on imports,
during most of this period, it is believed that actual (potential) demand has
been higher than quantities actually consumed.
3.03      Over the years production has fallen more and more behind consump-
tion, particularly in the field of flat products. In 1976 imports of semi-
finished and finished products provided about 30% of total steel products
consumption and about 55% of flat products. The table below summarizes his-
torical consumption and import data and more details are given in Annexes 3-1
and 3-2.

/a   Excluding imports of semi-finished products.
3.04      As Erdemir has been the only flat steel producer and imports were
generally restricted, the Company has been enjoying a seller's market most
of the time, and therefore has had almost no difficulty in marketing its
products. Most of its output is sold directly to u:Ltimate consumers. Erdemir
has found this direct contact advantageous and necessary to minimize specula-
tive buying by middlemen in periods of pronounced shortage. The Company
maintains its own sales offices in Turkey's major cLties. Inventory of
finished products at the mill has recently been maintained at below 10% of
annual sales, illustrating the favorable market situation. Erdemir normally
has firm orders for virtually a whole year's output, enabling it to plan
production efficiently well in advance, and to achieve relatively economic
production runs with few interruptions and changes. Most sales are against
cash; advance payment for 15-25% of the value of the annual orders are re-
ceived each September and December from nearly all iLts customers. Credit is
given mainly to a few Government agencies, but amounts to substantially less
than advance payments from customers.
B.   Historic Price and Pricing Policy
3.05      Erdemir, as a semi-private company, sets prices for its products,
but in practice, prices of steel products are coordiinated with the Govern-
ment. The steel price policy of Erdemir and the Government in recent years
has taken into consideration domestic production costs and, in the specific
case of flat products, Erdemir's needs to finance its expansion programs.
Erdemir's prices were increased on the average by 31% in 1976, 40% in 1977,
and by 24% in 1978 as noted in para 2.10. Erdemir's ex-factory flat steel
prices are now after the latest price hike, about 15 to 20% above domestic



- 8 -
West-European prices. The consumers have to pay an additional production tax
of 20%. On imported semi-finished and finished products, duties and levies at
present total about 37% of the CIF import price (duties and levies were
increased to 56% in 1978).

C.   Future Demand for Steel and Flat Steel Products
3.06      Since the early sixties, local and foreign organizations have pre-
pared long-term projections for steel demand in Turkey. Foreign and local
consultants as well as the Bank have used several techniques in their recent
market projections--time series and correlation ratios with macro-economic
indicators like GNP--for arriving at forecasts for overall steel demand and
the derived demand for non-flat products, and direct sectoral analysis of
demand for non-flat products.
3.07      Steel demand forecasts, according to time series projections, would
indicate a continuous rapid growth in steel demand in Turkey. Extrapolations
based. on regressicn analyses using an exponential function with a low standard
error and on past average yearly growth rates resulted in a forecast demand
for finished steel of between 6.9-7.6 million tons in 1983 and between 8.4-9.5
million tons in 1985, as shown in the following table.

-9-
3.08      Several studies have indicated the existence of a strong correla-
tion between GNP growth and steel demand. A report by the IISI suggests
that, in developing countries which have reached the economic "take off"
stage, the elasticity of steel demand with regard to GNP growth is above 1.0.
With the increase in GNP per capita, the elasticity generally tapers off;
and in developed countries, such as the USA and Europe, it is in fact well
below 1.0. Turkey, however, belongs in this respect, to the category of
developing countries, as the historic relationship between growth in GNP and
steel demand illustrates.

Steel Elasticity           1.8         1.8          1.8          1.9
3.09      The historical steel elasticity in Turkey (1.8 to 1.9) has been
much higher than in other developing countries for which studies by the IISI
and Nippon Steel have determined an average elasticity of 1.2 to 1.4. Past
GNP growth in Turkey has been impressive (7% per anaum over the last decade)
and Turkey, during that period, has been a country with one of the fastest
growing economies in the world. However, to overcome the acute foreign ex-
change difficulties now prevailing, and the instabiLity of the balance of
payments, Turkey is expected to slow down, at least for some time, its in-
vestments and, consequently, its GNP growth.
3.10      With a projected growth rate of GNP of about 6%, another set of
steel demand forecasts has been made, assuming various elasticity ratios.
The first ratio, 1.8, is the average Turkish historic ratio; the second,
1.55, is the average of the Turkish historic ratio and that of the develop-
ing countries as a whole; and the third, 1.3, is the ratio of the developing
countries as a whole. The following table presents the result of these pro-
jections.

3.L1      Because of the possibility of more severe repercussions of the
present foreign exchange difficulties of Turkey on the demand for steel
products than is at present foreseen, the lowest estimate among the forecasts
- 5.7 million in 1983 and 6.7 million in 1985 - have been used in this report
as a conservative forecast for steel product demand in the coming years; it
is likely that actual demand will be higher.
3.12      As noted in para 3.02 the share of flat rolled products in total
steel consumption in Turkey was around 32% until 1970, and subsequently
increased to 35,136%. One can reasonably assume that this share will continue
rising, with the further industrialization of Turkey and following the ex-
perience in other developing countries such as Mexico where - with a similar
economic development pattern - the share of flat products has come to 50%.
The US Steel Engineers and Consultants' (UEC) estimate, prepared in 1976,
that the share of flat products will be 44% in 1983 and 45.5% in 1985, has
therefore been accepted. This would result in a demand for flat steel pro-
ducts of 2.5 mi:Llion tons in 1983 and 3.0 million tons in 1985, compared to
acitual consumption of about 1.3 million tons in 1976 and 1.5 million tons in
1977.
3.[3      The f'Lat rolled steel projections cited above cover all grades of
steael - low carbon, high strength-low alloy, normal (full) alloy and stain-
less. In 1974, Turkish consumption of full alloy and stainless grades (in
steel mill form) was no more than 10,000 tons. Consumption of these special
grades are, according to UEC, expected to grow to 70,000 tons by 1982 and
120,000 tons by 1985, as industrial and technological development increases
demand for them by domestic manufacturers.  Therefore, to arrive at the
forecast demand for the flat products produced by Erdemir, the above-men-
tioned projections have to be reduced by the expected demand for alloy and
stainless grades. Accordingly, the demand for Erdemir-type products would
be about 2.4 mi:Llion tons in 1983 and 2.9 million tons in 1985.
3.14      Finally, UEC assessed the demand for flat products also directly
through sectoraL projections which were based on (i) detailed information
on present steel consumption according to major industrial sectors; (ii)
fiesld studies and surveys; and (iii) macro-economic sector studies and



- 11 -
demand correlations (input-output tables). These sectoral projections ex-
pect demand for flat steel products of the different industrial sectors
to grow by 10-13% per year and, on a weighted average, by 11%. Because of
the assumed acceleration in the industrialization process, UEC forecast a
fast growth for appliances, furniture, electrical and agricultural machinery
and containers while it predicts the demand from the construction, infrastruc-
ture and mining sectors as well as other users to grow at a slower rate.
Total demand for flat steel products would then be 3.2 million tons in 1983
and 3.9 million tons in 1985. Deducting from these forecasts the demand
for non-Erdemir type products one arrives at a demand forecast for Erdemir-type
products of 3.1 million tons in 1983 and 3.8 million tons in 1985. This
compares to the 2.4 and 2.9 million tons respectively actually used in this
report (para 3.13).
D.   Future Demand/Supply Gap
3.15      Although initial planning for additional flat steel capacity of 2
million tpy at the Iskenderun Steel Plant has started, the following table
which summarizes expected demand and supply in Turkey of Erdemir-type products
through 1985, does not assume that this capacity will become available before
1986. The supply forecast, therefore, represents the expected production
build-up of Erdemir alone for which details are given in para 4.07.

1979                   1,650            950                  700
1980                   1,820          1,050                  770
1981                   2,010          1,110                  900
1982                   2,220          1,200                1,020
1983                   2,450          1,280                1,170
1984                   2,660          1,370                1,290
1985                   2,880          1,460                1,420
3.16      The large supply gap (also shown in the graph which follows) indi-
cates that Erdemir will not have any difficulty in marketing the additional
output from the Stage II project, even if Iskendernn's flat products facili-
ties were to come on stream before 1986. Neverthe:Less, as a precaution for
a long-term balanced increase in production, agreement has been reached with
the Government (as was done in connection with Stage I expansion) to coor-
dinate investments for the expansion of the flat steel production capacity of
Turkish steel producers as required by domestic market conditions.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope and Location
4.01      The Stage II project will be complementary to the ongoing Stage I
expansion. It is basically a "round-out" expansion since it consists of
facilities to fully utilize the inherent iron and steelmaking and hot rolling
capacity now being installed in Stage I. The project also includes some
additional capital investments for ecology and facilities designed to reduce
consumption of energy and operating costs; details are given in Annex 7-3.
The Stage II facilities were anticipated in the design of Stage I but not
included in that expansion because of anticipated domestic market constraints.
4.02      The project (Stage II) was designed by UEC in general terms in
1971, along with Stage I, and was refined in December 1976 to reflect the
latest market and operating conditions. Stage II will expand Erdemir's
production capacity from its present level at the end of Stage I of 1.1
million tpy of finished products to 1.5 million tpy (this corresponds to an
increase in steelmaking capacity from 1.5 million tpy to 2.0 million tpy).
Stage II is fully compatible with the Master Plan drawn up by UEC in conjunc-
tion with Erdemir, for an expansion of Erdemir's production capacity in two
further stages to 4.7 million tpy in 1985 and to 6.4 million tpy by the early
1990's. 1/ That expansion (beyond Stage II) will be more costly and will
require extensive use of land fill since the presently available land is
restricted by nearby mountains and the shoreline.
4.03      Erdemir's plant, which has a port capable of handling 35,000 ton
vessels, is located near the town of Eregli on the Black Sea coast about 300
km north of Ankara and 270 km east of Istanbul; it Ls also located about 40
km from the coal deposits of Zonguldak to the east and 700 km from Turkey's
main iron ore deposits in the Sivas region. Since the Stage II expansion
is a "round-out," the selected location is appropriate and the "least cost"
alternative available.
B. Project Description
4.04      A detailed project description, material flow chart, and plant
layout are given in Annexes 4-1 through 4-3 and 7-3. Major new facilities
to be added in the Stage II expansion include:
(a) additions to raw material handling systems to increase
overall handling capacity, and improve quality control
and operating flexibility in blending, crushing, screen-
ing; including conveyors, bins, crushers, stackers, and
reclaimers as required to support iron production of 1.8
million tpy;
1/   Erdemir's long-range expansion plans have been analyzed in depth by
the Company and its consultants (UEC Report of December 1976 - Master
Plan, a copy of which is available in the project file).

(b) new turbo blower;
(c) increases in steelmaking capacity to a level of 2.0 million
tpy, including new scrap preparation facilities, cranes,
automatic baler and shear, manual burning beds;
(d) one new continuous slab caster unit - 0.6 million tpy
capacity;
(e) improvements in slab yard and hot strip mill to achieve
capacity of 1.67 million tpy, including cranes, computer
contro:Ls, a third coiler, slab yard extension;
(f) improvements in hot and cold rolled finishing facilities,
including a new shear line, annealing furnaces, cranes
and second stand on temper mill to achieve a capacity of
1.54 m:Lllion tpy of finished products;
(g) additional facilities to improve quality, reduce costs,
and conserve energy, including a fourth BF hot stove;
(h) expanded utilities, services, and effluent treatment
facilities to support levels of operations shown above
including equipment for improved control and monitoring
of pollutants; and,
(i)  The project will also include a technical/economic
feasibility study of Erdemir's Stage III and IV expansion
plans, and continuing technical assistance from an operating
steel lproducing company.
As a first step of project implementation the chosen engineering contractor,
NKK from Japan, will undertake a review of basic assumptions, facility plan,
unit balances, procurement packages, and project cost estimates. It has been
agreed that the Company will review with the Bank the results of NKK's analysis
of 'project scope and costs not later than November 30, 1978.
4.05      The choice and size of the above facilities was determined by the
objective of having a balanced plant at completion of Stage II and incorporated
a t'horough analysis of operating restrictions now being experienced with
present facilities and of bottlenecks expected to occur during operation of
Stage I. The technology chosen for Stage II is mainly an extension of the
conventional and established technology already utilized for Stage I, and is
considered appropriate. However, even with conventional technology, the
operating rates needed under the project will require good coordination of
steelmaking, casting, services and particularly maintenance - making the
access to technical assistance from an efficient operating steel company
essential (see para. 5.06).

C.   Tin Plate Facilities
4.06       The project originally submitted by Erdemir to the Bank included a
250,000 tpy capacity electrolytic tinning line and related facilities, at a
cost of about US$110 million. After a thorough review by Erdemir, UEC and
the Bank, it was determined that the economic rate of return on the invest-
ment in tin plate facilities was between 2% and 5%, due mainly to a reduction
in Erdemir's effective production capacity for cold rolled sheets if addi-
tional tonnages of tin plate were to be produced. At the insistence of the
Bank, Erdemir has agreed to drop the facilities for production of tin plate
from the project. It may be possible, however, that with further market
growth and later availability of additional steelmaking and rolling capacity,
production of tin plate could become economically attractive within Stage III.
During negotiations it was confirmed that the Company will exclude the tin
plate component from the project and will not construct it separately outside
the Stage II project, unless it can be shown, to the satisfaction of the
Company and the Bank, to be economically justified.
D. Production Plan, Raw Materials
4.07      The Company's production build-up over the next eight years, as
shown in the following table, is expected to be relatively fast, since Erdemir
has been operating an integrated steel plant since 1965 and has achieved
reasonably efficient levels of productivity, production yields, and overall
costs taking into account its relatively small-scale facilities.
Erdemir's Expected Production Build-up: 1977-1985 /a
(000 tons of finished products)
Stage I Build-up                             Stage II Build-up
1977 (actual)   478                          1982             1,200
1978             600                         1'183            1,320
1979             950                         1984             1,400
1980           1,050                         19i85            1,460
1981           1,113
/a   Excluding processing of imported semi finished products.
At the time of the scheduled start-up of Stage II in 1981, it will have had
16 years of experience in the operation of basic steelmaking facilities - coke
plant, blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace, rolling mills and auxiliary ser-
vices, and about three years experience in contintuous casting. Entirely new
operations to be added in Stage II are both few ancl relatively simple (mainly
scrap preparation, variations in material handling system and hot mill con-
trols). Also, the existing steckel mill is expected to be kept operational
through most of the start-up period of the new hot strip mill (installed under
Stage I), giving additional flexibility to meet, or possibly exceed, production
and financial targets.



- 16 -
4.08      Furthermore, in estimating the production capacity of the steel
plant it has been recognized that 100% full operating levels may not be
achieved on a continuing basis due to numerous factors - such as normal
operational difficulties, fluctuations in timing of market requirements,
restrictions on available electric power, and also, possible work stoppages;
hence the above production build-up and the financial projections are based on
only a 95% operating rate. All these factors, together with competent tech-
nica:L assistance, particularly in the BOF/continuous casting operation,
should make the projected production build-up attainable. (The 95% operating
rate corresponds to 10,212 BOF heats per vessel per year based on two vessel
operation. Although Erdemir and its consultant feel that the 100% level can
be achieved (Annex 4-4), the Bank considers the 95% operating rate to be more
approapriate, based on conditions likely to prevail in Turkey.)
4.09      Upon completion of Stage II, and at effective capacity, Erdemir's
produiction plan will be as follows:

Total Finished Flat Products                      1,460
4.10      Requirements for raw materials associated with the production shown
above are as f ollows:
Erdemir's Raw Materials Requirements at 95% Operating Rate
(000 tpy)
Iron Ore                                    2,600
of which:  Domestic                       2,000
Imported                         600
Coal         mostly Domestic                1,600

The indicated quantities of Turkish iron ore and limestone are expected to
be available without major problems. Projects are now underway to expand
iron ore production at Hasancelebi, Divrigi, and other deposits. However,
the availability of Turkish coal is less certain, even though total domestic
production capacity for coking coal is expected to be about 4.5 to 5.0 mil-
lion tpy in 1985 (versus total potential domestic demand of about 5.5 to 6.0
million tpy). If other Turkish steel plants, or other consumers, receive
substantial allocations of Turkish coal after mid 1980's, Erdemir may be
required to import gradually increasing quantities of coking coal. Except for
possible difficulties in the availability of foreign exchange in Turkey this
is not considered a major problem in the short term, based on the expected
availability of coking coal on world markets. However, in the longer term,
availability, and particularly price of good coking coal are more uncertain.
This may become an important factor to be consideredi for Stage III - including
the capability of Turkey to increase its own coal production. In order to
assure the supply of raw materials (and the necessary foreign exchange), an
agreement has been obtained that the Turkish government will grant Erdemir the
right to import the necessary amounts of iron ore anid coal to permit full
utilization of installed capacity as long as such imports are required to meet
market demand and are the most economic method of supply. (A covenant permit-
ting importation of iron ore was agreed upon for Stage I.)
E. Labor Requirements
4.11      For 1985, at full production, Erdemir's consultants (UEC) recommend,
based on detailed studies, a total work force of 6,182 people, including 1,394
in management, sales, general and administration; 8153 other administrative
staff; 740 in steelmaking, 916 in rolling and finishing; and 2,269 in services,
utilities and maintenance. At that level, Erdemir's total employment would
yield an estimated 9.0 man-hours per ton of product, which is a reduction
of about 12 man hours per ton as compared with the 1976 level, and would be
reasonably comparable with European and US practices for flat products plants
producing Erdemir's product mix.
4.12      In the past, however, Erdemir's actual employment has been about
11% over the level previously recommended by the consultants. If a similar
excess margin were to be continued in Stage II the total work force would
most likely be about 6,860 and employment costs would increase proportionately.
For the financial and economic analysis the higher level of work force (with
about 450 additional employees over the Stage I level) has been used. In that
case Erdemir's total employment would yield 10.0 man-hours per ton of product,
or only slightly above the level achieved in similar Western European steel
plants at high levels of capacity utilization. Erdemir's management has
stated that its firm policy is to restrict its work force to, or near, the
level recommended for Stage II by its consultants. This is reflected in the
loan documentation.

F. Ecology
1.   General
*.13      At present (i.e., prior to completion of Stage I) the main sources
of pollution from Erdemir's existing plant are the sinter plant, the coke
plant, blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace, mills, and pickle lines.  Liquid
effluents have been particularly troublesome, causing significant damage to
nearby beaches, and the fishing industry in Eregli. While these facilities
will not be physically expanded in Stage II, they will be operated at higher
levels of activity (up to 33% higher than in Stage I). The liquid effluents
and emissions from these facilities will be adequately treated with the same
facilities as in Stage I, with some improvements as noted below. The major
new facilities in Stage II, affecting ecology, will be the No. 2 continuous
casting machine and a scrap preparation yard. The continuous caster will be
similar to the unit incorporated in Stage I plant, and will include adequate
new water recirculation, cooling, cleaning and filtering systems. The scrap
yard. will be equipped with adequate safety devices, including guards, person-
nel protection equipment, clothing and adequate ventilation.
2.   Coke Plant
4.14      Since the method chosen to handle coke plant effluents in Stage I
(primarily dilution) has been judged to be not fully acceptable by the Bank,
the Company has agreed, at the Bank's suggestion, to install a new biological
treatment plant for all coke plant effluents to reduce the total volume of
phenols and cyanide discharged into the Black Sea.
3.   Sewage Treatment
4.15      All sewage from the plant and the Company's housing area is treated
in a modern chemical treatment plant. However, sewage from the town of Eregli
(about 2 km distant), of which Erdemir's workers and families constitute about
three fourths of the population, receives no treatment at all prior to dis-
charge into the Black Sea. Several alternatives for improvements in town
sewage treatment are under consideration, including a combined biological
treatment plant for both town sewage and Erdemir's coke plant effluents.
Erdemir has now agreed to review the combined biological treatment plant
as part of its engineering for Stage II.
4.16      The project sponsors have indicated an increasing willingness to
introduce strict ecological and safety standards and monitor them on an
effective basis. The Company has confirmed that it intends to use pollution
control standards for Stage II, which are fully consistent with Bank guidel-
ines. It also plans to purchase and utilize, under the Stage II project,
additional equipment for effective monitoring of pollutants. Thus it is judged
that adequate measures will be taken in Stage II to protect the environment.
Assurances have been obtained that the project facilities will be operated
with due regard to ecological, environmental and safety standards acceptable
to the Bank, and that antipollution measures will include, but not be limited
to, the following:



- 19 -
(i) new biological treatment plant for coke plant effluents;
(ii) new bag house filter system for sinter plant dust; and
(iii) detailed technical analysis and recommendations for
adequate treatment of town sewage.
V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Management and Organization
5.01      Erdemir recognizes the importance of promrpt implementation of the
Stage II project, particularly given the present and expected inability of the
Company to satisfy Turkey's market demand for flat products. Overall control
of the project rests with its owner, Erdemir. An organization chart for the
Company and its engineering organization is given iLn Annexes 5-1 through 5-3
However, the Company's recent experience with delays and cost overruns in the
Stage I project have led it, at the urging of the IBank and after analyzing
the reasons for these delays, to initiate arrangements with a competent, expe-
rienced international engineering firm for more effective control of project
implementation, including staffing requirements, expediting, followup, as well
as critical path analyses and control. The contract for engineering services
gives significantly more responsibility and authority to the Engineer (NKK),
and will be carried out under more effective organizational arrangements, than
in the Stage I project.
5.02      Although the initial engineering work will be done in Japan, most of
the work will be undertaken directly by the foreign firm working in Turkey,
and about 60% of the engineering man-hours will be from Turkish employees
working under direct control of the Engineer. This plan should result in a
substantial transfer of engineering skills to Turkey. Erdemir agreed to the
Bank's review and approval of the terms and conditions of the contract for
engineering services, and cooperated with the Bank during development of the
contract. The contract was approved by the Bank in April 1978, and is ex-
pected to be signed in early June 1978.

Implementation Schedule - Stage II Project /
1. Sign engineering contract                            June 1978
2. Finish writing of main specifications,
and prequalifications of major suppliers             August 1978
3. Issue Invitations to Bid                             September 1978
4. Receive bids and finish bid evaluation               Dec. '78 to April 1979
5. Sign major contracts                                 Jan. to August 1979
6. Manufacture equipment                                1 to 1.5 years

9. Commission plant                                     End 1981
/a Turboblower, B.F stove, and 3rd coiler may be postponed several months.
The above schedule is more extended than that being used by Erdemir's top
management for its "Management Objectives" and control purposes (which shows
project completion in July 1981). However, the above schedule is consid-
ered more realistic and attainable. It gives cognizance to local conditions
and makes adequate allowances for some expected difflculties in making needed
changes in management and control practices, and in organization. For purposes
of monitoring actual progress during project implementation, the above sched-
ule and the Company's scheme were incorporated in the agreed minutes of
negotiations. The critical importance of a PERT schedule for control of
project implementation has been discussed with Erdemir at length. In the
functional responsibilities of the Engineer the development of an accurate and
complete PERT schedule for implementation, and the periodic updating of this
schedule, is included. It has been agreed that such review and updating will
be completed quarterly and will be sent to the Bank as a part of normal
reporting requirements. Thus, the PERT schedule will be an important tool for
the Bank's monitoring of the project.
C. Training and Technical Assistance
5.04      Since Erdemir has been operating an integrated steel plant since
1965, and has achieved reasonably efficient results, the need for a special
training effort exists only in certain fields. The most important and crit-
ical training is required to attain efficient high level operations at the
BOF/continuous casting complex. This specialized training will be provided by
an experienced operating steel company under a continuous technical assistance
contract (para. 5.05 and 5.06). Additional specialized training by suppliers
totalling about 80 man-weeks will be needed and provided at Erdemir's plant
in continuous casting, scrap preparation and raw material handling. It is
expected that the procedures described above should be effective in assisting
Erdemir to reach satisfactory Stage II operating levels within a reasonably
short training and start-up period and in line with the production build-up
predicted (para. 4.07). In the area of management, and in order to keep
Erdemir's effective management information and control system adequate for
future expanded plant operations, some additional technical assistance,
training (and possibly minor equipment) for a modern management informa-
tion and control system is expected to be provided.



- 22 -
5.05      The Company has been assisted as needed by Koppers Company (US),
ArmcD Steel (US), John Miles Company (UK), US Steel, and other specialized
consultants during much of its existence. It now has a continuing technical
assistance contract with US Steel Engineers and Consultants (UEC) for opera-
tional know-how, problem solving and training.
5.06      Erdemir has used UEC in the past for specialized assistance in raw
materials specifications, sinter plant and blast furnace operations, tinplate
production, administrative systems, computer programs, etc., and is satisfied
with the services provided. Erdemir plans to continue this type of arrange-
ment for technical assistance and training (with UEC or NKK) through December
1983 (approximately two years after start-up of Stage II). This continuing
arrangement of adequate, full-range technical assistance and training from
an efficient operating steel company has been reconfirmed and is provided for
in the Loan Documentation.
VI. GENERAL MANAGEMENT
6.01      Management is probably the most important and fundamental issue
which will affect the degree of success of the project. As noted above,
during the last five years, Erdemir has consistently suffered from frequently
changing and sometimes insufficiently qualified senior personnel, and also
from interference in day-to-day operations by the Board of Directors. This
has been one of the main causes of delays in Stage I implementation and thus
is responsible for a major part of the cost overrun and the already lost
economic benefits. Therefore, the Bank has repeatedly stressed the importance
of stable and competent management and the appraisal has analyzed this subject
in depth.
6.02      More recently, in early 1977, a reshuffling of management occurred
and several new aLppointments for positions directly below the President were
made. As a result, five of the seven Vice Presidents were new in their
positions although only one, the Vice President of Finance - with a distin-
guished background - was brought in from outside. Continuing changes, and an
atmosphere of instability, did not promote effective management. Initial
indications of deteriorating operational results and low employee morale
becaLme evident in 1977.
6.03      Bank missions in October 1977 and February 1978 made it clear to
the Company, and the Turkish authorities that the Bank could not proceed with
assisting the Stage II project unless fully qualified, competent, and reason-
ably stable management could be assured. Subsequently, in early 1978 follow-
ing a change in Government, Turkish authorities confirmed that they were
fully aware of Erdemir's management problems in the last five years and that
qualifications and experience would be the basis for future appointments of
personnel at Erdemir. Also, major and basic changes in Government policies
affecting Erdemir were made:  7 of 9 Board members were changed in March; and
the Chairman of the Board and President were replaced in April with individuals
of etxtensive experience in the steel industry, and whose qualifications are
knowm to the Bank; the new management situation is clearly an improvement when
compared with the past.



- 23 -
6.04       Bank evaluation of the risk of future changes in Erdemir's top
management is difficult. However, as is anticipated, if present management
remains throughout project implementation, and continues to be delegated
sufficient responsibility and authority to make sound personnel appointments
and is given freedom to act in a timely fashion, Erdemir should be able to
successfully carry out the project.
6.05       In order to assist in maintaining basic conditions which are condu-
cive to effective management, the Company and the Bank have reached a satis-
factory understanding that (i) qualifications and experience of individuals
appointed to key positions would be consistent with the job requirements, and
(ii) the functional responsibilities of Board of Directors and President will
remain clearly delineated. A continuing cooperative relationship between the
Company and the Bank is expected to facilitate discussions of the topics
listed above, if the need should arise during implementation of the project.
6.06       In the Bank's judgment, the prospects for fulfillment of the
necessary conditions for effective management are reasonably good, and
Erdemir's management situation is therefore appropriate for Bank lending.
VII.  CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Capital Cost
7.01       The total financing required for the Stage II Expansion (including
incremental working capital and interest during construction) is estimated to
be US$342 million, of which US$173 million is in direct and indirect foreign
exchange. The cost includes a physical contingency of 9% and price escalation
for foreign equipment at an annual rate of 7.5% for 1978-79 and 7% for 1980-82
and an annual price escalation for local costs of 30% in 1978 and 20% for
1979-1983. The relatively high local inflation compared to foreign inflation
expected during the period of project implementation may lead to exchange rate
adjustments, but the extent and timing of such adjustments are not predictable
at this time. Therefore, the estimated project costs are based on the current
exchange rate of US$1 = LT25.00. The effect of exchange rate changes would be
to reduce the local price contingencies (and therefore the total project costs)
expressed in US$. Conversely, the foreign price contingencies (and therefore
the total project cost) expressed in TL would be increased. A summary of
estimated capital cost is given below and a more detailed breakdown is shown
in Annex 7-1. Historical data, showing past escalation in major elements of
local costs and construction, is given in Annex 7-2.

/a   Includes indirect foreign exchange costs of US$6.0 million.
7.02      Capital. cost  estimates were prepared by UEC in December 1977 in
conjunction with Erdemir's Engineering Department. Foreign exchange costs
were. based primarily on budget proposals from international equipment sup-
pliers updated in. October 1977, and also on updated cost data for equipment
and materials from other recent steel projects. Local costs were given
particular attention and were re-estimated during appraisal (October 1977)
to more closely reflect recent high inflation rates and the latest price
increases due to a new Government policy which affects such items as steel,
cement, lubricants and lumber. To the extent data on Stage I facilities
could be compared to Stage II facilities, it was used as a basis for esti-
mating Stage II local costs. The estimates are expected to be refined after
the Contractor for General Engineering Services (NKK) begins work, and is able
to review in more detail (i) project design and scope, and (ii) costs for
individual items. This detailed review is expected to be completed by October
1978, after which it will be reviewed with the Bank. Major changes in



- 25 -
project scope or costs are not expected. The incremental working capital was
calculated on the basis of Erdemir's historical working capital requirements
and specific inventory build-up needs of the expansion. The estimates of the
above costs are considered realistic.
7.03      Capital costs (fully escalated but excluding interest during con-
struction and working capital) for the Stage II ("round out") project are
estimated at about US$750 per annual ton of additional liquid steel capacity.
This figure compares favorably with cost of new capacity being added elsewhere
in the industry - especially for new capacity being installed at conventional
"green field" integrated plants where comparable (escalated) capital costs are
now well over US$1,200 per annual ton.
B. Procurement
7.04      Bank procurement procedures are well understood by the Company from
the Stage I project. For the Stage II project, the Company intends to pur-
chase the majority of goods through international competitive bidding
under IBRD procurement guidelines. Procurement procedures for part of
the project - now estimated to cost US$50 million - will have to comply with
rules of other sources of foreign exchange financing once such sources and
related amounts are finalized. The final make-up of bid packages will be
influenced by the availability of, and regulations of bilateral sources, and
the recommendations of the Engineer, NKK.
7.05      The preliminary breakdown of bid packages is given in Annex 7-3; it
shows the list of goods subdivided into three main groups.
Group A:  Goods and Related Services Procured through I.C.B. and International
Shopping (Approx. US$89 million):
About two thirds of the project's foreign exchange purchases
are expected to fall into this group, to be procured under
international competitive bidding or international shopping
procedures utilizing Bank procurement guidelines. Major
items to be financed by the Bank are: (a) Scrap Preparation -
baler, shear, buildings; (b) Raw Material Handling System
- conveyors, crushing and screening stations, stackers,
reclaimers, blending equipment; (c) Hot Mill Facilities -
Slab yard extension, strip cooling system; (d) Hot Rolled
Finishing - additional shear line, other; (e) Cold Mill
Facilities - annealing equipment, other; (f) Utilities and
Services; (g) Other Equipment - biological treatment plant,
other pollution control facilities; (h) Material Handling
Equipment - Including Overhead Electric Traveling Cranes;
(i) Building Structures; (j) Technical Assistance, Training,
and Other Services.
For purposes of bid comparison, a 15% margin of preference,
or the prevailing applicable import duty iLn Turkey, whichever
is the lesser, will be given to clearly identified Turkish
bids.



- 26 -
Groijp B: Services and Bilaterally Financed Goods (Approx. US$28 million):
Selection of NKK as contractor for General Engineering
Services,-along with establishment of terms of reference
and conditions of employment for this contractor, have been
done in cooperation with the Bank, and are judged to be
fully satisfactory. Financing of US$8 million equivalent
for this contract is being arranged through banks in .
Switzerland. Both the contract for financing, and for the
Engineering itself, are expected to be signed in June
1978.
The No. 2 Continuous Slab Caster unit is expected to be
purchased through a German firm, but supplied and financed
from sources in Spain. Erdemir's second slab caster is
expected to be purchased on a negotiated basis - after
comparison of purchase conditions applicable to its first
slab caster and also after comparison with other offers of
international supply. Arrangements for the above purchases
are judged to be appropriate and practical under prevailing
conditions.
Group C: Proprietary and Semi Proprietary Goods (Approx. US$28 million):
A substantial amount of proprietary or semi-proprietary
items is expected to be needed since this project is a
"round-out" expansion   and compatibility with existing
equipment is required in several areas. Supplier arranged
financing is being sought for the following three equipment
items: Blast Furnace Turbo Blower, Blast Furnace Stove, and
Hot Mill Coiler.  It is expected that, given the present weak
situation in the steel mill equipment supply industry, and
foreseen improvements in Turkey's financial situation, accept-
able supplier arranged financing for the above three major
items estimated to cost US$22 million can be obtained in the
course of 1979 (see comment in para. 7.07). The remaining
miscellaneous proprietary equipment items estimated to cost
US$6 million will be financed by the Bank loan.
Major bid packages may be let on the basis of "Supply, Deliver and Erect"
on prepared foundations when deemed advantageous by Erdemir.  Civil works will
be subject to competition within Turkey.



- 27 -
C. Financing Plan
7.06      Financing required for the project totalling US$341.8 million
(LT 8,545.4 million) is expected to be provided by foreign loans and
internally generated funds as follows:
Financing Plan
US$ million         %
Internally Generated Funds        196.8             58
Loans
IBRD                          95.0             28
European Credits              28.0              8
Suppliers' Credits            22.0              6
Total                   145.0              42
Total Financing                   341.8            100
7.07      Negotiations with Swiss and Spanish banks are well under way for
loans totalling US$28 million to finance the NKK engineering contract and the
slab caster equipment. Finalization of these loans is a condition of effec-
tiveness for the Bank loan. The additional loan financing of US$22 million
will only be required in the last half of 1979 to finance proprietary and/or
deferred equipment items. Conclusion of agreements for this amount will
therefore not be a condition of effectiveness, but failure to obtain adequate
financing by December 31, 1979 will be an event of suspension of the Bank
loan. As noted in para 7.01, the project cost estimates would be affected
by exchange rate adjustments if such adjustments occur during the implementa-
tion period. This, however, would not affect the foreign financing required,
which only covers the direct foreign exchange costs of the project.
7.08      On the basis of the above financing plan, the project will be
financed 42% with debt and 58% with internally generated funds. The financial
projections indicate that Erdemir will be able to finance the local cost,
interest during construction and working capital from internally generated
funds and reach an acceptable debt/equity ratio of 60/40 or lower by the end
of 1979 or two years before Stage II project completion. However, the Gov-
ernment's substantial influence on steel and raw material prices, and past
experience, requires a firm Government commitment, that (i) if the internally
generated funds are insufficient for the financing of local project cost,
working capital, interest during construction, or (ii) if the project should
have a cost overrun, such additional funding requirements will be financed by
infusion of equity capital. Agreement was reached with the Government and the
Company that funds needed for these purposes are to be provided, either in
form of equity or interest free Government loans repayable after 20 years,
whenever the Company's debt/equity ratio exceeds 6CI:40.



- 28 -
I). Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursement
7.09      The Bank loan is proposed to be extended to the Turkish Government
for 17 years iincluding 4 years grace at an interest rate of 7.5% p.a. As
i s the case wiith the Stage I expansion loan, the Turkish Government would
relend the proceeds of the Bank's loan for Stage II to Erdemir, with Erdemir
bearing the foreign exchange risk. The terms for on-lending will be for 14
years, 3.5 years grace and an interest rate of 10% p.a.  The finalization of
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower and the Company is a con-
dition of effectiveness. The US$95 million Bank loan will be disbursed
against the foreign exchange cost of erected equipment, spare parts, building
structures ancl related services, which are acquired in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines made up of approximately US$89 million and US$6 million
of Procurement: Groups A and C respectively as described in para. 7.05 above.
A detailed list of Bank financed items is given in Annex 7-3.  The Bank loan
iLs expected to be almost fully disbursed by end 1982 fiscal year as indicated
iLn Annex 7-4.
VIII.  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AL. Production Build-Up and Sales
8.01      The financial projections assume that (i) Stage I facilities will
start-up in October 1978 and (ii) Stage II facilities will commence production
by end 1981 and will reach full (i.e. 95%) capacity in 1985, in line with
the production build-up discussed in para. 4.07. Sales are assumed to include
4 90,000 tons of finished or semi-finished imported steel in 1978 and 200,000
tons in 1979. Thereafter while no further steel imports by the Company are
assumed, Erdemir's sales are forecast to equal production. Nevertheless, even
after the completion of the Stage II facilities the demand in Turkey for
flat steel products will be larger than Erdemir's production capacity and
hence Erdemir is not expected to encounter marketing difficulties.
B.   Revenue
8.02      Because of the sellers' market for steel in Turkey and steel's
importance to the economy, Erdemir's steel prices have been influenced
by the GovernrLment. Prices have changed often for domestic economic considera-
t;ions and have also followed the general trend of international or domestic
European prices. Between 1971-1975, flat steel prices increased at about the
same rate as overall inflation in Turkey. Since 1976, however, prices have
increased at a far greater rate.  After a 40% increase in Erdemir's steel
prices in September 1977, and a further 24% increase in March 1978, the
Company's steel prices are about 15-20% above the European domestic level
although only 2-5% above the opportunity cost of importing steel from Europe
and Japan. It has been agreed that the Company:
(a) will adopt a pricing strategy so that Erdemir steel prices
(i) will allow - under conditions of efficient operations - an
adequate return on investment; (ii) will permit the Company to



- 29 -
meet its financial obligations and contribute to the financial
requirements for future expansion; and, (iii) will be approxi-
mately in line with international steel price levels.
(b) will consult with the Bank on any future changes in steel prices.
8.03      The financial projections in this report assume one 20% increase in
current (LT) steel prices for Erdemir in 1980, which is more likely to occur
than steady, continuous increases in line with inflation. As a result steel
prices are assumed to decline in real terms in 1979 and 1981.
C.   Operating Costs
1.   Raw Material Costs
8.04      The main operating cost items are raw materials, labor, deprecia-
tion and financing charges, with raw materials alone accounting for nearly
50% of production costs. Among raw materials the main cost items are iron
ore and coal. Iron ore has been procured both from domestic and foreign
sources. The price of domestic ore, mined by private enterprises, has been
above international prices, particularly taking into account its below-average
quality. At present the delivered price of the iron ore Erdemir imports
(68% Fe) is US$27 per ton. Coal has been procured locally from the nearby
Zonguldak and Armacuk coal mines. In the past, the coal produced by these
state enterprises (making heavy losses) has been procured at prices well
below the international level (in early 1977 at 60% below), even taking
into account the relatively inferior quality of the domestic coal. However,
in September 1977 with the start of a new economic lpolicy of the Government,
intending among other targets to reduce or eliminate the losses of state
enterprises, the delivered price of coal was tripled and is now at LT 1,080
per ton. This new price equivalent to US$43/ton is reasonably close to
international prices for the grades involved. The Einancial projections have
assumed that the cost of raw materials will continues to rise in line with
inflation, but in addition assume one increase in real terms of 5% in 1979
due mainly to an anticipated further increase in coal prices.
2.   Labor Costs
8.05      In 1976 Erdemir's total labor costs, including social and all
fringe benefits were as follaws:

Erdemir's 1976 total employment cost/man-hour was about US$3 versus approximately
US$12 in USA and US$5-8 in Europe. Based on Erdemir's expected Stage II work
force, the Company's employment cost at the 1976 wage level would be the equi-
vatent of aboul: US$30 per ton of product as compared with approximately US$100
to 120 in the IJS, and approximately US$50 to 80 in Europe in the same year.
8.06      The labor force is expected to increase only slightly (by about 7%)
as a result of the Stage II expansion project. This will require strict
management control and awareness by the labor unions of the importance of
productivity to Erdemir's future. As a result the man-hours per ton of steel
products should decline considerably and reach a level only slightly above
siLmilar plants in developed countries. Cost of labor per man-hour is assumed
to increase in real terms by 5% p.a. until 1982 as a result of additional wage
and fringe benefits increases which are expected.

3.   Operating Costs - Summary
8.07      At full production of Stage I facilities operating costs in 1978
real terms are expected to fall by 12% as compared to present operations.
With full (95% capacity) operations of Stage II facilities, the operating
ccosts are expected to drop by another 7%, as shown in the table below:

/a   Reduction partly due to change in product mix.
4.   Financial Charges
8.08      The financial charges included in the project cost derive from
foreign loans, as all local costs will be financed from internally generated
funds. The projections assume (i) an interest rate of 8% p.a., 10 years
maturity including 3 years of grace for the European credits and (ii) an
interest rate of 8% p.a., 11 years maturity includiLng 3 years of grace for
the supplier credits. Repayments are assumed to be in equal principal install-
ments.
5.   Depreciation
8.09      An average 15 year economic life for depreciation of Stages I and
II facilities has been assumed in line with Erdemir's accounting practices.
Stage I facilities will be revalued in 1978 to reflect increased replacement
costs due to the 30% devaluation in the Turkish lira in March 1978.
6.   Dividends, Legal Reserves and Bonuses
8.10      The projections reflect an annual dividend of 15% on non-Founders'
shares held mostly by private investors. No dividends are assumed on all other
shares including the additional paid up equity of LT 1,200 million that would
result from conversion of the Company's interest free five-year government
loan to equity in 1978. In accordance with Turkish law, legal reserves are
assumed to be 5% of net profit before taxes until reserves reach 50% of
paid-in share capital. Bonus payments to employees are assumed to be 5% of
net profit before taxes.
7.   Taxation
8.11      The financial projections have taken into account:  (i) the existing
corporate tax rate of 25% on net income after investment credit and bonus;
(ii) the financial equalization tax rate of 3% of the adjusted net income
before tax (net income before tax less investment credit and bonus); (iii)
income tax of 20% on the distributed net income after payment of the corporate



- 32 -
and equalization taxes, and a special allowance for legal reserve additions
and dividends; and (iv) the investment credit of up to 30% of the total
local capital expenditures.
D.   Methodology Used in Financial Pro-jections
8.12      In order to reflect a reasonably accurate picture of Erdemir's cash
generation and liquidity position during the construction phase, the financial
projections are made in current Turkish Lira until project completion by end
1981. Thereafter, however, the projections are presented in constant terms
since high possible inflation rates tend to overshadow cost and profit
variations.
E.   Future Profitability and Financial Position

- 33 -
8.14      The projections show that the Company's financial position is
expected to improve in 1978 as a result of the substantial increases in steel
prices in late 1977 and early 1978, the expected high volume of sales from own
production and imported semi-finished and finished steel, and the infusion of
new equity/quasi-equity. As noted previously steel price increases for
Erdemir's product mix averaged 40% and 24% in 1977 and 1978 respectively, and
have not yet been fully offset by increased input prices. Erdemir realizes
a profit of about 20% on purchases of imported finished steel and resale at
domestic prices including a production tax. Semi-finished and finished
imports comprise 45% of Erdemir's sales volume in 1978 - a level that is
expected to decline as Erdemir's production increases after Stage I start-up.
In 1978, net profits before taxes are expected to reach LT 1,722 million
(US$69 million), thus increasing net return on sales from 9% in 1977 to 13%
in 1978.
8.15      The use of 180-360 day credits for the high level of importation of
semi-finished and finished products expected in 1978, however, causes the
Company's current ratio to fall temporarily to 1.2. Since the availability
of these credits is strictly limited to the import program and working capital
for the Company's production program is adequate (current ratio of 1.3), the
infusion of new equity or long-term debt for this; purpose is not called for.
Starting 1979, Erdemir's current ratio is expected to increase steadily,
leaving Erdemir in a comfortable liquidity position during project implementa-
tion and thereafter.
8.16      As Stage I and Stage II production build-up takes effect, the
financial position of the Company is projected to become stronger. Operating
costs are expected to fall and net profits before tax as a percentage of
sales are expected to improve to 19% in 1981 and 28% in 1985. This should
provide a cash build-up in the 1980s, needed ahead of the envisaged (much
larger) Stage III expansion project. The increasing profits, combined with
dividend restrictions and the infusion of equity,/quasi-equity, will cause the
debt/equity ratio to improve from an unsatisfactory 83:17 in 1977 to 54:46 in
1979, and to improve further thereafter. Further, the debt service coverage
of the Company shows improvement from 1.0 in 1977 to 1.9 in 1978, and there-
after to a level of 3.6 in 1985.
8.17      The projections are particularly sensitive to steel price changes,
which are likely to be implemented in 2-3 year intervals instead of continuous
changes in line with inflation. The 20% increase in sales prices assumed
in 1980 accounts for a peak in profits and return on sales in that year.
In 1981, no price increase is assumed, and, as a result, real steel prices
decline for that year accounting for a temporary decrease in profitability.
However, based on the agreed upon pricing policy outlined in para. 8.02, the
Company's future financial liquidity and profitability is expected to remain
healthy.
F.   Financial Covenants
8.18      Although Erdemir's projected financial prospects are good, in the
past the Company has been in a difficult financial position with high debt
equity and low liquidity ratios. In order to avoid such a situation in the
future and to enable Erdemir to have an acceptable basis for further expan-
sion, the following agreements have been reached with the Government and



- 34 -
Erdemir: (i) Erdemir should maintain at all times a debt/equity ratio of
60/40 or less, and a current ratio of at least 1.3, and (ii) dividend payment
w:Lll be restricted to private non-founders until project completion, and as in
the Stage I Loan Agreement, thereafter only if the debt/equity ratio will
remain higher than 60/40 and the current ratio below 1.3. The Company has
a:Lso agreed to limit its capital expenditures outside the scope of the Stage I
and Stage II projects, unless approved by the Bank, to the LT equivalent of
US$4.0 million/yr until the fiscal year ending after Project completion (Stage
II) and US$8.0 million, thereafter. Project completion is defined as the date
imumediately following a continuous 90 day period during which, (i) total plant
production has been at least 450,000 metric tons of liquid steel with corre-
sponding levels of finished product production as detailed in the loan agree-
ment; and (ii) the Company has maintained a 1.3 current ratio. Further, the
Company agreed to prepare and furnish to the Bank by September 1 of each year
f:Lnancial projections for the following 5 years on the basis of which the need
for new equity funds, if any, will be discussed and such funds requested in a
timely manner.
G5.   Break Even Point
8.19      In 1985, at full production (1.46 million tpy), the profit break even
point for the Company would be about 75% of its (95%) production capacity.
ALternatively, average sales prices at full production capacity could fall by
25% before the Company would show a loss. The cash break even point has also
been estimated at 75% of capacity.
H.   Financial Rate of Return
8.20      The iLncremental financial rate of return is 18.1%.  A slippage of
one year in start-up and capital cost increase of 10% would lower the rate of
return to 14.6%. Details on the incremental financial cost and benefit
sl:reams are given in Annex 8-5.

I.   Auditing and Reporting
8.21      According to a requirement under the Stage I Project Agreement,
Erdemir's accounts and financial statements have to be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and to be furnished to the Bank not later than
four months after the end of each fiscal year. The Company has consistently



- 35 -
followed this covenant, and the statements have been audited on time by local
auditors related to Touche Ross & Co. of USA. The Company has also provided
the Bank with excellent monthly statements within a few weeks of the end of
each month. During-Stage II the same auditing and overall reporting require-
ments as in Stage I will be followed and in addition, the critical path
schedule for project implementation monitoring will be maintained.
IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Rate of Return
9.01      In calculating the incremental economic rate of return the finan-
cial cost streams were amended by excluding payment of taxes. The incremental
revenue stream consists of the expenditures Turkey would have to incur to
import steel products if the Stage II expansion project were not implemented,
(i.e., FOB prices for flat products plus freight, and handling charges).
Since steel is produced in plants utilizing different production processes,
and of varying capacity levels and age, and paying different prices for their
raw material inputs, it is difficult to find a concensus on the cost of
production of steel and on probable future domestic and international steel
prices. However, both the U.S. Government and the Commission of the European
Coal and Steel Community recently published guidelines on steel prices, and
these have been applied as a basis for establishing the expenditures which
Turkey would have to incur for importation of flat steel products.
9.02      The U.S. Treasury Department announced in January 1978 "trigger
prices" for basic steel mill products imported into the U.S., intended to
discourage imports below these prices. The "trigger prices" are based on the
cost of production of Japanese steel companies (which are considered to be the
most efficient steel producers in the world), and on costs for freight,
insurance, and handling. In order to arrive at comparable price data for
Japanese exports to Turkey for products similar to those produced by Erdemir,
the following was taken into account:
(i) "Trigger prices" refer to net tons (907-.kg), while Erdemir's
and the Bank's prices refer to metric tcns (subsequent revi-
sions to trigger prices refer to metric tons).
(ii) "Trigger prices" refer to basic productEs. An average of
12Z of the Japanese FOB price has to be added for extras for
quality, size, quantity, etc. The CIF and landing costs from
Japan to Turkey have been assumed to be the same as those 4uoted
for exports to the East Coast of the USA.
9.03      The Commission of the European Coal and Steel Community established
in 1977 "guidance prices" to facilitate stabilization of the European steel
market which has been subject to fierce internal European and external Japanese
competition since the energy crisis. These guidance prices, the latest of
which are valid from September 1, 1977, are accoriding to the Commission to be
interpreted as being the lowest possible prices to be applied for basic qualitt



- 36 -
(i.e,- for the cheapest specification in this product group). In order to
apply these data to future import prices for Turkey, the following was taken
into account:
(i) Approximately 12% should be added for extras;
(ii) The guidance prices do not make allowances for an adequate
profit margin and hence it has been assumed that 3% should
be added for arriving at a normal profit level for European
plants;
(iii) Insurance, Freight and Handling costs of about US$35 have
to be added to the FOB price; and
(iv) Export prices have historically been about 10% lower
than European internal prices. This is assumed to be the
case also in the future.
Since (iii) and (iv) essentially cancel each other out, Turkey's long term
expenditures on import of Erdemir type flat products would be some 15% above
the S'eptember 1977 guidance price (in late 1977 price terms); since Turkey has
been importing both from Europe and Japan, the Bank has taken, in its forecast
of economic prices for the incremental economic revenue stream, the average of
the estimated impcirt prices from Japan and Europe, respectively. Thus, the
steel. prices assumed for the economic rate of return calculations are kept
constant, i.e. do not include real price increases over the life of the
project and therefore, must be considered conservative estimates. The table
belowr summarizes the price data on steel products.  Details are given in
Annex: 9-2.

Ad   Recent information (May 1978) indicates that actual European export
market prices for basic hot rolled flat products (hot rolled sheet, and
plate) are about 6% above the "guidance prices"; and that recent trends
show at least some strengthening in previously very weak market prices.
9.04      The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in the following
table indicating a "Base Case" economic rate of return is 17.2%. All costs
in the return calculations were expressed in real terms, thus eliminating
general inflationary cost increases. Labor cost was not shadow priced, since
the additional labor force to be employed during operations is not only small
but the number of unskilled labor minimal. For raw materials no adjustments
were made as they are either imported or procured at near international price
levels but indirect taxes amounting to about 10% of operating cost have been
eliminated. The results are very close to those for the financial rate of
return due to the small differential in economic price and Erdemir selling
price discussed in para. 9.03 and the slight decrease in operating cost. The
detailed calculations and sensitivity tests are shown in Annex 9-3.

9.0S      The relatively high economic rate of return results from several
fact:ors: (i) the facilities will be able to operate at their full effective
prodluction capacity (95%), as no market constraints are expected; (ii) the
investment per ton of added steel making capacity is much lower than in
greenfield plants and comes in escalated terms to about US$750 compared to
roughly US$1,200 and more for a new conventional plant; and (iii) only a
limited number of additional workers are needed for the expanded production,
both as a result of economies of scale and the existence now of some excess
labor force, which under Turkish conditions, is difficult to reduce.
9.06      Turkey will benefit from Erdemir's steel production with the Stage
II completion by having a plant which will produce at a cost comparable to the
European cost level of plants with similar production capacity. This results
from: (i) utilization of raw materials (mainly local), at a cost not signifi-
canl:ly above international cost levels, (ii) a lower wage bill notwithstanding
a s:Lightly lower production efficiency and fast increasing wages, and (iii) a
reasonable overaLl average investment cost per ton.
B.   Foreign Exchange Savings
9.07      One of the most important benefits Turkey receives from the Stage
II investment is the highly needed foreign exchange savings. At full produc-
tion of these facilities, Erdemir is expected to save about US$95 million
p.a. in real terms after payment of debt services. The foreign exchange saved
by Erdemir as a whole after Stage II is completed is estimated to be about
US$485 million (Ln real terms) after debt service. The payback period for the
total foreign exchange component of the Stage II project is estimated to be
about 3 years from startup. Further details on the foreign exchange effects
are contained in Annex 9-3.
C.   Other Benefits
9.08      Although the Stage II expansion requires only a small additional
labor force, it strengthens the Company, and therewith indirectly provides a
further stimulant for the township of Eregli, which at present is populated
by around 50,000 people and is far from any cultural, commercial and financial



- 39 -
center.  Its growth has been based on the steel plant, where about 8,000
people work in operations and expansion representing, with their families,
about three quarters of the town's population. Turkey will benefit also from
an assured steady local flat steel supply at reasonably competitive costs
as a basis for its steel consuming industries. Local steel production and
better customer service than provided by imports will also be a further
stimulant for a speedy development of the industrial sector in Turkey.
X. PROJECT RISKS
A.   Technical
10.01     Risks associated with project technology, startup and continuing
operations are moderate since all basic iron and steelmaking operations are
to be continued from Stage I and represent conventional modern steel plant
technology. Many of the new facilities to be added under the Stage II proj-
ect are essentially duplicates of the Stage I facilities, e.g., continuous
casting unit, hot strip mill coiler, shear lines, etc. which are already in-
cluded in the Stage I project, so that little or n,o new technology is involved
in most Stage II facilities.
10.02     The BOF shop, at 100% full operating level, would be required
to produce 21,500 heats per year based on two vessel operation. Attainment of
this level may involve some risk and difficulty due to possible problems of
coordinating sustained high level BOF operations with the continuous caster,
ingot teaming and blooming mill. However, the 95% operating rate assumed
for Stage II facilities is considered to be achievable given the product mix
and experience that Erdemir will have had with operating similar facilities.
Also the continuing access to adequate technical assistance and operational
know-how should reduce the risks of abnormal problems, shutdowns and reduced
productivity of Stage II facilities.
B.   Implementation
10.03     The main risk confronting the project appears to be the possibil-
ity of delays in implementation and ineffective cost controls due to diffi-
culties in project management. The problems described previously in Chapter
VI on General Management could have an adverse effect on general management
decision-making, resulting in additional delays. It is expected that the new
approach to Erdemir by the parties responsible for project implementation -
including the Project Engineer - should reduce overall chances of serious
delay in project implementation. However, the problem will require continuous
monitoring by Erdemir and the Bank to avoid problems experienced in Stage I.
C.   Financial
10.04     Notwithstanding the present instability in the economic position
of Turkey, no major (or abnormal) commercial or economic risks are foreseen.
Even on the basis of a conservative market estimate, Erdemir's production
capacity falls behind the Turkish market. Also with the increased production
capacity following the Stage I and, later on the Stage II completion, the



- 40 -
financial position should improve.  However, the financing plan which foresees
that 58% of Stage II project cost will be financed by internally generated
ftmds, depends, in part, on the assumption that Erdemir will be able to
inLcrease its steel selling prices periodically. There are no indications that
the Government will interfere in Erdemir's pricing strategy described in para
8.02.
10.05     Erdemir's operational foreign exchange requirements for importing
raw materials and supplies are moderate, while it will save considerable amounts
of foreign exchange to the Turkish economy. Therefore, if these factors are
recognized no particular difficulties should be experienced in the allocation
of foreign exchange when needed. Moreover, the commitment obtained from the
Government to grant Erdemir the right to import iron ore and coal (para.
4.10) should give further assurance on this aspect.
XI. AGREEMENTS
11.01     The following agreements have been reached with the Turkish Govern-
ment:
(i)  To maintain the semi-private status of the Company
(para. 2.13);
(ii) To coordinate future investment in flat products to
keep planned output in line with expected domestic
markelt growth (para. 3.16);
(iii)  To grant Erdemir the right to import the necessary
amounlts of iron ore and coal (paras. 4.10 and 10.05);
(iv)  To finance local cost, interest during construction,
working capital and any eventual cost overruns, by
equity or quasi-equity, if Erdemir's internally gen-
erated funds are insufficient and certain financial
ratios are not met (para. 7.08);
(v)  The Government will relend the proceeds of the Bank's
loan for Stage II to Erdemir, with Erdemir bearing the
foreign exchange risk (para. 7.09).
11.02     The following agreements have been reached with Erdemir:
(i)  To increase the Company's equity or quasi-equity by
LT 1,200 million (para 2.11);
(ii) To review with the Bank the results of the NKK project
scope review and detailed procurement list (para. 4.04);
(iii)  To maintain a labor force in line with the level recom-
mended by its consultants (para. 4.12);



- 41 -
(iv)   To operate the plant with due regard to ecological and
environmental and safety standards (paras 4.13 through 4.16).
(v)  To continue arrangements for technical assistance and training
(para. 5.06);
(vi)  To appoint key personnel whose capabilit:Les and experience are in
line with functional responsibilities (para 6.05);
(vii)  To secure US$22 million in foreign exchange financing
not later than December 31, 1979 (para 7.07);
(viii)  To set steel prices according to agreed upon criteria
and consult with the Bank on steel price changes
(para 8.02);
(ix)  To restrict dividend payments and new debt under certain
financial conditions (paras. 8.18 and 7.08);
(x)  To maintain a 1.3 current ratio and 60:40 debt/equity
ratio (para 8.18);
(xi)  To restrict investment outside the scope of the project
(para. 8.18);
(xii)  To prepare and review annually with the Bank 5-year
financial projections (para 8.18);
(xiii)  To maintain satisfactory auditing and reporting practices
(para. 8.21).
11.03     The effectiveness of the Bank loan is conditional to:
(i) the effectiveness of foreign loans total:Ling
US$28 million on reasonable terms (para. 7.07), and;
(ii)  the effectiveness of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Borrower and the Company, (para. 7.09).
11.04      Subject to the foregoing commitments and agreements, the project
provides a sound basis for a loan to the Government of Turkey, of US$95
million for a period of 17 years, including 4 years of grace to be onlent to
Erdemir under terms stipulated in para. 7.09.

ERDEMIR STAGE II STEEL PROJECT
PRODUCT MIX - VARIATION AT FULL (100%) OPERAT'ING LEVELS
The following product mix variation (from "originally" to "new") is based
on the Flow Chart Figures on the previous page and is due to omission of No.2
Tinning Line, which is no longer part of the Stage II project. The resulting
"new" product mix for cold rolling and tinning is as follows:
Originall1/            New (Nov. 1977)-/

Total            1,526                     1,535
1/ In both cases, total liquid steel production is 2.0 million tons per year.
2/ Adequate shearing and annealing capacity has already been included in the
program to assure capability to handle additionaL cold rolled tonnage.
Substantial flexibility to respond to changing markeit conditions will permit
changes from mix indicated above.

ERDEMIR STAGE II STEEL PROJECT
TRAINING PLAN
Training for the Stage II project can be broken down into:
(a) training for higher operating (activity)
levels using existing (Stage I) facilities; and
(b) training for new facilities to be added under
Stage II project.
With respect to training for higher activity levels (section (a)
above) the following is planned:
(i) Coordination of BOF and Continuous Casting Operations:
Probably the most complex operational training required for
Stage II will be related to the timing and coordination of
operations at the BOF shop with the two continuous casters
(and ingot teaming) to assure attainment of required produc-
tion levels (21,500 BOF heats per year). Although the
suppliers of the new continous casting machine will provide
for,eign experts, including production engineers,foremen,
maintenance experts, mold preparation men, as needed, l/
the coordination of operations will be controlled by
Erdemir's BOF operating supervision, with specialized
assistance from the Technical Assistance firm employed
(probably US Steel Engineers and Consultants UEC or
Japanese firm with similar qualifications) for specialized
dperating practices and timing and coordination of operations.
UEC is familiar with operating practices at several high
perEormance BOF shops say those producing 20,000 to 30,000
healts/year) on a world-wide basis including six shops in
Japan and one in Holland where over 22,000 heats/year are
being attained under similar operating conditions. 2
For category (b) above, the main new units to be added and type of
train:Lng to be used are indicated below:
(i)  Raw Material Handling - On-the-job training in system coordi-
natLon, unit operations, and especially mechanical/electrical
1/ Estimated to be about 50 man-weeks
2/ See Annex 4-4



ANNEX 5-5
Page 2 of 2
maintenance will be supplied by about six foreign experts,
who will train the Turkish crews;
ii)  Continuous Casting - Although this new unit is to be identical
to the existing Stage I slab caster, it is expected that eight
foreign experts will be required to train Turkish crews for
about 50 man-weeks in all phases of operations and main-
tenance (also see above on "Coordination of BOF and Continuous
Casting Operations")
iii) Scrap Preparations - Much of this operation is manual labor -
with simple burning with oxy-acetylene torches. Erdemir is
already familiar with techniques involved. However, opera-
tion and maintenance of scrap shear and/or scrap press will
be supervised for an initial period by representatives of the
manufacturer under the general control of the BOF shop.
OTHER
Management Information Systems
Erdemir's present management information and cost control system is
judged to be efficient and well suited to present operations, but at much
higher plant activities levels planned for Stage II, additional training and
development of a modern information system will be desired. The type of
system being considered may involve some additional equipment and facilities
of moderate cost, in addition to the training which will be supplied under
the ongoing Technical Assistance Contract as described in paragraphs 5.04
to 5.06.

,TURKEY - ERDEMIR STAGE II STEEL PROJECT
FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Input Data
The incremental internal financial rate of return calculations
for the project are based on a financial cost/benefit stream in 1978 real
terms. These streams have been obtained by:
a) eliminating the general inflationary component from the
working capital and operating costs, but recognizing real
cost increases for raw materials and labor as outlined
in paras. 8.03 - 8.04.
b) calculating revenues based on domestic steel prices in
1978 real term ;
c) taking into account capital investment of US$ 183.3 million
(including working capital but excluding inflationary price
escalation) and a scrap value of 5% after 15 years from the
start up of production in 1982.
All calculations are based on a 19 year period which includes
4 years for construction and 15 years for production.

ANNEX 9-1
Page 1 of 2
TURKEY - ERDEMIR STAGE II STEEL PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
The economic cost and benefit streams have been derived from the
financial projections and cost/benefit streams shown in Annexes 8-1 - 8-5.
All costs and revenues are expressed in real terms and thus eliminate general
inflationary cost increases. In addition, the following assumptions have
been made:
a) Sales are valued at the opportunity cost of importing steel
products to Turkey if the project were not implemented.
Opportunity cost is calculated on the basis of steel price
guidelines recently issued by the U.S. Government and
European Coal and Steel Community, and represents an average
of Turkey's imports from Japan and Europe. The methodology
for deriving the price is discussed in paras. 9.01 - 9.03.
b)  The investment costs are assumed to be the same as in the
financial cost/benefit stream. Scrap value of 5% is assumed
in 1997, after 15 years of production.
c) Indirect taxes estimated at about 10% per year have been
eliminated from the operating cost stream.
d) NoD shadow pricing of labor or foreign exchange has been
assumed since (i) the additional labor force is small,
particularly for unskilled laborers and (ii) the Turkish
cuirrency has been devalued only recently and a new currency
dLsequilibrium is not foreseen in the near future.
