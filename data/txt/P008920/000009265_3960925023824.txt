PROJECT COMPLET1ON REPORT
TURKEY
ERDESMR STAGZ 1I STEEL PROJECT
(LOAN 1606-TU)
EVALUATION SUMMWAY
1.       The  Erdemir  Stage  II  Steel  Project,  (Loar  1606-TU,  US$95.0
million) is the Bank's second lending operation with Erdemir (following
Loan 817-TU, US$76 million). The project vas appraised in October 1977 and
the loan  became  effective  on  July  31,  1979.    The  loan could become
effective only after Erdemir was able to obtain additional financing of
US$20 million, which it did in July 1979 from the Bank of Tokyo. Although
the project went through several changes in design and physical scope
(Sect. II. B. b.), its original components were completed in 1983 about 16
months later  than  appraisal  estimates  (Annex  3-1),  with a su:ltantial
underrun in project capital cost.
2.       Since many praject components  were  relatively independent of one
another, achievement of most expected benefits did not have to await for
completion of the full project. That factor, together with a strengthening
of the world steel industry and Erdemir product price levels in 1987 (Sect.
IV. C. 1.), high production volume, facilitated in part by importing slabs,
and other favorable factors (see Section II) contributed to an estimated
ERR of 252, higher than appraisal estimates of 182. at least if based on
final performance using 1987 data (Sect. VI). Estimated IRR is 202 vs. 18Z
expected at appraisal (Sect. V. C.).    Most key objectives of the project,
i.e.: production volume of total finished product for sale (Sect. IV. A.);
cost reduction, (including energy savings) (Sect. IV. C. 2.); profitability
(Annex 5-1); product quality improvements; financial status of the company
(Sect. V); financial structure; management development (Sect. IV. B.);
technology transfer; ecological protection (Sect. III. C.); and regional
development (Sect. IV. B., III. C.), have all been achieved to a very
reasonable degree. Other goals have not been fully achieved: (i) the
production level of liquid steel is 1.9 million tpy, has not yet been
achieved. The shortfall is 172 (Sect. IV. A.); and (ii) product mix
improvement, i.e. increased tonnage of higher valued cold rolled product in
final product mix is 40Z below targetted levels (Sect. IV. A.).
3.       Business risks for  the  project  are  also moderately higher than
originally expected, mainly because of increased reliance on use of
imported slabs. Those risks could be considered to be acceptable business
risks in the steel industry conditions prevailing over the last decade or
more. However, recent developments in the steel industry point to more
volatility in supply conditions for slabs and the profitability of
importing slabs should be monitored closely by Erdemir in future years.



_ vl -
4.       Based on the facts as known today, the project can be judged to be
essentalaly successful, if not fully.   Further improvement can be expected
in the future.  grdemir's management is  aware of its :ptions and risks and
is taking effectlve measures to maintain its very r-spectable profitability
and  competitiveness.      Furthermore,   Irdemir's   managemnt  has  shown
substantial growth and development since tle project was appraised in 1978,
and has  dmonstrated  high  levels  of  business  aeumn,  flexibility and
initiative  in  formulating  effective   responses  to  changing  technical
parameters  and  business   conditions.         In   the   rourse  of  project
implementation, the company has achieved a sound financial structure and
made a substantial positive contribution to the Turkish economy. All
things  considered,  the  final  results   of  the  Stage  II  Project  are
comendable.

US$20 million, which it did in July 1979 from the Bank of Tokyo. Although
the project went through several changes in design and physical scope
(Sect. II. B. b.), its original components were completed in 1983 about 16
months later  tha.  appraisal  estimates  (Annex  3-1),  with a substantial
underrun in project capital cost.
1.02     Total production  of  finished  flat  products  for  sale exceeded
appraisal estimates in 1984, about one year ahead of appraisal estimates
(Sect.  IV.  A.).l/  However,   early   recognition  of  certain  technical
shortcomings  of  the  project   including  deficiencies  in  liquid  steel
production and product mix, coupled with technological improvements then
being achieved in the world steel industry (higher product quality, cost
reduction, energy savings) -- all led to a further study of project design
and investment alternatives. In 1983, the availability of TJS$27.0 million
still unutilized from the Bank loan led to a request by ERDEMIR to add some
10-12 items to project scope, then designated the "Productivity Improvement
Project" (PIP). Objectives of that component of the project were to (Sect.
II. B. a2, Annex  2-2,  p.  5):    (i)  increase productivity of bottleneck
production facilities; (ii) decrease unit costs of production, and (iii)
substantially improve quality of finished products; and (iv) improve
product  mix  (higher  value  products).        After  separate  and  detailed
technical/economic  justification  of   project   components  by  qualified
consultants U.S. Steel Engineering Consultants (UEC), Bank approval of
financing for 9 of the highest priority components was given, and suitable
extensions of loan closir,g dates were granted to Erdemir by the Bank (Annex
2-3, p. 3). Thus, the "Stage Ii Steel Project' is made up of its original
(appraised) components and the P.I.P. components.2/
1/ That was due in part to utilization of imported slabs rather than
production from liquid steel.
2/ This sequence of events caused late completion of the project and a lag
of final loan disbursements of 4 years behind appraisal estimates.



-2-
1.03     The PIP Project was completed  with  about 6 months delay by early
1987 (Annex 3-2), with a final underrun in total capital cost of 26Z (Sect.
III. H.). Erdemir's production of finished products climbed to 1.8 million
tpy, or 23Z over appraisal estimates, by 1987 (Sect. IV. A.). Financial
performance improved quickly, achieving a very favorable profitability and
cash position in 1987, especially in comparisor to recent norms for the
steel industry (Sect. V. A., Annex 5-1, 5-2). Erdemir's financial outlook
appears to be very favorable for 1988 and beyond.
1.04     Since many project components  were  relatively independent of one
another, achievement of most expected benefits did not have to await for
completion of the full project, That factor, together with a strengthening
of the world steel industry and Erdemir product price levels in 1987 (Sect.
IV. C. 1.), high production volume, facilitated in part by imporr ng slabs,
and other favorable factors (see Section II) contributed to 6 estimated
ERR of 25Z, higher than appraisal estimates of 18X, at least if based on
final performance using 1987 data (Sect. VI). Estimated IRR is 201 vs. 18X
expected at appraisal (Sect. V. C.).    Most key objectives of the project,
i.e.:
1)   Production volume of total  finished  product  for sale (Sect. IV.
A.)
2)   Cost reduction, (including energy savings) (Sect. IV. C. 2.)
3)   Profitability (Annex 5-1)
4)   Product quality improvements
5)   Financial status of the company (Sect. V)
6)   Financial structure
7)   Management development (Sect. IV, 3.)
8)   Technology transfer
9)   Ecological protection (Sect. III. C.)
10)   Regional development (Sect. IV. B., III. C.)
have all been achieved to a very reasonable degree. Other goals have not
been fully achieved:
1. The production level of liquid steel is 1.9 million tpy, has not
yet been achieved.   The shortfall is 17? (Sect. IV. A.).
2. Product mix improvement, i.e. increased tonnage of higher valued
cold rolled product in final product mix is 40? below targetted
levels (Sect. IV. A.).
1.05     Business risks for  the  project  are  also moderately higher than
originally expected, mainly because of increased reliance on use of
imported slabs. Those risks could be considered to be acceptable business
risks in the steel industry conditions prevailing over the last decade or
more. However, recent developments in the steel industry point to more
volatility in supply conditions for slabs and the profitability of
importing slabs should be mon,tored closely by Erdemir in future years.



1.06     Based on the facts as known today, the project can be judged to be
essentially successful, if not fully.   Further improvement can be expo. -d
in the future. Erdemir's management is aware of its options and risks and
is taking effective measures to maintain its very respectable profitability
and competitiveness. Furthermore, Erdemir's management has shown substan-
tial growth and development since the project was appraised in 1978, and
has demonstrated high levels of business acumen, flexibility and initiative
in formulating effective responses to changing technical parameters and
business conditions. In the course of project implementation, the company
has achieved a sound financial structure and made a substantial positive
contribution to the  Turkish  economy.    All  things considered, the final
rtsults of the Stage II Project are commendable.
II. CLARIFICATIONS AND COMMENTS ON BORPOWERS REPORT
2.01     Actual Achievement of Benefits  and Impact on FRR/ERR Calculation.
Section II B of Erdemir's Project Completion Report clearly describes the
physical nature of the project. From an engineering/operational viewpoint,
it can be seen that most project components, especially those in the PIP,
completed in 1986-1987 have only limited linkages to one another. Ths
expected benefits for these components can be derived before completion of
other components.   Thus,  the  apparent  delay  in  completion of the full
project and the very late disbursement of the full Bank Loan, had limited
impact on the overall rate of return for the project. This explains, at
least in part, the very respectable FRR and ERR in spite of delays in
completion.
2.02     The benefits achieved (ANNEX  6-2,  PCR)  zlearly show that almost
immediately  after  Pr;'Ject   Completion,   calendar   year  1987,  Erdemir
experienced a very good year in terms of total production of finished
product,  sales  and   financial   performance.        Metallic  yield,  labor
productivity and coke rate improvements exceeded expectations at appraisal.
Product quality improvement was also tangible but is difficult to quantify.
When compared to 1982-1983 as a BASE period3/ the over 'l benefits are
substantial but it should be noted that some of the benefits may have
accrued from the STAGE I PROJECT, with delayed effect from the normal
learning curve, and from other factors not related directly to the STAGE II
PROJECT. Some of the most important of these are:
1.   Use of Imported Slabs
2.   Increased  Product  Volume  and   Unit  Valuation  Due  to  Market
Conditions
3.   Exchange rate movements
4.   Time Period of Measurement (Costs and Benefits).
3/ Very roughly approximating 1.1 million tpy production level achieved
under the Stage I Project.



- 4-
2.03     The use of substantial tonnages of imp.orted slabs (635,000 tpy in
1987) does expose Erdemir's operations to somev.hat more risk than production
from iron ore and coal (some of which is also imported) since the long-term
availability, price, and supply conditions of slabe can be expected to be more
variable than supply conditions for primary raw materials. Ihe addi'ional
risk of higher dependence on slab imports is judged to be acceptable for now
and is a prudent business decision in the conditions prevailing in 1980's
(over capacity and imbalance in world steel industry). Recognizing the
business risks associated with a higher dependence on imports of slabs,
Erdemir should monitor closely world "arket conditions which may affect future
supply conditions of slabs to determine if their current strategy continues to
be profitable. Also, recent indications (1st quarter 1988) are that Erdemir
can produce more liquid steel and cold rolled product with existing
facilities, as operating practices continously improve. Performance in future
years may be a better indicator of "full achievement" of benefits from the
project, since such large industrial projects normally take several years
after physical completion to achieve their full long-term benefits.2' There
may be certain advantages to delaying preparation of Bank "Project Completion
Reports" by one year or so to reflect accurately full benefits for large,
complex industrial projects.
2.04     The estimated benefits of the project are favorably influenced by a
strengthening of world steel markets in 1987, resulting in increases in
nominal selling pri es for ERDEMIR products by some 10-20% over depressed
1985/86 prices.  That, with appreciably higher sales, had a favorable effect
on the ERR calculation.
2.05     The effect on performance of short term relat-ve price movements,--
etc. can not be easily evaluated at this time.  Analysis of ERDEMIR's
performance in future years would allow smoothing of these short-term factors
to assess long term project benefits.
2.06     The comparison of estimated and actual costs2-  tends to exagerrate
the differences between "actual" expenditures and appraisal estimates in the
category: "Equipment, materials and spares" because of the way in which price
and physical contingencies have been allocated between equipment, materials
and spares and other categories such as civil works and installation. Overall
project cost comparisons are not distorted by this treatment, so detailed
adjustments have not been made.
ONGOING BANK INVOLVEMENT WITH ERDEMIR
2.07     Besides the Stage I (1972), and Stage II (1978) loans, Erdemir has
been allocated US$ 4.75 million from the "Turkish Electric Power Survey and
Development Administration" from a World Bank loan for a Turkish energy
conservation project. Erdemir plans to use this allocation in 1988/1989.
For example, a time lag between increases in product selling prices and
actual changes in production costs (or vice versa) has a major impact on
financial results.
PCR, p. 19



2.08     Erdemir and the Government also plan to pursue further their previous
requests for World Bank or IFC participation in its Capacity Improvement and
Modernization (CIM) Project even if Bank/IFO involvement were limited to
assistance in obtaining other financing or technical assistance for its future
projects.-
ERDEMIR AND TURKISH FUTURE MEMBERSHIP IN EEC
2.09     Erdemir sees potential benefits for its business due to possible
Turkish participation in the EEC (1990-1992) even if terms of membership are
limited. Improvement in quality of finished products attributable to the
Stage II Project coupled with Erdemir's competitive cost structure, could make
future exports to EEC countries potentially profitable, especially as
oversupply in the steel industry declines in the early 1990's.
MANAGEMENT--TRAINING, STAFFING, AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
2.10     In a project with a relatively mature borrower firm (Erdemir has been
operating its plant since 1965) more attention should be given to longer range
plans for management staffing/replacement as older highly-experienced
management staff leave the company for retirement or other purposes. Progress
on Lite next major expansion for Erdemir will require more attention to longer
range management selection, training and development programs.
III. THE ROLE OF THE BANK--PROJECT FORMULATION, APPRAISAL AND SUPERVISION
A. PROJECT COVENANTS
3.01     Several of the legal provisions (Loan Covenants) specified in the
Bank Loan/Project agreements with Erdemir and the government of Turkey proved
to be of major importance for successful project implementation and continuing
operation of the Company. For example:
1) RESTRICTIONS ON COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OR ROUTINE
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS--PROJECT AGREEMENT SECTION 4.04
This covenant proved to be important in assisting Erdemir's
management to conserve limited capital for the requirements of the Stage II
Project. During the period 1979-87 there were several proposals for "outside
investments" that could have potentially diverted funds away from the
project. The covenant ensured that there was very close scrutiny of any
proposed investments outside of the project, and resulted in outright decline
of such requests when clear justification was lacking. Other potential
requests were thought to have been deferred due at least in part, to the
covenant.
'/   IBRD financed the feasibility studies for the CIM and made an initial
evaluation of the project in 1987.



- 6 -
2) RESTRICTIONS ON TOTAL EMPLOYMENT LEVELS (MANPOWER LEVEL)
Project Agreement Section--Side Letter No. 7
This covenant restricts the amount of irdemir's total work force to
levels justified on technical grounds by Erdemir's quaified engineering
consultants (mainly UEC). It is judged by the Company to have been helpful in
maintaining a very gradual increase (122) in permanent work force, especially
during project implementation (1979-87) when plant prcduction levels increased
by over 120X. Without the covenant, Erdemir's work force could have increased
at a faster rate, due to strong pressures to create more jobs as plant volume
increased. The covenant, together with a firm management may have made a
positive contribution to Erdemir's long-term competitiveness.
3) RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS--PROJECT AGREEMENT SECTION 4.05
This provision proved to be valuable in two ways:
1.       It limited dividend payout to Non-Founder Share Holders to maintain
an adequate capital structure and keep Erdemir shares competitive in the
securit.es market.
2.       It severely limited dividend payout to Founder (government) share
holders until project completion. In effect this limitation meant no payout
at all of dividends to Founders Shares until project completion in 1987. The
provision was very helpful in enabling Erdemir to retain funds from earnings
as required to finance the Stage II expansion Project.
4) RESTRICTIONS ON FINANCIAL RATIOS--PROJECT AGREEMENT, SECTION 4.03
This provision proved to be helpful to Erdemir in maintaining a sound
financial structure. For example, in 1984, prior to startin3 the PIP Project,
Erdemir was able to achieve a total capital increase (with Government
cooperation) of TL 5.6 billion, by conversion of tax arrears (4.9 billion TL)
and infusion of added tax funds (0.7 billion TL) as equity. That action kept
tthe company's financial ratios within the limits set by the Project Agreement,
and facilitated Bank approval of financing for the PIP Project and related
extensions of Loan closing dates by three years.
5) COVENANTS TO PERMIT COAL IMPORTS (GOVERINMENT) LOAN AGREEMENT SECTION 4.04
In the world steel industry, one of the most important factors
affecting productivity, product cost and quality, and general competitiveness
is the quality and cost of basic raw materials used in the steel plant. In
many cases non-economic (mainly low quality) raw materials are used solely
because they are available locally, for local currency. In the case of
Erdemir, the company and the Government made the complex analysis required,
and then recognized in the early 1980's that the use of much more high quality
imported coal for steel production was the economic choice, rather than major
expansion of both production and use of local coal. The project was modified
(coal blending facility) to reflect this basic policy decision. It is likely
that the existence of L.A. Sect. 4.04, and follow up by the Bank, including
insistence that the Government make foreign exchange for coal imports



available to Erdemir in times of shortage, contributed to establishing and
implementing the long-term policy on the raw material base of Erdemir and
other Turkish steel plants such as Iskenderun, and helped to increase its
continuing competitiveness in product quality and cost.
6) COVENANT TO PERMIT IRON ORE IMPORTS--LOAN AGREEMENT SECTION 4.04
This provision was already contained in the agreement for the Stage I
Project; and was re-stated for the Stage II Project. It has similar
objectives as for coal imports described above, and facilitated expanded use
of high quality imported iron ore when that was the economic choice.
B. APPRAISAL: PROJECT SCOPE AND ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
3.02     During project formulation and appraisal, the Bank worked closely
with Erdemir, and facilitated (through financing of qualified engineering
consultants) the technical/economic analysis required for establishing
priorities and choosing individual project facilities. One facility which was
removed at the Bank's suggestion, from project scope at appraisal was the
electrolytic tinning line and related equipment (with estimated capital cost
of US$ 110 million), since it was eventually shown to have a FRR of about 3X.
That decision is now considered to have been a sound decision. It was
fortunate, since it increased Erdemir's capacity to sell niore high value cold
rolled products and actual demand for tin plate has been much lower than
expected. Bank promotion of such technical/economic analysis of investment
proposals was felt to be very constructive. The large number of changes in
project scope reflected both the long time period (1978-87) involved in
implementation and Erdemir's efforts to recognize changing conditions of
technology, market requirements, cost factors, etc.
3.03     As with the Stage I Project, the Bank played a key role in promoting
inclusion of pDllution control equipment in the project. Bank involvement
also promoted attention to design, installation and monitoring of that
equipment. Later, supervision by Bank pollution control specialists helped
Erdemir focus on measurement and monitoring techniques for improved long-term
performance of the pollution control equipment.
C. PROJECT SUPERVISION
3.04     Given Erdemir's long association with the World Bank, and the
continuity of contacts established with its management, consultants, and
financing agencies, etc., very effective communications were established,
leading to good understanding of IBRD requirements and practices. In
procurement this led to effective compliance with Bank procurement
requirements. Following Bank procurement guidelines helped to encourage a
high degree of effective competition between suppliers of project components
and hence, efficient utilization of the funds used for the project. Favorable
exchange rates and equipment supply conditions also contributed to that
result. The most important contribution of the Bank in the supervision stage,
however, was to persuade the Government, from time to time, to ensure the
maintenance of the various covenants as outlined in Section III.A above.



-8-
IV. THE ROLES OF THE BORROWER, THE CONSULTANT, AND THE GOVERNMENT
A. ERDEMIR
4.01      Erdemir has come quite close to being an ideal borrower.  Its
management had gained considerable experience during the Stage I expansion.
This was reflected, particularly as the project progressed, both in technical
as well as in administrative matters. The management was very careful in
re-evaluating and detailing their needs to the foreign suppliers when the
strength of the dollar made the purchase of equipment from their "wish-list"
possible. The professionalism of its finance and accounting departments has
also similarly been very reassuring. Uptil now, fortunately, Erdemir has been
able to retain most of their staff who had gained experience from the
expansion projects.
B. NIPPON KOKAN KAISHA (NKK)
4.02     NKK as a consultant to the project has performed the task
successfully. Even though they had come on-board after the project scope had
been decided, they carefully reevaluated the needs and improved upon the
original suggestions. It was one of their very first major foreign experience
but by the end of the implementation period they had been successful in
transferring the responsibilities of operation to the Turkish personnel.
C. THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY
4.03      The Government hxas allowed and continues to allow Erdemir to operate
as a private company in Lhis crucial sector, although it is the major
shareholder of the company. This allows Erdemir Fn have, among other things,
different procurement, personnel, and price setting policies from those of
state enterprises. The project has particularly gained due to the special
policy of the Government towards coal and iron ore imports by Erdemir as
explained in Sections III.A.6 and III.A.7 above.
V. LESSONS LEARNED
A. PRIVATE LEGAL STATUS OF ERDEMIR
5.01     Of all the legal covenarns governing the project, that ensuring that
the private nature of Erdemir witn its clear exemption from laws that apply to
state economic enterprises (concerning employment, salaries, purchasing,
auditing, financing, etc.) would be maintained (Section 4.03 Loan Agreement)
is surely one of the most important. Effective monitoring by the Bank of any
changes that could affect Erdemir's status, such as increases in authorized or
actual share capital, have also helped to assure the continued independent
private sector status of Erdemir.
B. MANAGEMENT
5.02     The quality and competence of management is central to the success or
failure of project implementation and later, operations. In the case of this
project, Erdemir's management demonstrated much more aptitude and willingness
to undertake project management responsibilities than in the earlier project,
and the positive effects on project implementation were tangible.



-9-
C. FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND CHANGES IN PROJECT SCOPE
5.03     This project experienced a higher than normal degree of changes in
technical scope of the project, due in part to changes in engineers consulting
from (UEC) to Nippon Kokan Kaisha (NKK). The long period between initial
feasibility and final engineering studies (5-6 years) and the changes in state
of the art technology during that time, contributed to additional changes in
scope. For future projects in fields where technical change is rapid the
feasibility btudies should be carried out not more than one to two years
before project implementation.
D. SELLING PRICE COVENANT
5.04     The covenant on product selling prices proved difficult to administer
in a inflationary economy; a simplified (more automatic) formula based on
agreed criteria proved necessary and was subsequently developed.
E. PROJECT SUPERVISION
5.05     Although project supervision by the Bank can be judged as very
effective, it required more time than anticipated at appraisal. More use of
Borrower personnel to assist in Bank supervision work could be considered for
future projects.
F. PROCUREMENT - LOCAL PREFERENCE FOR TURKISH GOODS
5.06     The application of a continuously variable preference system for bid
comparison of locally produced of goods with foreign goods proved to be a
practical system which benefited the project. This system used a sliding
scale of local preference from 0-15% based on the local value added; 15% was
only provided when local content was 100%. Wider use of that system for the
procurement of goods in other Bank industrial projects could be considered.
(Also see Section F., page 16, PCR).
G. CO-FINANCING
5.07     Erdemir feels that Section 6.01 c of the Loan Agreement, requiring
that agreements for suppliers credits be concluded as a condition of
effectiveness proved ultimately to (1) increase financing costs of the
project, and (2) cause a delay of about 1 year in the effectiveness of tb-
Bank loan. It is felt that this provision weakened Erdemir's negotiating
position with potential lenders, causing a long delay in reaching acceptable
borrowing terms. Ultimately, Erdemir settled for what it considered only
marginally acceptable terms (8 1/2% interest rate, payable in Japanese Yen, 8
year repayment). It is possible that additional help from the World Bank in
making arrangements for suppliers credits could have alleviated the problem.



- 10 -
INSTITUTION BUILDING
5.08     Erdemir's senior management thinks that the most important "Lesson"
learned from the project is the high level of discipline requiied of the
Borrower to participate in a World Bank financed project. That discipline
affected
1.   Feasibility studies, project justification
2.   Procurement procedures
3.   Organization of implementation, cost controls
4.   Financial controls and structure
5.   Management information systems (and decision making)
That discipline continues with Erdemir's ongoing operations and expansion
projects. Bank inputs were costly in terms of staff time, but brought
substantial benefits. Direct project lending of this type makes it possible
for the Bank to "transfer" techniques of managerial discipline such as these.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
ERDEMIR STAGE II STEEL PROJECT
(LOAN 1606-TU)
April 1988
Eregli Demir ve Celik Fabrikalari, T.A.S.
(ERDEMIR)



- 13 -
1- INTAOUTIDN
The Government of Turkey and Ere4li Demir ve Celik Fabrikalarl, T.A.5.
(Erdemir) have requested the Bank's participation in the financing of
Stiaq II Expansion of Erdemir steel plant to increase the annual iiquid
steel production capacity from 1.5 to 2.0 million metric tons per year
(tpy), equivalent of 1.1 to 1.5 million tpy of finished products,
respectively.
ERDEMIR which was officially established as a company on.0ay 1960, started
operations in 1965. It is Turkey's only integrated steel plant for production
of flat product, and its production is expected to continue falling short
of domestic market demand.
Total financial requirements for the project, including interest during the
construction, were estimated, at appraisal to be US$ 341.8 million with
US$ 173.1 million in foreign exchange. The Bank loan (US$ 95 million)
would therefore provide 28 ? of the total and 55 " of the foreign exchange
needs of the project. Bilateral financing sources, primarily European banks,
internally  generated funds, and in case these are insufficent, newly paid
tu equity would provide the remainder of the funds required.
The Stage II Expansion Project  which, originally, was a single project
was completed by the end of 1987. It was comprised of two projects namely;
Stage II Expansion Project and PrAictivity InproiffEnt Project. The prodictiac level hps readie
to 1.5 mil'icin tomes flat products in 1984 ard 1.65 millicn taTes in 198;. kid the actual
cost realized for the whole project was US% 251.8 million of which US$ 139
million was foreign exchange.   Withdrawals from  the Bank loan of
US$ 95 million had been completed in May 1987.
In 1972 the Bank granted its first loan (Loan 817 TU of US$ 76 million)
for Erdemir's Stage I Expension Project and it has been paid back totally
in 1987. The Stage II Project was presented to the Bank in December 1976 and
appraised in October 1977 by a mission consisting of Messrs. O'Neil (Chief)
and Roet of the Industrial Projects Department aid Mr. Maffei of the Legal
Departm,nt.

A- ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT
During the second half of the 1970's Turkey experienced a severe and
prolonged foreign exchange crisis as well as a serious deterioration of
the domestic Cconomy with a combination of low economic growth, high
inflation rates and labor strikes. In response to the financial crisis
of late 1970's the Turkish Government started a reform program, so
called January'24 decisions, with the objective of growing through
free-enterprise system. So that a number of sub-programs were put into
operation for establishing financial stabilization, switching the
orientation of economy outward, changing the role of the public sector,
supporting the private sector for leading economic growth.
With the rescheduling of foreign debts and international financial
asistance the reforms were verysurtessful in improving the financial
position of the Country and in promoting structural adjustment. Sir e
then macroeconomic performance has improved and creditworthiness in
the international financial markets has been re-established.
The growth rate in GNP had been negative in 1979 and 1980, - % 0.4 and
- ' 1.1 respectively, as a result of deteriorating domestic economy and
baiance of payment crisis in late 1970's. But the results of January
1980 decisions were seen since 1981 and real growth rate in GNP has
been % 4.1, 4.6, 3.2 in the years 1981, 1982, 1983 respectively. After
the Civilian Government had taken the office in 1983, the real growth
rate in GNP has increased and been % 5.9, 5.1, 8 and 6.8 for the years
1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.
The most remarkable performance has been in the field of exports since
the reform programs wre put into action. Despite the adverse effect by
the considerable slowdown in international trade growth exports have
increased three times from 1980 to 1985 and it became 8 billion US
dollars in 1985. It was slowed to 7.5 billion dollars in 1986 but it
has picked up since and the latest estimate for 1987 was 10 billion
dollars (It is a provisional figure). Ott the other hand imports has
been increasing since 1980. Although this kept foreign trade deficit
without mich iipnoemnt in dollar figires,  the  ratio of imports covered by
exports went up to % 72 in 1987 from % 37 in 1980.



- 15 -
The rate of domestic inflation, though decelarating since 1980, remains in
high levels and is a major source of concern at the present. In fact it had
decreased until 1989 and it was 29 Xo in 1986 (State Institute of Statistics'
wholesale price index).
But it paced up in 1987 due to referandum made and general elections took
place on Nov. 29, 1987. The wholesale price index of State Institute of
Statistics is 49.9 Z for the year 1987.
The political environment has been very stable since the Military took over
on Sept. 12, 1980. The Military left its place to Civilian Government in 1983
with general elections. The positive effects of stability in the political
environment has seen in the economy as well as the top management of State
Economic Enterprises and Erdemir. In the case of Erdemir, this stability has
payed its tolls and caused no major delays and other project difficulties.
B- THE TURKISH STEEL SECTOR 1/
The berinning of a modern steel industry in Turkey goes back to 1930's with
the construction of the Karabuk integrated steel plant in northern Turkey,
folloved by Erdemir, the second integrated steel producer which began operating
in 1965. A thirj plant, Isden,hir at Iskenderun in South Turkey, constructed
with Russian assistance, started production at the end of 1976. Today, there
also exist in Turkey, in addition to the three integrated plants in Eregli,
Karabuk and tskenderun, which produce steel by processing hot metal from iron ore
installation with are-type furnaces which produce steel by processing scrap.
The total crude steel output of Turkey was increased from 2.5 million tonnes in
1980, to over 7 million tonnes in 1987. In this era when there are plans in many
countries to close down existing plants and to attain a capacity utilization rate
of over Z 70, Turkey has used its crude steel capacity (about 8.9 million tonnes)
very well and has attained a crpacity utilization of 79 %. 52 Z of this capacity
is that of the integrated plants while the remaining 48 % is that of the electric
furnaces ( 27 Z in the early 1980's).

In the periods ahead, though, it is aimed to attain the production level of
7.5 million tonnes at the end of the 5 th five-year Development Period (in 1989)
and 10 to 11 million tonnes at the end of the 6 th five-year Development period
(in 1994). At this level of production, tre demand for flat products is UqNcted to
b 4.5 nillian ta*.The demand for flat products is expected to be 8 to 9 million
tonnes in the early 2000 a. It is therefore necessary to adopt soonest the
measures for production of flat products in particular.
C- ERDEMIR - THE COMPANY
1. Origin
Erdemir which was established in 1960 occupies approximately 4 million square
meters of land near the comunity of Ereli, on the Black sea. Eregli is located
about 200 kilometers ease of Istanbul and 190 kilometers north of Ankara, which
is the headquarters city for the Company. Erdemir began full aperations in
March 1965 after a 43-month design and construction period with a rated annual
raw steel production capacity of 470.000 tonnes (378.000 tonnes of finished steel
products) and a total investment in fixed assets of US$ 255 million. With
relatively minor additions included i  *.ts "truncated expansion" of 1969-1972,
its annual liquid steel cqxity wa ierrasd  to 800.000 tonnes (545.000 tonnes of
finished steel products). In 1973 it embarked, with the Bank's financial
participation, on its first major expansion (Stage I) which increased
its annual liquid steel production capacity to 1.5 million tonnes (1.1 million
tonnes of finished products).
2. Stage I Expansion Project
In 1972, loan agreements were ratified for the financingof the stage I Expansion.
Engineering and construction began in that year. The stage I Expansion was
completed in the fourth quarter of 1978.
The addition of the Stage I facilities increased the liquid steel making
capacity to 1.5 million tonnes per year (1.1 tonnes finished flat products),
which was an increase of I million tonnes during the first 13 years of operation
(1965-78). The total cost of the project was USS 527.4 million and the total
investment in fixed assets was USS 433.3 million. For this stage the Bank
granted its first loan of USS 76 million (Bank Loan No.817 TU ).



- 17 -
3- Staqe II Expansion Project
A further increase in production was the subject of a more recent investigation,
the results ot which indicated a potential 2.0 million tonnes of liquid steel
could be realized trom the Stage I plant by installing certain facilities
judiciously selected to eliminate bottlenecks  nd by att.ning the full potential
of the coke, iron, and steel making units. Consequently, the Stage II Exp-ssion
plan as adapted by Erdemir.
As Stage I1 facilities were being completed, Erdetr recognized the need to provide
new or modified facilit4es for consistent attainment of 2.0 million tonnes /yr,
together with substantial improvement in cost perform nce, and product quality, and
decreasing energy consumption. A project, 'ERDEMIR Productivity Improvemente(P.l.P) mE
completed in 1987, on which construction began in 1964.
Thus the full Stage II project, including PIP was completed by the end of 1987,
increasing the production of flat finished products to 1.650.000 tomes, and giving
experience to Erdemir engineers to carry out all baaic project management functions
more effectively not only for this project, but also for the further projects.
4- Ownership  nd Control
Ereli Demir ve Celik Fabrikalari T.A.5. (Erdemir) was formally established
in M4ay 11, 1960 as a private sector enterprise under special Law No.7462
and Decree No.4-12975 of 1960. Subsequently the authorized share capital
was increased from R. 510 to It. 600 *illion under Law No.335 of 1961, and
from R. 600 million to 1.40 billion under Lecree No.83/7261 of 1983. Then
the outstanding capital has been increased from 1. 600 million to 11.28.8
billion from the revaluation fund and from 1. 28.e billion to 1.38.4
billion by public offering in 1984. The outstanding capital has been paid-up
and registered so by the Register of Comerce of Ankara in 1985.
Erdemir's Articles of Assocation provide that the Company be operated as
a private enterprise regardless of the extent of the Gdvernmet's shareholding.
Thus, the Company is free from the legal constraints under which State Economic
Enterprises (SEE'S) operate (e.g. salary limitations, financial regulations,
purchasing controls, staffing etc.).The Government owns 51.5 Z of the paid-up
capital. This shareholding has been equally held by two SEE'S, SUmerbank and
Turkiye Demir ve Celik Illetmeleri Genel W.dirluOu until 1987. Then, in 1987,
the stock certificates held by Sumerbank and TOrkiye Demir ve Velik tIletme-
leii Genel rxdMrlOu transferred to Toplu Konut ve Kamu Ortaklii Idaresi



- 18 -
(Mass Housing   and Public Partnership Administration) under the Law No.3291
of 1986 for the purpose of privatization. Until 1974, Koppers Associates S.A
(Zurich) and other foreign investors owned about 18.9 % and 1.8 % respectively of
Erdemir'r paid-up capital.As anticipated during project appraisal, these foreign
shareholdings were gradually acquired by local commercial and investment banks
during 1975 and 1976. At present, these private institutional investors, including
Erdemir employee pension furd and private individuals together account for the
remaining 48.5 % of capital in Erdemir. (Annex 1-1)
The Company's private sector status is of great significance to the success of
the project and long-term Company operations. Privatization in Turkey which has
already started, includes public ownership of Erdemir . This national trend is
expected. to-contribute to strengthening of the private sector status of the CalVy.
53 Organization and Management
Erdenir's Boaed of Directors consists of 9 members. Who are elected for three
years. The Board has usually composed of industrialists, politicians and
formcr Erdemir managers. The general direction, management and control of the
business and affairs of the Company is by the Board of Directors and with the
power to appoint the president of the Company. The Board delegates to the
president of the company such powers and duties as she deems fit and proper.
Executive management of the Company is conducted by the president who may be
the Board hember which it is the present situation. If the president is not a
Member of The Board, he attends the board meetings. The President is assisted
by six vice presidents, responsible respectively for operations, sales, finance
purchasing, personnel and industrial relations, and expansion. Up to the end
of 1973, Erdemir's board and top management was characterized by continuity
and stability. Howevei, starting in 1974 up to 1982, there was a succession of
seven presidents (Annex 1,2) including frequent changes in the board of
membership and other top management personnel. Quite a continuity has been achieved
in the presidency since 1982. There have been two including the present
president since then. The stability and continuity,re-established to a certain
degree, installed securityand apositive  atmosphere in the management structure
creating no serious problems for the implementation of the project.

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Irigin Preparation and Justification
A Component of the .Stage I Project and the long term Technical Assistance
Agreement between UEC and ERDEMIR ,financed from loan 817 TU,UEC prepared
the Feasibility Report for Expansion Stage II in March 1976. This report
was taken up and reviewed by NKK in 1978 who were selected as the ENGINEER.
The cost of the project was estimated at 301.1 million US dollars of which
150.5 million US dollars was the required foreign portion, whereas the IBRD
limit was 95 million US dollars. The difference was to be financed by others.
The content of the project package was finalised by the parties concerned,
ie ERDEMIRI WORLD BANK,UEC and taking into consideration the above
mentioned revisions of the feasibility report and loan availabilities.
As a result, there were considerable changes in the initial
scope mainly due to :
- Limited time for adequate data collection needed for the original
feasibility studies.
- Considerabl long time between the issue date of the original report
and authorization for iinplimentation mostly caused by the processes
to reach loan agreements.
- Concept changes and/or technological improvements during the
elapse time.
- Change of engineeer/technical assistance(Japan/USA)
This experience shows that preparatory process time and the technical
precision needed should be very carefully balanced.Also the OWNER must
continuously be in the process of reviewing and appraising its requirements.
With Ustinformation, the company can more efficienctly initiate the
preparation phase of a project.

B. Project Description and Objectives
a. Original Concept
*l- Expansion Stage II.Project
The main objective of Erdemir Expansion Stage II Project
covered two major areas:
- The realization of the inherent full capacity of the
3 vessel 8OF Shop of 2.0 million tonnes per year and,
- The " round out" of finishing and auxiliary facilities to
complement the aforementioned steel capacity.
The round-out type of expansion planned for Stage II eliminated the
steelmaking bottleneck and provided a facility complement which will
maximize profit. The detailed list of equipment included in the
original scope is shown in Annex 2-1 Page 1.
a2- Productivity Improvement Project :
As Stage II facilities were being completed, Erdemir recognized the need
and cost justification of providing new or modified facilities
for consistent attainment of 2.0 million ton potential, further
improving cost performance, improving product quality , and decreasing entrgy
consumption. The results of the Feasibility Study for the Erdemir
Productivity Improvement Project is summarized below.
1. Facility modifications or additions required to produce uniform,
high quality hot metal at an annual rate of 1,785,000 tons.
2. Facility modifications or additions required to produce quality
steel at an annual rate of 2,000,0OO tons.
3. Significant improvements in quality of finished products,
cost reduction,and energy savings.



- 21 -
4. Facility'modifications or additions to produce 11650,000 tons of
finished product.
I Productivity Improvement Project' began in 1983 after release
of remaining part of Bank Loan, US$ 27 million. The detailed list
of equipment included in this project scope is shown in Annex
2-1 Page 2.
b. Changes in Project Scope
Due to the reasons explained in paragraph A above the following
changes in project scope were made.
bl. Expansion Stage II Project
1. Third downcoiler of Hot Strip Mill was cancelled because
more detailed studies,done after appraisal-together with
operating experience      actually achieved in the interim,
showed that at the production magnitude of approximately 1.7
million t/y of hot coil could be maintained by two existing
down coilers even if one of them was stopped occasionally,
2. In order to prevent the escape of fine particles, bag filter
type dust collecting system was preferred fur Sinter Plant.
3. Instead of one additional non-electric drive for Salt Water Pump,
two additional drives namely two non-condensing steam turbines
were selected.In the studies, it is calculated that emergency
cooling water requirement for the facilities could only
be provided with adequate security by two additional
non-electric drives.
4. The 4 th Hot Stove for second Blast Furnace was not found
strictly necessary under consideration of actual operational
characteristics,related to the existing local iron ore and
coal percentages in the burden which did not permit to obtain
the high blast air temperatures foreseen in the feasibility
study. For that reason,this item was cancelled at that time.



- 22 -
5. A new Roll Shop for Hot Strip Mill was installed to provide
required service at higher cperating levels.(1.65 million
-t/y .level)
6. Other chenges,resulting frm more detailed engineering studies
included.
- The equipment and layout of BOF Scrap Preparation facilities
was modified.
- Some minor additions in Hot Strip Mill were cancelled.
- Similar additions in Hot Rolled Finishing facilities
were cancelled.
- Some additions of Cold Rolled Finishing Facilities were
cancelled.
- Some additional facilities were decided to be installed in
scope of General Utilities and Services.
More detail of the changes are given in Annex 2-2 Page 4
and detailed list of project facilities (as actually installed)
are given in ANNEX 2-3 Page 1 and 2.
b2.Productivity Improvement Project
1. Since only one fully responsive bid could be obtained
for this bid package, and the technology of this system was in
rapid transition and improvement at that time , a clear decision
could not be reached about reagent to be used. As a result Hot
Metal Desulphurization and Reagent Plant were postponed to
another expansion project.
2. The scope of Sinter Plant Improvements was changed in some
details, and in order to prevent the separation of limestone
and dolomit in stock area,keeping these materials in the
silos was decided, instead of open storage.
3. In order to provide a more secure source of high quality
burnt lime, (which is necessary in steel production) the
capacity of Burnt Lime Plant was increased,without increasing
the energy consumption and the cost of the project
proportionally.



- 23 -
Thus one of the existing p.Its could produce dolomitic lime
wich is necessary to increase the refractory life of B.O.F
vessels,thereby achieving higher effective BOF steel making
capacity at low cost.
4. Taking care of the request of market and extra energy needs
of the system, the scope of Ladle Refining System was changed
Induction stirring,heating by are furnace, vacuum degassing
were deleted,a siqpler argon stirring and sampling system was
installed.
5. Due to inadequate capacity of normal pressure air,General Service
Compres5Jr was installed adjacent to Tandem Mill.
6. The capac_ty utilization of Hot Scarfing Facility would be low
and due to high material yield losFes , it was cancelled.
Also the full investment cost of this system has been
found four time higher than the budget figures due to the
neccesity of a new scale pit and an electrostatic precipitator,
and major modifications to the existing roller table and flume
channel, making the economics of the investment clearly
unsatisfactory.
A detailed list of project facilities (as actually installed are given
in ANNEX 2-3 Pg.3.
C.Environiiental and Community Linkages-Present and Future:
The Expansion Stage II Project was a step contemplated in the overall
"Master Plan" of ERDEMIR with a goal of achieving 2 million ton/yr liquid
steel capacity as well as meeting environmental expectations. From the first
operation days on, economical life in the vicinity rapidly changed from
agricultural type to industrial. This was a trend in the whole country
but exceptionally obvious in this region which has very limited cultivable
land. Demands of freshly developing satelite-industries and job
expectations of the unemployed had to be met. This project also tried
to balance thA aforementioned environmental pressure.



- 24 -
Effective measures were taken against pollution of the regional air and water
resources by improving existing units.Mojor new facilities such as Phenol
Treatment Plant) Ammonia Absorption and Recovery Unit, Sinter Plant Dust
Collecting System were installed, at an estimated S 1O million capital cDst.
For example, the biological effluent treatment plant (for Coke Plant Wastes)
suggested for inclusion in the project by the World Bank, (at a cost of
about S 3 million) has been operating successfully-and has achieved full
compliance with Turkish environmental regulations. Its operating performance,
monitored by continous chemical testing of effluent discharwges, has been
fully satisfactory.
There were not major infrastructure problems related with the plant and
Ereli. Town sewage system,which discharged raw sewage into the Black
Sea prior to initiation of the project,is being renewed. Roads outside of
Ereli town are to be improved to handle the higher volume of truck
traffic transporting the products of Erdemir.
The overall scheme of ERDEMIR had been defined in the ambitious
III Expansion Project. Due to great investment cost and worldwide
crisis in the steel industry at the time, ERDEMIR decided to re-pi >e
this scheme with a more realistic one called Capacity Improvement
Project, CIM in early 1980's. At present ERDEMIR is in the process
of preparation for the implementation of the first step of this project.

III. PROJECT IWLEDENTATION AND WALGEMENT
A.   Achievement  of ProJect Objectives
in this respect the Stage II Expansion Project, including the
Productivity Improvement projectlis judged by the cobpany to be
fully successful. All majc- performance indices and objectives
were achieved.'"       totally 25 facilities or units different in nature,
only one,namely Scrap Preparation Unit performane test results was
13% less than the designated productivity figure. All of the these
installations have sin-ce been operated successfully. Production levels
stipulated in the Loan Agreement were successfully achieved over the
ninety day period ending October 31,1987. (See"Bank Comments"section for
additional information)
B.   Project '-ope
Scope of the main work items of the concerned parties to implement both
Expansion Stage II and PIP are described below.
As the owner, ERDEMIR top management had full responsibility for the
projects, while IBRD enforced its guidelines and followed the progress
closely.
The project management was given to a group consisting of NKK and
assigned ERDEMIR personnel. NKK was responsible for project management,
engineer..ng and related services. In the PIP project the project management
responsioilities were distributed among related departments,namely
Engineering ,Purchasing, Financing and Administration departments,while
an advisory role was given to UEC Consultants.
The main equipment suppliers were responsible for engineering ,manufacturing,
erection-supervision,startup and performances of the. contracted facility
whereas ERDEMIR force-Account Group or local contractors undertook
the foundation building and erection works.
ERDEMIR also supplied material and equipment other than those covered
under suppliers contracts.
1/ A qualification on this statement is given in "Bank Comments" Sections Aawd B



- 26 -
C.   Project Management
In the light of experience gained during the 1 st.Stage Expansion
Project a responsible project management team for Stage II was
established with participation of Nippon Kokan Kaisha(NKK)
and Erdemir engineers. All basic project management functions were
carried out by this group more effectively than the previous (stage I)
project.
Management of implementation for the Productivity Improvement Project
was performed by a limited group in a manner of distributed (dispersed)
responsibilities to the Company's functional departments.Since,the
project was relatively small and implemented by experienced personnel,
reflection of managerial difficulties to the schedule was kept at the
minimum , as shown in minor delays actually experienced in project
implementation.
D.   Use and Performane of Consultants
NKK's role and responsbility was essential in the initial phase of
the Stage II Project. NKK performed the task successfully despite
the fact that it had beentheir very first major foreign experience,and
served as a learning experience for them . ERDEMIR's involvement in
the project gradually increased and nearing the end of theimplementation
period,the management of the project was practically transferred from
Japanese to Turkish personnel in order to keep the man-month figures
and costs under a foreseen level.
Although anl ongoing  technical assistance  agreement existed  forthe Stage II
Project,UEC's role in the implementation and management was practically
none. UEC was used mainly for improvement in plant operational aspects
at that time. For the PIP however,UEC acted as the consulting engineer
for ERDEMIR Expansion Group. Their consulting and advising services
obtained mostly during the technical /economic cost justification phase
(required by IBRD for financing approval), and specification preparation,
technical negotiation and bid evaluation phases of the project all in
all, the performance  of consultants can be judged to be satisfactory



- 27 -
E. Implementation Schedule
The following analysis id based on the initial schedule given in the
appraisal report.
1. Major facilities of Stage II Project. effecting production directly,
appear as delayed about 12-16 months .This my be attributed mainly to
inadequate forecast during the programming. Some minor general
facility items show delays even more than one year. In this case,
suppliers are responsible for the additional delays with insufficient
management of their procurement, supervision,etc. Facilities such as
Ammonia Absorption and Recovery Unit and Roll Shop will have to be
considered as new items which started andfinished later than the
others ,due to their late inclusion in project.
2. Productivity Improvement Project implementation program shows
an overall delay of about half a year. In this case delay is mainly
due to interferences of the operations with the construction;
as the modification works were mostly executed during plant shut
downlto avoid lost production /sales, and cost impact of additional
shut-downs of production units involved.)
3. Please see ANNEX 3-1 and 3-2 for illustrative bar graphs showing
actual release dates and start up dates for all major facility
items,as compared to IBRD appraisal estimates.
4. The financial impact-of the delays discussed above-was moderated
somewhat by the nature of project facilities-i.e. many faclities,
(especially in PIP project) are mostly independent, with limited
inter-dependence with other   production units, Thus acheivement of
benefits was not delayed for completion of "Whole Project" (see Bank
comments)

F- Procuremnt. Perforamnce of Suppliers / Contractors, Allocation and
Oiiru.mo  t of 0bnk Lomi
Procurement procedures were in accordance with the bank's guidelines and
international competitive bidding procedures. The details of procurement
procedures up to the selection of the successful bidder were outlined clearly
in the loan agreement 1606-TU. These procedures were designed to maximize
effective competition for supply of equipment and services leading to the lowest
possible costs. The technical specification were prepared to a great extent with
the help of consulting engineers, NIPPON KOKAN, JAPAN. Effective competition for
most bid packages was obtained,"d favorable prices were actually obtained
(v  appraisal), even thouch supply from Japan was predominant. The overall
procurement was effected and realized with Erdemir's own personnel who had a
long experience in such type of project work. In order to expedite the procurement
works the procurement to a great extent was comprised of large packages with
single contractor responsibility.
Since some Turkish firms could be considered pre-qualified for that type of
oveml contact responsibility, Erdemir and the Bank developed and agreed on a
preference system unique to the bank under which qualified Turkish Suppliers
could participate in bidding either directly or in conjunction with qualified
foreign bidders, and Turkish componentswere awarded a 15 % preference on the
CIF cost of imported equipment (or the customs duty-whithever was lower) on a
graduated scale-which gave a continous incentive to increase Turkish supply.
The actual bidding, technical and commercial evaluation and award of purchase
orders were fully satisfactory. Civil and relocation work.s to a great extent
were realized by Erdemir's own personnel force-account groups. Erectio   orks
were bid    competitively in Turkey and financed from E-demir's own funds.
For smaller size items the suppliers were less successful in meeting theschedule
reoriirwts of the project. Steem Turbines for Salt Water ad Dist Collecting For Siuter Plant
are typical examples. Those suppliers who preferred large ruters   of partial
s,ipaets often failed to attain the main target because of the complexity of the
systems.Local stippliers and local construction contractors were however more
successful in comparison with their achievements in previous expansion projects.
The following table shows the sources of supply of itmes financed by the IBRD,.
Interalliance, and Bank of Tokyo.

G Project Capital Cost
The installed cost (i.e., excluding interest during the construction and
incremental working capital) of the project was US$ 226.6 million (R.62.442
million) which was about 25 % lower in US dollar terms than the appraisal
estimate of US$ 301.1 million (R. 27.080 million of that R.4,300 million is
the budget of II. Stage Project which was estimated in 1979,and A. 22.779,
million is the budget of Productivity Improvement Project (PIP) which was
estimated in 1984. The PIP has been realized as a complementary project of
the Stage II Project to increase productivity and decrease costs. In this
sectionthe Sta  II Project and PIP are considered together as Stage II Project).
The Appraisal included interest during the construction (IDC) in the project
cepital cost estimnte and financirg plan in the awnat, of LE$ 20.4 milicrn. At the time
of budgeting it was the practice of Erdemir,enforced by the regulations,not
to capitalize IDC but to charge IDC directly against current operations or
income, which has the effect of deferring some income tax liabilities into
future. But then this practice was changed and Erdemir has capitalized IDC.
The actual IDC was about US$ 21.2 millionard was in foreign exchange as a whole.
The appraisal capital cost estimate including the IDC, and the actual cost,
is shown below.
* A list of the varicus foreign exchange rates in effect during 1980-1987 is
shown in Annex 3-2. These costs are in current terms that is they represent
the sum of the actual yearly disbursements throughout the implementation
period and therefore are a combination of liras or US dollars of different
purchasing power.

The actual total financing for the project, including IDC was USS 251.8
million or about US$ 90 million (26 %) less than the appraisal. About USS
55.9 million (62 X) of this cost underrun was in local currency. US$ 34.1
million underrun in foreign exchange cost correepaided to suppliers credit as
s %*ole (U5S$ 23 million) and the portions of Interallianz and Tokyo Bank
Low- not used and US 0.8 million interest overrun. If the US$ 34.1
million cost underrun in the direct foreign exchange cost, about USS 23.3
million was related to the equipment material and spare cost and USS 10.3
was related civil works, installation and miscellaneous. The rest which is
immaterial is the sumary of over and underruns in engineering,freight,and
insurance and technical assistance costs.
This underrun (USS 34 million) in direct foreign exchange cost is mostly
due to over-pricing in appraisalsl/Althought shifting some items from foreign
to local procurement, making some changes in the scope of   the project and
the experience gained during the I. Stage have some effects on the cost savings
it is extremely difficult to quantify these effects together and/or the effect
of each factor.
A Detailed analysis of the local currency cost underrun is shown in Annex 2-6
and the total cost underrun is summarized below. The largest local cost
underrun, at about US$ 77.3 million was in equipment, materials and spares
and most of it is due to estimating errors. The largest cost overrun which
was local was in pre-operating expenses. It is USS 19.6 which is due to change
in scope.
* Undoubtedly different proportional changes in foreign exchange rates and
local prices would effect these cost underruns since local current sppndings
converted into dollar by current exchange rates during the implementation.
Also there is a limited effectiveness of cost controls. But it would be very
difficult to quantify these.
1/ The over estimation (over pricing) done at time of appraisal (1978) was almost
entirely due to excessive provision of "Price Contingencies" (Which totalled
U% 101.3 milion); The iwract of the oil hxck-wd actual cost umernsu  seriarced in Stap
I Project (1971-78) influenced Bs estimates an price ccntirnencies.

The appraisal financing plan foresaw that 54 X (USS 196.8 million)
of the project financing requirements, excluding IOC, would be
fia-med fres Erdamir's internally generated funds fro its operationa
with the balance of 42 S (USS 145 million) being financd rrom
foreigd lons and suppliers credits. The details of the actual financing
patternis shown in Annx 3-4. It shows almost equal external (USS 117.8
million, 47 %) and internal (USS 134 million, 53 %) financing.
As it actually turned out, arter the Stage II Project was fully financed,
but before PIP, there was USS 27.7 left unutilized in the World Bank Loan,
toward completion of Stage II. facilities Erdemir recognized the need
to provide new or modified facilities for more consistent attainment of
2.0 million ton capacity, improving cost performance substantially,
improving quality of'finished products and decreasing energy consumption.
With this understanding, Productivity Improvement Project (PIP) began in
1983 after release of remaining part of Bank Loan (US$ 27.7 million) until
May 31, 1987 which was the final(izfixm) enstinn of cloing d3e for Ute Iw.
During 1978-1982 including 1982, the extnt of overrun in local spendings
was determined and it became apparent that Erdemir's projected cashflow
could not cover the additional financing requrLd.The Be* therefcoe bapi a
protracted dialogue with the Government and Erdemir to increase the
capital. As a result,Erdemir capital was increased by It. 9,600.0 million
(nominal value) in 1984;of that 1. 5,100.0 was capitalized against tax
liabilities. Thus US$ 22.2 was actually   added to Erdemir funds from
the capital increase to finance the project and to satisfy the covenant
on the current ratio.
About US% 67.0 million withdrawals from the World Bank Loan (US% 95.0
million in total) took place during 1979-1983 to finance the Stage II
Facilities. But, for the reasons explained before,in 1983, PIP Project
was activated and remaining USS 27.7 million was released and disbursed
during 1983-1987 to complete the project.         Meanwhile, total suppliers
credit and portions of the Bank of Tokyo and Interallianz Bank Loans was
cancelled for the renmm explained in earlier sections.

Iv - PROJECT OPERATION :
A. Production and Sales :
The implementation of the Stae II Expansion Project started in 1978
and mft mkjw fikilities incluc d in the project were btx4t into
operation in 1982. Some other facilities and equipment which were
added in the project during the implementation, were
finished and started to operate in 1983.
The main objectives of the project were
- To realize the full capacity of BOF Shop of 2 Million per year.
- The "round out" of finishing and auxiliary facilities comple-
ment the proposed steel capacity. Thus, to reach a finished
steel production of 1.5 Million Tonnes per year.
Although one year delay occured in realization of the project,
the proposed production level of 1.5 Million Tonnes per year
was reached in 1984 as total. The production levels and percentage
increases in production by the years as actual values are shown
below compared with the appraisal estimate (TABLE-A).

2- Prsdwtivity lproveuent Project :
By the ipleaentation of productivity improvement projects, it was aimed
to incre m productivity and quality and to eliminate some bottlenecks
in operation of facilities. The facilities of which the project was
oJALS"r  listed below, were drum  froa the feasibility study prepared
by UEC and, as a whole, it is expected a 2.0 Million Ton%aer year
liquid steel production level at the end of the project with 1.65
Million tpy in finished flat products. The facilities are;
- BOF Teeming Crane
- BOF Laddle Refining
- Hot Mill Additions
- Coal Blending Facility
- Sinter Plant Mod fication
- Third Lime Kiln Plant
- Tandem Mill Additions
- Power Distribution and General Services
The impleimentation of the project started in August 1983 and the first
5 fwcilities in the list above put into operation in 1986 in conformity
with the project schedule. In October 1987, all the facilities proposed
in the project were completed and put into operation. The overall delay
was about one year which was mainly due to interference of operations
and constructions. The physical completion and start-up dates of the
facilities are given on the next page.
Since the facilities included in the project vere cpleted in the rar past
and some of them contemplated for the purpose of increasing quality
and eliminating bottlenecks, the direct effect of the overall project
on the production could not be expressed clearly in numbers.For the
time being, the maximum monthly production levels realized in Tandem
(59.500 Tonnes) and BOF Shop (158.800 Tonnes or 1.9 Million tpy level)
in 1987 can be given as the results of the project.
1/ Nominal capacity; actually for purposes of appraisal a 95 X operating rate
(1.9 million tpy.) was used.

B- bipower Development
1. Work Force
The Company's permanent work force reached 6434 employees at end of 1978,
and increased to 7251 by the end of 1984. It was 7217 (*12% over 1978) by
the end of 1987 (Annex 4-5). * This work force was within the limits
agreed upon in the IBRO Project Agreement. Given the increase in production/
shipments during 1978-1987 period, (over 100 %) - and employment practices
in Turkey, that record can be considered a successful achievement, with
important benefits in costs/competitiveness.
2. Traininq
Since its inception in 1960, Erdemir has been fully aware of the importance
of recruiting, training, and holding the suitably skilled and specialized
work force needed for efficient and continuous plant operations. The
Company's original Articles of Association, and a special law, gave Erdemir
some important rights giving it great flexibility in hiring practices,
competitive salary structure and training programs, enabling it to attract
and keep skilled tradesmen, technical and management personnel.
The introduction of many technological advances in the newly installed
equipment made thorough training in theory, operation and maintenance
mandatory. Such training was contracted and carried out on a well planned
and systematic basis by initially sending teams of Turkish personnel to
suppliers shops and operating factories abroud which used the same equipment.
That training was followed by training in Turkey, in the Lregli plant, by
suppliers experts and specialized personnel of consultants. When required
highly specialized operating and maintenance personnel supplied by contracted
firms were kept on the job for continued training and trouble shooting.
Upgrading of skills was handled by foreign and local training, technical
assistance, and also purchase of associated proprietary computer software.
* 12.5 % of M1's total labor costhas ben used, as attributable to the project,
for the incremental financial analysis.

3. Social Aspects (and Labor Relations)
Early in the Company's development, it recognized the need for
adequate social facilities near the plant housing area in Ereli
to help m_intain a content nd satisfied work force-the bulk of
which was recruited from the cities of Ankara and Istanbul.
The Company has provided all basic necessary facilities for
housing, health, education and recreation at or near the plant
site. At very reasonable costs to the employee the Company has
provided or assisted in providing a large number of comfortable
and pleasant apartments, full time medical care (clinic/hospital),
good quality schools and teachers, sports playing fields, social
club houses, several restaurants, movies/theatres, and other suitable
services for company employees. Given the flexibility to pay
reasonably good (competitive) wages, and good long range labor
relations policies, the Company has had a relatively good record
in Turkey for attracting and holding good employees, and minimizing
labor strife, strikes and work stoppages.

C- Prices and Production Cost
1- Prices
Becauseofa seller's market for steel in Turkey and steel's importance
to the economy, Erdemir's prices have been set by the Company after
taking into account its production costs, and cash requirements for debt srvice
and capital investments. Also, prices have changed often for domestic
economic considerations and have also followed the general trend of interrittiaul
steel prices or imports into Turkish Market. Between January 1981 and December
1987 there were twenty-four (24) changes in the ex-factory prices of
Erdemir's products Annex 4-2 . The price changes became effective in
different months of the year and annual average price using the weighted
average of the prices (number of days on which prices are effective is
taken as weights) prevailing each day has been calculated and converted
to mid-1987 R. in Annex 4-3 on the basis of inflation indices shown in
Annex 4-4. The US% equivalents has been approximated by using the average
exchange rate prevaling durirg each period.
* There wasa 17X production tax included in Erdemir's ex-factory prices
until 1985. Production tax was replaced by Value Added Tax since 1985 and
the rate of VAT was 10 % up to 11.30. 1985 and is 12 % since then which
it is included in ex-factory prices.Erdemir sets the base prices and
premiums for extras.

2- PRODIUTION COSTS
An exact comparison of production costs for the years making distinction
between the different effects of changes in the input prices, the
technical input consumption coefficient, the product mix and the total
output tonnage would be very difficult. However, a simple comparison of
production cost per ton of saleable product would still be meaningful
as an overall indication of costs and benefits of Stage I expansion and
stage II plus PIP. Such a comparison is shown in the following page. The
comparison indicates 25.6 % lower production cost per ton for 1987. Most
of the savings (71 %) is due to decrease in financial and other expenses.
This is reflected in operating profit per/ton of product (5.3 % for 1983
and 17.3 % for 1987). As it is mentioned above it is quite difficult to
interprete the decreases in raw material, labor, other materials and costs
Locause of differences in-product mix, usage of imported semi-finished
products, foreign exchange rates and inflation rates. Finally operating
margin has increased from 5.3 % to 17.3 % due to decrease in prnduction
cost, although unit selling price is decreased by 15 %.
Note : There was a reline in Blast Furnaces in 1987 and not in 1984 and
1983. This increased usage of imported semi finished products in 1987.

Erdemir is the only producer of flat products with Irntgrated Steel
Plant in lurkey. In addition to producing riat products Irom iIs own
steel, Erdemir also imports some semi-.finished flat steel products
for finishing in its rolling mills. The National consumption of
Erdemir's product line are shown below together with Erdemir's
deliveries (sales) and 4ndicates a significant gap between consumption
and Erdemir's sales.
Itie stabilization experierced in the lurkishi ecomimy during 19JUI-1985 and
gradual improvements since then have had its reflection in National
consumption resulting in increases in National demand since 1982. As a
result Erdemir has easily sold its production and is not expected to have
any difficulties in selling its full production output in the future, since
the general economic condition or Turkey appears qood. Demand ror rIaot
rolled steel products in Turkey far exceed the capacity of Erdemiir to
supply. Markets for products requiring Erdemir's products contiriue to
increase as industrialization continues and demand for consumer products
develop. Part of the increased demand for flat rolled products if, being
supplied by annual increases in imports mainly from Europe and Africa.
Markets for flat rolled steel products in Turkey in the 1989/90 period
are expected to increase to about 3 million metric tons-as projvr'ted by
Crdemir and State Planninq Office.
* These types are tin plate, hot-rolled sheets, cold rolled sheets,
plate and skelp.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Financial Results
5.01     The historical (1978-1986) financial statements of Erdemir are shown
in Annexes 5-1 and 5-2. Projections for the Company with the Stage II Project
(including PIPI ) are shown in Annexes 5-3 through 5-5. The profitability of
Erdemir has been satisfactory since 1984.
5.02     Comparis3n of the appraisal report projection of financial indicators
for 1986-87 with the actual figures is shown below. These latter two years
reflect most closely project completion. Although the production figures were
comparable with the appraisal estimates, the sales revenue was about four
times the estimate. However, profitability targets were not fully met. The
main reason behind this is that the appraisal estimates were possible
optimistic given that the NPBT/sales was only 92 in 1977 and 13S in 1978.  Ic
actually dipped to only 1.47 in 1981 before recovery ensued. The other reason
is that the cost of goods sold, which includes labor costs, has deteriorated
from the pre-project level of 62.1X of sales to 72.3S in 1986.

B. Financial Covenants and Targets
5.03     The financial restructuring of Erdemir was an important objective of
the project. In general, the debt/equity ratio was to be improved over the
long term to 60:40 or lower although there was no specific time limit for this
to be achieved. The Stage II project agreement required Erdemir to maintain a
debt - equity ratio of 60:40 or lower and a current ratio of 1.3 or higher,
although Erdemir could still pay dividends to non-founding shareholders even
if these ratios were violated. In addition, the limits on other capital
investments were determined as US$4 million equivalent annually during project
implementation and US$8 million equivalent annually after project
implementation. Since 1983, for the first time since 1978, Erdemir has
satisfied all the covenants and is expected to do so in the coming years.

should be evaluated with certain special circumstances in mind. Up to 1983
revaluation of fixed assets only corrected for the devaluation of the Turkish
Lira (TL) as it affected the TL value of foreign debt. Essentially no direct
inflation adjustment was made. Since 1983, revaluation to reflect inflation
has been allowed. There has been substantial inflation and devaluation of the
TL from 1980-88. Erdemir has a strong position as the only flat products
producer in Turkey, although imports have been liberalized for the last few
years.
5.05     The financial covenants concerning the current ratio, dividend
payments, and limitations on other investments have helped the Company to
complete the Stage II Project by forcing Erdemir to conserve its financial
resources during the implementation of project. These resources were
eventually needed between mid-1980 and mid-1982 to help finance the project
when a cash shortage became apoarent. Also increasing Erdemir's capital in
1984 was very instrumental in providing financing for the PIP portion of the
project. Had Erdemir not been forced by the financial covenants to follow a
prudent financial strategy, the Company would not have been in a position to
avoid a liquidity crisis. The current ratio covenant in particular is
intended to protect the Company's liquidity against unforeseen extreme
shortfalls in cash inflows or large cash outflows, and it can be concluded
that it has done just that up to now. This ratio has been in high levels
since 1982 and can potentially improve rapidly in the future.

5.06     Finally, the practice of not revaluing assets in general (except to
match a revaluation of foreign debt during the implementation) and equity in
particular has understated equity relative to foreign debt before 1983. Since
a large proportion of Erdemir's debt is in foreign exchange, the debt/equity
ratio of the Company appears much higher than would otherwise be the case if a
system of indexing were used. But after regulations changed in 1983 to
revalue the fixed assets of corporations this ratio increased and has been
very high since then. With the higher profitability this ratio is expected to
increase in the future. The debt/equity ratio is intended to keep the debt
service coverage manageable and the stake of the project sponsors meaningful.
C. Financial Rate of Return
5.07     The actual and re-estimated incremental capital cost and cash streams
for the internal rate of return calculations are shown in Annex 5-6 and 5-7
based on the actual prices and costs in 1986 and budgeted figures for 1987
(annex 5-8) which were used in the projection (1987- onwards) of operating
cash flows (estimates for 1987 are very close to actuals). The financial rate
of return is 20.0Z before taxes and 12.4Z after taxes. The appraisal estimate
was 18.1Z before tax (after tax figures n.a.)

Combination of the above two cases            n.a.          14.6
5.08     The present expected financial rate of return is higher then the
appraisal estimates in spite of the project delays. This is mainly due to the
efficient use of funds in the project. This efficiency was achieved in the
following two ways. Firstly, the strong dollar (is-a-vis the Yen, which was
used for about half the foreign equipment supplied) made it possible to
acquire much beyond what was planned during appraisal. Secondly, the Erdemir
engineers with the experience gained from the Stage I expansion, were very
careful in re-evaluating and detailing their needs to the foreign suppliers
when the strength of the dollar made the purchase of equipment from their
"wish list" possible. The whole PIP part of the project, which includes the
installation of a state of the art computer controlled tandem mill for only
eleven million dollars of foreign exchange components, is an example of such
efficiencies.

VI. ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
6.01     For the economic rate of return the financial streams were amended as
follows. The landed cost of imports based on the Metal Bulletin Antwerp
Prices, were used for the revenue. The weighted average economic price of the
output is about 12.5S higher than the financial price. For the costs, taxes,
which are minimal because Erdemir's import are almost tax-exempt, are
excluded. The economic production cost structure of Erdemir with the project
is also mnown in annex 5-8. The incremental economic cost and benefit streams
are shown in Annex 6-1 and 6-2. The economic rate of return is 25.52 as
opposed to 17.22 estimated during appraisal. All the reasons behind the
respectable financial rate of return are also the ones for a high economic
rate of return. The reason why ERR is 82 more than the appraisal estimate
(compared to 2.02 more as in the case of FRR) is because of the high world
prices assumed to calculate the ERR. But, currently the Metal Bulletin
Antwerp Prices are somewhat higher than what some countries/suppliers may
accept for their products although the quality may not be fully comparable for
some Eastern European producers. If projections are made using these
unreliable (particularly for the long run) prices, the ERR of the project
would be closer to the appraisal estimate.

Combination of the above two cases           n.a.           22.2
6.02     Overall, Erdemir due to this project has developed into a very
valuable resource to Turkey. It is the only producer of flat products in the
country. Its cost being comparable with the world prices enables the country
to save considerable foreign exchange. Due to this project, the
implementation and operating management capability of the Turkish personnel
has undoubtedly improved. Turkish engineers at Erdemir are now conversant
with computer controlled steel making - a process which enables Erdemir to
produce high quality cold rolled product, a small portion of which is even
exported to Japan. Finally, Erdemir is now an important source of finance for
the government budget. From its 1987 earnings LT 7.26 billion is to be
transferred to the government.

6.03     Erdemir from its inception is a socially conscious corporation.  It
has a policy of providing free nutritious meals to its workers. It also takes
a lead in the developmtnt, particularly in education, in Eregli where it is
located. But this project has taken the corporation also in a direction which
is easy to neglect-that of pollution control. Erdemir management today is
proud of their phenol treatment plant which uses bacteria to remove phenol
from the effluents. Also during the project a coke oven gas desulphurization
plant was installed and the dust collecting system for the sinter plant vastly
improved. Quality steel making has also brought quality pollution control at
Erdemir.
