  World Bank studies in Bangladesh and Philippines found statistically highly significant benefits to electrified households vis-à-vis
un-electrified households due to higher educational achievements of children in electrified households and in reduced morbidity due
to avoided illnesses by switching from kerosene lamps to electric lamps.

1.1     Context at Appraisal
At appraisal in 2002, nearly 60 percent of the population of Sri Lanka (about 19 million at that
time) had access to electricity; however, the levels of access varied significantly among regions
of the country. On one hand, areas such as the Western Province had about 80 percent access to
electricity while other Provinces (e.g. Uva) had less than 30 percent. Recognizing the importance
of electrification to the expansion of the economy and for the country’s overall development
agenda, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) set a target to achieve 75 percent electrification
island-wide by the year 2007.

The supply of electricity to meet this goal required substantive investment in additional electricity
generation capacity. Sri Lanka’s largest source of electricity came from hydropower and the task
of increasing the supply with limited resources was challenging given that most of the major
hydro sites had already been fully developed. The Government would have had to rely purely on
conventional thermal power generation as an alternative to hydro in order to serve the unmet
demand and achieve its electrification targets. As a result, expansion of the grid through thermal
power was the principal vehicle for electrification in the country along with expanding the
national grid network.

Meanwhile, the ongoing Energy Services Delivery (ESD) project financed by the World Bank
and Global Environment Facility (GEF) had demonstrated that off-grid systems – such as solar
home systems (SHS) and community-level independent grids – were a viable option to serve a
significant population living in remote rural communities where the grid had not reached. It also
demonstrated that mini-hydro and other renewable energy technologies such as wind and biomass
had potential to contribute to the energy mix in the grid and could add diversity to electricity
generation. As renewable energy technologies use indigenous resources, its use would lead to a
reduction in the import of fossil fuels for power generation.

The ESD project had also proven to be a catalyst for engaging the private sector to invest in
renewable energy development. As a result of successes achieved under the ESD project, the
GoSL sought the Bank’s assistance to support a scale-up of its rural ‘off-grid’ electrification
program complemented by a diversification of the energy mix through the development of ‘grid-
connected’ renewable energy investments. Moreover, GoSL was also keen on a continuity of
private sector participation in the energy sector and on designing a mechanism, which would
enable private developers, commercial banks/financers and entrepreneurs to be key stakeholders
in this endeavor. This would improve overall sector development and contribute to a more robust
economy. The development of such schemes would have been made possible given the existence
of appropriate institutional structures and mechanisms pioneered under ESD.

The request from the Government of Sri Lanka for the development of the Renewable Energy for
Rural Economic Development (RERED) project was consistent with the World Bank Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) (May 1996), which included: promotion of sustainable private-sector
led growth; increasing efficiency in delivery of infrastructure, especially in rural areas;
preserving the environment; and working closely with communities and non-Governmental

Organizations (NGOs) to generate development solutions. This was also aligned with the GEF
Operational Program 6: Promoting Renewable Energy by Removing Barriers and Reducing
Implementation Costs. It is also consistent with the subsequent CAS dated July 2008. The latest
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) dated April 2012 came into effect after Project closing;
however, in spite of this, the Project remains relevant in the context of this CPS, specifically on
Focus Areas 1.A: Facilitating sustained private and public investment - Improving the investment
climate, and 3.A: Improving living standards and social inclusion – Increasing quality of
services. Relevant to the first objective, the Project addresses the constraints of access to finance
(for renewable energy investments) and electricity rates by moderating the increase of the
electricity price through the utilization of indigenous renewable resources of energy. Relevant to
Focus Area 3.A, the Project improves rural electricity services which directly improves the
quality of life, social inclusion and indirectly enabling the provision or improvement of social
services such as health, education and water supply.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
This project aimed to: (i) improve the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable energy
technologies to bring electricity to remote communities; and (ii) promote private sector power
generation from renewable energy resources for the main grid.

The key indicators were:

      1. Installation of 135 megawatts (MW) of grid-connected electric power generation capacity
         from small-scale renewables (original target was 85 MW with an additional 50 MW
         proposed under RERED Additional Financing).
      2. Increase in income generating activities in communities that gain access to electricity.
      3. Electricity access to 161,000 households, rural small/medium enterprises (SMEs) and
         public institutions through off-grid systems (original target was 101,000 with an
         additional 60,000 proposed under RERED Additional Financing)

1.3     Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project’s Global Environmental Objective was to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions by
removing barriers and reducing implementation costs for renewable energy, and removing
barriers to energy efficiency.

The key indicators were:

      1. Reduction of atmospheric carbon emissions / Greenhouse Gas Emissions (1.25 million
         tons of carbon avoided);
      2. Promote adoption of renewable energy by removing market barriers and reducing
         implementation cost.

1.4      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
         reasons/justification
A restructuring of the project was approved on October 16, 2010 in order to reduce the target for
the off-grid renewables component from 161,000 to 113,500 households, enterprises and
institutions. The primary reason was that grid expansion had proceeded more rapidly than



                                                 2
originally expected as the GoSL had made a policy and very significant financial commitment to
accelerate grid-based electricity coverage. Therefore, more households, enterprises and
institutions were being served by the grid and others anticipating grid electricity to extend to their
villages decided not to invest in off-grid electricity sources. This reduced the demand for off-grid
schemes.

At Appraisal, the Governments’ rural electrification policy envisaged that 20 percent of the
population would remain reliant on off-grid electricity supply2. At present, the Government
expects to achieve 100 percent electrification by end 2012 of which a mere 40,000 households
would have to be served by off-grid means (Note: average growth rate in grid-based electricity
connections since 2005 was about 6 percent per year and helped household electrification rate to
reach 92 percent by March 2012).

1.6    Main Beneficiaries
Both the country (as a whole) as well as rural households and enterprises were the principal
beneficiaries of this Project. The country benefitted from grid-tied renewables that reduced fuel
imports, diversified the power generation mix, reduced generation costs, and built a world-class
renewable energy (mainly mini-hydro) industry that is now expanding its services and
investments to Africa and other Asian countries. Building on this success, the GoSL has
increased its goal of renewable energy generation (excluding large hydro), from 15% of total
generation by 2015 to 20% by 2020 (730 Gigawatt-hour (GWh) in 2010 to over 4000 GWh in
2020).

The rural households and enterprises benefitted from increased access to reliable supply of
electricity which could expand income generating activities from productive use of electricity;
improve their quality of life through the use of (small) appliances; and improving indoor air
quality from reduced kerosene smoke.

An indirect benefit to the rural households and enterprises, though limited and difficult to
quantify, would be improved services for the electrified public institutions such as health clinics,
schools and other education buildings and water supply institutions.

Other beneficiaries include: (i) rural services institutions which can improve their service
delivery to the villages and communities; (ii) financial institutions which will be expanding their
services with access to long term financing; (iii) entrepreneurs/investors who are able to secure
financing for their renewable energy projects; (iv) GoSL leveraging its financial resources for
rural electrification; and (v) the global community which is benefitting from reductions of
greenhouse gas emissions.

Component 1: Grid-connected Renewable Energy Power Generation (US$ 77.2 million)
Component 1 is by far the largest component of the project with an allocation of 63% of total
Bank financing including from both the original IDA Credit and Additional Financing. Table 1
below provides a breakdown of financing for each component, by source and as a percentage of
total financing. This component would dramatically expand the renewable electricity generating
capacity and production in Sri Lanka. This would be achieved by supporting private commercial
developers to realize grid connected renewable electricity projects. Support would be provided,
by facilitating access to sufficiently long-term financing from participating credit institutions
(PCIs). Under this component, up to 80% of renewable energy project loans extended by PCI’s to
private developers can be refinanced by the project. The investments were expected to be mainly
in mini-hydro projects; however, it was also available for wind power and biomass generation.
Component 1 is directly linked to the PDO promoting private sector power generation from
renewable energy resources for the main grid and the GEO reduction in atmospheric carbon
emissions. It also contributes the increased proportion of electricity capacity being derived from
renewables.

Component 2: Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Investments (US$ 33.7 million)
Component 2 is the other major component of the project with an allocation of 27% of total Bank
financing most of which came from the original IDA Credit supplemented by funds from the
Additional Financing. This component would provide electricity to remote rural households that
would not be connected to the grid in the foreseeable future. Under this component, output-based
credit and grant support would be provided for the supply and installation of solar home systems.
The subsidy would depend on system size (smaller systems receive bigger subsidies) and decline
over time. The project would also refinance loans given by PCIs to households. Component 2 is
directly linked to the PDO improving the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable
electricity technologies to bring electricity to remote communities as well the GEO. It also
contributes to both the increased proportion of electricity capacity being derived from renewables
and number of rural consumers served by renewable energy systems.

Component 3: Independent Grid Systems (US$ 4.1 million)
Component 3 is a relative small component, with an allocation of only about 3% of total Bank
financing almost all of which was from original IDA Credit. It supports the development of
renewable energy based community mini grid systems which brings electricity services to remote
rural communities. Mini grid systems are in particular of interest for villages with good micro
hydro resources. The support provided would include: (i) project preparation grants to developers
for identifying projects and working with communities to help them realize the projects; (ii)
refinancing of loans by PCI’s to communities for eligible projects; (ii) investment subsidies to
communities to reduce the cost for the communities; and (iv) supervision grants to PCI’s to cover
the incremental supervision cost. The refinancing would be limited to 80 percent of the loan
provided to communities and the subsidy to US$ 400 per kW installed capacity (later increased to
US$600) up to US$ 20,000 per system. Component 3 is directly linked to the PDO improve the
quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable electricity technologies to bring electricity to
remote communities and the GEO reduction in atmospheric carbon emissions. It also contributes
to both the increased proportion of electricity capacity being derived from renewables and
number of rural consumers served by renewable energy systems.

Component 4: Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management (DSM) (US$ 1.1 million)
Component 4 is the smallest component with an allocation of less than 1% of total IDA
financing. This component intended to support the development of energy service companies
(ESCOs) through awareness creation and training. Support would also be provided for the
development of an ESCO business plan and development of legal agreements. Component 4 is
directly linked to the GEO and contributes to removal of barriers in energy efficiency.

Component 5: Cross-sectoral Energy Applications (US$ 3.1 million)
Component 5 is also a small component, with an allocation of about 2% of total Bank financing.
It was envisaged to promote renewable energy applications in non-energy sectors such as health,
education and water supply. This would be achieved through technical assistance (awareness
creation, assessment of impact and benefits and specification of standard energy packages) and
co-financing of various initiatives. The co-financing would leverage additional funds from
ongoing and planned Government and donor-supported projects. Component 5 is linked to the
GEO and contributes to the number of electricity use strategies developed and implemented by
government and nongovernmental institutions in non-energy sectors for using electricity to
improve the delivery of their products and services in rural areas.

Component 6: Technical Assistance (US$ 3.8 million)
The allocation for component 6 was about 3% of total IDA and GEF financing. It was intended to
largely support the implementation of the RERED investment components and would comprise a
number of technical assistance activities, including:

      1. Project administration and promotion
      2. Support to the development of sub-projects
      3. Market assessment and technology promotion related to renewable energy and energy
         efficiency capacity building
      4. Cross-sectoral energy applications
      5. Post-completion sustainability of project
      6. Monitoring and evaluation / surveys

refinancing rate of interest. Those are discussed in detail in section 2.2.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Background
The RERED project is a direct follow-up to the ESD Project and was designed to reap the fruits
of the groundwork established by that project. ESD was a breakthrough initiative, which created
an enabling environment for renewable energy development and energy efficiency. One of the
flagship achievements of ESD was the development and adaptation of a Standardized Power
Purchase Agreement (SPPA) and piloting the use of relatively large-scale, long-term credit
through licensed commercial banks as such credit lines were previously reserved for development
banks while commercial banks mainly had access to small-scale SME credit lines. As a result,
the capacity of small hydro in Sri Lanka increased from 1 MW in 1997 to 32 MW at the end of
2002. ESD also demonstrated the viability of private sector participation in providing off-grid
electricity services with financing coursed through Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs). MFIs
extended credit facilities to rural households and by the end of 2002, a total of 20,953 SHS were
installed, with sales averaging 850 systems per month. Off-grid electrification was also
provisioned through village hydro systems, whereby 35 village hydro schemes had been built
with a total capacity of 350 kW, benefitting 1,732 households. An additional 49 village hydro
projects were at various stages of development and would immediately benefit from a follow-on
financing facility.

Due to these and other factors, the design of RERED was in line with the environment at that
time which had become more conducive for growth and scale-up. The number of mini-hydro
developers was increasing (11 at the time); 4 major solar companies were in operation and about
12-15 village hydro developers were active. Also at the village level nearly 80 active electricity
consumer societies were established.

Wind power development had also been piloted for the first time in Sri Lanka under ESD with
the establishment of a 3 MW wind project. There was considerable interest from the private
sector to develop additional wind projects on several sites in Sri Lanka. In 2002, the Government
had invited expressions of interest from developers for 40 MW of wind capacity. At appraisal, it
was envisaged that RERED would be an important facilitator of financing for about 20-25 MW
of that targeted capacity.




                                                6
Tackling energy efficiency was also a key area of engagement as the environment for the
implementation of demand side management activities had improved after ESD, including the
formation of multiple ESCOs – the first of which came into being during the course of ESD.

While clearly the foundations had been laid for sustainable growth of the renewable energy
industry in Sri Lanka, critical barriers still needed to be addressed to maintain momentum; those
were:
    The size of the market which was still relatively small;
    Ensuring a level-playing field for private sector participants;
    Access to long term financing was still limited as domestic fund mobilization was mainly
       short term;
    Integrating renewable energy in the country’s overall electrification strategy; and
    Establishing a sustainable and transparent basis for subsidies for rural electrification.

2.1.2 Soundness of the background analysis
During the preparation of RERED it was assumed that technical and financial concerns would
limit grid extension and that even with widespread and rapid expansion of the system there would
still be nearly 20 percent of the island’s population reliant on off-grid systems (nearly 1 million
households.) This assumption was based on information from and discussions with the Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB) – the country’s largest power utility. CEB had also stated that the
existing electricity generating capacity was facing shortages of about 35 percent coupled with an
annual electricity demand growth of 8 to 10 percent.

Figure 1 below shows that, in effect, electrification moved faster than anticipated due to GoSL’s
decision to aggressively invest in grid network expansion, and reached a greater number of
households than had been assumed at Appraisal. The current plans by GoSL indicate 100%
village electrification by the end of 2012 recognizing that about 40,000 households will need to
be electrified through off-grid options.

One of the sharpest rates of increase in electrification was in the period from 2003-2011 when the
generation capacity grew from 2,483 MW to 3,139 MW4, an increase of 658 MW (or about
26.5% of total installed capacity). As development of major hydro has remained stagnant at 1,207
MW since 2003, the growth came from an increase in thermal power (51%) as well as renewable
energy (48%), the latter comprising small hydro, wind and biomass. This was consistent with the
analysis at Appraisal.

2.1.3 Lessons taken into consideration during preparation
The preparation of RERED benefitted from a build-up of considerable experience in the
implementation of rural and renewable energy projects in the country; however, from the Bank’s
perspective, this was not only limited to the Sri Lanka experience. RERED also benefitted from
experiences in other countries where a number of similar initiatives had been undertaken,
including countries in South and East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The guiding principles for success emerging from the various Bank interventions included: (i)
necessity of providing consumer choice; (ii) ensuring pricing which is cost-reflective; (iii)
overcoming high start-up cost; (iv) encouraging local participation and tapping into private sector
and civil society capabilities and potential; and (v) implementing sound sector policies. The
implementation of ESD offered useful lessons, which were built into the design of RERED.
Those included:

      (i)       Flexibility in the implementation and in the effective implementation review missions
                as an opportunity to address emerging problems and implementation challenges
                amongst all project stakeholders while considering adjustments to project design, as
                needed, to help resolve bottlenecks;

   (ii)    The effectiveness of third-party administration of the credit and grant facility and
           overall project management;

   (iii)   Involvement of industry associations and advocacy groups plays an important role in
           guiding industry growth and directions;

   (iv)    The adoption of an SPPA, ensuring tariff certainty, a bankable legal framework that
           assured availability of long term financing was vital to the success in grid connected
           renewable investments; and

   (v)     The importance of participation and commitment of the entire community on off-grid
           village electrification schemes for ensuring long term sustainability of these schemes,
           as well as a adequate after sales services (especially for SHS) are crucial.

2.1.4 Rationale for Bank involvement
The Bank has been recognized and accepted in Sri Lanka as a key catalyst for grid-connected and
off-grid renewable energy and energy efficiency interventions. The key value-added stems from
the Bank’s experience in supporting countries in Africa and Asia to develop and implement large
renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. This knowledge and experience is unique
among development institutions. The ESD project validated the adopted approach and laid the
foundation for scale-up under RERED. The Bank was best placed to help Sri Lanka achieve that
potential, both in terms of knowledge and financing needs.

The Bank’s involvement increased the confidence of the PCIs to continue to provide long-term
loans to private developers of renewable energy projects. This was of particular importance
because increasing the access to energy services from renewable energy was at the heart of the
RERED design.

2.1.5 Assessment of project design
The Project has two distinctively different but complementary objectives, one of a social/poverty
alleviation nature and another which is geared towards the power sector with an environmental
dimension. The element that binds the two objectives is that both will be achieved through
renewable energy technologies that are low-carbon and fueled by indigenous resources.

The social and economic benefits of rural access to electricity services are well documented
(IEG. The Welfare Impact of Rural Electrification, 2008 and Marge: Energy Poverty and Gender
(EnPoGen) Sri Lanka Report, 2002). Rural households prefer grid electricity as it provides them
with the highest and most reliable level of services and significantly subsidized tariffs, especially
for those consuming less than 60 kWh/month. On the other hand, they would be more inclined to
opt for off-grid electricity if the prospects for grid connectivity appeared to be out of reach or
would take many years before they are connected. The Project aimed at providing off-grid
electricity services to those households. The assumptions made by the Project (i.e. about 20% of
households would not be connected to the grid by 2010) meant that the utilities would need to
support extending connectivity to 650,000 households between 2004 and 2010. Therefore, the
target of electrifying about 160,000 rural households, using off-grid schemes would be
approximately 25% of the total forecast of un-electrified households by 2010. This was a



                                                 9
reasonable target and would make a significant impact. In reality, over 1.3 million new grid
connections were made between 2004 and 2010, which was double the original target.

The grid-connected renewable energy component would add 135 MW of renewable energy
generating capacity to the existing capacity of 32 MW – an increase of over 400%. This would
constitute 5.4% of the total installed generation capacity at the time. The grid connected
renewable energy component was therefore significant to the power sector in Sri Lanka.

The design of the project also included an engagement on energy efficiency through a small
component; however, the limited resources allocated for energy efficiency and DSM (US$ 2
million equivalent or 0.9% of the total financing) made a significant impact unlikely. Moreover, a
low interest credit line for energy efficiency extended by Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) made demand for RERED funds far less attractive. To reduce complexity and remain
focused, it would have been better to limit the project to renewable energy and address energy
efficiency in a more significant manner in a different project supported by the Bank or other
development institution.

Overall, the project was designed to build on the success of the ESD and it included a number of
the same components using proven approaches. In general, the project design was sound and was
designed to make a significant contribution to off-grid electrification, increasing the renewable
energy generation capacity to diversify the fuel mix relying on indigenous resources, and
contribute to an increase in total installed power generation capacity in the country to meet the
growing demand for electricity.

2.1.6 Adequacy of Government’s commitment
The Government’s commitment to the project was unwavering while recognizing the value of
implementing such a Project through a commercial entity (i.e. DFCC Bank was the RERED
Project Administrative Unit, continuing the role they played in ESD). Due to the nature of the
project being driven by commercial lenders and private developers, DFCC was better placed with
its experience in commercial banking transactions to work with the PCIs and private developers
and administer the refinancing mechanism. The Government facilitated the implementation of the
Project by providing the required policy and regulatory support, approving investments by the
utility in substation upgrades, as well as considerable grant support for off-grid electrification
schemes.

2.1.7 Participatory process
Stakeholder participation during preparation was achieved through a consultative process
established under ESD. This included consultation with PCIs, industry associations and
individual companies, village electricity consumer societies, CEB and other Government
organizations.

2.1.8 Assessment of risk
The overall risk rating at Appraisal was substantial. This is considered appropriate for the type
and scale of interventions proposed under the Project. The demand for refinancing of loans for
grid-connected renewable energy projects depends on a number of macroeconomic factors that
are beyond the control of the Project. For example, when interest rates were substantially higher



                                               10
at certain periods during the implementation period - most notably at the height of the military
conflict - the demand for refinancing loans reduced significantly. Demand grew once more when
interest rates dropped again. On the other hand, the risk of an insufficient market for SHS was
identified and considered moderate. The impact of a saturated market for SHS or accelerated grid
expansion was not analyzed in sufficient detail, which could have addressed some of the
challenges faced during implementation. This is an important lesson for other countries that are
undertaking or planning aggressive off-grid electrification schemes.

2.2      Implementation

2.2.1 Progress of Implementation
Implementation progress was generally rated ‘satisfactory’ with a few exceptions in 2009 when
the rating was ‘marginally satisfactory’ mainly attributed to slow disbursements. This eventually
picked up and the Credit was fully disbursed5. The major implementation issues by component
are discussed below:

Component 1: Grid-connected Renewable Energy Generation
There were no major issues during the implementation of Component 1. Minor issues were the
benchmarking of refinance interest rate and limitation of refinancing approvals to the available
budget. The AU approved refinancing until the total budget was committed. This led to non-
disbursing commitments and did not provide an incentive to submit refinancing applications
quickly. This approach would have caused a significant amount of undisbursed refinancing
approvals at the end of the project. Both issues were resolved (refer to the section below on
Actions Taken in Response to Problems). As component 1 was by far the largest component of
the project the AU rightfully devoted most attention to this component.

Component 2: Solar PV Investments
Sales of SHS fell from 2,000 per month in 2005 to 800 per month in 2008. The shrinking of the
market was caused by rapid expansion of the grid and by a reduction or cessation of SHS loans
from financial institutions as the rate of defaults on loans began to rise sharply. This in turn, was
caused by, among others, SHS vendors not honoring their after sales services and warrantee
obligations. Due to some of these unanticipated market conditions, actual number of households
to be electrified fell short of the original target. However, overall, the component was successful
in providing opportunities for rural households to gain access to much-needed electricity services
far sooner than they would have, had they waited for a grid electricity connection. As component
2 was a major component the AU made significant efforts to get this component back on track.
When the AU realized that this was not possible, a proposal was made to restructure the project
to revise the realistic target expected to be achieved under this component.

Component 3: Independent Grid Systems

   Fully disbursed does not mean zero balance. At the end of the Disbursement Grace Period, US$ 12,052 of IDA funds were
refunded by GoSL as unutilized.

There were no major issues implementing this component. One minor issue was in the quality
and technical capacity of some of the village hydro developers and equipment suppliers. That
issue was addressed through the introduction of a pre-qualification process for all village hydro
developers and suppliers, mandatory testing of equipment and stricter supervision.

Component 4: Energy Efficiency and DSM
There was little demand for support from the Project under this small component. The main
reason for this was that the Environmental Friendly Solutions Fund (E-Friends), supported by
JICA, offered similar support at better terms (70-100% refinancing, 10 year loan with 2 year
grace period and a fixed Rupee interest rate of 8.5% per annum.)6 The initiatives that were
supported under this component included refinancing of loans for energy efficiency sub-projects
and awareness campaigns. Because there was no demand on these funds (and component was
very small) the AU correctly decided to focus its attention on the more significant components
with larger impacts on the achievement of the PDO and GEO.

Component 5: Cross-sectoral Energy Applications
This component also had limited demand. The grid was expanding rapidly and most rural public
institutions such as schools and hospital were gaining access to grid electricity and, as such, a
long term renewable energy-based solution was not a priority. AU also did not push this
component and devoted its attention to the main (larger) components, namely 1 and 2.

Component 6: Technical Assistance
There were no issues with the implementation of component 6.

2.2.2 Success Factors
RERED is a successful project in a number of dimensions. It supported the development of 185.3
MW of renewable energy capacity (or about 65% of total renewable electricity generating
capacity in Sri Lanka as of March 2012. It also provided off-grid electricity to over 116,000
remote rural households (or about 0.5 million people.) Key factors that contributed to the
successful implementation of RERED are given below:

       (i) Building on the success and lessons learned from ESD and use of proven concepts.
       Many of the activities designed for RERED were previously piloted under ESD. All of the
       support mechanisms were developed and required minimal fine-tuning. The adoption of an
       SPPA developed under ESD coupled with an established tariff regime and securing long-
       term financing was critical to the continued success of renewable energy investments in the
       sector. Consultation with major stakeholder groups had been institutionalized and the
       implementation agency had acquired the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to
       handle these transactions. Stakeholders were familiar with the requirements and support
       provided, resulting in a seamless transition from ESD to RERED.

       (ii) Private sector leadership. The project development and global environmental targets
       could only be achieved through the implementation of a significant number (ultimately 71)
       grid-connected renewable energy sub-projects. This required substantial implementation

     and financial capacity that could only be provided by the private sector. The project was set
     to achieve those targets by creating an enabling environment for private sector participation.
     Entrepreneurs would identify economic and financially viable projects, investing time,
     effort and equity in the preparation of those projects, and seeking financing from PCIs.
     Having a line of credit facility through RERED incentivized the PCIs to extend sub-loans as
     they were able to refinance these loans through the IDA Credit at favorable terms.

     (iii) Implementation arrangements. One of the key success factors lay in the project
     management by the DFCC Bank which functioned as the RERED Administrative Unit
     (AU). The AU was, by design, a separate entity from DFCC Bank’s main lending function
     to avoid a possible conflict of interest and provide transparency to PCIs whom were
     competing with DFCC Bank on the refinancing of sub-loans. The AU was staffed with
     professionals (including engineers), many of whom had gained considerable experience
     from the implementation of ESD. As the implementation progressed, the AU retained much
     of this knowledge and became well in tune with energy sector issues. The AU was also
     taking up an important role as facilitator and intermediary between the direct beneficiaries
     (PCIs, developers, SHS vendors, village hydro developers and end-users), the various
     Government branches (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Power and Energy, etc.) and the
     World Bank. The AU maintained a good consultation process with all stakeholders
     throughout the implementation of RERED and convened regular workshops and meetings
     to help resolve impediments and address emerging problems. This established good faith
     and a great deal of trust in the AU among the various stakeholders.

     (iv) Enabling macro-economic environment. Re-financing of loans for renewable energy
     sub-project only works in a suitable macro-economic environment which is usually outside
     of the control of the Project. In this case, GoSL supported an excellent market enabling
     environment and its commitment to getting the private sector engaged in developing the
     sector was crucially important to RERED’s success. Significant duty and tax concessions
     were also available for most sub-projects. During the implementation of RERED the macro-
     economic environment was generally conducive. Interest rates were reasonable (other than
     for a period during heightened military conflict in the country), the exchange rate fluctuated
     relatively modestly and there were no restrictions on lending for renewable energy
     investments. With the tariffs offered by the CEB, projects were financially viable and
     encouraged developers to actively develop and implement renewable energy projects.
     Under different macro-economic conditions, and without government cooperation, the
     Project might not have been successful.

2.2.3 Actions Taken in Response to Problems
During implementation several actions were taken in response to emerging problems. The most
important actions are discussed below.

     (i) Change of Interest Rate of Refinancing Loans. The original RERED IDA Credit and
     GEF grant agreement stipulated that interest rates to PCIs are calculated based on a six-
     month average of the Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR). At the time the Additional
     Finance was approved, the rate was to a blend of AWDR and Average Weighted Fixed
     Deposit Rate (AWFDR). This was done to improve financial sustainability by bringing the



                                               13
interest rates closer to market terms. Subsequently, interest rates had begun to rise sharply
and that led to a significant increase in the financing terms for renewable energy project
loans and resulted in a considerable decline in loan applications. While lending rates began
to decline rapidly in the second half of 2009, the cost of RERED remained high as it was
influenced by fixed deposit rates set every 6-months. The interest rates for RERED funds
remained high for a longer period of time, causing its sub-loans to be out-priced by other
loans available in the market. Therefore, in response to these issues, the Bank agreed with
GoSL to use the AWDR - revised every 3 months. As a result, more sub-projects were
picked-up and the pace of loan applications and financing of sub-projects increased.

(ii) Change of disbursement condition to first-come first-serve basis. For the most part
during the life of the project, the AU did not approve new refinancing requests when the
RERED un-committed balance was insufficient. As per the participation agreements with
the PCIs, the AU could cancel a refinance commitment only if no disbursements had taken
place in 12 months. This resulted in non-disbursing commitments with a risk of large
undisbursed balance towards the latter stage of the project. In 2008, the AU in consultation
with the Bank and PCIs, changed their approach and overcommitted the available funds by
approving refinancing requests with the clear understanding that disbursements would take
place on a first-come first-serve basis until the available funds are exhausted. This provided
an incentive for project developers and PCIs to submit disbursement requests as soon as
possible or otherwise run the risk of not being able to draw on the full amount of approved
refinancing. This modified approach resulted in an increase in disbursements and ensured
that the IDA Credit would be fully disbursed by the closing date of the project or during the
grace period.

(iii) Prequalification of village hydro developers and suppliers. Developers received a
project preparation grant to develop village hydro projects. This grant was paid in
installments after a set of milestones were reached. The support was considered attractive
and resulted in an increase in the number of village hydro developers during the latter
stages of ESD, not all of whom had the required knowledge and skills. To avoid this issue,
including potential misuse of resources, the AU introduced a prequalification process for
village hydro developers and equipment suppliers whereby only those with a minimum
level of knowledge and experience were pre-qualified under the Project. This led to fewer
number of incomplete projects and potentially unsatisfied end-users, and overall, a more
efficient implementation of the village hydro component. The introduction of mandatory
testing of turbines prior to installation led to better quality equipment and less conflicts with
suppliers.

(iv) Modification of SHS vendors’ business model. In late 2006, problems with the solar
PV component began to surface. By 2009, it became clear that sales targets might not be
achieved. To address this problem, the AU organized a participatory problem analysis
workshop in December 2009 to analyze the issues in detail and identify remedial actions
(details on problems encountered are provided in section 6 on lessons learned). The
workshop provided recommendations for possible actions, including the modification of the
SHS vendor business model. This included import of cheaper but good quality systems,
shift to cash sales and modification of the sales services networks. SHS vendors started to



                                            14
     implement the recommendations, but it was not sufficient to increase SHS sales. In October
     2010, the project was restructured to reduce the target for the off-grid renewables
     component from 161,000 households, enterprises and institutions to 113,500. With a
     saturated market, the number of solar vendors active at the peak of SHS sales fell from 14
     to 2. The current vendors are supplying SHS systems on a cash basis or on credit provided
     by the vendors themselves.

     (v) Increasing the thresholds for using established commercial procurement practices by
     the private sector. The established thresholds were set in 1997 under the ESD project and
     were carried over into the RERED project without revision. Data from RERED-financed
     sub-projects showed that costs had gone up substantially over the period (2004-2010). This
     meant that more sub-projects would need to follow International Competitive Bidding
     (ICB) procedures since the costs would go beyond the established thresholds under ESD.
     This was also more critical for smaller projects where the cost of going through an ICB
     procedure outweighed the benefit of using commercially accepted procurement practices.
     As such, an increase in the thresholds for investment projects was agreed with GoSL. For
     the procurement of Goods, the threshold increased from US$ 2 million to US$ 6 million,
     while the Works category increased from US$ 3 million to US$ 9 million and Turnkey
     contracts from US$ 5 million to US$ 15 million. These increases were in line with the
     percentage increase in Prior Review in the Bank’s South Asia Region for the Borrower’s
     Procurement Transactions approved in May 2009.

     (vi) Increasing IDA Credit and GEF Grant percentage of expenditure under all TA
     categories. The Government requested to increase the percentage of expenditures financed
     for the technical assistance categories of the IDA Credit and GEF Grant to 100%. Due to
     the difficult fiscal situation further aggravated by the global economic crisis, GoSL had not
     been able to allocate co-financing for technical assistance funded by IDA or GEF in a
     timely manner. At the height of the military conflict, the solar subsidy payments were also
     delayed by GoSL, resulting in severe cash flow problems to SHS vendors. This has often
     resulted in payment delays to suppliers and reputational risks for the Bank. The increase
     facilitated the implementation of a critical technical assessment of the power grid
     absorption capacity as well as capacity building activities and other TA geared towards
     scaling-up investments in new renewable energy technologies such as wind and biomass.
     The increase in expenditures was covered by a reallocation of non-utilized funds from other
     categories.

2.2.4 Mid Term Review
The Mid Term Review (MTR) was carried out in September 2005. At that time it was concluded
that the original targets for off-grid electrification could be achieved (101,000). The grid
connected renewable energy project component was behind schedule. Delays were caused by
problems with connections that needed to be made by CEB as result of sub-stations reaching their
maximum capacities, delays in obtaining required approvals from the Central Environmental
Authority (CEA) and other agencies, and from delays in obtaining land. The MTR provided the
following recommendations: (i) streamlining approval procedures; (ii) address with CEB
problems related to connection of renewable energy projects to the grid (grid failure and
absorption capacity of sub-stations); (iii) pre-qualification and training of village hydro



                                               15
developers and equipment suppliers; (iv) closer monitoring of performance of village hydro
projects; and (v) require village hydro developers to involve village mobilization experts. The
AU implemented the recommendations to the extent possible. To address sub-station capacity,
CEB took on a number of grid strengthening projects financed by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and others.

Approximately two years following the MTR, an Additional Financing was approved by IDA in
2007. This was largely in response to the increased demand for RERED refinancing. Since the
majority of the funds would be geared towards new sub-projects, and with an average gestation
period of about 2 years from inception to commissioning, a 3-year extension to the closing date
was approved to allow sufficient time for the additional financing credit to be committed and
disbursed. By that time, most of the funds available under the IDA Credit and GEF Grant were
disbursed; however, since there were some amounts that still remained uncommitted (mainly
allocated for TA), the parent project was also extended to allow GoSL to utilize all remaining
sources of funds. Ultimately, all but a few thousand dollars from the entire allocation of IDA and
GEF was exhausted by the end of the disbursement grace period.

Projects at Risk
Not applicable.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design
The first objective of the Project is to improve the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid
renewable energy technologies to bring electricity to remote communities. The M&E framework
includes two indicators for the first objective: (i) increase in income generating activities in
communities that gain access to electricity; and (ii) electricity access to 161,000 households, rural
small/medium enterprises and public institutions through off-grid systems. Studies show that
quality of life improves when access to electricity is provided. This does not necessarily require
an increase in income. Non-financial benefits include reduction of “time poverty,? the feeling of
social inclusion, improved cleanliness of the home and a greater improvement in studying
opportunities for children. Increased income generating activities would be an additional benefit
and further improve the quality of life. The number of households, small and medium enterprises
and public institutions electrified can simply be obtained from project statistics. The increase in
income generating activities would be accessed through surveys. Where increased income
generation activities are found, attribution may be difficult.

The second objective is to promote private sector power generation from renewable energy
resources for the main grid. This will increase the electricity generation capacity of Sri Lanka
using environmentally friendly indigenous renewable resources, avoiding carbon emissions and
conserving foreign currency which is otherwise spent on the import of fossil fuels. The indicators
for the second objective are: (i) additional 135 MW of small-scale renewable grid-connected
power generation capacity installed (85 MW under RERED and 50 MW under the Additional
Finance); (ii) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (1.25 million tons of CO2 avoided); and (iii)
promote adoption of renewable energy by removing market barriers and reducing implementation



                                                 16
cost. The indicators are adequate to assess achievement of this objective. The installed capacity is
obtained from project statistics, as this information must be provided for all re-financed projects,
whereas the avoided green house gas emissions can be calculated from total electricity generated,
which can be obtained from CEB. The removal of market barriers will be evident from achieving
the first indicator. In the discussion of this indicator additional details on barrier removal can be
provided.

2.3.2 M&E Implementation and Utilization
The AU contracted a consultant to monitor progress towards achieving objectives and meeting
indicators. M&E reports were submitted initially every quarter and bi-annually from 2006
onwards. Where the information had to come from project statistics, very accurate and reliable
information was obtained. The AU collected the required information as part of its routine
administration work and progress was monitored throughout the sub-project lifecycle. Based on
this process, corrective action was taken where needed.



2.4    Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards
There were no major issues on either social or environmental safeguards and overall safeguards
compliance is rated satisfactory. The project relied on GoSL environmental clearance processes.
In addition, the AU contracted consultants to conduct environmental and social assessments of
every grid connected sub-project before approval, and on a sample basis after commissioning,
which also included site visits. Based on these assessments, two projects were denied its
application for refinancing because of non-compliance with environmental safeguards. After
commissioning, no significant problems were found. According to the RERED Operating
Guidelines which were strictly adhered to, IDA had required prior review of: (i) all biomass
projects; (ii) mini-hydro projects with a capacity of more than 5 MW; (iii) wind projects with a
capacity of more than 10 MW; (iv) all projects involving land acquisition and/or resettlement;
and (v) the first two environmental assessments of each PCI for mini hydro, biomass and wind
power projects. The AU followed these procedures diligently.

2.4.2 Fiduciary
Fiduciary compliance was satisfactory. The AU had well-established procedures for approval of
disbursements of loan and grant resources and adequate financial management (FM) staff with
sufficient capacity to undertake those responsibilities. PCIs were required to submit refinancing
application packages comprising a complete set of documents. Refinance disbursements were
made only after providing proof that PCIs had already disbursed their loans to developers and
such funds were utilized for the stated purpose. Co-financing grants were disbursed on
submission of proof of installation. Other grant payments were generally based on reaching
specified verifiable milestones. Verification of installation of SHS was carried out on a sample
basis. These verifications did not find any indication of unjustified payment requests. The AU
kept detailed records on all payments made. Financial audits carried out during implementation
did not find any issues. To ensure adequate fiduciary controls, IDA reviewed: (i) the first two
refinancing requests, irrespective of size, submitted by each PCI; (ii) refinancing applications



                                                 17
above the free limit (US$ 3.5 million); (iii) each PCIs’ first solar home system refinancing
request; (iv) each PCIs’ first grid-connected hydro, wind and biomass refinancing request; and
(v) each PCIs’ first village based hydro, wind and biomass refinancing request.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Until 2007 there was no single Government organization in Sri Lanka responsible for the
promotion of renewable energy. To implement ESD and later RERED, an implementing unit had
to be established and GoSL decided to facilitate this through an independent unit within a private
development bank, namely DFCC Bank. On October 1, 2007 the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy
Authority (SEA) was established through the enactment of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy
Authority Act No. 35 of 2007. SEA was established as an apex institution responsible for
reaching a new level of sustainability in energy generation and use through increasing the use of
indigenous renewable energy resources and improving energy efficiency.

The RERED AU is expected to be handing over Project files to the SEA who will continue to
take on some of these roles of facilitating investments in the sector. They will also likely continue
to maintain the documentation, data, and studies undertaken under RERED which was disclosed
on the Project website. This includes a wealth of analysis, data and information on the subject of
renewable energy and related initiatives in the developing country context. Throughout the
project, this had been very valuable resource for many researchers, practitioners and those who
are keen on replicating some of Sri Lanka’s experiences. Although the transfer arrangements are
clear it could have been benefitted from better coordination with SEA and more pro-activity.
Sub-projects refinanced by RERED shall continue to comply with GoSL environmental
requirements, including the required monitoring. This is expected to continue after Project
closure.

ESD and RERED addressed one of the most important barriers to renewable energy
development, namely the availability and access to sufficient long-term credit. This barrier was
addressed by encouraging commercial banks to lend to renewable energy projects in order to
demonstrate that the risks are manageable and that lending would also be profitable. Once
commercial banks recognized this, they were expected to continue lending for these projects,
even without support from RERED. The true criterion of success of RERED is in the continued
lending for renewable energy projects by commercial banks and the initial findings post Project
completion are very encouraging. SPPAs have been signed for an additional 95 renewable energy
projects with a total capacity of 281 MW, commercial banks are willing to continue lending in
the sector, and some banks have even taken their financing abroad on other renewable energy
projects outside of Sri Lanka. In addition, the credibility created by RERED and ESD have led to
other investors financing grid-tied renewable projects. These include, fund mobilization through
Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) by several local firms, entry of foreign funds, and a risk sharing
facility from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) namely, Portfolio Approach to
Distributed Generation Opportunities (PADGO) Project. It would be of interest for the SEA to
continue monitoring these trends and other relevant ones.

The SHS component of the Project (Component 2) was largely of similar design to the one
financed under ESD given the success achieved under the latter. The outcome of the SHS sub-



                                                 18
component of ESD was rated satisfactory, and while the design did not vary much between the
two projects, the SHS component of RERED faced substantial difficulties. This illustrated that
sometimes the most important lessons can be learned years after project completion and not
always immediately following completion of a project. It is worth noting that the difficulties
were not necessarily due to component design or product failures, but rather because the market
reached saturation leading to fewer business opportunities for vendors. As a result, the cost of
doing business went up and led to a higher transaction cost and smaller volumes. A number of
solar companies closed down and their customers were left without support prompting many to
stop repaying their loans. These issues led to a somewhat negative reputation for solar PV.

It is therefore important for SEA to continue monitoring the impact of the activities implemented
under RERED as it will help also in supporting the Government’s continued effort of off-grid
electrification of remaining households to achieve island-wide electrification.

A possible follow-up to the RERED Project could be support for the development of wind energy
as well as power generation from biomass and grid-connected solar PV (where installed cost is
dropping rapidly). The distribution utilities and the regulator (PUCSL) introduced net metering
regulations that allow individual customers to install solar PV systems where the electricity
generated from PV offsets their electricity payments at the retail tariffs. Few investments of
these schemes (limited to 42 kWp per facility) are happening as residential tariffs were recently
increased to as much as Rs 50.4/kWh (currently about US$0.38/kWh). Small hydro development
is now considered a commercial practice with sufficient expertise in the country which may not
require additional support. Biomass generation, and to a lesser extent wind power and solar PV,
are still facing a number of barriers and support to overcome these barriers would be useful.
These barriers include some of a technical nature, as well as regulatory and financing barriers.
There are at present no renewable energy projects in the World Bank lending pipeline for Sri
Lanka.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

RERED is still highly relevant to Sri Lanka, the Bank and global energy and climate initiatives.
Grid-connected renewables supplies electricity to consumers from indigenous resources. At the
national level, this contributes to reduced expenditures on imported fossil fuels as well as
greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel based electricity generation.

The grid-connected renewable energy sub-project development under RERED is in line with the
October 2006 GoSL National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka as it addressed 3 of the 9
main elements of that policy, namely: (i) provide basic energy needs; (ii) improve energy
security; and (iii) use indigenous resources. This is also consistent with President Mahinda
Rajapaksa’s ‘Mahinda Chinthanaya – Vision for the Future’ which commits to increasing
generation from renewable energy (excluding large hydro) to 20% of total generation by 2020
corresponding to about 4,000 GWh/year (or ~1300 MW in installed capacity). The development
of grid-connected renewables responds to the 2009 CAS outcome 2.1 Improving Infrastructure
Provision. As a result of these sub-projects, a vibrant sustainable world-class SME-based



                                               19
renewable energy industrial sector has developed with good domestic and foreign business
prospects. This also contributes to achieving CAS outcome 2.2 Improving the Business
Environment for Stronger Entrepreneurship and Knowledge-based Economy.

As the Project ended prior to the completion of the latest CPS dated April 2012, there are no
direct indicators to which the Project contributes to in this CPS; however, it is believed that as a
result of RERED interventions, outcomes such as ‘Improved access to finance’ (under 1.1
Improving investment climate) as well as Improved quality and sustainability of infrastructure
(under 3.1 Increasing the quality of service delivery). This attribution is mainly due to the
emergence of a sustainable industry which is engaged in developing, financing and operations
and maintenance of energy delivery systems. Moreover, commercial banks are continuing to
lend to private developers whereas in the past the latter faced significant challenges securing
financing (or obtaining it at much higher costs) due to perceived risks of small-scale privately-
developed infrastructure projects in the county and/or the usually high capital cost of these
investments.

To date, climate change is still one of most important global priorities. Its’ impact not only on the
environment, but on food security, water resources, etc. is critical, and the grid-connected
renewable energy sub-projects reduce the carbon intensity of the power supply in Sri Lanka. In
addition, lessons learned and experience gained from the implementation of the RERED project
has been shared with a number of countries many of whom have adopted similar models in the
development of their renewable energy initiatives.

Electrification has been a high priority for GoSL. The 2006 Energy Policy calls for 85%
electrification by 2015. In 2010, GoSL announced its intention to have island-wide electrification
by the end of 20127. To achieve the 100 percent electrification goal, GoSL is investing
significantly in network expansion, using off-grid means to electrify roughly 40,000 customers
who are “beyond the last mile,? and adding new generation capacity. If the subsidy required for
grid connection exceeds LKR 200,000 per household (approximately US$ 2,000), those
households will be provided with an alternative subsidy to obtain a robust renewable energy-
based off-grid solution.

Therefore, the off-grid schemes developed under RERED remain highly relevant to GoSL’s
priorities. From the Bank’s perspective, these are also relevant to the 2009 CAS outcome 1.1
Supporting Integrated Rural Development and outcome 2.1 Improving Infrastructure Provision
by providing electricity services which in turn improves market connectivity. The village hydro
sub-projects also contribute to village organization through the establishment of electricity
consumer societies. The off-grid activities contribute to CAS outcome 1.2 Improve Economic
Opportunities in North and East as 15% of the SHS supported by RERED were sold to
households in those areas. This is also relevant to the 2012 CPS as off-grid electricity
significantly improves households’ quality of life and social inclusion.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

Achievement of the following objectives is discussed:
7
    Electrification data shows that at the end of the first quarter of 2012 the electrification ratio had reached about 92 percent.


                                                                    20
    1. Improve the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable energy technologies to
       bring electricity to remote communities;
    2. Promote private sector power generation from renewable energy resources for the main
       grid;
    3. Reduce atmospheric carbon emissions by removing barriers and reducing implementation
       costs for renewable energy, and removing barriers to energy efficiency.

The first objective corresponds in particular with component 2 (Solar PV Investments) and
component 3 (Independent Grid System). The two components cover about 18% of the actual
total expenditures for the Project. The second and third objectives relate in particular to
component 1 (Grid-Connected Renewable Energy Power Generation), which incurred about 80%
of actual total expenditures of Project funds.


Objective 1: Improve the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable energy
technologies to bring electricity to remote communities.

RERED aimed to provide 161,000 households, rural small and medium enterprises and public
institutions access to electricity services through off-grid renewable energy schemes. In 2010, the
target was reduced to 113,500 based on the forecast demand for off-grid electrification. The final
accounting for off-grid electrification showed that RERED had provided access to electricity to
110,575 households through the sales of SHS while 6,220 households were electrified through
independent grid systems, mainly village hydro. In total RERED provided 116,795 households
access to electricity, which exceeded the revised target by a small margin.

It is also important to realize that for many families, first time access to electricity was a life-
changing event. Electricity from SHS and off-grid community-based hydro sub-projects has
made a lasting impact on the lives of the beneficiaries. Although there has been only a limited
improvement in their income, they have gained significant benefits in quality of life through
better lighting, enabling children to study longer in the evening hours, facilitating the work of
women and improving family and community relationships. Of these benefits, improved
domestic lighting has played the most significant role in improving the quality of life. Many
villagers described the improved lighting as “a reawakening of their lives,? believing that they
would have never realized this dream in their lifetime.

Electric lighting when compared to alternatives such as kerosene lanterns – which had long been
used by the village communities – offers distinct advantages: (a) it is far safer as it dramatically
reduces kerosene-related accidents including fire and burns; (b) it is cleaner as soot build up from
burning kerosene oil in homes is avoided; (c) it improves safety by allowing more light points,
especially for outdoor use; and (d) provides overall greater quality of lighting.

Off-grid electricity is also extensively used for watching television, leading to more awareness of
the outside world, in addition to the entertainment aspect. Surveys8 carried out during Project

implementation showed that husbands devoted more time to the family (80% of the respondents
in surveys) and reduced time spent outside of the house including alcohol consumption in the
evening (20% of respondents). Villagers feel safer (60 – 87 % of the respondents of different
surveys) and reported that there is more unity among villagers and an increase in socio-cultural
activities resulting from electricity at religious places in the villages (80% of the respondents).
The use of computers was also observed in a few houses electrified by village hydro schemes.

Contrary to expectation, the availability of electricity did not stimulate the development of
enterprises. It did, however, improve operation of existing enterprises. According to reports from
PCIs and consultants, access to electricity improved economic activities of 742 (household)
enterprises or 0.6% of total number of electrified households. Economic activities that benefited
from access to electricity include grocery shops, bakeries, battery-charging stations,
communication centers, computer training centers, grinding/rice milling and cinnamon
processing. Although there was no formal target according to the PAD, the Bank team tried to
capture this data during implementation by assuming that the 1,500 households, small/medium
enterprises and public institutions targeted for electrification from the original IDA Credit (1,000)
and the Additional Financing (500), would experience an increase in income generating activities
as a result of the provision of electricity. However, as indicated above, that implicit target was
not achieved.

Although the revised targets have been achieved, and the impact on those receiving access to
electricity is evident from surveys, there are a few issues to be noted. Of the 110,575 SHS sold to
rural households an estimated 20,000 had to be repossessed because households defaulted on
their loans. In general, the PCIs only repossessed the modules which were deemed as their only
collateral. The value of the repossessed modules was insufficient to recover the outstanding
balance. Further, a small number of SHS and village hydro systems are no longer used because
the households have since been connected to the electricity grid. On the other hand, many rural
households – in spite of being connected to the grid - continue to use their SHS as a back-up
system and some villagers continue to use their village hydro system. By doing so, they are able
to reduce their electricity bills.

On the other hand, while several village systems have now been connected to the grid, another
important development occurred. Under a scheme similar to an SPPA but for smaller systems,
the off-grid village systems connected to the grid can now sell power to the utility at an agreed
tariff. This is a win-win situation for the villages communities who have invested money and
sweat equity into their off-grid systems as they can now benefit from the reliability of the
national grid, while continuing to earn revenues from the sale of electricity generated by their
village hydro schemes back to the utility at an agreed tariff (see Annex 2 for more details.)

It should be noted that not all rural households using off-grid schemes have benefitted from the
expansion of the national, grid approximately 40,000 households are expected to still remain
without access to the national grid (including some who are on small islands.) This is in addition
to thousands who are still using off-grid schemes or other means such as kerosene for lighting
today. However, for those who have benefitted from faster than anticipated grid expansion this
was a positive development as it provides a higher level of services and is more affordable for
households. Off-grid electricity supply provided years of access to electricity before the arrival



                                                 22
of the grid to their communities, and for those households who have yet to receive grid power,
the off-grid schemes are still very much valued.

The number of grid connected domestic customers were 2.82 million in 2004. By 2010, that
number had increased to 3.96 million - an increase of 1.14 million. Grid electrification now
serves 92 percent of households making off-grid less relevant than originally anticipated at
Project Appraisal. However, off-grid schemes have demonstrated that SHS and/or independent
mini grids are a viable option for rural areas where the cost of grid extension would be
prohibitive for the utility.

Overall, achieving this objective is rated satisfactory as benefits to electrified households
outweigh the difficulties and challenges encountered.


Objective 2: Promote private sector power generation from renewable energy resources for
the main grid

The indicator for achieving objective 2 was the installation of an additional 135 MW of small-
scale renewable grid-connected power generation capacity installed (85 MW under RERED and
50 MW under the Additional Financing). In reality, RERED supported the installation of about
185.3 MW grid-connected renewable energy sub-projects. This included 2 wind projects (19.8
MW total capacity), 1 biomass project (1 MW capacity) and 68 mini hydro projects (164.5 MW
total capacity.) Only the biomass project stopped operating9. Private sector developers developed
all projects, using loans provided by commercial banks participating in RERED. The PCIs
extended loans totaling US$ 122 million (LKR 12.84 billion), which is on average 59.5% of total
project cost. The total investment was about US$ 205 million (LKR 21.55 billion).
As of March 2012, there were 102 NCRE projects connected to the grid. The total installed
capacity from those was 243.1 MW of which almost 65% was a result of RERED support. The
total energy generated during 2011 from NCRE was 722 GWh10 of which RERED-funded sub-
projects contributed 422.5 GWh (58%).

There are good indications that development of grid-connected renewables will continue after the
close of the RERED project. About 26 other plants commissioned to date have not been financed
by RERED or ESD, most of which were commissioned during the last few years of RERED
implementation. In addition, there is a pipeline of about 95 projects for which an SPPA has been
signed between private developers and CEB. Developers have shown a continued desire to
undertake private investment in renewable energy generation even without support from RERED,
and commercial banks continue to finance these investments. Sources of funds include private
equity, funds raised through stock markets, foreign equity investors and support from a small IFC
loan guarantee facility. This demonstrates that the expected outputs and outcomes have been
achieved.

  The 1 MW Walapane biomass power plant at Nuwara Eliya was Sri Lanka’s first grid-connected biomass plant commissioned
in November 2004. It stopped operation due to a variety of reasons, including fuel supply issues, frequent grid failure and
remoteness of the plant site. The failure of this project made PCIs more reluctant to lend for biomass power projects.

Whilst the above discussion highlights the significant achievements associated with this
objective, they do not capture the full picture. In achieving this objective, the Project contributed
to the creation of a world-class renewable energy industry in Sri Lanka (in particular for small
hydropower) comprising investors, private developers, financiers, engineers/designers, planners,
operators, equipment manufacturers, etc. In addition, rural communities benefitted from both
temporary and long-term employment opportunities from construction and operations of the sub-
projects and overall improved infrastructure as GoSL had undertaken construction of new roads
and/or repair of existing ones to facilitate the construction activities for some of these sub-
projects. A number of villages benefitted from piped water supply, construction of houses,
school facilities, community centers and improved facilities at places of worship. Developers
carried out these improvements mainly to create goodwill among the villagers, while some were
done as compensation payments to the villagers.

Overall achieving this objective is rated highly satisfactory.

Objective 3: reduce atmospheric carbon emissions by removing barriers and reducing
implementation costs for renewable energy, and removing barriers to energy efficiency

The indicators for achieving the global environmental objective were: (i) avoiding emissions of
1.25 million tons of CO2); and (ii) promotion of the adoption of renewable energy by removing
market barriers and reducing implementation cost. The quantifiable indicator was not increased
with the additional financing.

The avoided emissions are calculated from the actual renewable electricity production. As given
above, total electricity generation from RERED-financed sub-projects in 2011 was 422.5 GWh.
Total generation supplied will fluctuate, mainly depending on rainfall (for the hydro plants.)
When considering that not all plants commissioned in 2011 are operating at full capacity or were
in operation for a full year, and those commissioned in 2012 or yet to be commissioned did not
generate any electricity as of yet, the electricity generation figure used is considered a
conservative estimate for the total annual electricity generation over the lifetime of the sub-
projects.

Assuming an average carbon emission coefficient for Sri Lanka of 0.8 kgCO2/kWh, the resulting
avoided emissions of sub-projects commissioned to date is 1.84 million tons CO2) surpassing the
target by 47%. By estimating the total expected generation from all plants commissioned in 2012
or those expected to be commissioned by year’s end, the volume of avoided CO2 emissions
would be 2.15 million.

The removal of market barriers is evident from the additional installed capacity of grid-connected
renewable energy from all investments in the sector. The main market barriers first addressed by
the ESD project at a smaller scale were more substantially addressed through RERED. Those
were: (i) commercial banks not willing to lend for grid-connected renewable energy projects
because they are not familiar with these until then untried projects and consider lending in this
sector too risky; (ii) developers cannot obtain lending (or lending with longer tenures) for these
projects; (iii) un-electrified households had little access to clean electricity services on affordable




                                                  24
terms; (iv) investors considered renewable energy investments to be risky; and (v) CEB is
reluctant to purchase electricity from grid-connected renewable energy plants.

The resulting reduction in carbon emissions can also be attributed to the off-grid schemes as well,
though these are far smaller in volume than emissions avoided from the grid-connected sub-
projects.

Achieving this objective is rated highly satisfactory.

3.3   Results Framework

The objectives of RERED were all within the direct control of the Project. Higher-level
objectives could have been: (i) create strong support and commitment among Government
agencies and CEB for the development of grid-connected renewable energy sub-projects; and (ii)
create recognition that renewable energy-based off-grid electrification schemes are a viable and
preferred option for areas where the cost of grid extension is prohibitive. These higher-level
objectives also have been achieved with RERED playing a crucial role.

The CEB has changed from a reluctant acceptor of grid-connected renewable energy to a strong
supporter of those. CEB stated that power purchased from small renewable energy plants, had
saved the utility LKR 2 billion in electricity generation cost in 2010, resulting from reduced
expenditure on imported heavy fuel oil and other fossil fuels based power generation.

The Mahinda Chinthanaya calls for generation from renewable energy to reach 20% of total
electricity generation or about 4,000 GWh/year by 2020 and the 2012 National Energy Policy
currently under preparation calls for increasing the renewable energy generation capacity from
234 MW at the end of 2012 to 928 MW by 2020. Mahinda Chinthanaya also commits to 100
percent access to grid electricity for all households.

3.4    Efficiency

3.4.1 Economic

Grid-connected mini hydros were the dominant investment in the “grid-tied? component. A mini
hydro sub-project was used as a representative project for the economic and financial analyses.
Post completion, the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) was 46 percent for a
representative 2.5 MW mini hydro plant with an investment cost of US$1,445/kW, a plant factor
of 38 percent and an avoided cost of US$0.252/kWh based on Short-Run Marginal Cost (SRMC)
of highest cost thermal plants offset by the mini hydro generation. The economic analysis at
Appraisal for a 1,500 kW mini hydro plant showed an EIRR of 24 percent. The higher EIRR is
attributed to the higher avoided cost even though plant factor was lower and investment cost
higher than at Appraisal.

Solar Home Systems. Households using a SHS will save on kerosene for lighting and batteries as
well as receiving far superior and safer lighting services from electric lighting compared to
kerosene lighting. A 40 Wp SHS is used for the representative analysis. The EIRR is 88 percent



                                                 25
when consumer surplus (attributed to the far superior electric lighting) is considered. If consumer
surplus is disregarded, the EIRR is 13 percent. There was no EIRR calculated at Appraisal for
this component.

Village hydro. The village hydro plant saves kerosene for lighting and batteries as well as
providing far superior and safer electric lighting services compared to kerosene lighting. Beyond
meeting households’ basic electricity needs, they have the potential to meet other electricity
needs in the community such as ironing, water pumping, and power for small enterprises. The
EIRR of a representative sub-project was calculated taking into account only savings due to
avoided kerosene and battery use as well as consumer surplus gained from using superior electric
lighting. The EIRR for a representative sub-project with a capacity of 8 kW and serving 30
households is 54 percent when consumer surplus was considered and 9 percent if consumer
surplus was not considered. The EIRR of a typical village hydro sub-project was reported as 12
percent at Appraisal.

3.4.2 Financial

Grid connected mini hydro. The financial analysis of the representative 2.5 MW mini hydro plant
shows a Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 17 percent against an FIRR of 21 percent
calculated at Appraisal. The FIRR varies substantially from sub-project to sub-project depending
on site characteristics, which determine investment cost and plant factor. The financial analysis
used the flat rate 20-year tariff approved by the regulator, PUCSL, which was applicable in 2010.

Solar Home Systems. The FIRR for the representative 40 Wp SHS was 12 percent compared to 7
percent estimated at Appraisal. While the 12 percent is comparable to interest that is paid on a
fixed deposit savings account, it would be considered a low return on an investment that a poor
household with few savings would expect. However given the poorer quality of services from
kerosene lighting, the expenses and difficulties of transporting batteries for recharging, a
household would expect to give the SHS services a higher value than merely its financial returns.

Village hydro. The FIRR for the 7.5 kW representative sub-project is 50 percent. The high FIRR
is due to the significant reduction in investment costs due to grants provided, which reduce the
investment cost to US$704/kW (compared to a SHS of over US$9,000/kW after grant). Without
investment subsidies, the FIRR would drop to 13 percent. Even more so than in the case of an
SHS, the level of services provided by the village hydro plant is much greater than that of the
alternative (kerosene lighting, dry cell batteries, battery charging, etc.) For example, in the
representative sub-project evaluated, a household could potentially use nearly 60 kWh per month
given the generation potential of the village hydro scheme (compared to 5.5 kWh per month from
a 40 Wp SHS.)

3.5   Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The RERED PDOs and GEOs have been achieved. The indicator for grid-connected renewable
energy capacity and avoided emissions has been exceeded by a substantial margin, while the
indicator for rural households connected through off-grid renewable electricity options was less



                                                26
than planned, bearing in mind that the number of households electrified by the grid far exceeded
expectations at Appraisal. The objectives of project are still highly relevant to the Government of
Sri Lanka and within the World Bank CAS. The sub-projects supported by RERED are
economically and financially sound.

Based on actual expenditure, it can be argued that the grid-connected component was the most
dominant component of the Project (nearly 80% of expenditures against 18% for off-grid
component). Therefore, the shortcomings in the smaller element of the project must be weighed
against achievements above expectation by the larger component and the one contributing to the
major development of the PDOs and GEOs. Giving an overall rating for this Project only as
‘satisfactory’ would not do the project justice in conveying the truly transformational and
breakthrough achievements of this Project and the significant benefits it has brought to Sri Lanka.
On the other hand, rating this project as ‘highly satisfactory’ would downplay some of the
shortcomings, especially on the smaller components. In order to maintain a high standard and
remain critical it is considered appropriate to maintain an overall rating of ‘satisfactory.’

3.6    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.6.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The off-grid electrification elements of the project (i.e. components 2 and 3) had achieved the
intended rural development impact envisioned at Appraisal. In both off-grid electrification
options, household lighting has improved considerably. Electrification offers the possibility of
increased lighting points in homes and for outdoor lights. Village communities have felt the
difference and clearly expressed preference in the cleanliness aspect of electric lighting compared
to kerosene lanterns. This has also prompted some to invest in home improvements. Village
hydro also offers the opportunity of using equipment with a higher power rating such as
television sets, grinders, power tools, heaters and irons.

The World Bank IEG 2008 impact evaluation of rural electrification (which includes off-grid
electrification) concluded that the economic case for investment in rural electrification is proven,
provided that technical problems in service provision are adequately addressed. It further
concludes: (i) electricity represents cost savings compared with kerosene; (ii) electricity can spur
growth of home businesses; (iii) electricity extends waking hours; and (iv) electrification benefits
the quality of health services. The positive effect of electrification on woman has been
extensively described in the EnPoGen series of reports (2002).

The study found that even in minimal quantities, electricity brings about profound lifestyle
changes in families, mainly by making home life more convenient and housework easier.
Electricity results in time savings in the daily lives of both men and women. Men use these
mainly for recreation and leisure, whereas women redirect it to other household chores. On the
whole, time savings from electricity do not reduce the overall work load of women, although they
make work easier. The social development impact comes from Alleviation of isolation, through
television and radio. This is considered the next highest benefit of electricity as it serves to bring
remote rural communities closer to the outside world. Further, the level of social interaction
within households and communities increase with electricity, which contributes in numerous
ways to social capital development. The above is confirmed in the project surveys summarized in

the “Completion Report? which reports on achievements in the period September 2004 to
September 200811.

3.6.2 Institutional Change/Strengthening
RERED was instrumental in developing a vibrant renewable energy industry in Sri Lanka. A
large number of renewable energy sub-projects and schemes were initiated as a result of
availability of RERED financing. Consequently, a demand for supporting services developed,
including project development, technical/advisory, construction, equipment manufacturing,
financing, etc. Given the long-term support extended by the Bank in the sector over a period of
15 years (including ESD), these services were able to thrive. Moreover, the Project contributed
to the formation of several associations, including solar, village hydro developers and small
power. These continue to be active today and play an important role in representing their
industry in government, regulatory and other consultations. As a result, Sri Lanka now has a
world-class renewable energy industry with developers, manufacturers, and financiers venturing
abroad to undertake investments in renewable energy projects in other countries in Asia and
Africa. A few examples include:

        Five Sri Lankan mini hydro developers are now active in East Asia;
        Lanka Ventures, an equity financier, is investing in mini hydro projects in East Africa;
        VS Hydro is an established consultancy in the hydropower industry, and undertakes its
         own contracting and manufacturing of turbines in Sri Lanka and has investments in
         Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.
        An 18 MW plant in Uganda uses three 6 MW turbines manufactured in Sri Lanka.

3.6.3 Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
To enlarge the SHS market and speed up sales, MFIs were brought in under ESD and continued
to have a role under RERED. The MFIs were providing loans to households for the purchase of
SHSs. The MFIs were frequently under pressure from vendors to process loans faster in order to
maintain the sales levels of SHSs. At the same time, extending loans for SHSs was profitable and,
thus, the MFIs also had an incentive to increase the number of loans. The process was moving
well until about 2006 when defaults began to increase and some PV modules had to be
repossessed (with MFIs unable to resell those at prices high enough to cover the unpaid balance
of the loans.) This led to substantial losses for the MFIs who eventually ceased to provide loans
for SHS altogether. This was an unintended negative impact.

At the same time, Lanka Orix Leasing Company (LOLC) entered the micro financing business
only in 2003 to provide SHS loans under RERED. LOLC provided about 12,000 loans for SHS,
of which about 4,000 defaulted. The repossessed modules could not be sold and were finally
combined into a grid-connected PV array at LOLCs headquarters in Colombo. LOLC incurred
substantial losses from providing SHS loans, yet still considers its’ participation in RERED of
great value. As a consequence of its participation in the Project, an LOLC subsidiary is now the
largest MFI in Sri Lanka. It also ventured overseas (Cambodia) providing micro credits,
interestingly for SHS. This is an unintended positive impact.

3.7     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
The AU carried out a beneficiary survey among the participating PCIs, which was administered
and analyzed by an independent third party. The most interesting results of the survey were that
PCIs had entered the business of lending for grid-connected renewable energy because of ESD
and RERED, but they are now confident enough to continue lending for those projects provided
they are viable at commercial interest rates. The work of the AU was also highly praised. Details
are provided in Annex 5.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

The risks to the following outcomes are assessed:
   1. Improved quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable energy technologies to bring
       electricity to remote communities
   2. Promoted private sector power generation from renewable energy resources for the main
       grid
   3. Reduced atmospheric carbon emissions by removing barriers and reducing
       implementation costs for renewable energy, and removing barriers to energy efficiency

The risk to the improved quality of life by utilizing off-grid renewable energy technologies to
bring electricity to remote communities is considered low. The risk of communities no longer
using the off-grid renewable energy technologies for another reason than the arrival of the grid is
low. Once they have experienced the benefits of electrification they will make considerable
efforts to maintain this service. If communities are connected to the grid, the level of services
improves and therewith the quality of life. In many cases, the off-grid options may be maintained
as back-up or to reduce the grid electricity bill.

RERED contributed to the development of an off-grid renewable energy industry. A substantial
part of the capacity built and infrastructure established has not been sustained. Of the 14 SHS
vendors at the peak of sales, only 2 vendors are still active in the off-grid sector. Those two
vendors are, however, expected to continue the SHS business because there still is a market with
little or no competition. Several of the 14 SHS vendors are now offering grid-connected solar PV
systems (typically 1-2 kWp each), under net metering rules. Some of the technicians trained
under ESD/RERED are providing independent after sales services in their area and SHS vendors
depend on their services to fulfill their obligations. Development of village hydro without
RERED support is unlikely while the need is also declining due to rapid grid expansion.
Developers active in village hydro have moved to other areas and some are now providing
consultancy services in India and Africa.

While there is a risk that some of the grid-connected renewable energy sub-projects would stop
operating (mainly for projects where PPAs will be expiring and the tariff offered for those would
be too low to sustain operations), it is highly unlikely that this would occur in any considerable
numbers as these projects are very profitable, especially after debt is paid off (between 5 to 10
years.) The risk that the private sector ceases to develop and seek new projects is considered low
unless tariffs decline substantially to the point where the economics become unviable. The
Government has indicated its commitment to the participation of the private sector in electricity



                                                29
generation, especially from renewable resources. These projects are financially viable and
commercial banks are continuing to lend, even without RERED refinancing. In addition, RERED
contributed to the establishment of a sustainable renewable energy industry which is now catering
to more than just the local demand.

Project developers and the CEB both have a shared interest in maximizing renewable energy
production. As the alternative will remain imported fossil fuel based electricity generation, the
risk to the conservation in greenhouse gas emissions is considered low.

The overall risks to achieving the PDO and GEO are considered Negligible to Low.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The quality at entry was satisfactory. RERED was for the most part a continuation of the
successful ESD project. Successful approaches piloted under ESD were incorporated in RERED
and the proven management structure was maintained. Lessons learned from the implementation
of ESD were applied in the design of RERED. Conversely, and in retrospect, the benchmarking
of loans to AWFDR in the Additional Financing (from AWDR in the first RERED IDA Credit)
should have been carefully studied as this shift constrained the Projects’ ability to commit and
disburse funds until the decision was made to revert back to AWDR. Also, in retrospect, the
removal of the GEF grant for larger systems was probably done pre-maturely. The only
shortcoming was the inclusion of two relative small components (energy efficiency/DSM and
cross-sectoral energy applications) which did not yield the anticipated results and diverted the
focus from the main components. Overall the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is
rated satisfactory.

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank supervision was made easy by the high quality of the implementing agency. This enabled
the Bank supervision team to maintain a more strategic management role rather than day to day
handholding of all activities. This also tremendously improved the sense of ownership by the
implementing agency and GoSL, and facilitated the AU to propose solutions to arising problems.
The Bank responded adequately and timely on requests for clearances and No Objections and
participated regularly in meetings with all Project stakeholders. The role of the Bank was highly
valued in the feedback survey conducted at the end of RERED.

The quality of supervision could have been improved through deeper involvement by the Bank in
areas where the AU was weak. The AU was not as proactive in administering the technical
assistance component, and less TA had taken place than envisaged. Many TA activities were
intended to be demand driven, and the AU on its own did initiate many capacity building
programs unless requests were made by the industry, Project stakeholders or beneficiaries. The
proper analysis of the problems faced by the SHS which took place could have been done sooner.



                                               30
When the analysis was finally completed it was too late for recommendations to be implemented.
Finally, the Bank should have insisted on better transition arrangements including digitalizing the
archives and transfer of files.

The benefits of creating ownership (highly satisfactory) balance the disadvantage of a hands-off
approach (moderately satisfactory). Overall, the quality of supervision is rated satisfactory.

5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Given the satisfactory rating for both ‘ensuring quality at entry’ and ‘quality of supervision,’ the
overall rating of the Bank performance is satisfactory.



5.2    Borrower Performance

5.2.1 Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Government took a hands-off approach on day-to-day implementation while playing an
essential market enabling role. The Project was designed to support the private sector in
developing grid-connected and off-grid renewable energy projects, and implemented by a
commercial entity, namely the RERED AU of DFCC Bank. The Government limited its role to
creating an enabling environment and providing counterpart funding for these sub-projects to
flourish. The AU was being funded by the Government based on the level of disbursements of the
refinanced loans. In turn, the Government was very responsive to requests for assistance from the
AU and helped address problems arising during implementation. The Government also provided
considerable grant support for SHS (directly) and village hydro schemes (through provincial
councils) and, through CEB, established attractive tariffs for selling renewable electricity to the
national grid and ensured that the SPPA terms and conditions were adhered to by all parties.
Based on the above, the Government performance is rated as satisfactory.

5.2.2 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The performance of the AU is rated highly satisfactory. The AU was highly committed to
achieving the objectives of the Project. They established very good relationships with all major
stakeholder groups, including PCIs, MFIs, developers, SHS vendors, village hydro developers,
industry associations, and village electricity societies. The AU avoided a possible conflict of
interest by separating itself from the lending arm of DFCC Bank. This aspect was highly
appreciated by the other PCIs who were competing against DFCC on refinancing loans. The AU
had full ownership of the Project and proactively coming up with solutions to arising problems,
with input and support from the World Bank and the Government, where needed. The AU
established well-documented procedures, kept good and complete files on all sub-projects and
maintained detailed records. The areas where the AU could have done better include: (i) being
more creative in identifying opportunities for TA activities to support the various components;
(ii) devoting adequate attention to all components; and (iii) planning for a smoother transition at
Project close.



                                                31
Although there were minor shortcomings, the performance of the implementation agency was
exceptional and is rated highly satisfactory.

5.2.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
As Government performance was rated satisfactory and implementing agency performance rated
highly satisfactory, the overall Borrowers’ performance is rated satisfactory.

6.       Lessons Learned

A number of valuable lessons can be taken away from the implementation of RERED. These
lessons are in particular important for the design and implementation of possible follow-up
initiatives to RERED, and for the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority to take into account in
future sustainability of the sector. These lessons are also relevant for future renewable energy
projects in other countries.

The most important lessons include:

        Lesson 1: Long term involvement is very important;
        Lesson 2: A quality implementation body is vital;
        Lesson 3: Private sector market growth should be carefully managed where possible;
        Lesson 4: Stakeholder consultation throughout the project cycle is necessary;
        Lesson 5: Risk analysis should be carried out also during implementation;
        Lesson 6: Performance-based incentives to selected developers is key in enabling
         communities to get expert support;
        Lesson 7: Prepare well for project closure;
        Lesson 8: World Bank involvement added credibility.

Lesson 1. Long-term involvement is very important
As mentioned elsewhere in the document, RERED (and the Additional Finance) were a follow-up
to the ESD project and this string of continuity in engagement with the country covers a period of
more than 14 years. Implementation of ESD started slowly largely because different stakeholders
had to grow into their respective roles and start-up problems had to be resolved. These start-up
problems did not happen in RERED. The procedures and systems set-up during ESD were, with
minor modifications, also used for RERED. The long project period enabled building trust and
good relationships between the AU and the various stakeholders. It also provided sufficient time
to convince PCIs that the risk of lending for grid- connected renewable energy sub-projects was
manageable. Policies established under ESD could be monitored under RERED and emerging
problems could be addressed. A much shorter duration of the project would have substantially
increased the risk to the sustainability of the results.

Long-term involvement also enables the identification of problems that usually occur much later,
sometimes after several years. The off-grid PV component was considered a success at the end of
ESD, and so with minor modifications, this component was continued under RERED. It took
almost four years after the start of RERED for problems to surface. A number of factors


                                               32
contributed to the problems encountered, these were: (a) there was no mechanism to address
vendors not honoring after sales and warrantee obligations as they stopped providing after sales
and warrantee services because of bankruptcy or because business was becoming non-profitable
in a small and dispersed market; (b) dissatisfied end-users stopped repayment of SHS loans to
PCIs who in turn began repossessing the PV modules, and the re-sales of these would not cover
the outstanding balance because the price of new modules was reducing significantly over time;
(d) a shrinking market due to expansion of the grid at a faster pace than assumed; (e) PCIs were
providing fewer loans with, as a consequence, further shrinking of the market.

These developments show that design issues may become apparent years after project closure and
it was because of RERED that these could at the least be monitored and salvage efforts be made.
In projects with shorter durations, such problems would only be identified after an evaluation is
carried out several years from completion. More importantly, in a rapidly saturating market,
businesses must be agile to adopt and be responsive to new market conditions – what worked
where electrification rate is low will not be viable in areas where electricity coverage is high.

Lesson 2: A quality implementing body is vital
The quality of the implementing agency is vital to the success of any project. The implementing
body needs to have ownership, authority and the responsibility to be flexible in addressing arising
problems. The implementing agency should be able to function independently and solve issues on
its own, while knowing when to involve the Government and the World Bank where appropriate.
Another key aspect was in building trust among key beneficiaries and stakeholders. The
implementing body must have adequate staffing and the right skill mix to carry out the various
tasks. It must also be able to devote sufficient time to the project.

Lesson 3: Private sector market growth should be carefully managed where possible
The provision of off-grid electricity using SHS depended on private vendors, and the village
hydro component depended on private village hydro developers. These private sector parties
enter into this business only when profit is to be made. In some isolated cases, this has led to
participation of unqualified and/or undesirable private entities, which were drawn by the grants
on offer. However, many of the unqualified/undesirable entities were not strictly private sector,
but small non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or community-based organizations (CBOs).
The private sector 'businesses' that engaged in village hydro to expressly earn a profit were, on
the whole, fine. The real problems arose towards the end of ESD when a large number of new
developers were trained (in hindsight inadequately) in order to scale up village hydro
development. Some village hydro developers lacked the required technical and community
development skills, causing frustration among Village Electricity Consumer Societies (VECS),
PCIs and the AU. The AU addressed this problem by introducing a pre-qualification process for
all village hydro developers and also equipment suppliers. This may have reduced the number of
developers but it substantially improved the quality and reduce conflicts otherwise.

When SHS sales grew steeply (2003 to 2005) a large number of SHS vendors entered the market
as entry barriers were low, which later became overcrowded and resulted in declining margins for
each vendor. As the growth rate slowed down, the market was less profitable, causing vendors to
go bankrupt or cease operations. In both cases, after sales services and warrantee obligations
were often not honored. In hindsight, it would have been better to manage the growth phase more



                                                33
carefully to assure sustainability of after sales and warrantee services. On the other hand, there
are factors beyond the control of Project as managing such growth can often be complex and
difficult to control. Where possible, the implementation would have been easier with a smaller
number of pre-qualified SHS vendors. One disadvantage is that prices and services would need
to be regulated by an appropriate body in the country as having fewer vendors might lead to
monopolizing power in some areas. Introducing more stringent entry requirements such as the
provision of guarantees and/or performance bonds may have also helped address this problem.

Lesson 4: Stakeholder consultation throughout the project cycle
Implementation of RERED confirmed the importance of maintaining an ongoing dialogue with
the main stakeholders and beneficiaries. The AU maintained this dialogue through regular
meetings and visits and actively supported the strengthening of stakeholder groups such as the
Federation of Electricity Consumer Societies and other technology associations. Consultations
strengthened trust and understanding of problems and constraints amongst the various
stakeholder groups.

Lesson 5: Risk analysis should be carried out also during implementation
An analysis of the risk to achieving the PDO and GEO should be carried out also during
implementation and not only during preparation. External experts, not involved in the
implementation of the Project, should preferable carry out this assessment. That way, it is
possible to identify new risks, assess the risks of emerging problems, and take appropriate action.

Lesson 6: Performance based incentives works well
The project provided performance-based incentives to selected village hydro developers. This
provided an incentive to developers to help communities develop village hydro schemes. The
developers would identify the village, mobilize the community and establish contacts with
appropriate financing institutions, many of whom were not participating in RERED. Payment of
developers by the Project was based on achieving clearly defined milestones. This minimized the
risk to the Project and reduced the workload of the implementing agency. The Development of
grid-connected renewable energy sub-projects was based on a similar principle where the Project
did not need to identify the opportunities but rather only evaluate those proposed by the
developers. Subsidies to SHS vendors were also performance-based depending on proven sales of
SHS. On the other hand, no grants were given to grid-connected project developers.

Lesson 7: Prepare well for project closure
A project like RERED generates valuable information for similar projects, not only in Sri Lanka,
but also in other countries. However, the wealth of information is only of limited accessibility.
The paper files are currently stored in boxes. It is unlikely that any of the information in these
boxes can be accessed in one or two years. A project like RERED should digitalize its files for
easy reference. The way this was done for the China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program is a
best-practice example. Digitizing the files should be planned well before project closure and
financial resources must be reserved for this. It is further important to discuss project closure with
key stakeholders and beneficiaries to make sure they understand that the project will close and
that there will be no direct follow-up. This will help them to prepare for project closure.

Lesson 8: World Bank involvement added credibility



                                                 34
The World Bank not only brings financial resources, knowledge and staff expertise, but through
its’ participation in the Project, it also boosts the credibility of the project and builds confidence
among stakeholders and beneficiaries. This was of particular importance for the participating
commercial banks involved in RERED as it made them more willing to consider lending for
renewable energy initiatives.

The outputs and outcomes of each component are discussed below:

Component 1. Grid-Connected Renewable Energy Power Generation

This component is by far the largest in the Project amounting to about 80% of total expenditures.
Refinancing was made to 63 grid-connected renewable energy sub-projects by private sector
developers and investors. This included 68 mini hydro projects, 2 wind projects and 1 biomass
project. Details on these projects are provided in Table 3.

The main barrier was the reluctance of commercial banks to offer long-term lending to the sector.
This was primarily true for technologies other than hydro (such as biomass and wind) as the
hydro has been tested under ESD. Lending to wind sub-projects commenced once tariffs were
revised and RERED provided additional TA to support the PCIs and developers. RERED
extended a line of credit through IDA to a group of commercial banks, development banks and
leasing companies (collectively known as PCIs) to re-finance a portion (up to 80%) of the loans
that they would extend for renewable energy sub-projects. The terms of the refinancing loan were
an interest rate of AWDR with repayment over 10 years starting from 5.5 years after the first
withdrawal. The terms of the loan to developers was negotiated between the developer and the
PCI with a maximum duration of 10 years, including a two-year grace period.

The total volume of investments for all sub-projects was about US$ 205 million (LKR 21.55
billion). The PCIs had extended loans totaling US$ 122 million (LKR 12.84 billion), which on
average represents 59.5% of total sub-project cost. The amount of re-financing provided by
RERED for these investments was US$ 88.38 million (LKR 9.35 billion).

The expected outputs for this component have been surpassed, as measured by the key
performance indicators. The overarching outcomes were also achieved as PCIs have all indicated
a continued interest and actual lending to the sector, specifically for grid-connected renewable
energy projects beyond the close of RERED. Similarly, developers were confident of securing
finances for their projects as enough capacity has been built that developers are now able to
attract financing by listing projects on the Colombo Stock Exchange. To date, five companies
have become publically traded in Sri Lanka. The first company to do so was Vallibel Power
Erathna PLC, which was listed on May 17, 2006. The company has 3 mini hydro projects with a
total capacity of 21.9 MW, all of which have been refinanced by RERED.

This component also made the largest contribution to positive environmental impact through the
avoidance of about 2.15 million tons of CO2.

This component was the second largest to be supported by the Project with 17.2% of actual
expenditures. It facilitated the sale of 110,575 SHS to rural households by private vendors as well
as support to investment subsidies (or co-financing grant) from RERED13 and refinancing of
loans provided by PCIs for SHS.

The total refinancing provided by RERED for this component was US$ 21.78 million. The
Project provided an investment subsidy of US$ 40 per SHS which was paid to the developer for
systems with module sizes ranging between 10-30 Wp. About 76,000 systems received a
Government subsidy with the majority receiving LKR 10,000 (approximately US$ 95 per system.
A total of 77,408 systems bought through loans were refinanced by RERED (including re-flows
of refinancing funds). The balance (33,167) were sold on cash basis, through vendor credits or
financed by institutions not participating in RERED (“Non-PCIs?). The average SHS loan from
PCIs to households was about US$ 400 with a 3-year repayment period at an interest rate above
15 percent per annum.

Requests for payment of the SHS investment subsidies submitted by the vendors were reviewed
by Project auditors checking for all appropriate documents, invoices, consumer acceptance
receipts (CAR) and packing lists. The project auditors then prepared an assessment report for the
AU, upon which the AU would disburse against eligible payments. Field verification was carried
out on a sample basis. The total investment subsidies paid to 14 SHS vendors was US$ 11.9
million (US$ 4.5 million from GEF, US$ 0.2 million from IDA and US$7.2 million from GoSL).
With an average capacity of 25 Wp per the system, the total capacity of RERED-financed SHS is
2.8 MWp.


13
     Depending on the locality, many systems received supplemental subsidies directly from the local government.


                                                                38
The revised target for number of households to be served by off-grid means was achieved;
however, of the 110,575 SHS sold, an estimated 20,000 were repossessed by the PCIs due to
defaults by households on their loans. The implicit expected outcomes were: (i) SHS
demonstrated as a viable option for areas not being served by the grid; (ii) micro credits for SHS
are routine business for PCIs; and (iii) ensuring a sustainable SHS industry. These outcomes have
been partially achieved. The Government, CEB and SEA consider SHS a viable option for areas
that are unlikely to receive grid in the near future. However, PCIs have ceased lending for SHS
and only two SHS vendors are still active in Sri Lanka. On the other hand, those vendors still see
SHS as a profitable market in Sri Lanka. One vendor offers households the option to pay for the
system in installments, which in itself is a form of micro credit to households.

Component 3. Independent Grid Systems

With 1.0% of actual total expenditure, this was also considered a small component in volume,
though its impacts outweighed the volume of financing. Under this component, RERED
supported the installation of 173 community-based micro hydro systems and 2 community-based
biomass electricity systems. The average capacity of the village systems was 10 kW. While, the
project refinanced 53 systems, the balance 120 (69%) were re-financed by ‘non-PCIs.’ The
Project provided development and co-financing grants for basically all systems and supervision
grants for 73 PCIs and non-PCIs.

The independent mini-grid systems component provided access to electricity for 6,181
households. A survey conducted among VECS in 2011 showed that 66% of the villages have
now access to the grid. This does, however, not mean that all households in a given village are
connected to the grid. Villages, in general, continue operating the mini grids independent from
the CEB connection. Villages not only benefitted from the electricity provided, they also
benefitted from the establishment of VECS.

Another important development related to village schemes that have been connected to the grid is
the availability of an option to sell electricity to the utility at the mini-hydro tariff (similar to an
SPPA but for much smaller systems.) This means that a village which is purchasing electricity
from the national grid can also sell back to that grid the energy which has been produced by its
village hydro scheme. The first pilot scheme to adopt this was the Athuraliya village hydro at in
Ratnapura with a capacity of 21 kW. The grid connection and upgrade costs were borne by
donors (including a consultancy cost borne by the RERED Project) and village residents were
issued shares to the value of their investment in the assets of a new power company, allowing
them to benefit from dividend income once payments are received from CEB from the power
bought by the utility.

Component 4. Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management

This component was intended to be complementary to the renewable energy investments but was
too small to make any significant impact. In the original design, 0.9% of the total financing was
allocated to this component. In reality, only 0.1% of total actual expenditure was incurred. Under
component 4, six energy efficiency projects were refinanced for a total of US$ 154,000 which
leveraged a total investment of US$ 330,000. The number of sub-projects was small because



                                                  39
there was very limited demand for the support provided under this component. The availability
of similar support with better financial terms from the Environmental Friendly Solutions Fund
(E-Friends) supported by JICA made it difficult for the component to take off.

Component 5. Cross-sectoral Energy Applications

This component was designed to be a small but significant activity using 2.1% of the total
financing envelope. Final accounting shows that less than 0.05% of funds were used to finance
activities under this component. Two consultancy services were contracted and carried out to
assess electricity needs of public institutions in the North and East of Sri Lanka. In addition, two
other pilot projects to electrify a government school and a hospital in the Eastern and Northern
provinces did not proceed due to the escalation of the military conflict at the time.

Component 6. Technical Assistance

The TA component funded a number of important activities such as environmental audits,
physical verification of assets, and overall support to the RERED AU. Several studies were also
carried out under this component, including:

       Technical assessment of Sri Lanka’s renewable energy resource based energy generation
        for the connection and management of embedded generation;
       Wind integration study to assess the absorption capacity of the grid to an increase in wind
        power;
       Support for due diligence of two proposed wind farms to be refinanced by RERED;
       Evaluation of capital market constraints to finance renewable power projects;
       Feasibility and mechanism for connecting off-grid hydro schemes to the grid;
       Solar industry growth analysis.

TA activities were of tremendous value to many Project stakeholders and contributed to a greater
understanding of sector and project-related issues for developers/investors, commercial
banks/MFIs, industry associations, the CEB, other government agencies and stakeholders. These
knowledge products focused on the important elements of successful sector development (e.g.
techno-economic appraisal of projects, environmental and social considerations, and financial
aspects of the energy sector.) The provision of TA activities including both studies as well as
human resource capacity building through hands-on training and workshops that has lead to the
creation of a more robust and mature sector.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This annex summarizes ex-post economic and financial analysis of three of the dominant areas
financed under this project and compares them to expectations at Project Appraisal. These are: (i)
grid connected renewable energy projects using a 2.5 MW mini-hydro project as a representative
project, (ii) solar home systems using a 40 Wp SHS as a representative project, and (iii)
community-based village hydro projects using an 7.5 kW project serving 30 households as a
representative project. The analysis is conducted for a typical project in 2010. The analysis is
undertaken for a representative investment in each investment category. The LKR to US$
exchange rate at Appraisal was 92 LKR per US$ and in 2010 it was 112 LKR per US$.

Mini-Hydro Sub-projects

Mini hydro, biomass power and wind power projects feed power to the national grid at a
substation with adequate capacity that is nearest to the power plant. All mini-hydro projects are
on streams/rivers in the hill country except for two projects in Polonnaruwa District where one
mini-hydro project is at the dam toe on Maduru Oya Reservoir and another at a canal drop. The
wind projects are in Puttalum district in the North Central Province (See Figure 2). The one (1)
MW biomass power plant is no longer operating.

An economic and financial analysis was
conducted for one representative mini hydro
project as mini hydro projects were the
dominant class of grid tied projects financed
by RERED. The economic analysis shows
that the project economics is robust and the
economic returns are better than estimated
during Appraisal.

The EIRR for the representative project is
45.8 percent compared to 24 percent at
appraisal. The higher EIRR is principally due
to higher economic SRMC of generation of
thermal plants offset by operating the mini
hydro plants. The FIRR for the project is 17.3
percent compared to 21 percent at Appraisal.
The lower FIRR is due to higher investment
cost and lower plant capacity factor.

The 2010 analysis values economic benefits
from avoiding CO2 emissions. The increase in Figure 2 Grid-tied Sub-Project Locations
EIRR due to emissions avoided is 1.8 percent.
Economic avoided cost is based on the SRMC of generation of the most expensive generators.
The sources of data and assumptions used to estimate the avoided cost is given in Box 1.

Key data and results and comparison with estimates at Project Appraisal are given in Table 4.

Off Grid Systems

Off grid systems supported by RERED were
principally SHS and village hydro schemes and two
biomass powered mini-grids. The distribution of
installations is shown in Figure 3. As expected the
off-grid systems are predominantly in districts that
have lower electrification coverage. Presently,
GoSL considers consumers where a grid connection
cost is more than LKR 200,000 (approximately
US$1,785 in 2010 US$) to be candidates for off-
grid solutions and they estimate there are about
40,000 such consumers. In contrast, in 2002 when
grid coverage was much less, the marginal cost of
grid connection was US$300 (about US$450 per
connection in 2010 US$).

Solar Home Systems
SHS are purchased by households and enterprises
that either do not want to wait a long time to receive      Figure 3 Distribution of Off-grid Systems

grid connection or by those in located in areas where grid connection is not cost effective or is
impossible.

The SHS offers basic electricity services to those switching from kerosene for lighting and using
rechargeable batteries to operate small appliances such as television or radio. A 40 Wp SHS14
will provide about 5.5 kWh a month and for the purpose of analysis, 2.3 kWh/month is assumed
to be used for lighting and the balance for other purposes such as operating a TV and other
appliances. At this scale of electricity use it is not a substitute for grid electricity that has the
potential to offer “unlimited? electricity at low cost (households consuming small amounts of
electricity, for example 30 kWh/month or less, the tariff is highly subsidized).

The economic and financial analysis considers the benefits to derive from (a) kerosene fuel and
kerosene lanterns displaced, and (b) rechargeable batteries and battery charging costs avoided.
The economic analysis additionally considers the economic value of carbon emissions avoided
and the consumer surplus due to superior lighting provided by electric lamps compared to
kerosene lamps15. Consumer surplus assumptions and results are shown later in Table 16.

The EIRR for the 40 Wp SHS providing electric lighting and electricity for television, radio or
other small appliance was 95 percent when Consumer Surplus was taken into account. If
Consumer Surplus was not considered, then EIRR was 16 percent. EIRR was not reported at
appraisal. The FIRR was 12 percent. At appraisal FIRR was estimated at 7 percent. Comparative
data for 40 Wp SHS at Appraisal, ICR and summary of results is given in Table 7.

   The average size of a SHS supported by RERED was 43 Wp and 97 percent of SHS were in 20-60 Wp range. See
http://www.energyservices.lk. It should be noted that the GEF grant was being phased out and from Jan 1, 2007, a 40Wp system
was no longer entitled to a GEF grant. A US$40 grant was available only for SHS below 20Wp while the GoSL subsidy
continued. From January 2010, the US$40 GEF grant was made available for systems up to 30Wp.

   Consumer Surplus is calculated using the approach detailed in Meier, Peter, “An Economic Analysis of Solar Home Systems: A
Case Study for the Philippines?, February 3, 2003, The World Bank and available at http://www.worldbank.org/retoolkit.

Village Hydro

Under RERED, 174 Village Hydro Projects (VHP) were refinanced and have all been
commissioned; 14 VHPs remain to be completed as of December 31, 2011. The median VHP
project had 7.5 kW serving 27 customers. The largest project had a capacity of 48 kW serving
102 customers and the smallest, 3 kW serving 2 customers. The economic and financial analysis
was done for a representative project, Andawala in Udagama with 7.5 kW serving 30 customers.
The project potentially could supply 22 MWh/year at a load factor of 33 percent (~8 hours/day at
peak capacity). However, only a small portion may be needed for household lighting and
appliances (5 MWh/year), thus leaving 17 MWh/year for other purposes, including productive
uses.

The economic and financial analysis results and the characteristics of the project and comparison
to the VHP scheme analyzed at Appraisal are given in Table 11. The EIRR with Consumer
Surplus was 54 percent and without it was 10 percent. The EIRR at appraisal was 12 percent.
The FIRR was 50 percent compared to the estimate of 10 percent at appraisal. The higher FIRR
is due to lower cost of the project to the community (after RERED and government grants) of
US$700/kW compared to US$940/kW at appraisal. The VHP project analysis at appraisal
assumed revenues from electricity sales to community of US$2600, compared to US$3,000 for
the representative project analyzed.

Annex 5. Results of Beneficiary Surveys

To obtain feedback from beneficiaries, a survey of PCIs lending to grid-connected sub-projects
and SHS was undertaken. The AU undertook a number of surveys. Different questionnaires were
prepared for each of the two sectors.

PCIs lending to grid-connected sub-projects
The questionnaire was sent to four PCIs actively involved in lending to grid-connected sub-
projects and responses were received from three (3) of them. The questionnaire was not sent to
DFCC Bank. The most salient points were:

 1. All respondents stated that they have started financing grid-connected renewable energy
    investments because of ESD/RERED, as it offered long-term financing, the PCIs could
    extend the tenures of their loans to developers. Overall, RERED was critical for the
    development of the portfolio of sub-projects financed by the PCIs.

 2. The refinancing credit line improved the liquidity position of the PCIs and accelerated
    credit growth. Further, the conditions of refinancing were attractive with a long repayment
    period, concessionary interest rates and low volatility because the interest rate was linked to
    the AWDR which was an acceptable benchmark to the banks, which in turn allowed the
    banks to offer lower interest rates to the developers. The rates typically charged by
    commercial banks in the absence of RERED refinancing would have been too costly and
    some of sub-project may have become unfeasible.

 3. In addition to the refinancing, the PCIs valued the technical assistance provided. In
    particular, the training extended to their staff in order to build in-house capacity, and on
    financing of low head hydro and wind projects. Also the hydro and wind related overseas
    study tours, workshops and seminars were appreciated.

 4. When asked what the PCIs did not like about the support given by RERED, one PCI
    mentioned the lengthy procurement procedures and another would have preferred if 100%
    refinancing was extended for the sub-loan instead of the ceiling of 80%.

 5. The PCIs were also asked to rate the support provided by RERED on a 10-point scale with
    10 being perfect. The average rating was 8.3. One PCI remarked that: “in an interest rate
    falling scenario in the country the refinancing scheme proved to be more expensive than the
    commercial lending possible by the banks. During this time, some projects were financed
    by commercial loans. However, subsequently this rate was amended.?

 6. The performance of the AU was rated very highly. On all aspects (guidance and help
    provided, responsiveness and timeliness of actions and quality of work) the average score
    was 9.3. The PCIs expressed their great appreciation for the AU who had worked diligently
    to provide direct and valuable assistance to them. This was done independent from GoSL
    and the World Bank and the PCIs did not need to resort to them to resolve most of their
    issues.




                                               54
 7. All PCIs indicated that they will continue lending for grid-connected renewable energy
    projects after RERED closure; however, the interest rate will be based on commercial rates
    and thus projects which are marginally viable, will likely not be able to obtain financing.

 8. One of the PCIs, Hatton National Bank, received a runner-up award in the Development
    Project Financing category at the Asian Banking Award 2004 for their involvement in
    financing off-grid village hydro schemes.

PCIs financing SHS
The questionnaire was sent to three (3) PCIs involved in SHS financing. The following is a
summary of the main issues emerging from their responses:

 1. The reasons for households not repaying their SHS loans were: (i) poor after sales service
    by suppliers; (ii) grid connection; (iii) financial problems; (iv) willful defaulters; and (v)
    problems with quality of the product.

 2. About 40% of the SHS loans were non-performing (small loans in particular) and of the
    total loan value, 19% was non-performing. PCIs repossessed 23% of the modules for
    systems they financed and only 41% of the repossessed modules could be sold.

 3. The PCIs were asked to rate different aspects of the vendors on a 10-point scale. The results
    were: system quality: 5, user manual/operation training: 1, honoring warrantee: 1 and
    provision of after sales services: 0. The low scores reflected the dissatisfaction of the PCIs
    with the industry.

 4. In terms of their support to the Project, the AU received an average score of 6.7.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The off-grid electrification target of RERED was 101,000 households, rural small and medium
enterprises and public institutions. The Additional Finance increased this target to 161,000. Sales
of SHS, was the main vehicle to reach this target. In 2009 the RERED Solar PV Investment
component was facing serious challenges. While the component reached 66 percent of its target,
it was witnessing a steady year-to-year decline in annual installations. If the decline could not be
stopped, it would be difficult to reach the target.

To analyze the problems and to identify solutions, the AU organized a participatory PV
Component Trouble Shooting Workshop. The two-day workshop was held in Colombo on
November 17-18, 2009. Seventeen participants attended the workshop, representing PV
companies, MFIs, leasing companies, the AU and the World Bank. The participants conducted a
problem analysis and proposed possible solutions.

From the problem analysis it was clear that the RERED solar PV investments component was in
a downward cyclical trend and represented in Figure 4 below:

                                       PV companies go out of
                                             business


                                                                        Faltering after sales

                                                                      repairs, sales of system
                                                                           components)

                                                                      Customers (households)

                                                                          and performance

         less credit worthy                                  promised grid-connection

      Figure 4 SHS Problem Analysis

The following actions were proposed by the workshop:

 1.    PV companies should diversify their business and not only rely on SHS sales;



                                                56
 2.    RERED will commission a study to come-up with a solution for warrantee problems;

 3.    PV companies will prepare a plan for Coordinated System Service by PV Companies to
       reduce both risks and costs;

 4.    The AU will prepare a PV Component Wind-Down Plan in case the PV component stops;

 5.    PV companies will specify products they will offer for cash sales which meet RERED
       specs;

 6.    RERED will extend the same GEF subsidy from 20 Wp systems to < 40 Wp systems;

 7.    AU and PV companies agreed on an awareness creation plan;

 8.    PV companies, in consultation with MFI’s will prepare information for end-users (i.e.
       households) on their rights and obligations for their PV system should they be connected
       to the grid. This will also include information on what is included in the lease including
       what is covered in the lease agreement (i.e. commissioning and repairs during the
       warrantee period) and what needs to be paid by households beyond the warrantee period;

 9.    RERED will commission a study to improve the PV loan payment collection.

Although all stakeholders supported the recommendations, it was concluded that it was too late to
implement these and revive the solar PV investments component. In 2010, the Project was
restructured to reduce the target from 161,000 households, small and medium enterprises and
public institutions to 113,500.
