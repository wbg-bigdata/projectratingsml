REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ONi A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A COCOA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent
to US$8.5 million to the Republic of Ghana to assist in financing a
project for the improvement of cocoa production.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's first purely
agricultural lending operation in Ghana. The project was prepared by
the Government with the assistance of the Bank's Permanent Mission to
WTestern Africa (PNWmrA). After submission for Bank Group assistance,
the project was preappraised in February 1969 and final appraisal took
place in OctoberAJovember 1969.
3.        Negotiations were held in lWTashington in April 1970.  Repre-
sentation of the Republic of Ghana included the Honorable K. Safo-Adu,
Minister of Agriculture; Mr. J.W. Sraha, Principal Secretary, Ministry
of Agriculture; Mr. M.S.O. Nicholas, Chief, Cocoa Division, Ministry
of Agriculture; Mr. E.N. Afful, Managing Director, Agricultural Devel-
opment Bank; and His Excellency, E.M. Debrah, Ambassador of Ghana to
the United States.
4.        The proposed credit would constitute the Bank Group's seventh
lending operation in Ghana. The following is a summary statement of
Bank loans and IDA credits to Ghana as of May YI, 1970.

5.        The Volta Project, financed by Loan 310 GH, was completed in
early 1966. Execution of the other projects is progressing satisfactori2y,
6.        Appraisal of a power distribution expansion project of the
Electricity Corporation of Ghana is currently taking place and a proposal
for a credit of about US$8 million is likely to be presented to the
Executive Directors early in 1971. A highway rehabilitation and mainten-
ance project is scheduled for appraisal early in 1971. In agriculture,
certain projects designed to assist diversification of agriculture, such
as sugar, cotton and rice, are in various stages of preparation.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.        BORROV;TER:                  Republic of Ghana.
BENEFICIARIES:                rocoa farmers through the Agri-
cultural Development Bank and
Ministry of Agriculture.



-3-
MOTJNT:                      Uc$8.5 million.
PURP      PURPOSE:                      To assist in financing the
replanting and rehabilitation
of approximately 87,000 acres
of cocoa in the Eastern Region
through credits to farmers,
related training and other
technical assistance, and
improvement of feeder roads.
AMORTIZATION:                 In 50 years, including a
10-year period of grace, through
semi-annual installments of 1/2
of 1 percent from December 15,
1980 through June 15, 1990 and
of 1_1/2 percent from December
15, 1990 through June 15, 2020.
SERVICE CHARGE:               3/4 of 1 percent per annum.
RELENDING:                    The Borrower would provide about
$7 million of the credit through
the Agricultural Development Bank
to enable farmers to acquire
equipment, insecticides and
fertilizer and to carry out
farm improvements. The balance
of $1.5 million would be used by
the Borrower for buildings,
vehicles, the improvement of
feeder roads and staff costs.
ESTTIA9TED ECONOMIC RA,TE
OF RETTUPZ OF PROJECT:        26 percent per annum.
PART 111 - TNE PROJECT
8.        The appraisal report entitled "Eastern Region Cocoa Project
Ghana" (PA-h3a), dated June 3, 1970, is attached.
9.        Ghana is the world's largest cocoa producer; cocoa accounts
for about two-thircds of the export receipts. As cocoa is the principal
foreign exchange earner, Ghana has been, and will be, at least in the
medium-term, critically dependent on cocoa for financing its development
program. However, Ghana's cocoa industry has been beset by severe
problems since 1965. Its share of total world production has dropped from



- 4 -
an average of 36 percent for the period 1960/65 to 29 percent
subsequently, as a result of the decline in annual average production
from 450,000 tons in the first half of the 1960's to 400,000 tons during
1966/70. The decline has largely been the result of unfavorable
Government policies initiated in the early 1960's which led to sharp
reductions in producer prices, in line with falling world prices.
In the absence of a price stabilization scheme, sound marketing policies
and adequate measures for pest and disease control, farm maintenance
deteriorated, plantations were abandoned, pest and disease infestation
increased. The result was a decline in production.
10.       More recently Government policy has been directed at
achieving production increases. To this end, the producer price has
been raised and as additional incentives, the Government doubled
the amount of capsid spray available, subsidized the cost of spraying
material and machinery and facilitated transport of fertilizer to the
cocoa areas. During negotiations assurances have been obtained that
such policies will be continued. The Government also renewed the
policy of aiding farmers in replanting trees which have been cut down
because of swollen shoot disease. kiuch more, however, needs to be
done to compensate for the neglect of the past.
11.       The proposed project would be the first stage of a national
program to rehabilitate Ghana's cocoa industry and is designed to serve
as a pattern for similar activities in other areas of the country.
The project would consist of the replanting of 36,000 acres with
improved high-yielding cocoa varities and the rehabilitation of about
51,000 acres of standing but low-yielding cocoa by controlling capsids,..
replanting vacant lots and improving farm maintenance. The project,
at maturity in 1982, would increase annual cocoa production by about
19,000 tons. It would be carried out through (a) provision of credit
to cocoa farmers for the purchase of spraying machines, pesticides,
fertilizers, improved planting materials and for covering the cost
of hired labor; (b) improved cocoa extension service and farmer
training in modern cocoa production techniques; (c) improvement of
marketing cooperatives and establishment of 15 new cooperatives and
1d) improvement of feeder roads.
i2.       The estimated cost of the project is US$15.6 million of which
-JS$4.7 million (or 30 percent) would be for foreign and US$10.9 million
for local expenditures. The Government would contribute the equivalent
of US$2.7 million and three local commercial banks (Barclays Bank,
Standard Bank of West Africa and Ghana Commercial Bank) would finance
the equivalent of US$4.4 million.   The proposed IDA credit of US$8.5
million, representing 55 percent of total project cost, would meet all
of the project's foreign exchange requirements plus US$3.8 million
of local costs.



-5-
As noted in paragraph 25 below, (thanats meed for external
capital is expected to remain high in the next 3-5 years as export
earnings are not expected to grow rapidly and as the servicing of
external debt will absorb a large proportion of available resources.
Thus, Ghana's ability to increase significantly its share in the
financing of its development is limited. The proposed project is
Tis  t,t to Ghana's economic growth and foreign exchange earnings.
In these circumstances, IDA participation on the scale proposed seems
fully justified.
14.       The project would be carried out by a project development unit
established for the purpose within the lIinistry of Agriculture. The
project development unit would maintain its own accounts and have a
large degree of autonomy in exercising management and financial control
over project implementation. A project manager with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Associaiton, has already been designated.
In addition, the project authority will be staffed with a deputy project
manager and other key personnel acceptable to the Association. A
Project Steering Committeee, with the Principal Secretary of the
Ministry of Agriculture as Chairman, would be established in which
other institutions or agencies involved in the project's execution
would be represented, among them the Agricultural Development Bank
and the Ghana Cooperative i'Iarketing Association.
15.       Of total project cost for the 5-year disbursement period
of the proposed credit, about US$7.5 million would be provided to
farmers as loans through the Agricultural Development Bank for
replanting (us$5.4 million) and rehabilitation (US$2.1 million);
US$7.7 million would be for project administration and operation,
farmer training and the establishment of new cocoa marketing
cooperatives; and US$0.4 million for road equipment and rehabilitation
of feeder roads in the project area. Loans for rehabilitation of
cocoa would be repayable over four years with interest at 8 percent,
following a grace period of one year during which interest would be
waived. For replanting, payment of principal would be over tea years
after a grace period of three years. Interest again of 8 percent would
be waived for four years, capitalized during the fifth and sixth
year and paid currently thereafter. The Agricultural Development Bank
would repay the Government the principal of sub-borrowers' repayments
as they are received, together with interest at 5-1/2 percent; 1-1/2
percent of interest payments would be retained by the Agricultural
Development Bank to cover its expenses, and 1 percent would be paid to
the Ghana Cooperative Marketing Association as a fee for marketing the
cocoa of project participants and guaranteeing loan repayments to ADB.
16.      WTith about 770 field staff, project staff costs would account
for approximately 30 percent of total project cost. The proposed
ratio of one field assistant to between 15-30 farmers and 65 to 85
acres and the number of field supervision personnel is justified in the
light of the experience of previous pest control projects in Ghana and
similar agricultural projects in other countries. Such experience
indicates that intensive supervision and technical assistance ae
essential if the full benefits of the proposed project are to m)Lcri& LeO
Reduction in field staff would be considered if £o'nc. juzt`iiei.later ,r..

17.       Procurement of vehicles, tractors, building equipment,
spraying machines, tools and fertilizers valued at about US$1.6 million,
would be through international competitive bidding. Gammalin
insecticide is produced locally for Ghana's entire cocoa industry
as well as for other areas in VTest Africa. It conforms to accepted
international standards, particularly those required by major chocolate
anu-lacturers.  Project requlirements valued at about US$810,000 would
therefore be procured by negotiated contract with the local manufacturers.
Because the small size of individual contracts would not attract
international competition, the project building program of housing
and stores, costing about US$660,000, would be subject to local
competitive bidding.
18.       The project is justified by the additional cocoa production,
as well as substantial indirect benefits. On the basis of long-range
cocoa prices of around US$0.27 per pound, the estimated rate of
return would be 26 percent. If prices fell to the lowest level of
the projected range (US$0.25 per pound) and yields declined by
one-fourth, the return would be 15 percent. Production at the estimated
yields and at US$0.27 per pound would contribute as much as US$11
million annually to Ghana's foreign exchange earnings.
PART 1V - LE5AL INSTRUIE,NTS AND AUTHORITY.
19.       The draft Developnent Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Ghana and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed development credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separatezly.
20.       The draft Development Credit Agreement follows the pattern
of agreeeents for other similar agricultural projects. Section 4.10(b)
contains the Borrocer's undertaking that its subsidies on cocoa
production inputs iill take into account the need to provide Project
participants with a sufficient incentive and the opportunity to earn
an adequate return on their farm investments.
PART V - Tw ECONO!i-Y.
21.       A report entitled "The Current Tconomic Position and Prospects
of Ghana" (!5t-6a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on IHlay 7,
1969, and a subsequent updating memorandum was distributed on June 19,
1969. A bank economic mission has recently returned from Ghana and
is preparing its appraisal of Ghana's development problems and prospects.
Its report is scheduled for distribution to the Fxecutive Directors in
the early fall. The latest available data on the Ghanaian economr are
contained in the Annex. The preliminary conclusions of the mission
underscore the country's difficult economic situation. Its serious
un-employment problem shows no sign of abating.   Ghana's heavy
external debt burden poses a major iopadlinent to accele2at-irg develop-
ment and improving Ghanaian living standards.



12.       The civilian government which took over from the National
Liberation C)uncil in September 1969 has indicated that it is anxious
to increase the rate of economic growth, give more attention to agri-
cultural development, provide additional employment opportunities and
seek a more viable balance of payments position. The Government has
exercised caution in its credit and budget management, thus continuing
the policies of monetary stability of its predecessor. It is seeking
to restrain current expenditures but hopes to obtain resources for an
increase in development outlays, particularly in such priority sectors
as agriculture, feeder roads and health. Measures to increase taxes are
being studied by a National Tax Review Commission and a new development
plan is being prepared.
23.       The immediate outlook for the balance of payments is on the
one hand governed by the relatively favorable prospects for cocoa and
on the other, the need to increase imports somewhat in line with the
requirements of the development program. At the same time, the Govern-
ment wants to strengthen Ghana's short-term financial position by re-
paying short-term debt and improving reserves. The Government has also
asked creditors to consider reducing the payments due on medium-term
debts which were rescheduled pursuant to the 1966 and 1968 agreements,
a request which is currently under consideration.
24.       Earnings for cocoa will reach a high of about $300 million
in 1970 (compared with an average of $225 million in 1968 and 1969)
on a volume of 390,000 tons and an average price of 34.5 cents per
pound (f.o.b Ghana). In the next two years the price received by
Ghana is expected to decline somewhat from this level but remain firm
as stocks in consuming centers are being replenished. As to market
conditions, demand for cocoa has grown during the past decade and
there has been some shortage since 1966. Over the longer term world
demand and production are expected to grow by some 4 percent per year.
Ghana's production is expected to increase at about the same rate, assum-
ing continuation of present policies favoring cocoa production.
25.       Even with a relatively favorable outlook for cocoa, total ex-
port earnings are not expected to show dynamic growth. For the 1970-80
decade, export growth is not likely to exceed 4 percent per annum. At
the same time, the heavy burden of external debt service makes it un-
likely that there will be a significant improvement in Ghana's ability
to increase its share of development expenditure for some years to
come. Thus, in view of the need to step-up investment in priority
areas and the modest rate at which public savings can be increased,
Ghana's available resources will need to be augmented by a substantial
inflow of external capital in the years ahead. Given the slow growth
of exports and the level of service payments on the present external
debt, Ghana will have to exercise great caution in incurring new debt
and wfill need to obtain most of its capital inflow on concessionary
terms. Moreover, since external financing related solely to the foreign
exchange cost of development projects would not be sufficient to meet



- 8 -
Ghana's total capital requirements, financing of some local cost is
jus-tified in special circumstances, particularly in the case of high
priority projects which have a relatively low foreign exchange com-
ponent.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AG?EE=MT
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMI'ThDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed credit.
