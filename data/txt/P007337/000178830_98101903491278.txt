APPRAISAL OF THE WESTERN HIGHWAY PAVING PROJECT
SUMbARY
i.        The Government of Honduras has asked the Bank to help finance a
highway project in the Western Region. This would be the fifth highway
project by the Bank/IDA in Honduras.
ii.       The project consists of:
(1) the reconstruction of sections totalling 37 kms
of the Western Highway between Chamelecon and La Entrada,
and the paving and bituminous surfacing of the Highway
between Chamelecon and the El Salvador border (247 kms);
(2) the supervision of construction of the above work;
(3) feasibility studies for feeder roads in the service
area of the Western Highway,
(4) a feasibility study for reconstruction of the North-
Eastern Highway between Tegucigalpa and Juticalpa (130 kms)
iii.      Total project costs are estimated at US$ 12.6 million equivalent.
The proposed loan of US$ 8.6 million represents the presently estimated
foreign exchange cost component of the project. The balance will be provided
by the Government. The project is expected to be completed by mid-1971.
iv.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the Highway
Department within the Ministry of Communications and Public Works. Engineer-
ing consultants, Brown & Root, S.A., have prepared designs for the construction
works, and are expected to be retained to provide the remaining services for
the construction project. Consultants satisfactory to the Bank will also be
employed for the feasibility studies.
v.        The project has high priority in the country's road development
program. Paving of the Western Highway will reduce transport costs and
prevent a rapid rise in transport and road maintenance costs that would
otherwise occur in the near future.  The rate of economic return on the
investment from savings in transport costs alone ranges from 11 per cent to
25 per cent for various sections according to traffic volumes and terrain,
with an overall rate of return on the project of 14 per cent, which is
satisfactory.
vi.       The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan in the
amount of US$ 8.6 million equivalent. A suitable loan term would be 20 years
including a five-year period of grace.

APPRAISAL OF THE WESTERN HIGHWAY PAVING PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of Honduras has submitted an application to the
Bank to help finance (i) the completion of the Western Highway from
Chamelecon to the El Salvador border to a paved standard throughout its
length (247 kms), and (ii) feasibility studies for additional feeder roads
to serve the Western Highway, and for a section of the North-Eastern
Highway.
1.2       This will be the fifth highway project for Honduras for which
the Bank/IDA finance has been made available. In 1955 a loan of US$ 4.2
million (No. 135-HO) was made to finance the establishment of a road
maintenance organization. Three years later a loan of US$ 5.5 million
(No. 195-HO) was made primarily to reconstruct the main roads between San
Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortes, and between Tegucigalpa and the Inter-
American Highway. This project also included the construction of bridges
on the Western Highway between Chamelecon and Santa Rosa to make it
passable during the rainy season. All work under these projects has been
successfully completed.
1.3       The first IDA Credit of US$ 9 million (No. 1-HO) was made in 1961
to finance (a) the improvements of sections of the Western Highway between
Chamelecon and Santa Rosa to gravel standard and the construction of an
extension to the highway from Santa Rosa to the El Salvador border; (b) the
construction of feeder roads to the Western Highway; (c) the strengthening
of the highway maintenance organization initiated under the first loan;
and (d) a highway transportation survey to prepare a long-term road invest-
ment program. The survey was carried out by Stanford Research Institute
and was finished in 1962. The extension of the Western Highway was completed
in 1964; other construction works on the Western Highway and the feeder
roads are nearing completion.
1.4       In 1965 a credit of US$ 3.5 million (No. 71-HO) and a loan of
US$ 6 million (No. 400-HO) were made to finance reconstruction of the North
Road from Tegucigalpa to Potrerillos. The first contracts for construction
of the northern section of this road have recently been awarded; however,
the call for tenders for the remaining road sections was delayed as the
Government had requested the Bank/IDA to consider an alternative alignment.
This issue has now been resolved.
1.5       This appraisal report is based on a feasibility study of the
Western Highway paving project prepared by the Government's consultants,
Brown & Root (U.S.), the findings of a Bank appraisal mission in June 1966
consisting of Messrs. Soges (Engineer), Park and Huber (Economists),
and subsequent studies by the consultants in September/December 1966.

2. BACKGROUNDT
A. General
2.1       With a land area of 44,480 square miles, Honduras is nearly three
times the size of Switzerland and is the second largest of the five Central
American countries. It has a population of 2.3 million which has been
growing at an average of 3.4% per annum over the last five years.
2.2       The growth rate of Honduras' gross national product, which in
the recent past was 4.5% annually, increased sharply to 6.4% in 1964 and
to an estimated rate of 10% in 1965 as a result of an export boom. The
country's per capita GNP (about US$ 200 equivalent) is the lowest of the
Central American countries. The transport and communications sector
contributed only 6% of the gross domestic product in recent years, which
reflects the low degree of development of this sector.
2.3       The terrain is rugged and traversed by many rivers and streams.
Together with the tropical climate this makes the construction and main-
tenance of the road system difficult and expensive.
B. Transport System
2.4       The inadequate transportation infrastructure is one of the major
obstacles to economic development in Honduras. The country only recently
started to construct a modern highway network to connect the major producing
and consuming centers, as well as to open new areas for cultivation. In
view of the under-developed state of the transport system, Honduras will
have to devote an important part of its resources to this sector for many
years to come.
2.5       Honduras has three railway lines extending nearly 1,200 kms, all
located on the north coast adjacent to the major ports and consequently
serving only a very small area. Two lines are owned by fruit companies
and are used primarily for shipping bananas to the Caribbean ports and to
transport imported supplies to the plantations. The National Railways,
owned and operated by the Government, has only about 130 kms of line but
accounts for about 50% of the passenger and 32% of the cargo traffic of
the railways.
2.6       Due to the lack of adequate land transportation facilities, air
service plays a vital role, and for many remote areas provides the only
modern means of transport. Honduras has an extensive air transport network
serving 32 communities on a schedule basis, supplemented by taxi services
to practically all parts of the country. The bulk of the traffic moves
within the triangular area between Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba.
As a result of the recent improvement of the highway system, the air services
to some areas have been discontinued. Nevertheless, the total traffic
volume - especially for passengers - has been steadily increasing.



- 3 -
2.7       Sea transport on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts complements the
road and rail transport.  Completion of the Northern Highway as well as of
the Western Highway to El Salvador is expected to increase the traffic
volume of the port of Puerto Cortes. The Bank recently made a loan to
finance the expansion of this port (No. 463-HO).
2.8       Road transport activities have expanded rapidly in the last 15
years. The total vehicle fleet increased between 1950 and 1965 from about
3,000 to 18,700 vehicles (see Table 1), which represents an annual growth
rate of over 12%. The large percentage (54%) of trucks and buses in the
total vehicle fleet is, in part, a reflection of the Government's policy
to encourage commercial road traffic through favorable tax devices (no
import duties on commercial vehicles, lower import duty on diesel fuel
than on gasoline, lower user tax on commercial vehicles).
2.9       In view of the improvement and expansion of Honduras' highway
network and the extensive construction program to be executed in the near
future, a continuation of the past trend of rapid growth of the highway
industry is likely. With seven vehicles per 1,000 population at present,
Honduras has by far the lowest level of vehicles per capita of the Central
American countries (Guatemala 11, El Salvador 12, Nicaragua 11, Costa
Rica 20). The Central American Transportation Study, carried out in 1965
by a consortium of consultants under the auspices of the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), projected an increase of the
Honduran vehicle fleet at an average rate of 7.5% per annum.
2.10      As in the case of many developing countries, road transport in
Honduras is dominated by individual owner-drivers and competition among
them is keen. There is no public regulation of the industry; licenses are
freely available at a small fee and rates are not prescribed. At present
there seems to be no need for introducing regulations restricting compe-
tition in this sector.
2.11      Annual government investment expenditures in transport doubled
between 1955 and 1963 from L 12.4 million to L 24.4 million.   Highways
accounted for about 90% of the total, the remainder being about equally
divided between air transport and the publicly owned railway.
2.12      Transport coordination is not a major policy issue in Honduras.
Competition between the various modes, with the exception of some road-
air competition, has been quite limited as the railroads serve only a small
part of the country along the Atlantic coast, while neither coastal shipping
nor inland water transportation is of any significance. There is, however,
a need to increase road user charges to an adequate level in view of the
major step-up in road transport investment currently under consideration.
(see paragraphs 2.18 to 2.21)



-4-
C. The Highway System
2.13      No significant development of the Honduran highway network took
place until the middle 1950's. During the past ten years the Government
has made great efforts to improve and expand the highway system. The result
is an increase in the total length of the road network from 1,570 kms in
1953 to about 3,600 kms in 1965. As shown below, about 430 kms, or 12%
of the network, are paved. Even with the increased length of roads, the
density of the network is by far the lowest in Central America. 1/ While
there are now road connections between the major population centers, many
parts of the country, mainly in the north-east, have no roads.

D. Highway Administration and Maintenance
2.14      Overall responsibility for the nation's highway system rests with
the Ministry of Communications and Works. Within the Ministry, the Planning
Unit prepares long term investment programs and is also responsible for the
coordination of planning in all fields of transportation. The Unit works
in close cooperation with the National Economic Council, an inter-Minister-
ial planning body which reports directly to the President. The Highway
Department of the Ministry is responsible for the construction and main-
tenance of roads.
2.15      The organization of the Highway Department is shown in the
annexed chart. The Department has separate divisions for engineering,
administration, road maintenance equipment and road maintenance. All
major design and construction work is let to consultants and contractors.
During Loan/Credit negotiations for the North Road Project (Credit 71-HO,
Loan 400-Ho) the Government agreed to carry out a number of important
reforms in the highway administration, some of which were previously
recommended by consultants employed under Credit 1-HO. These reforms
include improvement of road maintenance practices and maintenance cost
accounting procedures, relaxation of cumbersome financial procedures
for the procurement of supplies and spare parts for maintenance equipment,
the establishment of a mobile highway patrol with police authority to

enforce traffic regulations, the strengthening of the Planning Unit within
the Ministry, and the institution of a civil service system of professional
staff to ensure a stable staff and continuity in the Highway Department's
operation. Progress on most of these matters is satisfactory. Road
maintenance practices are improving and adequate maintenance cost accounting
methods have been adopted, procedures for procurement of supplies and spare
parts have been improved, the Planning Unit has been strengthened, and
the civil service bill is presently being submitted to the national assembly
for enactment.
2.16      Early in 1964 the Government issued a decree limiting the
permissible weight of vehicles. Unfortunately, it did not indicate clearly
the axle load limits. Importation of vehicles with excessive axle ratings
is not restricted; moreover, vehicles with acceptable axle ratings are
often overloaded. Thus in practice a high percentage of the axle loads are
above the designed bearing capacity of the roads. If roads had to be
built to resist these excessive axle loads, construction costs would
increase, in particular the cost of pavement. Such cost increases could
not be justified on the basis of the relatively low volume of goods and
passenger traffic on the road system. LThe lack of adequate regulations
and enforcement will result in a rapid deterioration of the roads and will
increase maintenance and repair costs, if remedial action is not taken] ....I
The Higlmay Department is aware of this situation and has included in its
budget for 1967 the cost of personnel to operate five portable weigh scales,
gnd plans are being made to install permanent weighing stations by 1968.
During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that the decree of 1964 will be revised by December 31, 1968, in consultation
with the Bank, to prescribe axle load limits consistent with sound design
practices, and that restrictions satisfactory to the Bank will be established
for the future importation of vehicles with high axle ratings, and implemented
in accordance with a fixed schedule. Under the terms of the Loan/Credit
agreements for the North Road project the Government agreed to enforce
traffic regulations. This is not being done effectively, and during loan
negotiations agreement was obtainqd that the enforcement agency will be
strengthened by December 31, 19681-
2.17      Highway maintenance is the responsibility of the seven maintenance
districts which are grouped into two divisions, one for the North and one
for the South. Each district has its own technical and administrative
staff, equipment, workshops and service facilities. In recent years the
training and equipping of the highway maintenance organization has been
materially strengthened with financial assistance from the Bank and IDA.
Allocations for highway maintenance have increased slowly (see Table 2)
and the condition of the roads has improved. Expenditures presently range
from L 600 to 2,000 per km per annum (US$ 300 to 1,000 equivalent), which
is considered reasonable at this stage of the country's transport development.



- 6 -
However, most of the highway maintenance equipment was purchased before 1960,
out of the proceeds of Loan No. 135-HO; this equipment is now over-age and
requires major repair and renewal. During loan negotiations, assu-rances
were obtained from the Government that budgetary allocations for highway
maintenance will continue to be increased consistent with the extension of
the highway system and the increase of traffic. In addition, agreement
was reached with the Government that it will undertake a program to renew
the highway maintenance equipment through its own budget.
E. Government's Road Cost and Road User Contribution
2.18      The Government's annual expenditures on roads (excluding city
streets) between 1959 to 1965 ranged from L 11.0 million to L 16.4 million
(see Table 2). Maintenance accounted for about 25% of the total. Annual
construction expenditures ranged widely because of fluctuations in the
availability of foreign assistance funds.
2.19      To determine the adequacy of road user contributions, the cost
of the road system to the Government, including depreciation based on
appropriate periods of economic life, interest, maintenance and adminis-
trative costs was estimated on the basis of available data. The estimate
indicates that the Government's road cost for 1964 was about L 20 million,
as follows:
L Million
Annual Depreciation of road system               8.8
Interest (10% p.a.)                             7.6
Maintenance and Administration Cost              3.8
Total            20.2
2.20      Taxes and other charges from road users such as the motor fuel
tax, vehicle ownership tax, license fees, etc., amounted to about L 6.7
million in 1964 (see Table 3). Since, however, part of the charges
collected are from city street traffic they should be segregated from
those of the inter-urban traffic. On the evidence available, it appears
that about two-thirds of the total taxes collected, or about L 4.4 million,
have been contributed by non-city traffic. On this basis, road user
charges cover about 20% of the Government's annual cost of the highway
system.
2.21      There is little doubt of the need to collect more taxes from
users of the nation's road system to help meet the Government's costs for
building, improving and maintaining the road system, particularly in view
of the planned rapid expansion of road investment. The Central American
Transportation Study arrived at a similar conclusion regarding the road user
contributions in Honduras. There are various possibilities for increasing



- 7 -
road user taxes. The diesel fuel tax, which is only about 10% of the pump-
head price, could be raised. Moreover, there are no import tariffs currently
in force on trucks, buses, and Jeeps, aside from the consular fee of 8% of
FOB value of vehicles. Even for private automobiles, the total of import
duties and sales tax amounts to only about 35% to 45% of FOB value depending
on price. The Government agreed during negotiations to make the necessary
arrangements to assist the Bank in the organization and carrying out of a
road user charges study, either on a national or a regional basis. It was
further agreed that the recommendations of the road user charges study --
whether limited to Honduras or regional -- will be discussed with the Bank
with a view to agreeing on a time table for the appropriate revisicn of the.
road user charges system. Pending the outcome of such study, the Government
is considering the possibility of introducing an immediate increase of up to
50% in the present level of road user charges, as described in paragraph 2.20.
F. Investment Plans for Transportation
2.22      The Government's current five-year plan, 1965-69, calls for a
total investment in transportation facilities of over L 180 million which
is more than 37% of the total public investment envisaged for the plan
period, (about L 481 million). More than 80% of the transport investment,
or over L 146 million, is programmed for construction and improvement of the
country's road network. The annual level of road investment is projected
to increase from L 17.4 million in 1965 to L 40.7 million in 1969.
2.23      Due, however, to the slow start in implementing the plan and lack
of project preparation, the actual results obtained during 1965, the first
year of the plan, were far short of the target; against planned expenditures
on roads of L 17.4 million only L 7.5 million was spent. Moreover, it
appears that the plan is not operative; investments are presently carried
out on the basis of annual budgetary appropriations. The 1967 budget calls
for an expenditure of about L 38 million on roads. Taking into account
past performance and the country's capacity to execute road projects, the
planned level of investment for 1967 may be difficult to attain. The recent
Bank economic mission to Central America considered that the reasonable
level of investment in the road sector for 1967 would be about L 26 million.
2.24      In view of the inadequacy of the country's road system, provision
of a satisfactory basic network will require sustained efforts over at least
the next decade. The emphasis placed by the Government on road construction
and improvement, therefore, is correct. However, in order to ensure that
actual preparation of road projects is based on sound economic considerations,
the Government has agreed that the Bank will be consulted from time to time
on the development of future road programs.

3. THE PROJECT
A. Description
3.1       The project consists of the following parts (see Map):
(i) the reconstruction of sections totalling 37 kms of
the Western Highway between Chamelecon and La Entrada,
and the paving and bituminous surfacing of the Highway
between Chamelecon and the El Salvador border (247 kms);
(ii) the supervision of construction of the above work;
(iii)  feasibility studies for feeder roads in the service
area of the Western Highway:
(iv) a feasibility study for reconstruction of the North-
Eastern Highway between Tegucigalpa and Juticalpa (130 kms)
(i) The Reconstruction and Paving of the Western Highway
3.2       The Western Highway extends from Chamelecon on the North Road
(Central American Inter-regional Highway No. 5) to Nueva Ocotepeque on
the El Salvador border. The North Road from Chamelecon to Puerto Cortes
was reconstructed and bituminous paved under Loan 195-HO, and the rest of
the North Road south of Chamelecon is being reconstructed and bituminous
paved under Credit 71-HO and Loan 400-HO. At the other end of the Western
Highway, the road from the border to Tejutla in El Salvador is being
reconstructed and bituminous paved under Credit 31-ES.
3.3       The Western Highway is part of the Central American Inter-
regional Highway No. 4, which links the Honduran Atlantic plain with the
El Salvadorian road system serving the densely populated Pacific slopes
of the Central American isthmus. For the most part, the highway traverses
hilly and mountainous terrain through small valleys and across substantial
streams. The continental divide is crossed near Nueva Ocotepeque.
3.4       The Western Highway has been under construction and improvement
uninterruptedly since 1955. Sections totalling 71 kms between Chamelecon
and Santa Rosa (150 kms) were improved to gravel standard and twelve
bridges were built under Loan 195-HO. Under Credit 1-HO the highway was
extended from Santa Rosa to the El Salvador border (97 kms) to a gravel
standard, and additional sections totalling 42 kms between La Entrada and
Santa Rosa are being improved and gravel surfaced. Thus, the Western
Highway has been improved in stages over the last decade to a fully
engineered, gravel-surfaced stendard except for about 37 kms of unimproved
sections between Chamelecon and La Entrada. Under the proposed project,
the remaining 37 kms of unimproved sections would be reconstructed, and the
whole highway between Chamelecon and the El Salvador border would be paved.

(ii) Supervision of Construction
3.5       Engineering consultants satisfactory to the Bank, Brown and Root
(USA), have completed the detailed engineering for the reconstruction of
the 37 kms of unimproved road sections between Chamelecon and La Entrada,
and have carried out pavement designs for the whole Highway necessary for
the preparation of contract documents. The same consultants are expected to
be retained (a) to prepare contract documents; (b) to assist the Government
in the awarding of contracts; (c) to recheck the design of the pavement as the
work proceeds; and (d) to supervise construction.
(iii) Feasibility Studies for Feeder Roads in the Western Region
3.6       The Highway Department has prepared the detailed design for ten
feeder roads totalling 144 kms in the Western Region. The project includes
an assessment by consultants of the economic justification for the construction
of these roads and feasibility studies for about 100 kms of additional feeder
roads to determine relative priorities and to define a program for the
development of a feeder road system in the Western Region.
(iv) Feasibility Study for the Reconstruction of the
North-Eastern Highway
3.7       The North-Eastern Highway (see Map) when completed will be one of
the most important trunk roads in Honduras. It will link Tegucigalpa, the
capital, with the northern coastal area through branches from Juticalpa to
Olanchito and LaCeiba, and to Puerto Castilla. The present road between
Tegucigalpa and Juticalpa is narrow and winding, with sharp curves, steep
grades, and poor earth or gravel surfacing. The road is particularly
difficult between Tegucigalpa and Talanga (about 40 kms) where it crosses
rugged mountainous terrain and where the traffic is heaviest. This road
section will most probably be relocated under a new design, the suggested new
alignment branching off the North Road at the Rio del Hombre. The feasibil-
ity study in the proposed project for the Tegucigalpa-Juticalpa section will
provide the basis on which to select the best road alignment, to define
design standards, to establish preliminary construction cost estimates, and
to evaluate the economic merits of the project.
3.8       The reconstruction and bituminous paving of the Rio del Hombre-
Talanga section of the road and the improvement and gravel surfacing of the
Talanga-Juticalpa section were given high priority in the ten-year highway
program recommended in the Stanford Study of 1962. The reconstruction and
improvement of these road sections and the extension of the road to Puerto
Castilla are included in the Highway Department's basic highway program for
the period 1968-1973. Although the time schedules devised by the Department
appear optimistic, it is considered appropriate to proceed at this time with
studies of the North-Eastern Highway in view of the length of time involved



- 10 -
in the project preparation. Engineering consultants have already been com-
missioned to carry out a feasibility study under CABET auspices for the
future road sections between Juticalpa and Puerto Castilla.
B. Design Standards
3.9       The geometric design standards of the Western Highway, as built,
are shown in Table 4. Design speeds range from 45 kms per hour in mountain-
ous terrain to 80 kms per hour in level terrain. Maximum grades are 10%.
The standards are appropriate for the traffic requirements and the terrain.
The road will have ample capacity to accommodate forecast traffic volumes,
during the 15 years of its expected useful economic life.
3.10      The pavement structure, including a surfacing of 2.5 cm thickness
of asphalt, is designed for the projected traffic on the assumption that the
axle weight regulations discussed in paragraph 2.16 will be establihsed and
enforced. The design allows for stage development so that the pavement can be
strengthened as the traffic grows. The pavement over some sections will
probably require strengthening by a second asphalt overlay or some alternative
method after about six years of service life. The need for the strengthening
will have to be determined with more certainty at that time on the basis of
the actual development of traffic and the physical behaviour of the pavement.
The Government has agreed that the need for strengthening will be examined
from time to time, and, that strengthening will be carried out as appropriate.
C. Execution
3.11      Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the Highway
Department within the Ministry of Communications and Public Works. Unit
price type contracts for construction will be let on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. No difficulty is anticipated in getting suitable
contractors to carry out the project. It is expected that construction will
start at the beginning of 1968, and that the project will be completed by
mid-1971. Engineering consultants satisfactory to the Bank will be employed
for all engineering services involved in the project.



D. Cost Estimate and Financing
3.12      The estimated total cost of the project is US$12.6 million equivalent.
The foreign exchange component is presently estimated at 70% on construction
and 50% on engineering. The estimate is summarized below (for details see
Table 5). The proposed Bank loan would cover about 705 of the total cost of
the project and the Government would finance the balance.

Total        25,200             12,600             8,600
3.13      The disbursement procedures will be as follows.   For construction
(Table 5, Category A) the Bank will disburse 70 percent of total expenditures
(this percentage being fixed on the basis of the presently estimated foreign
exchange component thereof); if construction costs are lower than estimated,
any surplus funds remaining in the loan account would be cancelled. If
construction costs are higher than estimated, the Bank may, at its option,
establish such other (and lower) percentage as will permit the Bank to spread
disbursements throughout the construction period. For Engineering Services
(Table 5, Category B) the Bank will disburse 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost thereof.
3.14      The constructior, cost estimates are based on work quantities
derived from the designs discussed in paragraph 3.5 and on unit
prices determined from cost analyses taking into account prices for similar
works recently tendered on the North Road project in Honduras. Import taxes
and consular fees are excluded from the estimates, as it is normal practice
in Honduras to exempt public work contracts from such taxes and duties.
The foreign exchange includes use of imported equipment, fuel and materials,
foreign personnel and overhead, and the profits of foreign contractors and
consultants.



- 12 -
3.15      Average pavement thickness requirements were determined for the
purpose of the cost estimates on the basis of soil strength values applicable
to typical soil formations. The thickness of the pavement to be actually
built will be determined as construction proceeds on the basis of more
detailed soil strength values. The exact amount of gravel materials from
the road surface which can be recovered for incorporation into the pavement
structure will also be determined in the course of construction, as wqell
as the amount of necessary reshaping and reconditioning works of the existing
road surface prior to surfacing. A 15% allowance on construction costs is
included in the estimates to cover possible work quantity variations.
A further 10% allowance on all costs is also included to cover possible price
increases over the construction period. Construction costs in Honduras during
the past years have increased only moderately. The allowances for quantity
and cost contingencies are considered adequate.
3.16      On the basis of the construction program discussed in para. 3.11,
the annual expenditures are estimated as follows:

4. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Importance of the lWestern Region
4.1       The zone of influence of the Western Highway, the Western Region,
stretches from the El Salvador border in the south along the Guatemala border
in the west to the Carribean coast in the north.  Economic development currently
is centered around San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortes in the north. The develop-
ment of the southern part has received considerable stimulus from the construct-
ion of the gravel road to the El Salvador border in the recent years, but the
development is still in the early stage.
4.2       The terrain varies greatly along the highway.  The fertile Sula
Valley at the northern end is a wide open tropical plain at sea level. The
northern half of the highway generally follows the course of the Chamelecon
River. Here the terrain and climate conditions are favorable for agricul-
ture. In the southern half, the highway crosses various plateaus, narrow
valleys and passes over a 7,000 foot mountain range near the El Salvador
border. The terrain in this part is less favorable for agricultural produc-
tion. The climate varies with the altitude and is generally hot and humid
in the northern plain and temperate in the mountainous southern part. During
the rainy season (May through October in the south and May through January
in the north) heavy rainfalls make road maintenance costly and difficult.
4.3       The Western Region which covers only about 16% of the country's
total area is the most heavily populated, accounting for nearly 35% of the
country's population. The population density in the Departments of Cortes
and Copan is the highest in Honduras and the population growth in these
Departments is considerably higher than the national average.
4.4       The zone of influence of the highway includes important centers of
economic activity in Honduras. The importance of the region may be illus-
trated by its contribution to the total production in major agricultural
commodities.  More than 40% of the country's production of tobacco, sugar,
coffee and rice originates in this area (see Table 6).
4.5       Furthermore, in 1963 the Western Region produced 47% of the
country's total industrial output as well as 26% of the total forest pro-
duction. In 1963 agricu'ltural land utilization in Copan, Cortes and Santa
Barbara was the highest in Honduras. Additional land use is expected for
products such as lumber, along the western side of the highway between San
Pedro and Copan, sugar cane in Cortes and Santa Barbara, and corn and beans
throughout the whole area.
4.6       The Western Region is a major supplier of many of the main
Honduran export products to El Salvador (forest products, corn, beans,
cattle, tobacco, other agricultural and some industrial products). The trade
between Honduras and El Salvador has been increasing considerably since the
construction of the Western Highway extension to the Salvadorian border a
few years ago.



- 14 -
B. Savings in Transportation Costs
4.7       The proposed improvement and pavement of the Western Highway will
reduce vehicle operating cost by about 22% to 28%. On the basis of a rather
conservative estimate of future traffic, the reduction in transport costs
during the assumed economic life of the project of 15 years would produce an
average annual rate of return of about 14% on the cost of the project, which
is satisfactory. The details and the basis of the estimate are explained
below.
(a) Traffic Projection
4.8       According to the consultants' traffic counts at the Quimistan
station, 50 kms west of Chamelecon, the daily traffic volume has grown from
120 in 1960 to 275 in 1965, or at an annual rate of growth of nearly 20%.
Traffic counts on the newly built Western Highway extension are available
only starting from March 1965, as the new road has been open to traffic only
since 1964. The average daily traffic during March 1965 of 128 vehicles
has increased to 170 in March 1966, or by 30%. It would be unwise to base
the traffic forecast on the increase registered in one year. But it appears
that the traffic growth on the Western Highway extension to the El Salvador
border will be very large in the next 5 to 10 years due to the increasing
trade with El Salvador. The reconstruction of El Salvador's connecting North
Road will provide an asphalt paved through route from the Pacific coast in
El Salvador to the Atlantic shore in Honduras.
4.9       The forecast rate of traffic growth used in this report is consid-
erably below the historic trend observed in the Chamelecon-Santa Rosa section,
but somewhat above the average for the country as a whole because of the
known potential of this road as an international link. For the sections
Chamelecon-La Entrada and La Entrada-Santa Rosa which are part of the original
Western Highway, and on which the present traffic volumes are comparatively
large, normal annual traffic growth rates are assumed to be 15% from now to
1970, declining thereafter to 10%, 8% and 6% for the respective 5-year periods
up to 1985. For generated traffic, annual growth rates have been estimated
at 5% and 2% for 1970-75 and 1976-80, respectively. Somewhat higher annual
growth rates are anticipated for the sections Santa Rosa-La Labor and
La Labor-El Salvador border (Western HighwTay Extension) which were only
recently opened to traffic. The annual growth rates for normal traffic are
estimated at 15% from now to 1970, 12% for 1971-75, 10% for 1976-80 and 7%
for 1981-85. Generated traffic is expected to grow at 5% and 2% p.a. between
1970-75 and 1976-80, respectively (see Table 7).



- 15 -
(b) Estimated Rates of Return
4.10      As the present conditions of the road vary considerably between
different sections and also because of the different types of terrain which
the sections of the road traverse, the present and future costs of vehicle
operation and, therefore, the savings in vehicle operation costs, are ex-
pected to differ between sections. On the basis of the consultants' detailed
investigation the savings in vehicle operating cost per km are estimated to
range from 7 centavos to 14 centavos (see Tab'le 8).
4.11      The savings in vehicle operating costs will produce rates of re-
turn ranging from 11% to 25% for individual sections, all of which are ade-
qluate to justify the proposed investment. The estimated rates of return by
sections are showm as follows:
Section 1, Chamelecon - La Entrada       106 km    11%
Section 2, La Entrada - Santa Rosa        43 km    25%
Section 3, Santa Rosa - La Labor          54 km    12%
Section 4, La Labor - El Salvador Border 43 km     15%
4.12      Section 2 produces the highest return despite the fact that the
traffic volume on this section is somewhat lower than on Section 1. This is
caused by the mountainous terrain which makes vehicle operating costs on the
present road very high, while after the completion of the proposed project
they will come more into line with those on other sections. A similar ex-
planation applies to Section 4, which has a slightly lower volume of traffic
than Section 3 but a higher rate of return. The overall return of the pro-
posed project is about 14% per annum.
C. Other Benefits
4.13      There are other benefits from the project, such as savings in
road maintenance costs, time savings to both passenger and freight, and
closer national and regional integration. However, apart from savings
in road maintenance costs, these benefits are not readily quantifiable.
Maintenance savings account only for a small fraction of total benefits
and are estimated to increase from some L 70,000 in 1970 to L 170,000 in 1975,
remaining at that level over the lifetime of the project. If these benefits
are included in the rate of return calculation, it would increase by less than
1%.
4.14      Although the northern end of the highway has been in use for many
years the through connection between Chamelecon and the El Salvador border
was only opened in 1964. Hence, it is too early to make a detailed assess-
ment of the development benefits which may be attributed to the latter work.
However, there is evidence that the road construction has been instrumental
in bringing about various favorable social and economic changes in its service
areas.



- 16 -
4.15      The most rapid development has been taking place in the San Pedro
Sula area which, within the past few years, has become one of the important
industrial and agricultural centers of Honduras. The city of San Pedro Sula,
just beyond the northern end of the Western Highway has grown into an impor-
tant marketing center for agricultural and forestry products originating in
the Sula Valley.
4.16      Important social and economic changes are taking place in the whole
border area south of Santa Rosa. Previously, what little trade there was in
this region was principally directed to El Salvador over primitive trails;
today the area is becoming more closely integrated with the national as well
as the Central American markets and is developing into an important center
for trade and production. The road construction substantially contributed to
this favorable change.
4.17      In the more isolated region in the southern part, the Western High-
way and its feeder roads have made it possible to provide improved educational,
medical and administrative facilities. Since 1962, 27 new schools and 15
public clinics were opened in the region (partly financed by Alliance for
Progress funds) at a cost of some 1.1 million Lempiras. Moreover, the Govern-
ment, in cooperation with the Banco de Fomento, has started to provide
technical and financial assistance to farmers.
4.18      Easier access to El Salvador as well as to home markets in Honduras
has presumably been instrumental in inducing substantial increases in cash
crop production, primarily tobacco, corn and beans. Santa Rosa de Copan is
developing into a regional center for tobacco production and marketing.
Coffee production benefitted materially from the reduction in transportation
costs not only for marketing the final product (the change from mule and air
to road transportation has reduced transport costs by up to 75%) but also for
cheaper inputs, such as fertilizer, which is being used to an increasing
extent in coffee growing. Exploitation of lumber resources has begun recently
and appears to be developing into an important activity in the area.
4.19      The rapid expansion in productive activities accompanied by a
process of closer national and interregional integration of the Western
Region is only a beginning. Paving the Western Highway will further
stimulate both the exploitation of the region's resources and the process
of integration.
D. Feasibility Studies
(a) Feeder Roads in the Western Highway Service Area
4.20      In order to exploit fully the agricultural potential and to further
strengthen the integration process of the Western Region, the feeder road
system must be expanded in the near future. At present some feeder roads are
under construction (partly financed by IDA credit 1-HO), and final engineering
has been completed on some additional feeder roads, but no feasibility study
for a feeder road system for the whole Western Region is available. Although



- 17 -
the Western Highway project is justified on its own merits, a feeder road systen
would substantially increase its benefits. Therefore, a feasibility study for
such roads appears economically justified.
(b) North-Eastern Highway
4.21      A low standard road connects the Honduran center of lumber produc-
tion located in the area around Juticalpa with Tegucigalpa. It is not
adequate for the heavy traffic, which consists mainly of lumber transport.
The service area of the road has considerable lumber resources as well as
possibilities for increasing agricultural production. The improvement of this
road is scheduled for the 1968-73 period and is considered to be one of the
high priority projects. Together with the Juticalpa-Puerto Castilla road, this
will provide a needed additional link between the capital city and the
Atlantic coast.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECO1MIMENDATIONS
5.1       The project will greatly improve the conditions of road transport
on the Honduran section of one of the principal Central American Inter-
regional Highways and will enhance economic development in the potentially
rich Western Region of Honduras. It is well planned, technically feasible
and will yield a good economic return on the investment from lower transport
costs alone.
5.2       The Highway Department within the Ministry of Communications and
Public Works will be able to execute the project with the assistance of
consultants; construction will be carried out by contractors in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The amount of the loan represents
the presently estimated foreign exchange cost component of the project and
the balance will be provided by the Government.
5.3       The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$ 8.6
million. An appropriate loan term would be 20 years including a five-year
period of grace.
