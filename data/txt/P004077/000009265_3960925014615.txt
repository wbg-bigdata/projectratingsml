OGSZO ARtA DEVLOYMDNT PROJECT STAGE I
(LOAN 1503-10)
PRZFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Ogseo Area
Developmnt Project Stage I for which Loan 1503-I0 was approved on December
22, 1977 in the  mount  of US$36.0 sillion.    The loan ws closed fully
disbursed on June 30,  1985,  two years behind schedule, although project
works were not expected to be completed b-fore the end of 1988.
The PCR, prepared by FA0/CP, is based upon a review of the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR No. 1728-10, dated December 1, 1977); the President's
Report (No. P-2183-10,  dated December  7,  1977)g  the Loan and Guarantee
Agremoents of January 4, 1978; project data compiled by ADC; supervision
reports and various  project-rolated  Back  file.   Field visits to the
project area eroe made in September 1985 and May 1986; discussions were
held with project staff in ADC and the staff of local offices of the Office
of Rural Development, National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and
Nonsan Farmland  Improvement Association,  and  Bank  staff who have been
associated with the project.
The report ws not selected for audit by ORD, as Its more
important findings and lessons are similar to those noted in the combined
PCR  of the Niho Watershed Area Developmnt  and Tong San Oang Irrigation
Stage II Projects (OED Report No. 6197 dated May 21, 1986) an well as the
PPAR of the Korea Rural Infrastructure Project II (OlD Report No. 6197 of
June 6, 1986).
The draft report ws sent to the Borrower for coments on
September 17, 1987. Coments received are attached to the PCR as an annex.
The assistance provided during the preparation of this report by
the Government of Korea and the staff of ADC Is gratefully acknowledged.

P3OJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
OGSEO AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT STAGE I
(LOAN 1503-KO)
EVALUATION SUWOARY
Introduction
The project wa  the seventh in  a series of projects to asgist the
country's  land  and water  development.    Thesa  projects  have  been an
Important part of Government's strategy to raise rural incomes, to create
productive rural  employment,  discouraging  migration  to  cities,  and to
satisfy the country's demand for foodgrains, particularly rice and barley.
Oblectives
The project was the first phase of a large ma2ter plan aimed at
developing th- lower Geum, Nangyeong snd Dongjin river basins covering a
total area of about 102,000  ha.    The  project was to benefit some 23,400
farm families, providing Irrigation, drainage and land development on
12,290 ha, including 7,090 ha  of  new  and 3,710 ha of Improved irrigation
and drainage, and providing 1,490 ha with a more assured water supply. The
project ws to be implemented in five years (1978-82) by the Agricultural
Development Corporation (ADC) for an estimated cost of US$76.0 million.
Implementation IxDerience
Little progress was made in the first six months after loan
effectiveness, and it was not until November 1979 that the contracts for
the first three irrigation aub-projects were awarded. During this period,
ADC did a study of pumping alternatives which resulted in appreciable
changes to the pumping arrangements.   Work on the first three sub-projects
ws completed in December 1983, having taken about four years instead of
the two and a half forecast in the SAR. Construction periods for the other
sub-proje ts, which are not yet completed,  are expected to be of about the
same duration. The delays wore mainly due to late preparation of final
design  and  Government's   difficulties   in   providing  adequate  budget
allocations to ADC due to rapid inflation. In addition, self-sufficiency
in cereals had been attained in 1982, resulting in lower priority being
given by Government to irrigation projects. However, ADC's performance in
constructing project works was of high standard. When the loan was closed,
in,Juno 1985, total project was estimated at US$103 million (including
US$30 million to complete the project by end 1988), or a cost overrun of
36Z and a time overrun of 144Z.



Results
Irrigated area yields and cropping intensity have increased
significantly, resulting in higher production of rice and barley. Now
crops,mostly vegetables, have been Introduced in the project area. As In
other irrigation projects in Korea, use of high-yield varieties of rice has
been less than  expected  becuse  of consuer preference for traditional
rIce.
Based on the cropping pattarn and yields of the complete sub-
projects, the overall project ERR Is now estimated at 102, compared with an
appraisal estimate of 121. The main factors contributing to the lower ERR
are implementation delays and higher investment costs than anticipated.
Sustainabilitv
The sustainability of economic benefits is somewhat doubtful as
project works were not fully completed at project closing and price
forecasts for rice are now lower than estimated at that time. On the
positive  side,  the  finimncial price   of  rice  remain  attractive  for
producers, who are also strongly comitted to pay adequate water charges
and to ensure operation end maintenance of the project works.
Findinas and Lessons
The main lessons learned from this project ar- as follows:
(a) In order to avoid implementation delays specific coumitment should
be obtained from Government in the Gurantse Agrement to allocate
the necessary funds;
(b) To better compete with traditional rice varieties more research
should  be  directed  to   producing   HYV* which meet  consumer
preferencesa
(c)  Revision  of  farm   size   cellings   is   essential  to  prevent
smllholdings from becoming 'nominal' assets which no longer
produce high enough incomes to prevent the loss of young people to
the cities;
(d) The reliability of water supply as well as the level of prices
received by farmers for the main crops grown lnfluence strongly
the rate of Irrigation cost recovery by a governmental agency
providing operation and maintenance servicess and
, (e) Continuity of a technically strong Bank supervision team is a
definite advantage to project success.

OGSEO AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT STAGE I
(LOAN 1503-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The Ogseo Area Development Project Stage I (Ogseo Project) was  the
Bank's seventh lending operation in Korea to assist the country's land and
water development. The Bank has been involved in this sub-sector since 1969
when it approved a loan of US$45 N for Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project
(Loan 600-KO), followed by six other projects including Ogseo Project (see
Table 1). These projects have formed an important part of the Government's
strategy to raise rural incomes, to create productive rural employment
(thereby discouraging migration to the cities), and to satisfy the country's
demand for foodgrains, particularly rice and barley.
1.2      The Ogseo Project, the  subject  of  this  completion  report,  was
estimated to cost US$76 N of which USS36 M, representing the foreign
exchange component, was financed by a Bank loan. The project, which was to
benefit  same  23,400  farm  families,  was  designed to provide irrigation,
drainage and land development, on 12,290 ha which included 7,090 ha of new
and 3,710 ha of improved irrigation and drainage, and 1,490 ha with a more
assured w&ter supply. Responsibility for implementition rested with the
Agricultural Development Corporation (ABC).
1.3      This report Is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (No.
1728-KO) dated 1 December 1977, the President's Report (No.P-2183-KO) dated
7 December 1977, the Loan and Guarantee Agreements dated 4 January 1978, and
project data compiled by ADC; perusal of supervision reports and project
files in the Bank, field visits in September 1985 and May 1986 to selected
project sites; discussions with project staff in ADC and the staff of  local
offices of the Office of Rural Development (ORD), National Agricultural
Cooperative Federation (NACF) and Nonsan Farmland Improvement Association
(FLIA), and  interviews  with  Bank staff who have been associated with the
project.

It. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification
2.1      As  the  first  stage  of a O'ln for Irrigation, drainage and tidal
land reclamation in the lower reaches of the Geum river 1/ and adjacent
areas along the west coast of Korea about 160 km south of Seoul, a project
In Ogseo area had been under consideration  t,  AOC  since  the  mid-1960s.
Overall surveys, studies and investigations for the Geum river were begun in
1968 by a team from the Ministry of Construction (MOC), the Korea Water
Resources Development Corporation (a forerunner of the Industrial Sites and
Water Resource Developiunt Corporation - ISWACO), and foreign consulting
engineers. The resulting report was presented by MOC in 1972.
2.2      Following  recomendations  of  a  Dank mission which visited Korea
between 19 March and 1 April 1973 and based on Government request, the Bank
Included funds in the National Seeds Project. (Loan 942-KO, 1973) for
preparing a master plan for the Ogseo project and a feasibility report for a
first stage development based on the 1972 report, supplemented by additional
investigations.
Preparation
2.3      In  March  1974, the Government selected another firm of consulting
engineers to assist ADC in preparing these studies. The master plan was
completed in July 1975 and the feasibility study in August 1975. The master
plan proposed a number of distinct sub-projects or divisions in the lower
Geum, Mangyeong and Dongjin river basins, covering a total area of about
102,000 ha of which about 44,000 ha would be newly irrigated, and 58,000 ha,.
already irrigated, would be improved by firming up water supplies, and
providing drainage, access roads and on-farm development. The two principal
features  of  the  plan would be an estuary weir on the Geum river and a sea
dike across the mouth of the Mangyeong-Dongjin river system. In addition to
the estuary  reservoir,  water  supply  would  also  be  available from the
Daecheong multi-purpose da, then under construction, Seomjin reservoir on
the Oongjin and a number of smaller reservoirs.
2.4      The  plan  recommended  development  of  the  Ogseo  project in two
phases. Phase I would provide some 27,000 ha of new and 29,000 ha of
improved irrigation and would be carried out in two stages. The first stage
called for construction of the Geum estuary weir, main and secondary canal
and on-farm development works on 40,000 ha in the Igsan and Gimje Divisions,
while the second stage included irrigation and on-farm works for 16,000 ha
in the Nonsan and Seocheon Divisions. The remaining area of 46,000 ha was to
be 'developed in Phase II. Phase I was found to be technically and
economically feasible. However, the financial requirements of the project as
proposed were too great (USS250 N in mid-1975 prices, excluding price
contingencies) and the Government decided to delay construction of the
estuary weir and related works.
TJ The Geum, over 400 km long with a catchment area of about 10,000 km2 is
tho third larapst river in Korea.



2.5      At the sam  time, the Government decided that ISWACO should proceed
with the Daecheong multipurpose dam about 85 km upstream of the project
area. Construction began at the end of 1975 and was scheduled for completion
in June 1980. Releases from the Oaecheong reservoir would permit adequate
flow in the lower Geum during the irrigation season to flush the tidal salt
water below the confluence of the Nonsan and Geum rivers and enable
development of the Nonsan part of the project prior to construction of the
estuary weir. ADC in association with the consulting engineers therefore
revised the staging of Phase I in an addendum to the feasibility study
completed in June 1976 in which it was proposed that Stage I iculd include
development of the Nonsan Division (11,500 ha) and Stage II would include
the estuary weir plus development of the Igsan, Gimje and Seocheon Divisions
(44,500 ha). Subsequently, the Government requested that the Stage I project
scope be expanded to 18,000 ha made up of 11,500 ha irrigation development
in Nonsan Division, 3,000 ha of new irrigation in the Taein Division
(originally included In Ogseo Phase II), dnd a 3,500 ha first stage of the
Naeseong Watershed Project. The proposed project would be  adjacent  to  and
complement   the  Kumgang  Project  (Loan  600-KO)  which  was  successfully
completed in 1976.
Appraisal
2.6      The  project  was  appraised  by a Bank mission which visited Korea
from 24 May to l June 1977. The mission, in agreement with the  Government,
reduced  the project to benefit only 12,290 ha: pumping stations, canals and
on-farm development works would serve new areas totalling 7,090 ha; 3,710 ha
out of S,200 ha of existing irrigation under the control of Nonsan FLIA
would be improved. The remaining 1,490 ha in the FLlA area, which would not
receive engineering improvements, would receive a more assured water supply.
The Government proposals for Taein and Naeseong Divisions were found to be
too  narrowly defined and not investigated well enough to form the basis for
firm cost estimates. These components were therefore deleted from the
project. However, funds were provided to carry out necessary studies and
prepare related feasibility studies. 1/ Furthermore, about 700 ha were left
out of Nonsan Division due to poor soils and steep slopes. These revisions
resulted in the appraised project area of 10,800 ha benefiting from project
works and another 1,490 ha with a more assured water supply (see Map).
Project Description
2.7      The project, as agreed at  negotiations,  comprised  the  following
*          components:
a) for the newly irrigated area (7,090 ha), irrigation facilities
comprising nine pumping stations, 120 km  of  main  and  70  km  of
secondary    canals;   and   land   development   comprising   land
consolidation on 3,070 ha, conversion of 1,510 ha of upland and 270
ha of forest to irrigated paddy, and tertiary canals and drains on
2,240 ha of existing rainfed paddyland;

b) for  the  existing  irrigated areas (3,710 ha), improvements to the
irrigation system over the entire area, drainage improvement in
2,500 ha and land consolidation on 2,770 ha;
c) for the areas with improved water supply only (1,490 ha) the
transfer of the source of irrigation water from the Tabjeong
reservoir by gravity to the Geum river by pumping;
d) cons.truction of a project field office and four sub-divisional
offices;
e) short-term consulting services to assist in project  implementation
and in preparation of feasibility studies for future irrigation and
area development projects; and
f) overseas training for ADC staff.
2.8      The  Agricultural  Development  Corporation  was  given the task of
project management. Responsibility for designs and procurement was to rest
with ADC headquarters and the Implementation and supervision of civil works
with the Project Office in Nonsan to be established under the project.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Negotiation and Effectiveness
3.1      Negotitions for the loan took place in Washington during  7  -  15
November 1977. The Bank's Board of Directors approved the loan on 22
December 1977. The loan was signed on 4 January 1978 and became effective on
29 March 1978.
Implementation Progress
3.2      At appraisal it was estimated  that  construction  would  begin  in
early 1979 and be completed by mid-1982 with a loan closing date of 30 June
1983. Construction began in early 1980 and it is now estimated that it  will
be  completed  by  the end of 1988, although the loan closed on 30 June 1985
(see para. 3.21).
3.3      Negligible progress was made during the first six months after loan
effectiveness and it was not until November 1979 that the contracts for the
;           first three sub-projects were awarded after more than  a  year  for  design.
During this period ADC completed a study of the pumping alternatives which
resulted in appreciable changes to the pumping arrangements. Work on the
first three sub-projects was completed in December 1983 having taken about
four years instead of the two and a half years forecast in SAR for the
works.  Construction  periods  for the other sub-projects, which are not yet
completed, are expected to be of about the same duration.

3.4      SAR and estimated actual implementation schedules are  compared  in
Table 2. The delays were mainly attributed to the Goverrnent's difficulties
in providing adequate budget allocations to ADC due to rapid inflation
during the early years of the project. Between 1978 and 1981 the wholesale
price index doubled; since then inflation has dropped to about 2% but by
1982 self-sufficiency in cereals had nearly been attained, resulting in
lower prority being given by Government to irrigation projects.
Design and Construction
3.5      At  appraisal  the  project  was  divided  into  four sub-projects.
Following a request made by ADC in January 1979 the project was divided into
seven sub-projects on the following grounds:
- rationalisatlon of the construction works adapted to the complex
irrigation system;
- funding constraints on local investment schedule; and
- more even allocation of construction cost for sub-projects.
The standard of design and construction is generally high and the works
appear adequate for their intended purpose. Design of civil works and
specifications for pumping plant were carried out by the staff of ADC
assisted in the fields of mechanical plant, irrigation and drainage by 8
man-months  from  three  foreign  consultants. Power lines and an additional
sub-station were designed by Korea Electric Company.
3.6      Design was carried out generally in accordance with the  provisions
of the SAR but some changes were made to the arrangement of pumping stations
(see paras. 3.10 and 3.11) and to drainage design criteria para 3.14.
Following international competitive bidding, ail contracts, civil and
electrical/mechanical,  were  awarded  to  Korean   contractors   and   were
supervised by ADC. The work was divided into seven sub-projects, each with
separate contracts for civil works and for pumping equipment except that the
pumping equipment for sub-projects I, II and III were grouped into one
contract. An additional sub-project IV-1 for a drain and drainage pumping
station was awarded to the contractors for sub-project IV, even though the
geographical area of the work was in the location of sub-projects II and III
then nearing completion.



-8-
Water Supply
3.7      Soengdong pumping station draws water from the Geum river to supply
3,854 ha with irrigation. Although the Guarantee Agreement requires te
Government to guarantee sufficient releases from Daechong dam for irrigating
5,000 ha in this project, no specific guarantee has yet been received by
ADC. To date there has always been sufficient water of adequate quality.
3.8      The  appraisal  report  expected  10,400  ha  to  be  supplied from
Tabjeong reservoir but this is now expected to be only about 7,500 ha made
up as follows:
Tabjeong pumping station                                    3,995 ha
Right bank canal, including supply to Wangjeong             2,400 ha
pumping station
Left bank canal                                             1.100 ha
7,495 ha
3.9      FLIA  engineers  are  said  to  have  studied  recent  hydrological
information and consider that there will be no problem in supplying this
area even during a once-in-ten years dry year. The storage in Tabjeong
reservoir  is  31.6  million  cubic  metres,  and  inflow  between  June and
September In the once-in-ten dry year should be about 50 million cubic
metres. After  allowing  for  losses  from  the  reservoir, there should be
sufficient water for 1,072 - of irrigation on 7,500 ha which is tne
diversion  requirement estimated in the appraisal report for the once-tn-ten
dry year.
Irioation Pumpina Stations
3.10     The  appraisal  report  proposed that water should be lifted at two
pumping stations from the dredged Nonsan river, (augmented when necessary,
by pumping from the Bongjeong pumping station, upstream on the Geum river)
into the existing right and left bank canals from Tabjeong reservoir.
Instead, a new drainage and irrigation primary pumping station has been
constructed at Seongdong (see Map), about 8 km downstream of Bongjeong which
delivers into the Seongdong canal. This canal connects to the right bank
canal from the Tabeong reservoir and, through a new inverted  syphon  under
the Nonsan river to the Chaewun (left bank) canal at the new Bonghwa
irrigation secondary pumping station. The new Sinhwa tertiary pumping
station has been constructed near the southern end of the left bank main
canal instead of a pumping station on the new Eunjin canal which was
proposed in the SAR. The Chaewun canal also supplies the Yongsan and 1ugbon
tertlary  pumping  stations  which  were  not  included  in  the   appraisal
proposals.
3.11    The  SAR  proposed  two  pumping  stations on opposite banks of the
Tabjeong reservoir: these have been amalgamated into one Tabjeong pumping
station  at  the  dam.  The  total number of irrigation pumping stations has
increased from nine to eleven but the total installed horsepower of the pum'
motors is almost unchanged (13,055 hp instead of 13,000 hp proposed in SAR)
as suarised below.

Total                        Y       13,          TI       T305
The maximum static pumping lift is about 70 m (Table 3).
Canals
3.12     The  total  leigth  of  main  canals  has  Increased  slightly from
120.2 km at appraisal to 122.6 km. The main change is the connection from
Seondong to Bonghwa pumping station. The length of secondary canals was
underestimated at appraisal and has now doubled from 70.6 km at appraisal to
the estimated actual length of 141 km.
Drainage
3.13     The SAR did not define the drainage proposals In detail.  The  area
of  land with improved drainage is now estimated to be 2,735 ha, some 235 ha
more than proposed in SAR. This is achieved with a considerable saving in
length of drains (32.5 km instead of 60 km) but with nine drainage pumping
stations instead of two proposed in the SAR.
3.14     The SAR stated that the optimum drainage intensity should be  fixed
at  7  1/s/ha  but  that  exact  criteria  should be determined during final
design. Drainage pumping stations in the early contracts were approximately
in accordance with this criterion (Table 4). The 1982 supervision mission
suggested that the capacity of sub-project IV-1 pumps was uneconomical and
the duty was reduced from 13 to 10 1/s/ha. In 1983, the Ministry of
Agriculture revised national criteria so that instead of coping in 48 hours
with floods with ten years' recurrence, drainage pumps were designed to cope
in 24 hours with floods with 20 years' recurrence. The drainage pumps in
sub-project VII thus have duties between 15 and 32 1/s/ha, which may be
considered high by normal standards.
Land DeveloPment
3.15     Detailed  topographical  survey revealed that the area of land with
suitable slopes that could be economically newly irrigated economically, was
less than assumed at appraisal. Conversion of forest land to rice land was
cancelled because some of the area could not now be commanded by the
irrigation system due to change in location while the rest was used as
burial grounds. Upland conversion to paddy for which the farmers had to
contribute 50% of the costs was only partly accepted by the farmers. In
order to compensate for the reductions in land development described above
the area of tertiary development was increased. The changes from appraisal
proposals are summarised below:

Studies
3.16     The project included funds for preparation of two future irrigation
and area development projects. The first was to have been in the Oongjin
river basin and was intended to include about 3,000 ha of new Irrigation in
the Taein area and extensive rehabilitation in the adjacent Dongjin and Buan
FLIA areas. The second was to have been in the Naeseong watershed in the
upper reaches of the Nakdong river. Neither of these studies were carried
out under the project.
ProJect Cost
3.17     A  comparison  of appraisal cost estimates with actual expenditures
(up to 30 June 1985 - loan closing date) as well as with estimated final
costs at completion of works in 1988, is given in detail in Tables 5 and 6
and suamarised below:

3.18     As shown above, the total cost of the project, on completion, would
be W82 billion (US$103 M) compared to appraisal estmates of W36.8 billion
(US$76 M), a 123% ,ost overrun. Expressed in dollars, which reflect the
depreciation of the Won (about 80% over the period 1978-1985), the cost
overrun would be substantially lower at 36% (see Table 6). The cost of
irrigation and land development amounts to W7.6 M (US$9,500) per ha which is
about 124% (36%) above appraisal estimates.
3.19     The  greatest cost increase was for equipment and materials (220%),
followed by civil works (123%), and other expenditures (68%). Within civil
works, drainage canals and land consolidation components proved most
expensive on an overall as well as on a unit cost basis. As can be seen in
Table 7 the overrun was caused partly by price escalation (59%) and partly
by quantity changes due to design modifications (41%); price escalation
itself was the result of inflation and depreciation of the Won exacerbated
by the prolonged implementation period. The cost profile of the project
confirms the experience in other countries that irrigation projects are
expensive and grow more so as the easier opportunities have been exploited.
ProJect Financing
3.20     The  Bank  was  expected  to finance the project's foreign exchange
requirements of US$36 M (W17.4 billion) accounting for 47% of total project
cost. Local expenditures of W19.4 billion (USS40 M), representing the
balance of the project  cost,  were  to *be  met  through  annual  budgetary
allocations to AOC. Because of substantial cost overruns, loan disbursements
contributed only 35% of total project cost.
3.21     Due  to  considerable  implementation  delays,  the  Bank  and  the
Government agreed in 1981 that the loan disbursements would be limited to
five sub-projects. Later, in September 1984, one more sub-project (VI) was
included for loan financing, leaving sub-project VII to be fully funded by
the Government.
3.22     In June 1980, the disbursement rate for civil works was raised from
the original 50% to 65%, as a temporary measure to ease a budgetary
constraint during a period of rapid price escalation. Since continued
disbursement at 65% would have led to the loans being used up before
completion of those sub-projects on which the Bank had agreed to disburse,
the percentage of disbursement was reverted to 50% with effect from 11
February 1982. Actual disbursements lagged substantially behind appraisal
estimates. By June 1983, the original closing date, only about 50% of the
loan had been disbursed (Table 8) and it took until 26 December 1985 to
complete full disbursement of the loan. 1/
A
J Although the loan was formally closed on 30 June 1985, the Bank agreed
to meet withdrawal applications received up to 30 November 1985 to allow
processing before 31 December 1985.

Loan Allocation
3.23     At the borrower's request, the Bank loan was re-allocated using the
unallocated funds and transfers between different categories (Table 9). As a
result, the amount allocated to equipment and materials almost doubled as
shown below:

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
The Aqricultural Oevelopment Corporation
4.1      The  Agricultural  Development Corporation, the implementing agency
of the project, Is a semi-autonomous authority within the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries. The main activities of the Corporation are the
promotion of agricultural production through development of land and water
resources and the provision of technical assistance to Farmland Improvement
Associations. A new line of activity - fisheries development - will soon be
added to ADC's portfolio and the Corporation's name possibly changed to
Agricultural   and   Fishery   Development   Corporation.   ADC's   proposed
diversification into the fisheries sector is intended to sustain its overall
volume of operations which, in recent years, has declined due  to  a  severe
drop in irrigation projects sponsored by the Government.
4.2      ADC  is  managed by a president, assisted by a vice-president and a
six-man  board  of  directors.   There   are   three   executive   directors
(Administration, Project Implementation and Technology). The current staff
of the Corporation numbers 1,834 comprising irrigation engineers (1,022),
mechanical   engineers   (33),   electrical  engineers  (31),  architectural
,engineers (10), pedologists (26), geologists and hydrogeologists (110),
economists (19), agronomists (50), adminstrators (333), and other support
staff (197), serving headquarters, nine provincial offices, and seven
project offices (see Chart). The latter are specially set up to implement
specific projects. Since the merger of the Union of Land Improvement
Associations with the Groundwater Development Corporation in 1970, ADC has
completed eight large-scale comprehensive agricultural development projects.
Its on-going portfolio includes seven comprehensive and 91 medium-scale
agricultural development projects.



- 13 -
4.3      A project office was established In Nonsan with project funds under
the direct supervision of the Director of Project Implementation, and made
responsible for implementation and supervision of construction for the Ogseo
project, while the responsibility for design and procurement rested with ADC
head office. The office was established in ADC headquarters in February 1978
as agreed, and it started operating in Nonsan from March 1979, more than a
year later than agreed.
4.4      As expected  at  appraisal,  ADC's  performance  in  executing  the
project was of a high standard. This was mainly due to the stability,
continuity and competence of project managewent. The contribution cf Ogseo
project to the improved capability of ADC is difficult to isolate since ADC
has gained from concurrent implementation of several projects as well as
from interaction with Bank staff and expatriate consultants provided under
various projects. The major institutional benefits of this interaction
include   (a)  the  introduction  of  improved  procurement  procedures  (b)
familiarity with different designs for irrigation schemes (c) greater
attention to economic considerations in the design of irrigation works and
consequently an appreciation of the importance of economic analysis in
project appraisal, ard (a) development of a comprehensive approach to
irrigation development instead of viewing it purely as an engineering task.
The gained experience and expertise has enabled ADC to get international
recognition as evidenced by its expanding consulting services abroad.
4.5      A substantial portion of the Corporation's business is sponsored by
the Government. Under agreements with the Government, AOC is reimbursed for
its expenditures and in addition receives a certain amount of fees
determined by the Governnent. In 1985, over 60% of AOC's long-term funds has
come as advances for work carried out on behalf of the Government
(Table 10). After completion of the Government-sponsored projects, the
advances from the Government are transferred to FLIA together with the cost
of works.
4.6      As  in other projects, ADC has faced problems concerned mainly with
delays and cost overruns. These problems have resulted primarily from
inadequate local funds, a factor outside the control of ADC's management. A
side-effect of funding difficulties Is seen in slow completion of projects
as evidenced, in part, by an increase in the value of contracts in progress
which rose from W448 billion in 1982 to W696 billion in 1985, jj and falling
profitability as measured by the ratio of operating profit to operating
assets (Table 11). The Corporation, which earned an operating profit of
Wil billion in 1982 and W1.6 billion in 1983, barely managed to break even in
1984, but showed a marginal improvement in 1985 largely due to a fall in
general and administrative expenses.
1/ After completion of projects/sub-projects, the contracts in progress are
transferred to FLIAs. The amounts lying at year-end are the remaining
balance of accumulated costs after the transfer to FLIA of the completed
projects.



- 14 -
Consultinu Services
4.7      Project  consultants provided valuable assistance to ADC in projert
implementation including some transfer of knowledge. Of the 18 man-months
envisaged at appraisal, 15 man-months have been utilised almost equally
between the four consultants employed by ADC (see Table 12). A good
relationship existed between the consultants and the Corporation.
Procurement
4.8      Following implementation of several Bank-financed  projects,  ADC's
procurement procedures became well established and coordinated with the
Office of Supply. As a result, no major difficulties were encountered in
meeting the requirements of 'Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement'. The
successful contractors for civil works were all Korean firms.
Operation and Maintenance
4.9      On  completion  of  construction, the works are handed over to FLIA
for operation and maintenance. To date, the first three sub-projects and
sub-project IV-1 have been handed over and are being adequately operated and
maintained by the Nonsan FLIA; cost recovery is high, almost reaching 100%
(para. 4.19). Details of irrigation pumping station operation are shown in
Table 3.
Trainina
4.10     As shown in Table 12 training was provided to 20 civil engineers of
ABC. Seven engineers studied hydrology at the United States Bureau of
Reclamation (USBR) and Colorado State University for periods of 6-11 months
in 1983, three engineers attended two to three weeks water management
courses at USBR and in Taiwan In 1984, and 10 engineers attended the
International Commission for Irrigation and Drainage Congress in Chile and
other countries in 1985.
Accounting and Reporting
4.11     ADC has maintained project accounts in a satisfactory  manner,  and
as  required  under  the  Loan  Agreement,  had  its final accounts for each
financial year up to 1985 audited by a recognised firm of chartered
accountants who have issued unqualified reports.
4,2      Quarterly  reporting  on  physical  and financial progress followed
practices and formats established under Yong San Gang Irrigation Project
Stage I. These reports were submitted regularly incorporating improvements
suggested by a Bank supervision mission in August 1978. A quantitative
analysis of agricultural performance was also requested to be compiled in
the annual report for the project. ADC saw the advantages of these
improvements and implemented the changes as suggested by the Bank.

Agricultural Inputs and Supportino Services
4.13     As  appraised,  the  project did not include any provision for farm
inputs or for strengthening of agricultural services in the project area.
These services were considered adequate to meet the anticipated needs of the
project beneficiaries. Although the capacity of these services has not been
tested fully due to implementation delays, available evidence indicates that
the servicing agencies are well organized to provide adequate services and
help  project beneficiaries in realising the benefits of irrigation and land
development promoted by the project.
4.14     Farm mechanisation in Nonsan has expanded rapidly reaching its peak
In 1983. As shown in Table 13, powertillers increased over the period 1978-
85 from 1,785 to 3,975, tractors from 24 to 139, combine harvestors from 1
to 116, binders from 44 to 136, transplanters from 6 to 390 and power
sprayers from 501 to 2,757. It is noteworthy that - although relatively
small in absolute numbers - tractor purchases increased more rapidly than
the acquisition of powertillers despite the latter's advantages for small
farms. Tiller mechanisation developed at a slower pace in the project area
than in the country as a whole. The number of tillers increased by about
120% compared to 150% for the whole country. Tractor mechanisation showed a
faster growth in the project area (480%) than for the country as a whole
(365%).
4.15     In  Nonsan  county, fertilizer use (NPK) has increased from a total
of about 8,000 tons in 1978, peaking in 1981 at approximately 10,000 tons.
Reflecting the decline in HYV rice cultivation, fertilizer consumption
thereafter has fluctuated annually without ever attaining its peak level,
more or less in line with the national trend. The supply of agricultural
chemicals increased from about 120 tons in 1978 to about 135 tons in 1985.
4.16     The  Office  of  Rural  Oevelopment,  a  department  of   MAF,   is
responsible for research and agricultural extension services. Although the
number of extension agents in the area has not been increased, services
available to farmers are considered adequate, given the high level of
efficiency of extension agents and the responsive and market-oriented
farmers. The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation has been active in
the area supplying agricultural loans, marketing farm products and inputs,
and providing storage. Loans extended by NACF have increased considerably
allowing farmers to purchase the needed inputs. The volume of short-term
loans increased from W4 billion in 1978 to W15 billion in 1985 while term
loans rose from W705 M in 1978 to W1,849 M in 1985 (Table 14).
Farmers' Organizations
4.17     Farmers' organizations in the project area consist of  Nonsan  FLIA
with 15,000 households, 418 Heung Nong Gye (HNG) 1/ with 21,235 members, and
15,agricultural cooperatives with 25,220 members. FLIA and agricultural
cpoperatives have remained by and large constant throughout the project
implementation period while some new HNG have been organized during this
period (Table 15). Of the 418 HNG, 271 were organized by FLIA and the
balance 147 by AOC. The performance of these farmers' organizations has been
satisfactory.
1/ An HNG is established as a separate organization in each village served
by the FLIA acting as a point of contact between the FLIA and the
farmers.

CogDliance with Covenants
4.18     Table  16  sets  out the current status in regard to the compliance
with covenants stipulated in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements. Brief
explanatory coments on each covenant are also noted therein. It Is seen
that the covenants have generally been complied with satisfactorily.
However, Section 3.06 of the Loan Agreement requires ADC to furnish to the
Bank a detailed plan for operation and maintenance of the facilities
included in the project. This has not been done. The guarantee required by
Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement has not been given (see para. 3.7).
The PCR mission was not able to establish that Daechong and Tabjeong dams
were being periodically inspected as required by Section 3.03 of the
Guarantee Agreement.
Cost Recovery
4.19     The Nonsan FLIA assumes responsibility for recovery  of  irrigation
charges   from   farmers  on  projects  completed  and  transferred  to  the
association by ADC. In taking over a project, FLIA would have to meet 30% of
its capital cost, through a loan from NACF repayable, at 5.5% interest per
year for 35 years with an initial five-year grace period while the balance
of 70% is a grant from the Government. FLIA therefore sets irrigation
charges at levels to recover all operating and maintenance costs and at
least 30% of the capital cost over a period of 35 years. Sub-projects I, ?I
and III have been handed over to the Nonsan FLIA. Irrigation charges vary
according to the cost of pumping. On average farmers pay the equivalent or
deliver 280 kg rice/ha per year. I/ FLIA's records indicate that the
recovery  of  irrigation  charges  from the farmers and the repayment of the
loan by FLIA to MACF have been regular.
V. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Impact on Aoricultural Production
Intended Impact
S.1      The major production impacts intended by the project were increases
in annual rice production to about 53,000 tons, from the pre-project 30,000
tons and annual barley production to about 20,000 tons from the pre-project
6,000 tons. These were expected to be achieved principally by accelerating
the adoption of high yielding variety (HYV) of rice in the summer and by
elpanding barley planted area in the winter.
A
5.2      Total project area appraised for irrigation  and  land  development
was 10,800 ha. It was projected that full developme;nt production would be
attained in 1986, four years after expected completicn of the project work.
in 1982.
/ Charges range from 200 kg/ha to 400 kg/ha.



- 17 -
Area and CrOD OeveloPment
5.3      Table 17 sets out the revised irrigation and land development  area
compared with that at appraisal, together with corresponding pre-project
land use status and the completed area at end 1985. As can be seen, the
conversion of 270 ha of forest to paddyland has been cancelled and the
upland conversion to paddyland has been reduced, from 1,510 ha to 739 ha.
There has also been a reduction in area for land consolidation from 5,840 ha:
to 4,803 ha. On the other hand, areas for drainage improvement and on-farm
development have been increased, making up for the above reduced areas.
Total project area therefore remains at 10,800 ha.
5.4      Because  of  the  above  changes,  there  was  some  alteration  in
locations of the project area as reflected in the different pre-project land
use between the revised and the appraised plan. About 2,080 ha of upland,
forest and paddylands included in the appraised project were excluded, and
about 2,080 ha of the existing paddylands located outside the original
project area were added to the revised project area for additional drainage
improvement and on-farm development. The development works so far completed
by the project cover about 50% or 5,300 ha of total project area.
S.5      Information on crop development which has taken place over the past
six years in the project area is drawn from various data provided by ADC. It
should be noted that the impact of the project on crop production is not
strictly comparable with appraisal estimates since there were  some  charles
in the appraised irrigation and land development plan during the course of
project implementation.
5.6      Land use. Annual changes in land use during  the  past  six  years,
compared with the appraisal targets are given in Table 18. The irrigated
paddyland has increased from the actual pre-project (1980) 4,330 ha to the
current 6,504 ha. The expected change in land use has not been realized
largely because of the delay in project implementation.
5.7      Use of HYV rice. Annual estimates of the area planted  to  HYV  and
traditional  varieties  1/ of rice from 1980 to 1985 in the project area are
given in Table 19. About 3,400 ha or 34% of total rice cropped area was
estimated to be planted with HYV rice in 1985. As can be seen in the table,
use of HYV has significantly declined since 1980 (pre-project). As the
appraisal projection for the same period is not given in the appraisal
report, no comparison between the two can be made. However, in comparison
with the appraisal projection for full development (1986 and on), the actual
use of HYV is substantially lower than expected. At appraisal, it was
expected that the area under HYVs would increase to about 8,000 ha or about
75% of total rice cropped area. Table 21 shows changes in use of HYVs over
the last eight years in Monsan and Gun (county) where the project area Is
located.
J HYV are conmonly known in Korea as "Tongill type varieties developed
from crosses between indica (IRRI lines) and japonica. Traditional
varieties in this report refer to the improved japonica either developed
in Korea or introduced from Japan. Use of these terms (HYV and
Traditional) are a little misleading as the yield difference between the
two is not so great. However, to maintain consistency with the appraisal
report, they are also used in this report.



- 18 -
5.8      The lower actual use of  HYV  rice  is  mainly  attributed  to  th.e
inferior varietal characteristics (other than its high yielding capacity) cf
the presently available HYVs. Compared to traditional varieties HYVs are
inferior in eating quality as reflected in their lower market price. 1/ HYVs
require more fertilizers to obtain the potential htgher yield,  2/  and  are
less tolerant to occasional lower temperature in September when the crop 1s
entering its ripening stage immediately after flowering. 3/
S.9      Non-rice cro s.  Crops other than rice include barley,  strawberry,
garlic and other off-season vegetables such as tomato and cucumbers. 4/
These crops are grown as a second crop 5/ after rice without irrigation.
Other than barley, growing of these crops was not foreseen at appraisal.
Barley was then a substitute for foodgrains. I,vever, attainment of near
self-sufficiency in rice in the late 1970! lad tu1 reduced Government support
for the campaign to grow-more barley, whicd retjlted in lower purchasing
quotas  for  barley by the Government. Conseq LAtly, farmers looked for more
profitable alternatives.
5.10     It is therefore difficult to claim that diversification of cropping
after rice is attributed to the project works, because these second crops
are grown virtually without irrigation, and this change has taken place
throughout the country. However, it is likely that the general development
'with project' resulted in a more rapid growth in the area devoted to the
diversified second cropping. In addition, it is reported that the drainage
condition improved by the project made it possible to cultivate more secona
crops.
/ Average farmgate prices for HYV and traditional rice in 1985 were
W56,000 and W66,000 per 100 litres (80 kg), respectively (Grade 8 rice).
O The current recommended fertilizer rates are 150:95:110 kg per ha (NPK)
for HYVs an4d 110:70:75 kg per ha (NPK) for traditional varieties.
(Average for the plain area in Korea).
]/ Lower temperature during this crop stage affect the rate of grain
filling and decrease the yield. Low temperatures occured in September
1980 and resulted in a nationwide reduction in crop harvest (2 million
,   tons less than the 1979 harvest). Since then, the use of HYVs has
significantly declined.
4/ Strawberry and other off-season vegetables are intensively cultivated in
the hot-house with plastic sheets, installed in the paddy field after
harvest of rice. The area of this type of cultIvation is limited as it
requires high investment and intensive crop management.

5.11     Cropp1ng intensity.  It is  estimated  that  the  overall  cropping
intensity has Increased from the actual pre-project 105l (1980) to 127%
(1985), as shown in Table 19. This increase was due to the increased cropped
area of second crops after rice. The latest cropping intensity (1985) was
about 40% lower than that projected at appraisal. This lower cropping
intensity is attributed to change in the Government support for barley
cultivation, which resulted in Introduction of intensive cultivation of high
value crops in small areas as explained in pdras 5.9 and 5.10.
5.12     Cro0  Yields.   Table  20 sets out the pre-project (actual) and the
latest crop yields (1985) estimated by ABC, compared with the appraisal
estimates. The estimated 'actual' pre-project rice yields (1980) in the
irrigated area (non-consolidated as well as consolidated) are slightly
different from those at appraisal pre-project year (1977). This is due to
the delay in project implementation, and also due to a considerable increase
in drainage improvement area in the existing consolidated area. 1/ Rice
yields in the non-consolidated area are estimated to have increasel over
three 'without project' years from 3.4 ton/ha to 4.0 ton/ha for HYV.
However, the actual pre-project rice yields in the consolidated area where
drainage improvement was required were slightly lower than the appraisal
pre-project yields. Due to poor drainage conditions in certain areas in the
extended drainage improvement area, average yields tended to be lower.
5.13     Rice  yields presently attained in the irrigated (non-consolidated)
paddyland have exceeded the appraisal full development yields (1986). The
actual yields (1985) were 4.3 ton/ha for traditional varieties and 5.0
ton/ha for HYV, whereas the appraisal projections (1986) were 4.2 ton/ha and
4.7 ton/ha respectively. The present rice yields in the consolidated area
are estimated at 4.8 ton/ha for traditional rice and 5.5 ton/ha for HYV
rice. These have also exceeded appraisal projections, which were 4.7 ton/ha
and 5.2 ton/he respectively.
5.14     The mission has  some  reservations  on  the  above  higher  yields
estimated   for  the  consolidated  paddylands.  Although  it  is  generally.
recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries that paddyland
consolidation in Korea leads to an average yield increase of 330 kg/ha, no
survey has been conducted to quantify the effect of the consolidation on
rice yields in the project area. Moreover, the mission's discussion with
agricultural staff of ADC and Office of Rural Development in the project
area reveals that it .is difficult to quantify the actual extent of yield
increase.
5.15     Land consolidation itself may not necessarily result in much  yield
increase compared with yield attained in the non-consolidated irrigated
paddyland, particularly in a country like Korea where high yield has been
attained in the non-consolidated paddyland. It appears that the real effect
of the land consolidation on rice cultivation is in terms of reduction in
the production cost due to saving of labour input through easy crop
management and mechanization, and saving of irrigation water. Available
information, however, Is inadequate to assess the effect in this eegard.
Furthermore, farmers tend to apply a higher level of fertilizers and with
mechanization have better land preparation on consolidated areas which could
result in higher yields.
1/ This change was not foreseen at appraisal. The drainage improvement area
in the existing consolidated area has been increased from 940 ha to
about 1,400 ha.



- 20 -
5.16     Barley yields presently attained (2.5 ton/ha) have not yet  reach^d
the level of appraisal projection (2.8 ton/ha for non-consolidated area and
3.0 ton/ha for consolidated area). The appraisal estimate was made on the
assumption that barley would receive supplementary irrigation in April and
early May when the crop is normally short of water. 1/ Barley presently
cultivated after rice is however not irrigated. The FLIA in the project area
does not operate the irrigation system during the non-rice crop season.
5.17     Achievements on crop yields other than rice and  barley  cannot  be
compared with the appraisal projection as these crops were not expected to
be cultivated in the irrigated paddyland according to the appraisal report.
5.18     With regard to the yield development period, the  appraisal  report
assumed that farmers would attain the projected yield levels over four years
after completion of civil works. ADC estimates show much earlier attainment
of the full development yields which exceed the appraisal projection in the
case of rice. This fast achievement of high yields is probably due to
farmers ability to apply good crop management techniques.
5.19     Overall   crop   production.   Development  of  annual  total  crop
production over  the  past  six  years  is  summarised  in  Table  19.  Rice
production has increased from the pre-project 35,000 tons to about 44,000
tons (1985). Barley production has also increased from about 1,000 tons to
about 3,800 tons.
Impact on Farm Incomes
5.20     The appraisal report assumed increases in farm incomes based on the
calculation of changes in net agricultural income before debt service for
three different farm sizes as follows:
Farm Income
(W  OOs)
Size of Farm    Proportion      Future       Future with        % Chance
of Farms-    Without         Project
0.25 ha            38             320            385              24
0.7  ha            31             590            755              28
1.7  ha           31           1,075           1,450              35

Restated in 1985 prices, future without and future with project farm
incomes would be W1,356,000 and W1,758,000 respectively for the 0.8 ha
farm.

- 21 -
5.21     The effect of the project on farm income has  been  ascertained  by
preparing a farm budget (Table 22) for an average farm size of 0.8 ha using
crop budgets and financial prices shown in Tables 23 and 24. As in
appraisal, the analysis did not take into account non-agricultural income,
which in 1984, averaged 33% of the total household income. The PCR estimates
show that net agricultural income in 1985 prices is about Wl,150,000 before
the project, W1,4t5,000 in the future without project and W1,990,000 with
the project at full development, reflecting an incremental increase of 35%.
Project-induced  improved  irrigation  and  drainage  facilities  and   land
consolidation whtre it occurred, have no doubt provided an improved
production base to pursue agricultural production as a means to raising
income and quality of life, however it must be emphasised that the most
impoftant factor contributing to increased incomes has been  the  Government
rice price. 1/
B. Economic Analysis
Appraisal Estimates
5.22     At appraisal, the project's  economic  rate  of  return  (ERR)  was
estimated to be 12% based on the following assumptions:
- project life of 50 years, including an implementation period of 4.5
years;
- full development reached 4 years after completion of works i.e. in
1986;
- prices of rice, barley, soyabean and chemical fertilizers based on
projected 1985 world market prices in 1978 terms;
- all farm labour valued at W2,500/man-day during cropping season and
W1,5G0/man-day during the winter;
- use of a standard conversion factor of 0.89 to express local costs
in terms of border prices;
- consideration only of incremental crop production (rice and barley
in the 'with project' situation) in 10,800 ha scheduled for full
irrigation and land development. Although there will be some
additional benefits on the 1,490 ha due to more assured water
supply, these were not quantified for rate of return calculations.

of Self-sufficiency" by Michael V. Martin and John A. McDonald: Economic
Development and Cultural Change Vol. 34 No. 2, January 1986.

PCR Estimates
5.23     The  recalculation  of  the  project's  ERR essentially follows t1he
appraisal report. The rain differences are:
- actual and estimated actual costs (Tables 25) and croo production
data (Table 19) are used for oroject years 1978-1985; Past
expenditures have been restated in 1985 prices, usinq the Wholesale
price index;
- consideration of increnental production in the 'with oroject'
situation included rice, barley, strawberry and veaetables (qarlic)
(Table 27);
- all values are expressed in 1985 terns, the project's final
disbursement year; V/
- Prices of internationally traded coods are based on January 1985
World Bank comiodity orice forecasts (Table 26), while those of
non-traded qoods and xrvices includinq farm labour  are  based  on
domestic  prices.  Domestic orices have been translated into border
Won bv applyina conversion factors of 0.84 for heavy eouipTent
costs; 0.76 for fuel lubricant costs; 0.79 for indirect Labour
costss  0.64 for wnkilled  labour  including  farm  labour; and  a
standard conversion factor of 0.94.
5.24     The recalculated economic rate of return for the  proiect  on  this
basis is 10% (Table 28), 2% lower than the ao=raisal estimate. The principal
factors which have contributed to the lower ERR as comcared with appraisal
estimate are delavs in benefits due to prolonged inplementation period and
hiqher investment costs. The adverse effects of these two factors on ERR
were  not  fully  offset  by additional benefits from high-value crops  htich
were not foreseen. at appraisal.

Overall Performance
6.1      Despite delays in imrlementation, Bank assistance  to  the  project
allowed  acceleration of investnent programmes in land and water development
to support GDvernment's efforts to achieve foodgrain self-sufficiencv, and
imnroved inomes' and living standards of the farming population. Within a
master olan with a rational secuence for the develoonsnt of the lower Geum
river basin and ip line with the overall river basin development proqramme,
the project Provifeed a convrehensive packaqe of irriqation, drainage and
land imnrovement works in Nonsan area. Given the adecuacy of agricultural
support services  (extension,  credit  and  marketing),  project  works,  to
Provide  comnlementing  irrigation  water  and  land  improvements includinq
drainage was entrusted to a single agency  (ADC). The  project  formulation
within this context is therefore considered appropriate and justified.
/ No distinction has been made in the pri.es for incremental croduction
prior to 1985 as the ouantity is snall in relation to the total oroject.



- 23 -
6.2      A  strong  feature  during  project  implementation  has  been  the
constructive dialogue and rapport between Bank staff and the executing
agency. This association has yielded several institutional benefits to the
ADC (see para. 4.4). Project implementation was monitored closely by the
Bank, drawing attention to potential difficulties and eliciting appropriate
action from Government agencies such as EPB and MAf. In particular, the
importance of adequate budgetary allocations which remained the single
greatest problem throughout the project was stressed by the Bank during
supervision.
Supervision
6.3      The  Bank's supervision effort was adequate. The Bank fielded seven
supervision missions in the 7.5 year disbursement period. The mission was
technically strong and there was good staff continuity between missions. As
a result of suggestions made by the Bank during supervision, improvements
were made resulting in improved reporting and better provision of local
funds. Nevertheless, cuts in public spending have affected the level of
local funds channelled to project financing, considerably delaying the
completion of project works, a factor beyond the control of the ADC or the
Bank.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1      The  project  is making a valuable contribution to the Government's
goal of reducing imports of foodgrains. The project has strengthened the
infrastructure for the irrigation and drainage and other complementary land
improvement activities in Nonsan. This has allowed the farmers in the
project area to participate in the overall economic growth and improvements
in social welfare that have occurred in rural areas over the last two
decades.
7.2      Government  support  policies  for  rice  (particularly keeping the
price above the world market price) have provided adequate incentives to
farmers to grow rice. Reduced Government support to barley production in
recent years has rendered its production unattractive as demonstrated by the
decline  in  barley  cultivation compared to that envisaged at appraisal. On
the other hand, production of high value horticulture crops has increased
significantly. Increased use of vinyl covers, as cheap greenhouses, is the
result of farmer initiative responding to profitable opportunities made
possible, in part, because of the improved land and water conditions
provided by the project. The combined effect of these developments is an
increase in the incomes of project beneficiaries, although this is still not
attractive enough to stem the outflow of younger persons to the cities.
7.3      The concurrent implementation of several projects by AOC  makes  it
difficult to single out the impact of the Ogseo project on the institutional
development of ADC. The project, however, contributed successfully to the
training of the ADC's staff, and also through technical assistance during
implementation, saw AOC develop into a competent and experienced design and
construction agency with full technical and managerial capabilities.



- 24 -
7.4      The following major lessons for design of future  projects  can  be
drawn from the implementation experience of the Ogseo project:
a) To avoid implementation deLays, it wouLd be necessary to obtain
specific commitment from the Government in the Guarantee Agree-
ment to aLLocate the necessary LocaL funds!
b) In countries without food shortages high yielding varieties of rice
cannot easily compete with traditional varieties which, despite
lower   yields,   find   better   markets  because  of  tastes  and
preferences. This suggests a need for more research directed to
producing HYVs which meet consumer preferences.
c) Higher incomes fr.m non-farm employment resulting from industrial
development have far reaching implications for the sustainability
of domestic agricultural production, given the land tenure laws
permitting maximum holdings of only 3 ha and the outflow of younger
persons from farms. Revision of farm size ceilings is essential to
prevent smallholdings from becoming 'nominal' assets which no
longer produce.
d) High   recovery  of  irrigation  charges  by  a  Government  agency
providing 0 & M activities is necessarily linked to, among other
things, reliability of water supply and the level of prices
received by the farmers for the main crop grown.
e) It is advantageous to have continuity of a technically strong teAm
of Bank supervising staff as has occurred in this project.
