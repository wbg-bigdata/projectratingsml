KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE OGSEO AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT STAGE I
1. BACKGROUND
1.01      The project falls under the heading of land and water development
designed to help meet the country's rural income and self-sufficiency goals.
It is the first stage of a plan for irrigation, drainage and tideland
reclamation in the lower reaches of the Geum River. The Geum, over 400 km
long with a catchment area of almost 10,000 sq km, is the third largest river
in Korea. In an average year the flow is 4,200 MCM, but can fall to about
1,400 MCM in a year of very low rainfall. In the lower Geum basin irrigation
is constrained by seawater intrusion which limits the availability of
fresh water, particularly during periods of low river flow early in the main
growing season.
1.02      The Government has been considering an irrigation project in
the Osgeo /1 area since the mid-1960s. A preliminary plan was produced by
the Ministry of Construction and their consulting engineers, Nippon Koei
(Japan), in the 1972 feasibility study for the Daecheong Multipurpose Dam
Project (paras. 1.04 and 2.10). Following this study, the Bank-assisted
National Seeds Project (Loan 942-KO) included funds for the Agricultural
Development Corporation (ADC) to prepare a master plan for the Ogseo project
and a feasibility report for a first stage development. ADC, assisted by
Tahal Consulting Engineers (Israel), completed the master plan (Reference B1)
in July 1975 and the feasibility study (Reference B2) in August of that
year.
1.03      The feasibility report found that a large project involving construc-
tion of an estuary weir on the Geum River above Gunsan, the transfer of water
to an adjacent river basin and about 40,000 ha of new and improved irriga-
tion, would be technically feasible and economically viable. However, the
Government considered the financial requirements (US$250 million at mid-1975
prices, excluding price contingencies) too great for it to be implemented at
that time. The project cost could not be lowered by reducing the project
area, because the large investment in the basic structures (the estuary weir,
the main pumping station and the first stretches of the transbasin canal) was
indivisible and required a large service area to justify it economically.
The Government therefore decided to delay construction of the Ogseo project.
1.04      At the same time, the Government decided to proceed with construc-
tion of the Daecheong multipurpose dam. Construction began at the end of
/1 The term "Ogseo" was coined from the names of two principal counties
in the lower Geum basin - Oggu and Seocheon.

1975 and is scheduled for completion in June 1980. Releases from the
Daecheong reservoir would permit a sufficient flow in the lower Geum during
the irrigation season to flush the tidal saltwater below the confluence of
the Nonsan and Geum rivers, and enable development of the Nonsan part of the
project before construction of the estuary weir. ADC-Tahal therefore revised
the staging of the project in an addendum to the feasibility study completed
in June 1976 (Reference B3), in which the Nonsan Division became Stage I and
the estuary weir, along with the transbasin diversion and the remaining
irrigation development, Stage II. However, during mid-1976 the Government was
reviewing its strategy for agricultural development under the Fourth Five-Year
Economic Development Plan (1977-1981), and it was not until early 1977 that
the Government decided to go ahead with a first stage of the Ogseo Project.
This report is based on the proposal in the addendum to the feasibility
study, plus additional data provided by ADC in May and June 1977 (References
B4 and B5).
1.05      The proposed project would be adjacent to and would complement the
recently completed Kumgang Project (Loan 600-KO) /1 (para. 2.09). Construc-
tion of the Kumgang Project was initially delayed by a reorganization of the
executing agency, ADC, and a delay in hiring consultants, but progress there-
after was satisfactory and ADC successfully completed the project in Miarch
1976. High costs for land development in areas with steep slopes led to a
reduction in the project area from 15,650 ha at appraisal to 12,200 ha at
completion. Actual project cost was about 45% above the appraisal estimate,
largely because of inflation and the increased costs of right-of-way, engin-
eering, administration and land consolidation. Nevertheless, increases in
the international price of rice compensated for the reduced area and higher
construction cost so that the economic rate of return is now estimated to be
about the same as the appraisal estimate of 14%. ADC has incorporated the
lessons learned about avoiding high cost land development on steep slopes,
and actual exparience with project costs, in the design and cost estimates
for the proposed project.
1.06      The water supply for the Kumgang Project comes from three pumping
stations on the Geum River. However, the Geum is now tidal at the sites of
these stations and the intakes must be closed during periods of low river
flow early in the main rice-growing season. During such periods, water is
made available to the Kumgang Project from the Tabjeong reservoir on the
Nonsan River, a tributary of the Geum, with confluence at Ganggyeong. Water
from the reservoir is impounded by a weir at the mouth of the Nonsan River,
from where it is pumped to the project area by the Ganggyeong pumping station.
1.07      When the Daecheong dam is completed in 1980, enough fresh water
will be available in the Geum at all times to meet the needs of the Kumgang
Project as well as about 5,000 ha of other new and existing irrigation along
/1  "Kumgang" in Korean means "Geum River", reflecting different spelling systems
which have been used to Romanize the Korean language. Loan 600-KO also
helped finance the physically distinct Pyongtaek Project to provide
irrigation, land development and tidal reclamation on a total area of
18,400 ha along the west coast of Korea, about 70 km south of Seoul.

the lower reaches of the Nonsan River. The storage at Tabjeong would thus be
made available to fully irrigate new areas, in addition to meeting existing
commitments which could not be transferred to the Geum. The proposed project
has been formulated to take advantage of the water in the lower Geum and the
Tabjeong reservoir as soon as it becomes available, by constructing the
necessary pumping stations, canals and on-farm development works to serve
new areas totaling 7,090 ha (5,160 ha from the Tabjeong reservoir and 1,930
ha from the Geum River) and by making necessary improvements on 3,710 ha out
of 5,200 ha of existing irrigation (2,150 ha from the Tabjeong reservoir and
3,050 ha from the Geum River) under control of the Nonsan Farmland Improvement
Association (FLIA). The remaining 1,490 ha in the FLIA area, which would not
receive engineering improvements, would receive a more assured water supply
due to the transfer of water sources.
2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The project is located along the west coast of Korea about 160 kma
south of Seoul (Map 13025). It encompasses parts of Nonsan and Gongju counLies
in Chung Cheong Nam province. Nonsan town in the center of the project area
has about 20,000 inhabitants while Ganggyeong, at the confluence of the Geum
and Nonsan rivers, has about 50,000. The provincial capital of Daejeon, with
a population of over 500,000, lies about 30 km northeast of the project area.
Project works would be carried out on about 10,800 ha along both sides of the
Nonsan River, and another 1,490 ha would benefit by having a better assured
water supply.
Climate
2.02      Korea lies in the path of warm, moist, southeasterly air currents
from the Pacific Ocean in the summer, and a northwesterly front of cold, dry
air from the Asian land mass in the winter. The summer extends from May
through September with temperatures reaching 30 degrees centigrade. December
and January are the coldest months with temperatures often below freezing.
The project area has about 200 frost-free days. Annual precipitation averages
about 1,200 mm with almost two thirds occurring during the period June
through September. Even in the summer, rainfall is unreliable, especially
during the critical rice transplanting period (June). In addition, droughts
sometimes occur in August and September. Irrigation is therefore required to
obtain optimum yields from high-yielding varieties of rice. Furthermore,
since April is frequently a dry month, maturing barley crops require supple-
mentary irrigation in order to maximize yields. Climatic data are presented
in Table 2.1.

Topography and Soils
2.03      Topography.  The project is composed of two main topographic areas:
lowlands, comprising about two thirds of the project, with slopes up to 2%;
and uplands, which make up the remainder of the project, with slopes from 2%
to 12%. The lowlands are located in the alluvial plain of the Geum River,
and in the narrow valleys spread through the surrounding hills. The uplands
lie along the surrounding foothills and have been terraced for rice culti-
vation, except for 1,780 ha which are, in general, under upland crops and
forest.
2.04      Soils.  Soils in the project area are mostly of alluvial origin,
predominantly grey or grey brown and classified as clay loams or silty clay
loams. Natural fertility is low, soil reactions moderate to strongly acid,
internal drainage generally poor, and the soils suited to rice. For barley,
however, they require drainage and liming.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.05      About 23,400 farm families, consisting on the average of 5.6 persons,
have all or part of their holdings within the 10,800 ha to be improved under
the project. These families farm a total of 19,600 ha; thus, the average
farm size is just over 0.8 ha, slightly less than the national average of 0.9
ha, of which about 0.5 ha would be improved. All farms are owner-operatea and,
as is the case throughout Korea, all holdings of cultivated land are restricted
to 3 ha under the Land Reform Act of 1950, except for those containing orchards
or reclaimed forest or tideland, for which there is no limit. The distribution
of holdings according to farm size is shown in Table 2.2.

Existing Infrastructure
2.06      The project area is crossed by paved, all-weather roads connecting
the county towns and provincial cities. Nonsan town is connected by paved
road to the Honam expressway, and thence to the Seoul-Busan expressway. The
larger towns within the project area are served by gravel-surfaced county
roads, and access roads to the villages are being upgraded as part of the New
Community Movement. The project area is also crossed by the rail line
between Iri and Daejeon. These road and rail systems adequately meet the
transportation needs of the project. Almost all farm households have
electricity and piped water supplies.
2.07      Nonsan FLIA and Tabjeong Dam. The first major irrigation scheme in
the Geum basin was implemented in the Nonsan valley. A Farmland Improvement
Association (FLIA) was created in 1941 which at present irrigates some
9,500 ha. The most important structure operated by the Nonsan FLIA is the
Tabjeong dam (catchment 217 sq km), originally completed in 1944 and raised
as part of the Kumgang Project to increase its storage capacity. Tabjeong is
a central core earth dam, 573 m long with a crest elevation of 32 m, crest
width of 6 m and a live storage capacity of 31 MCM. It presently irrigates
some 5,200 ha (2,550 ha on the right bank of the Nonsan River and 2,650 ha on
the left bank) by gravity through two main canals extending from the dam.
The supply of irrigation water during the peak (transplanting) period in June
is satisfactory, except in the lower ends of the main canals, where farmers
supplement canal water by pumping from tubewells or from small streams. In
addition to the area served from the Tabjeong reservoir, the Nonsan FLIA
irrigates about 1,400 ha through a number of small reservoirs and pumping
stations, and is responsible for the 2,900 ha Nonsan Division of the Kungang
Project.
2.08      While land consolidation (para. 3.08) has been implemented on only
about 2,400 ha or 40% of the area, the most important limitation to the
increased production of rice and barley is the lack of drainage. Although
the valley is already protected from flooding of the Nonsan River by dikes,
the flood level in the river is often higher than the adjoining irrigated
areas for periods exceeding several days and, consequently, the local runoff
cannot be evacuated, and causes severe damage to the rice crop. Furthermore,
because of the high clay content of the lower fields, and because of the lack
of deep drainage, there is frequently too much delay between harvesting of
the rice and the first tillage operations for the winter barley crop. As a
result, the cropping intensity in the poorly drained areas is only about
120%.
2.09      Kumgang Project (Loan 600-KO).  This 12,200 ha project was imple-
mented between 1970 and 1976 and involves irrigation by pumping from the Geum
River through the Bongjeong, Ganggyeong and Yongdu main pumping stations
(Figure 3.1). The Nonsan Division of the project (2,900 ha), which is
located north of the Nonsan valley, is irrigated from the Bongjeong pumping
station where the Geum remains always fresh, except during times of extreme
drought when the pumping station might be forced to shut down for several
days due to saltwater intrusion. The Igsan Division of the project (9,300 ha)



is irrigated from the Ganggyeong and Yongdu pumping stations. When the Geum
at Ganggyeong becomes too saline, the Ganggyeong weir at the mouth of the
Nonsan River, which was built under the project, is closed and the Ganggyeong
pumping station can pump fresh water from two sources:
(a)  the Bongjeong pumping station, which was adequately oversized and
connected to the Ganggyeong pumping station through a link canal
and siphon under the Nonsan River; or
(b)  when the water at Bongjeong becomes saline, from the Tabjeong
dam.
Daecheong Dam
2.10      The Daecheong multipurpose dam is being built on the main stream of
the Geum about 15 km north of Daejeon and 85 km upstream of the project area.
A concrete and rockfill dam, 72 m high and 495 m long, will form a 1,490 MCM
reservoir to regulate the runoff from a catchment area of 4,130 sq km (49% of
the total catchment of the Geum).  The project will include a 90 MW power
plant to generate about 240 million kWh annually. It will also provide an
assured water supply for expanding municipal or industrial systems in the
vicinity of Daejeon and Cheongju, augment river flows for irrigation and
reduce the magnitude and frequency of floods.
2.11      The dam is being built by the Government's Industrial Sites and
Water Resources Development Corporation (ISWACO) with financial assistance
from Japan. Construction of the dam and power plant began in March 1977 and
the reservoir is scheduled to start filling in October 1979, with final
completion of the dam and power plant proposed for MIay 1980. According to
this schedule, downstream releases would start about June 1980. When the dam
is in operation it will permit a sufficient maintenance flow during the dry
months for the Geum to remain permanently fresh at Ganggyeong, in addition to
meeting the irrigation requirements of the Kumgang Project and the proposed
project (para 3.16). This would allow the extra capacity of the Tabjeong
reservoir to be used for irrigating the new areas proposed under the present
project.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The proposed project would benefit a total of 12,290 ha including
7,090 ha of new and 3,710 ha of improved irrigation and drainage and 1,490 ha
with a more assured water supply (Figure 3.1). Rice would be the main crop

in the summer, followed by a winter crop of barley on about 70% of the area.
The principal features of the project are summarized below:
(a) for the newly irrigated areas (7,090 ha), irrigation facilities
comprising 9 pumping stations, 120 km of main and 70 km of secondary
canals; and land development comprising land consolidation on
3,070 ha, conversion of 1,510 ha of upland and 270 ha of forest to
irrigated paddy, and tertiary canals and drains on 2,240 ha of
existing rainfed paddy land;
(b) for the existing irrigated areas (3,710 ha), improvements to the
irrigation system over the entire area, drainage improvement on
2,500 ha and land consolidation on 2,770 ha;
(c) for the areas with improved water supply only (1,490 ha) the transfer
of the source of irrigation water from the Tabjeong reservoir by gravity
to the Geum River by pumping;
(d) construction of a project field office and four subdivisional offices;
(e) short-term consulting services to assist in project implementation
and in preparation of feasibility studies for future irrigation
and area development projects; and
(f) overseas training for ADC staff.
Project Works
3.02      Pumping Stations.  The project area would be served by five main
and four relift electrical pumping stations with individual motor capacity
varying between 150 and 3,000 hp and a total installed capacity of 13,000 hp.
The lift would range from 8 to 25 m for the main stations and from 14 to 36 m
for the relift stations, with maximum total lift of 57 m. Two of the main
pumping stations (Bugbu and Nambu) would be located on the edge of the
Tabjeong reservoir and a third (Wangjeon) would be located along the existing
right bank main canal of the Nonsan FLIA, which would be enlarged from its
intake at the Tabjeong dam to the new pumping station. The remaining two
main pumping stations (Duribong and Bonghwa) would be located along the
Nonsan River, but would pump water flowing back into the Nonsan from the Geum
(Map 13025). The main characteristics of each pumping station are shown in
Table 3.1.
3.03      The Duribong and Bonghwa pumping stations would be connected by
reinforced concrete pipes to the existing right and left bank main canals
to irrigate the lower parts of the Nonsan FLIA with water from the Geum.
In addition, the Bonghwa pumping station would supply water from the Geum
to irrigate the new Bonghwa subdivision. In order to reduce the cost of
the connecting pipes, both stations have been located 4.5 km upstream of
Ganggyeong where the riverbed level is 0 m MSL. Since, during dry years, the
minimum water level at Ganggyeong could fall to -1 m, the preliminary designs



- 10 -
call for dredging of a 4.5 km stretch of the Nonsan riverbed and relocation
of the intake of the Ganggyeong pumping station downstream of the Ganggyeong
weir. The relocation would allow water to be stored at a high enough level
upstream of the weir. However, ADC is considering an alternative means of
supplying water to these two pumping stations without dredging, by means of
one or two low-lift pumps and feeder canals. The alternative is likely to
prove less expensive to construct, operate and maintain (Reference C2). An
assurance was obtained that ADC would complete its study of the low-lift
pumping alternative by June 1978, and discuss the results with the Bank
before preparing final designs for the Duribong and Bonghwa pumping stations.

3.04      The project area is crossed by 66 and 22 kV high tension lines
and two substations exist at Ganggyeong and Nonsan. The Korea Electric
Company (KECO) would connect the pumping stations to the existing electrical
network by constructing 7 km of 22 kV lines and 21.5 km of 6.6 kV lines and
expanding the capacity of the Nonsan substation; the 6,000 kVA power capacity
of the Ganggyeong substation is adequate.

3.05      Main and Secondary Canals.  The total length of new main irrigation
canals would be about 120 km, of which 21 km would consist of tunnels,
flumes, culverts and siphons, while the length of new secondaries would be
about 70 km (Table 3.2). About 15% of the canal length, where curves are
sharp or the canals traverse areas of permeable soil on steep slopes, would
be provided with a compacted earth lining. Some of the main canals are
relatively small, serving areas down to 100 ha. The areas served by the
secondaries vary between 50 and 400 ha and average around 150 ha.
3.06      Around 60 km of main and secondary drainage canals would be dug or
improved. The drainage discharge was calculated for a 1:10 year rainfall.
Runoff from uplands was calculated using the "Rational Formula" for catch-
ments less than 100 ha (one-hour intensity rainfall: 42 mm) and the "Simpli-
fied Unit Hydrograph Method" for catchments larger than 100 ha. The surface
drainage intensities in the lowlands were based on three-day rainstorms
(250 mm in July). Comparison of the present value of damage to recently
transplanted rice caused by rainfall of varying frequency of occurrence,
with the cost of drainage systems of different sizes, showed that the optimum
drainage intensity should be fixed at 60 mm/day (equivalent to 7 1/s/ha). The
exact drainage criterion for specific areas would be determined during final
design. The drainage canals would be connected to the Duribong, Bonghwa and
Ganggyeong pumping stations to permit drainage by pumping when the Nonsan
River is in flood.
3.07      Land Development.  The proposed land development is summarized in
Table 3.3. Land consolidation would be carried out on 2,770 ha of existing
irrigated paddy land in the Nonsan FLIA and 3,070 ha of newly irrigated paddy
land where slopes are less than 2%. For areas with slopes between 1% and 2%
(around 2,400 ha), designs would minimize the amount of leveling required by
orienting the long sides of farm plots parallel to the contours and by
providing several small steps within the same farm.
3.08      Land consolidation, which consists of replacing the existing
uneven pattern of small, irregular plots with larger, level plots in a
rectangular grid of ditches, farm roads and drains, has been carried out
on large areas of irrigated land in Korea. For the farmer, the advantages
of land consolidation are that it facilitates mechanical land preparation,
it allows easier access to the fields and improved standards of farm
management, and it allows more efficient control of irrigation and
drainage. The improvements in crop and water management lead to higher
rice yields. Also, more timely land preparation combined with effective
drainage at the end of the rice-growing season facilitates the planting of
a winter barley crop. Boundary rearrangement may lead to minor changes in
the size of individual holdings, but there is no change of ownership and if
land is lost to ditches or farm roads, adequate compensation is paid. Up
to the late 1960s most of the land consolidation in Korea was carried out
on large blocks of flat land (less than 0.5% slope), and topography was
not a significant factor in the designs. As land consolidation came to be
applied to steeper land (up to 2% slope) design procedures were modified
to take account of topography in order to minimize earthwork quantities. The
Bank has participated in the evolution of design principles for land consoli-
dation through its supervision of ongoing Bank-financed projects.

3.09      Drainage improvement would be carried out on 2,500 ha of the
presently irrigated lower parts of the Nonsan FLIA area, of which 940 ha
is already consolidated. These improvements would accelerate disposal of
surface water at the end of the rice-growing season, which would allow enough
time for establishing the barley crop before the temperature falls too
low.
3.10      On-farm development without land consolidation would be carried out
on 2,240 ha of existing rainfed paddy land with slopes above 2%. These areas
are generally too narrow and would be too expensive to justify consolidation
works. Consequently they would only be supplied with new (or sometimes
improved, in partially irrigated areas) tertiary irrigation and drainage
canals. Construction and improvement of quaternary canals would be carried
out by the farmers. It is common practice in Korea for farmers to join
together in construction of on-farm distribution systems.

3.11      Conversion of uplands and forest to paddy would be carried out
on 1,780 ha under command of the main canals where slopes are less than
12%. The areas to be developed are generally narrow strips of land averaging
about 150 mr wide, which have been carefully selected to ensure that soils are
suited to paddy cultivation and to avoid disturbing high-value crops and
orchards. They would be converted into a series of horizontal benches with
widths ranging from 10 to 20 m, depending on the slope. Tertiary canals and
drains would be spaced at 150 to 200 m. ADC has successfully carried out
this type o' development on a number of projects in recent years.

3.14      Water Demand.  The crop water requirements for rice are presented
in Table 3.5. The diversion requirements amount to about 760 mm in an
average rainfall year and about 1,070 mm in a 1:10 dry year (which would
entail a peak discharge capacity for the main canals of around 1.6 1/s/ha in
June). Barley would receive one or two 50 mm irrigations in April and May,
which would require another 1,000 cu m/ha at the head of the main canals,/l
amounting to a total of 8,600 cu m/ha in an average year, and 11,700 cu mn/ha
in a 1:10 dry year. Including the Nonsan FLIA areas which would not be
improved, the project water demand would be about 106 MCM in an average year,
and 143 MCM in a 1:10 dry year.  Of the total requirement, 90 MCM in an
average or wet year and 85 MCM in a 1:10 dry year would be needed from
Tabjeong reservoir, and the remainder from the Geum River (Table 3.6).
/1 The 67% overall efficiency is compensated by the cropping intensity of 70%
for barley.

discharge are experienced within the year (with almost 80% of the annual flow
occurring during the six-month rainy season from April to September) and from
year to year (Tables 3.7 and 3.8). The lowest monthly discharges have been

3.16      Even with these variations, the water available in the Geum River
would be more than sufficient to meet the needs of the project. However,
during the dry season, as a result of the reduced discharge of the Geum,
saltwater intrusion occurs annually, reaching upstream of the Ganggyeong
pumping station. Because of the tidal effect, the daily amplitude of the
salt interface of the maximum acceptable salinity for rice (1,500 ppm)
is of the order of 10-12 km. Thanks to a narrow constriction of the river-
bed located just downstream of Ganggyeong, only about 35 cu m/s (including
5 cu m/s for safety) of permanent flow would be required at maximum tide
to flush the salt interface downstream of that constriction. In addition
to this maintenance flow, 30 cu m/s would be needed to irrigate 12,200 ha
in the Kumgang Project and 5,000 ha in the proposed project during dry
years, giving a total water requirement of 65 cu m/s. An operation study
carried out as part of the feasibility study for the proposed project showed
that the Daecheong reservoir could be operated to meet these demands with
only a minor loss in peak power capability during June and July of dry
years (Reference B3, Chapter C). Under the project, ADC would carry out
salinity measurements at the constriction in the Geum River below Ganggyeong
to confirm the amount of maintenance flow required. An assurance was
obtained that the Government would guarantee releases from the Daecheong
dam sufficient to provide this maintenance flow, plus 30 cu m/s required
in June for irrigating 12,200 ha in the Kumgang project and 5,000 ha in the
lower parts of the Nonsan FLIA area.
3.17      No data on the runoff of the Nonsan River are available, although
water level records of the Tabjeong reservoir have been kept for a few years.
Empirical estimates of the annual runoff at Tabjeong dam vary from 143 to
168 MCM. The lack of data precluded a detailed operation study to optimize
the size of the service area with respect to the runoff and storage at
the dam. However, ADC follows conservative policies in planning irrigation
projects. Nominally, the sytems are designed to meet full irrigation demands
in nine years out of ten. This is because strict compliance with project
charges can only be expected if farmers have a high degree of confidence in
their water supply. To test this general proposition in the case of the
Tabjeong dam, the water supply and demand in the service area were calculated



- 19 -
for an average year and a critical year /1 (Table 3.9). The results show that
there would be no difficulty in meeting the water demand for rice and barley
during an average year, even if the lower part of the presently irrigated
area is served by gravity from the Tabjeong dam rather than pumping from the
Geum, but that water shortage is likely to occur in a critical year, causing
some degree of crop damage. This is due to the small storage capacity of the
Tabjeong reservoir relative to the average annual runoff (20%), which results
in some water being spilled before the irrigation season, even in a critically
dry year. Because of this relatively small storage, it is important that the
Tabjeong dam be operated most efficiently to reduce the possibility of water
shortage while serving as large an area as possible to minimize the need for
pumping from the Geum. For this purpose, accurate data on runoff in the
catchment are needed. ADC would therefore establish a gauging station
upstream of the Tabjeong dam on the Nonsan River, and rainfall stations at
appropriate locations in the catchment area, to measure the rainfall and
runoff in the Nonsan basin. The estimation of runoff volumes is expected to
be improved when the Study of Hydrologic Services, being financed under Rural
Infrastructure Project I (Loans 1216 and 1218T-KO), is completed in 1978.
Based on these data, ADC would prepare operating rules for Tabjeong reservoir.
An assurance was obtained that ADC would submit these operating rules to
the Bank for review and comment by December 1982.
3.18      Water Quality.  The water from the Nonsan River is excellent
and has been used for irrigating rice for many years with no ill effects.
The water of the Geum River is also naturally excellent. Provided that
a sufficient maintenance flow is guaranteed at the constriction below the
Ganggyeong pumping station, the Geum would no longer be under the influence
of tidal saltwater intrusion in the vicinity of the project area during dry
months.
/1 A year for which rainfall and stream flow are exceeded in nine years
out of ten, in this case, 1967.

Status of Designs
3.19       The designs of the engineering works are in sufficient detail
to provide a basis for accurate quantity estimates. In preparing these
designs, ADC has drawn from its experience on the Pyongtaek-Kumgang and
Yong San Gang (Loan/Credit 795/283-KO) irrigation projects. Standard designs
were used for the pumping stations. The designs of the main and secondary
canals are based on up-to-date -1:5,000 maps with 1 m contour interval.
Topographical alignments with surveys of the permeability of soils, as well
as preliminary designs, were prepared for all the main canals. All
secondaries were delineated on the 1:5,000 maps, and preliminary designs were
carried out for typical ones accounting for about 14% of their total length.
3.20       Preliminary designs for drainage improvements were prepared for
two sample areas covering a total of 1,770 ha. Although these particular
areas have been deferred to Stage II, (para. 1.04), they are representative
of the proposed project area, and amount to about 70% of the 2,500 ha
proposed for drainage improvement.
3.21      Detailed designs and cost estimates for land development were
prepared for five sample areas, covering a total of 240 ha. The project area
was divided into six typical zones according to slope, morphology and type of
land development. Weighted average costs per ha for the proposed project
were calculated using the costs estimated for the sample areas. In addition,
cross-checks were made with the actual costs of land development in the
adjacent Kumgang Project.
Implementation Schedule
3.22       The project would be implemented over a period of four and a
half years from January 1978 through June 1982 (Figure 3.2). Actual con-
struction would begin in January 1979. Operations would start with the
improvement of the already irrigated areas. Development of the new areas has
been spread out over three years to achieve a rate of implementation between
2,000 and 3,000 ha per year. Completion of works in the new areas has been
scheduled with a one-year safety factor to allow for a possible delay in the
completion of the Daecheong dam (para. 2.11).
Cost Estimates
3.23      Details of the project costs are presented in Annex 1 and summa-
rized in Table 3.10. The total project cost is estimated at US$76 million,
of which US$36 million or 47% is foreign exchange. Construction costs are
based on quantity and unit price estimates prepared by ADC. Unit prices
were calculated using a standard government procedure which, for each work
item, estimates equipment use (depreciation and operation), labor, materials
and contractor's profit. The unit prices, which include about 10% for taxes
and duties, are in line with recent bid prices for similar work. Physical
contingencies of 15% have been applied to civil works, materials and equip-
ment. Engineering and administration amounts to about 13% of the base
construction cost estimate. The base cost estimate, expressed in January

1978 prices, was obtained by increasing January 1977 estimates by 9% for
civil works and 7.5% for equipment and services. Costs due to expected
price increases over the implementation period amount to about 24% of base
cost plus physical contingencies and assume the following annual rates of
price inflation for local and foreign costs:
Inflation Rate (%)
1978-79      1980-82
Civil Works                       9             8
Equipment and Services            7.5           7
Financing
3.24      The proposed Bank loan of US$36 million to ADC, with guarantee by
the Republic of Korea, would finance the project's foreign exchange require-
ments. Local expenditures of W 19.4 billion (US$40 million) would be met
through annual Government budgetary allocations to ADC.
Procurement
3.25.    Contracts for civil works construction and the supply of equipment
and materials would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. The total value of all
civil works contracts (including physical contingencies but excluding price
contingencies) would be about US$41 million. Civil works would be packaged
together by areas to form about four contracts with an average value of
about US$10 million. Major equipment contracts would be for the manufacture
and installation of pumping station equipment (US$4 million). Contracts
for cement and reinforcing steel would be spread out over the implementation
period to keep the supply of materials in line with requirements.
3.26      The domestic construction industry has grown rapidly in recent
years and has demonstrated considerable capacity and competence to perform
major public works in Korea as well as overseas. Most local contractors
are well equipped and are expected to be the successful bidders on all civil
works contracts under the project. ADC's policy is to supply contractors
with the cement and steel to be incorporated in the works. Materials and
equipment would be procured on behalf of ADC by the Office of Supply, Republic
of Korea (OSROK). A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of
imported goods or the customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended
to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Miscellaneous equipment
(US$100,000) would be purchased through normal Government procurement proced-
ures.
Disbursements
3.27      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% against the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment and materials, or at the rate



- 25 -
of 100% of ex-factory cost for equipment and materials manufactured locally.
For consulting services, disbursements would equal 100% of >-tal expenditures.
Disbursements for civil works would be at 50% of total cxpr=.=<litures, to be
disbursed against monthly contractors' progress payments. It is expected
that disbursements would be completed by June 1983, one year after the
scheduled completion of all project works. Estimated schee)tles of expendi-
tures, disbursements and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the loan
are presented in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audits
3.28      Assurances were obtained that ADC would maintain separate accounts
for the project; would employ independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank,
to audit project accounts annually; _a'l would send the audited accounts,
together with the auditor's comments, to the Bank within four months of the
close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.29      Experience in Korea has demonstrated that the development of irri-
gation in the project area would have no adverse effects on the environment.
Drainage improvement in existing irrigated areas would reduce the amount of
stagnant water and thus reduce hazards from water-associated diseases.
Chemical fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides are already widely used in
Korea, even in rainfed areas.
Preparation of Future Projects
3.30      The project would also include funds for the preparation of two
future irrigation and area development projects. The first would be in the
Dongjin River basin and would be similar in scope to the present project.
The project would tentatively include about 3,000 ha of new irrigation in the
Taein area and extensive rehabilitation works in the adjacent Dongjin and
Buan FLIA areas where a total of about 31,000 ha is presently irrigated from
the Dongjin River, regulated by the Seomjin dam. Preparation would take ADC
about two years with short-term assistance by senior experts from a consult-
ing firm in hydrology, irrigation and drainage (Working Paper C5).
3.31      The second project would be in the Naeseong watershed in the upper
reaches of the Nakdong River in the east-central part of Korea, and would be
similar in scope to the Miho Watershed Area Development Project (Loan 1319-KO).
Because of the more severe climatic conditions prevailing in the Naeseong
area, and because of its remoteness, the present status of agricultural
development is much lower than along Korea's west coast. The Government
therefore wishes to improve farming conditions through irrigation and other
investments to help equalize regional income opportunities. The project would
be the first stage of a comprehensive development of the Naeseong watershed.
It would tentatively include new irrigation on 3,500 ha, most of which consists
of small patches of flat land and narrow valleys now under rainfed paddy, and
improvement of about 2,800 ha of existing small irrigated areas, most of which
have unreliable water supplies and irrigation facilities in need of repair.
Preparation would take ADC about one year, with short-term assistance in
hydrology and dam design (Working Paper C6).

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Organization
4.01      The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), a semi-autonomous
agency operating under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF), would
be responsible for project implementation. ADC was created by the Rural
Modernization Promotion Law (Law No. 2199) of January 12, 1970, which merged
the Union of Land Improvement Associations and the Groundwater Development
Corporation. The main activities of ADC are the promotion of agriculture
through development of land and water resources, and the provision of technical
assistance to Farmland Improvement Associations (FLIA) which operate and
maintain irrigation projects. ADC is headed by a president, who is assisted
by a vice president, and a six-man board of directors. The president of ADC
is appointed by the President of the Republic of Korea. The vice president,
auditor and directors are appointed by the Minister of Agriculture and
Fisheries (Figure 4.1).
Project Implementation
4.02      Responsibility for designs and procurement would rest with ADC
headquarters while the implementation and supervision of civil works would
be under an Ogseo Project Office to be set up by ADC in Nonsan. The
office would be headed by a senior staff member of ADC who would serve as
project manager and be directly responsible to one of ADC's Directors. ADC
would establish a branch office in each of the four project subdivisions to
supervise construction. This approach is in line with ADC's normal policy
for large-scale projects whereby special units, under a project manager, are
set up with the necessary technical and administrative staff to implement
specific projects. Assurances were obtained that by February 1, 1978, ADC
would set up a separate office for the project under a project manager whose
qualifications and experience are acceptable to the Bank, and that the
office would be operating at Nonsan by July 1, 1978.
Consulting Services
4.03      ADC has already acquired extensive experience in designing and
supervising works for large irrigation projects. However, to assist with the
collection of hydrological data in the Nonsan basin and the preparation of
operation rules for the Tabjeong dam (para. 3.17), the study of an alternative
water supply for the two largest pumping stations (para. 3.03), and because
of ADC's limited experience in designing large drainage works, it would
employ experts from a consulting firm for short-term visits to assist its own
senior technical staff in planning, designing and supervising project works.
The consultants would also assist ADC in preparing feasibility studies for
future irrigation and area development projects (paras. 3.30 and 3.31). The
estimated consultant input is 18 man-months for project implementation and
15 man-months for the feasibility studies. The estimated cost is US$8,000
per consultant man-month, including international transportation. Assurances

were obtained that ADC would employ consultants on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.
Training
4.04      The project would include funds for training selected ADC staff in
the fields of hydrology, irrigation and drainage and agricultural economics.
Nine fellowships are proposed for overseas training at a total cost of about
US$120,000.
Right-of-Way
4.05      Land acquisition for right-of-way and property compensation on ADC
projects is handled by the provincial authorities with funds provided by ADC.
Assurances were obtained that land and rights to land and property would
be acquired in a timely manner to avoid any delays in project construction.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.06      Agricultural services in the project area, described below, are
well organized and would adequately support the farmers in realizing the
benefits of improved irrigation and land development.
4.07      Research and Extension.  The Office of Rural Development (ORD) is
the agency in MAF responsible for research and extension. Research is
concentrated at ORD's headquarters at Suweon, 40 km south of Seoul. In
addition, ORD runs four field stations of which the Honam Crop Experiment
Station is located near the project area. Research at Honam is focused on
the development of short duration, high-yielding rice and barley varieties.
ORD's extension work is conducted through provincial, county and district
offices. The Chung Cheong Nam Province ORD conducts field trials, multiplies
foundation seed and supervises the county ORDs. The Nonsan County ORD
serving the project area has 18 specialists in crops, livestock, soils, plant
protection and farm management and 51 general extension workers. Excluding
specialists, there is one extension worker for 525 farmers in the project
area.
4.08      Fertilizer.  Annual use of chemical fertilizers in the project area
is presently about 6,300 tons of which about 50% is compound fertilizer,
mostly 22:22:11, and 50% straight formulations of urea, triple superphosphate
and muriate of potash. At full development, annual consumption would rise to
about 11,200 tons. In addition to numerous private dealers, the National
Agricultural Cooperatives Federation (NACF) supplies chemical fertilizer
through the township cooperatives and there would be no difficulty in meeting
the additional demand. In addition, farmers currently apply about 6 ton/ha
of compost for rice and barley, and 5 ton/ha for upland crops except soybean.
It is expected that this practice would continue with the project, and that
annual application of compost for the entire project area would increase from
78,000 tons to over 100,000 tons.



- 29 -
4.09      Seed.  About 620 tons of rice and barley seed per annum are presently
used in the project area. The Chung Cheong Nam ORD multiplies foundation
seed to produce registered seed at the provincial ORD seed farm. Selected
seed growers in the villages then use the registered seed to produce certified
seed for sale to farmers. At full development the annual seed requirement
of rice and barley for the project area would total about 1,150 tons, of
which about 140 tons (rice) and 240 tons (barley) would be certified. Im-
provements in quality control and expansion of processing facilities are
being implemented under the National Seeds Project with financial assistance
from the Bank (Loan 942-KO). No problems are expected in obtaining the
quantities of seed needed for the project.
4.10      Cooperatives.  Almost all supplies of inputs and credit originating
from Government sources are supplied through the cooperative system. It also
handles marketing of a number of crops. Some 90% of farmers in the project
area are members of cooperatives serving individual townships. These primary
cooperatives are successively grouped into county cooperative federations and
ultimately the National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation (NACF). Not
only do the cooperatives serve in channeling Government-supplied inputs and
credit to farmers, they also make the farmers' needs known to the Government.
4.11      Credit.  At present, project area farmers finance about 70% of farm
inputs and hired labor from their own resources and the remainder from NACF
credit in the form of six-month loans from the township cooperatives at
13% interest p.a. Thanks to abundant harvests and high grain prices for the
past two years there is substantial liquidity in the project area and the
amount of production credit supplied by moneylenders, millers and relatives
appears to be small. Medium-term credit, mainly for power tillers, is also
available from the township cooperatives (50% of the cost for seven years at
11% interest p.a.). Short-term production loans from cooperatives in the
area amount to some W 1,050 million (US$2.2 million), and the requirement is
expected to increase to an estimated W 1,715 million (US$3.5 million)
annually with the project at full development. There are already enough
power tillers in the area to meet the needs of the project for mechanized
land preparation although they are now mainly used for other purposes. Power
sprayers and threshers are also widely available. The additional medium-term
credit required for equipment purchases would therefore be small. Even if
there is a reversal in the farmers' favorable cash position, NACF would
have no difficulty in providing the increased credit needed to support the
project.
Operation and Maintenance
4.12      Responsibility for operation and maintenance of existing irrigation
projects in Korea rests with the Farmland Improvement Associations (FLIA).
These associations operate as independent units, although their annual
operating budgets must be approved either by the provincial government or the
IAF, depending on the size of the project. The Nonsan FLIA presently owns,
operates and maintains the Tabjeong dam and irrigation facilities serving
9,500 ha; it would be expanded to cover the additional 7,090 ha to be developed



- 30 -
by the project. The FLIA would operate and maintain the irrigation systems,
schedule water deliveries, allocate and collect project charges, and enter
into cooperative arrangements with other agencies, such as NACF and ORD, for
various kinds of assistance to the farmers. The pumping stations proposed
under the project would be operated and maintained by ADC, but the costs
would be borne by the FLIA.
4.13      The annual financial cost of management, operation and maintenance
of the project works is estimated at W 75,000/ha (US$155/ha) on average
(Annex 1, Table 6). Energy costs represent about 30% of total operation and
maintenance costs. The project is staffed not only to operate and maintain
the works, but also to collect water charges and assist in organizing support-
ing services. Salaries are set at a high enough level to attract qualified
and experienced personnel.
4.14      Assurances were obtained that, by December 1979, ADC would submit
to the Bank for review and comment, a detailed plan for the operation
and maintenance of the project, including proposals for turning over the new
irrigation service area works to the Nonsan FLIA. Because of shortages in
the delivery of irrigation water during the transplanting season in the
lower parts of the already irrigated area, the plan would also include a
review of the operation and maintenance of the existing system, and proposals
for bringing the operation and maintenance of the entire Nonsan FLIA up to
the same standards as the project area.
Safety of Dams
4.15      Although the Daecheong dam is being built without Bank financing,
and the Tabjeong dam was originally built without Bank financing and raised
with the help of an already disbursed Bank loan, both structures would be
essential to the success of the proposed project. ISWACO would be respon-
sible for operation and maintenance of Daecheong dam, while the Nonsan FLIA
has been responsible for operation and maintenance of Tabjeong dam since
1944. Both dams exceed 10 m in height above the stream bed, create a reservoir
with a gross storage volume of more than 2.5 MCM and are situated so as to be
significantly destructive in the unlikely event of failure. An assurance was
therefore obtained that the Government would make arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank for the two dams to be periodically inspected in accordance with
sound engineering practice, in order to determine whether there are any
deficiencies in their condition, or in the quality and adequacy of maintenance
or methods of operation, which may endanger their safety; and that the
Government would submit such arrangements to the Bank for review by June 1979.
Monitoring and Evaluation.
4.16      ADC and the FLIAs routinely collect data on project construction,
operation and maintenance costs, as well as agricultural yields, production
and production costs. The county cooperatives and ORD offices maintain
records of agricultural credit, inputs, machinery, and special conditions
which may affect project implementation or the achievement of benefits. On



- 31 -
the basis of such information ADC recently prepared a draft completion report
for the Pyongtaek-Kumgang Project, and an assurance was obtained that ADC
would prepare a similar report for the proposed project not later than six
months after the closing date of the loan.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
5.01      The effect of the project on agricultural production has been
analyzed only for the 10,800 ha area on which land development would be
carried out, and not for the 1,490 ha which would benefit from a more assured
water supply without land development. The project would increase agricultural
production by improving and extending irrigation and drainage on existing
paddy land and converting cultivated upland and forest to fully irrigated
paddy land. These changes in land use are summarized in Table 5.1.
Present Cropping Patterns
5.02      Of the 9,020 ha of existing paddy land, 4,330 ha are rainfed,
980 ha are partially irrigated from numerous small reservoirs, and 3,710 ha
are fully irrigated. Periodic droughts during the cropping season frequently
limit yields in rainfed and partially irrigated areas, while deficiencies in
the irrigation and drainage systems in the fully irrigated area have an
adverse effect on the timeliness of operations affecting both yields and
cropping intensity. All of the existing paddy lands are planted to rice in
the summer. Rice is transplanted from seedbeds to previously puddled fields
in June, and harvested from late September through October. Both traditional
and high-yielding rice varieties (HYVs) are grown, with HYVs occupying
30-40% of the rainfed and partially irrigated lands and 50% of the fully
irrigated area. The so-called traditional varieties have good grain quality
and a moderately high yield potential but, with a 160-day growth period,
they are not well suited for cropping in rotation with winter barley.
Recently released HYVs have a 10-15 day shorter growing season, and yields
up to 30% higher than traditional varieties. However, to achieve their
potential, HYVs require a high level of inputs, a reliable irrigation supply
and good water control.

5.03      Barley is grown as a winter crop following the rice harvest.  The
crop is planted as soon as the soil is dry enough for land preparation
(late October), and harvested in early June. Barley does not tolerate
excessive soil moisture and is therefore generally confined to better drained
areas. In addition to drainage problems in low-lying areas, farmers with
partially irrigated or rainfed land at higher elevations prefer to keep paddy
land fallow in the winter in order to impound early spring rain for the
benefit of the rice crop. Barley is grown on only 20-25% of the existing
paddy land.
5.04      The upland area included in the project covers 1,780 ha, of which
1,510 ha are cultivated and 270 ha are under forest. During the summer,
soybeans are grown on about one third of the cultivated area. The remaining
land is cropped with a variety of vegetables including cabbage, radish,
garlic, peppers and sweet potatoes. Barley occupies about 70% of the culti-
vated uplands in the winter.
5.05      Most farmers own approximately equal areas of lowland and upland.
Farming is highly labor intensive and most land preparation is by draft
bullocks. In recent years, however, there has been a steady increase in the
use of powered implements such as tillers, sprayers and threshers. Fertilizers
and pesticides are used on nearly all crops with fairly high application
rates on rice, barley and the higher value upland crops. Herbicides are now
widely used to alleviate labor shortages.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.06      In the absence of the project there would be no significant change
in cropping patterns. The area planted to HYVs on both partially and fully
irrigated paddy would possibly increase, and wider adoption of early maturing
rice varieties would lead to an estimated 5% increase in the area of barley
on the paddy lands.



- 33 -
5.07      Under the project, the paddy land would increase  o 10,800 ha through
conversion of uplands, and the area would be fully irrigated. The area of
paddy with land consolidation would increase from 940 ha to 6,780 ha. With a
reliable irrigation water supply, the area under HYVs is expected to increase
to between 70% and 80%. Improvement and extension of irr-gation and drainage
facilities, coupled with a larger area of land consolidation, would give
farmers better control of crop calendars, and the area of paddy land under
winter barley would increase to about 70%.
Yields and Production
5.08      Except for Japan, Korea has the highest average rice yield in Asia.
The average yield of polished rice was 3.8 ton/ha in 1975 and 4.3 ton/ha in
1976. Increased use of fertilizer and agrochemicals, the introduction of
locally adapted high-yielding varieties, and the extension of irrigation and
drainage have resulted in a steady upward trend in production in recent years.
Of the 1.2 million ha of rice grown in 1976, 43% of the area was grown to HYVs
yielding an average of 4.8 ton/ha, with progressive farmers in fully irrigated
areas obtaining yields of 6 ton/ha.
5.09      Despite the relatively high yields and intensive land use in the
project area there is a considerable potential for further increases in
agricultural production through irrigation and land development. Rice
farmers throughout Korea have shown their ability to take full advantage of
irrigation and drainage facilities. Improvements in water control as a
result of the project, combined with adequate supplies of credit, inputs and
extension service support, would raise yields of both rice and barley. With
an adequate water supply, barley, which at present is not irrigated, would
receive supplementary irrigation in April and early HIay when the crop is
normally short of water. Present and future crop yields are shown in
Table 5.2. The projected yields would be reached four years after the
introduction of water, or completion of land consolidation on areas already
irrigated.

5.10      As a result of the project, rice production would increase from
30,000 tons at present to 52,000 tons at full development (Table 5.3).
Barley production would increase from 6,100 tons to 21,000 tons.
Cropping Calendar
5.11      Figure 5.1 shows the proposed cropping calendar for the project.
At present two critical periods occur during the cropping season. The
first is in June, when barley has to be harvested so that rice can be trans-
planted; the second is in October, when rice must be harvested as quickly as
possible so that barley can be sown early enough to be well established
before the onset of heavy frosts. With improvement and extension of irri-
gation and drainage facilites, both the rice and barley crops can be planted
at the correct time, avoiding yield reductions due to late planting and
interference with the following crop. Greater use of polyvinyl covering
for the early establishment of rice nurseries and an increase in plantings of
early maturing HYVs of rice and barley would increase the time available at
the critical harvest and planting periods, easing peak labor demands.
Farm Mechanization
5.12      At present, 20-30X of land preparation is done by power tillers
and the balance by animal-drawn implements. Land consolidation, improved
water management and better access to fields would facilitate an increase
in mechanization. Under the project, power tillers and some four-wheel



- 35 -
tractors would be used for an estimated 90% of all land preparation. Rice
and barley are cut by hand and either threshed in the field or carried to
threshers. The use of power threshers has increased rapidly in recent
years and currently 80% of rice and barley is mechanically threshed with
the drum-loop type thresher. In the future it is estimated that all rice
and barley would be threshed mechanically. lHand sprayers for the applica-
tion of agrochemicals are increasingly being replaced by machine-powered
sprayers. This trend is expected to continue in the future.

farm level is adequate since farmers retain only that portion of their crop
required for their own consumption. NIACF has 67 warehouses with a capacity
of 29,500 tons in the project area and plans to build more as part of a
nationwide program. There are also 12 private warehouses with a capacity
of 8,000 tons. NACF's planned storage capacity would be sufficient to
handle the expected production increases under the project. There are
186 rice and barley mills in the-project area with a total capacity of about
140,000 tons. These mills also cater to the needs of farmers outside the
project area but the existing capacity is underutilized and should be adequate
to handle the increase in production at full project development.
6. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND
PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      One of the major agricultural issues facing the Korean Government
is maintaining the balance between food demand and production. Of particu-
lar concern are the staple food grains - rice, barley and, increasingly,
wheat. In the early 1970s rice production fell seriously behind demand,
requiring annual imports which averaged over 600,000 tons from 1969 to 1975,
and reached more than one million tons in 1971. Barley imports have also
been substantial except for a few years since 1963, and wheat imports have
averaged over 1.5 million tons a year since 1969. Since the late 1960s, as
a result of price incentives, the wider use of high-yielding varieties and
cash inputs, and generally good weather, rice production has increased
dramatically, reaching 4.7 million tons in 1975 and 5.2 million tons in
1976. Rice imports were only 157,000 tons in 1976 and are expected to be
zero for 1977.
6.02      Although per capita consumption of rice and barley are projected
to fall after about 1980 with rising incomes, total consumption is expected
to increase at least through the end of the century due to population
growth. It is therefore expected that the incremental 21,000 tons of rice
and 13,000 tons of barley produced annually by the project at full development
would find a ready local market. Furthermore, if it turns out that Korea
has entered a period of sustained self-sufficiency in rice and barley, there
would still be considerable scope for import substitution by reducing wheat
imports and allowing the domestic price of wheat to rise relative to rice
and barley.
6.03      The project is in a rice surplus area.  About half of total produc-
tion is consumed on the farm and the remainder is sold, mostly through
county cooperatives for ultimate consumption in Seoul. Farmers also sell
rice to private dealers for use in towns near the project area, or directly
to the Government.



- 38 -
Prices
6.04      All farm inputs and outputs were evaluated at present and projected
1985 farm-gate prices expressed in January 1978 constant prices. The prices
for rice, soybeans and chemical fertilizers were based on the Bank's commodity
price forecasts. The price structure for rice is presented in Table 6.1.
The present financial farm-gate price is almost twice the economic price,
reflecting the Government's food grain support price policy. The Government
intends to reduce the deficit in the Grain Management Fund, and the 1985
financial price of rice shows a 40% reduction in the implicit subsidy per
ton of milled rice. However, it is expected that the Government will not be
able or willing to reduce the financial farm-gate price in real terms, and
that a substantial subsidy element will remain.
6.05      Since no world market price projection is available for barley
intended for human consumption, polished barley was assumed to be worth 85%
of the value of wheat flour, based on observed trends. This ratio reflects
the taste preference of Korean consumers for wheat flour. For the remaining
crops which are not traded internationally, financial prices used were
actual farm-gate prices averaged over five years (1972-76) and adjusted for
inflation. Table 6.2 shows all present and future prices used in the
farm budget and economic analyses. In converting from financial to economic
prices, a standard conversion factor of 0.89 was applied to all domestic
components (para. 7.03).
Farm Incomes
6.06      Farm budgets have been prepared for three representative model
farms, chosen according to the farm size distribution in Table 2.2 (Annex 2,
Table 5). The three models are 0.25 ha, the average size of farms smaller
than 0.5 ha (38% of farm holdings); 0.7 ha, the average size of farms
between 0.5 and 1.0 ha (31% of farm holdings); and 1.7 ha, the average size
of farms larger than 1.0 ha (31% of farm holdings). Farms in the project
area tend to be fragmented, and the project would affect 55% of the area of
each farm on average. Of the part of farms within the project area, about
85% at present consists of riceland, part of which is irrigated and part
rainfed, and 15% consists of upland and small patches of uncultivated
forest. In the future with the project, the entire project area would be
riceland with an average of 70% under a second crop of winter barley.
6.07      Based on surveys and discussions in the project area, farmers earn
about 70% of their agricultural income from the part of their farms to be
improved by the project. The project would not affect the remaining part of
the farm area, and it is assumed that net income from that land would remain
constant. Although the project would eliminate part of the area under upland
crops, farmers would continue to grow vegetables and other high-value crops
for their own consumption and cash income on the remaining 45% of their land.
Due to the Government's price support policy for foodgrains, farmers are
observed to follow a paddy-barley rotation in preference to upland crops
whenever water supply permits.

6.08      In the farm models, family size and labor supply are assumed to
increase with size of farm./l The number of full-time adult equivalents is
taken as 1.8 for the 0.25 ha farm, 2.0 for the 0.7 ha farm and 2.7 for the
1.7 ha farm. The number of full days worked each month is taken as 20.
Family labor is assumed to be divided evenly between the land inside and
outside the project area, to reflect the higher labor requirements of upland
crops. For the peak labor demand months of June (barley harvest and rice
transplanting) and October (rice harvest and cultivation for barley), farm
activities must be concentrated into a two-week period, so that more hired
labor is needed than the monthly supply of family labor would suggest. Hired
labor, which is generally used only during April through October, is costed
at the market wage of W 2,500 per day.
6.09      Rural incomes in Korea are becoming increasingly diversified.
Although 82% of farm household income still comes from agricultural sources
for the average of all farms, the proportion is much lower for small farms.
As a result, farm household income distribution is much more even than farm
size distribution. Based on the 1976 farm household survey,|2 agricultural
income is assumed to account for 58% of household income for the 0.25 ha
farm, 79% for the 0.7 ha farm and 90% for the 1.7 ha farm in the present
situation. The amount of nonagricultural income is assumed to remain constant
in the future. There would be opposing tendencies for it to increase on the
one hand, as more nonfarm job opportunities become available in rural areas,
and decrease on the other, as higher cropping intensity and better farm
management place increasing demands on farm family labor.
6.10      With the project, farmers would pay full 0&M costs, estimated at
W 75,000 (US$155)/ha. They would also repay part of the project's capital
costs, calculated for irrigation works as 30% of capital costs over 35 years
at 3.5% interest p.a., with an initial five-year grace period followed by
30 years of repayments. This would amount to an average annual charge of
about W 42,000 (US$87)/ha. At present, farmers pay about W 40,000/ha for
O&M and W 15,000/ha for capital recovery on past investments in the Nonsan
FLIA area, which covers about 34% of the area included in the project.
6.11      The results of the farm budget analysis are summarized in Table 6.3.
Present farm household incomes range from W 310,000 (US$640) on a 0.25 ha farm
to W 1,040,000 (US$2,150) on a 1.7 ha farm. With the project, incomes would
range from W 385,000 (US$800) on a 0.25 ha farm to W 1,450,000 (US$3,000) on
a 1.7 ha farm. This represents a 31% increase for the smallest model,
rising to 39% for the largest. The reason why the household incomes of the
smallest farms show a smaller proportional increase is that agricultural
income from the project area represents a smaller part of total income for
these farms (para. 6.09). This fact points out the increasing difficulty of
raising incomes for the smallest farm households through agricultural

investments alone. For example, the net income per ha at full development
from the part of the 0.25 ha farm inside the project area would be W 1,360,000
(US$2,900) after taxes and project charges. The corresponding figure for a
similar recent project in Thailand is US$720./1 Given the absolute limit on
farm size, after raising productivity and farm-gate prices for food grains to
the practical limit, Korea will have to look increasingly to other cash
crops, nonagricultural sources of income and rural services to maintain the
balance between rural and urban living standards in the future. The principal
Government program to achieve this objective is the New Community (Samaeul)
Movement, which the Bank is assisting through the Rural Infrastructure
Project I.
6.12      Although comparisons of farm incomes based on farm budgets with
income data based on national accounts aggregates must be interpreted with
caution, they do present a rough picture of the relative position of project
beneficiaries. For the three farm models, present per capita farm income
(US$130-330) is about 20-50% of the estimated 1977 per capita consumption (in
terms of January 1978 prices) of US$650. Providing the farm population
remains constant, at full project development in 1986 the projected per
capita farm income (US$170-460) is estimated to be some 15-40% of the then
per capita GNP. Thus, unless farmers in the project area can augment the
incremental income which the project would provide, their relative income
position would deteriorate. However, without the project the situation would
be even worse.
6.13      According to the Bank's estimates, only 14% of Korea's rural
population was classified as being below the poverty income level for rural
development in 1976. Updating the poverty income figure to a 1977 level of
US$200, about 40% of the project's farm families (0.5 ha farm or smaller), or
almost three times the national average, would be at or below the poverty
level. Even allowing for errors in measurement in making this comparison, it
is clear that by increasing this group's incomes an average of 30%, the
project would have a significant impact on rural poverty.
Project Charges
6.14      Korea has a well established system of charges applying to govern-
ment-planned land development projects. These charges are split into
recurrent or 0&M costs, and capital repayments. While farmers must pay full
annual O&M costs, the capital repayment terms vary according to the type of
land development. For example, for irrigation works farmers repay 30% of
capital costs over 35 years at 3.5% interest p.a., with an initial 5-year
grace period followed by 30 years of repayment.
6.15      In determining the adequacy of the proposed project charges, two
indices have been used which are defined as follows for the present project:
/1 Bank Staff Project Report No. 1412a-TH, Thailand: Chao Phya Irrigation
Improvement Project II, June 1, 1977, Table 4.4 (0.5 ha farm model).

(a)  Cost recovery index.  the ratio of the present value of incremental
project charges paid by project farmers, to the present value of
incremental project construction, operation and maintenance costs;
and
(b) Rent recovery index. The ratio of the present value of incre-
mental project charges paid by a typical farm family to the
present value of incremental "project rent" accruing to the family
before paying project charges, where project rent is defined as
net incremental income less the incremental value of family labor,
farm management, depreciation, return on investment and an allowance
for risk and uncertainty.
All project charges, costs and benefits are measured at present values discoun-
ted at 10% over the 50-year life of the project, and in terms of January 1978
constant prices (Table 6.4).
6.16      In the cost recovery analysis, US$61.5 million construction costs
(base cost estimate plus physical contingencies) are charged against the
project. Annual incremental O&M costs are W 56,300 (US$116)/ha. The present
value of construction and O&M costs, discounted at 10%, is US$55.4 million.
At full project development, and during the period of maximum capital repay-
ments, incremental project charges total US$2.1 million per year. Discounted
at 10% and assuming no inflation over the project's life, their net present
value totals US$14.4 million, giving a 26% cost recovery index for the
project. Since capital repayment charges are fixed in nominal terms, with
an annual inflation of 10%, the cost recovery index would be 20%.
6.17      In the rent recovery analysis, indices are calculated for the 0.25 ha,
0.7 ha and 1.7 ha model farms. The rent recovery indices vary from 44% for the
0.25 ha farm to 52% for the 1.7 ha farm, indicating that the proposed project
charges would be mildly progressive. These rates indicate that the farmers
would have sufficient financial incentive to achieve projected yields and
cropping intensities, and are considered satisfactory because:
(a)  although government pricing and subsidy policies have raised rural
incomes relative to urban incomes over the past five years, it is
unlikely that the terms of trade for agriculture will improve much
in the future. The proposed level of project charges is therefore
consistent with the objective of preventing a widening gap between
rural and urban incomes;
(b)  the absolute level of project charges at full development would be
considerable, averaging US$242/ha of irrigated land; and
(c)  collection rates for water charges in Korea are commonly greater
than 98% of assessments.
6.18      An assurance was obtained from the Government that project
farmers would contribute to the capital and recurrent costs of the project
facilities at the levels described in para. 6.14.

7.01      The proposed project would increase yields and production on
10,800 ha through irrigation and land development, and provide a better
assured irrigation water supply for another 1,490 ha. It would directly
benefit some 23,400 farm families or approximately 130,000 people. The
project would support the Government's policies to attain self-sufficiency in
rice and barley production, and help reduce income disparities between rural
and urban areas. The project's per ha cost of US$5,700, excluding costs due
to expected price increases, is similar to other Bank-financed irrigation
projects in Korea, but higher than projects of a similar nature in other
Asian countries with the exception of Japan. This is due to the high costs
of building canals in rugged topography and also the intensive modes of
on-farm development needed to satisfy the Korean farmers' high standard of
farm management and water control. The average cost per farm family of
US$2,600 is lower, however, than other recent Bank-financed irrigation and
area development projects in the region.
7.02      Benefits.  Expected future yields and production with and without
the project are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the farm-gate
prices for inputs and outputs, based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts
for rice, soybean and chemical fertilizers, and domestic prices for other
commodities. Gross returns, production costs, net returns (without accounting
for labor costs) and labor requirements per ha are given in Annex 2, Table 4.
Figure 5.1 shows the proposed cropping calendar. Table 7.1 summarizes the
foregoing information and gives the expected benefits at full agricultural
development for the 10,800 ha area scheduled for full irrigation and land
development. In addition, losses due to water shortage on the 1,490 ha to
receive an assured water supply would be reduced, although data limitations
did not permit these benefits to be quantified.
7.03      Foreign Exchange.  The common unit of account used in the economic
analysis is uncommitted public income measured at border prices. Because of
import taxes and quantitative restrictions, the official exchange rate
understates the value to the economy of foreign exchange used in carrying out
the project and saved through larger rice and barley production, relative to
the value of domestic resources. For this reason a standard conversion
factor of 0.89 has been used to express all values in terms of the common
unit of account, implying a shadow foreign exchange rate of W 545 = US$1./1
/I By definition, SCF = OER
SER
Where SCF = standard conversion factor
OER = official exchange rate
SER = shadow exchange rate                                          +X
In this case the SCF has been estimated by the formula, SFC =M(l+t) + X(1 tx)
Where M = imports, c.i.f.
X = exports, f.o.b.
tm = average tariff rate on imports
tx = average tax rate (subsidy) on exports

7.04      Farm Labor.  The demand for labor in the rural areas of Korea is
highly seasonal, as exemplified by the proposed project area (Table 7.2).
During the cropping season (April through October) there is virtually full
employment. In peak months (June and October) local labor shortages may
develop, and it is common practice for school children, soldiers and civil
servants to assist with rice transplanting and harvesting. Since the rural
labor force is relatively mobile, the labor market works fairly efficiently
and therefore the observed market wage for hired labor provides a good
estimate of the efficiency price of farm labor, particularly during the
cropping season. Thus all farm labor has been valued at W 2,500/man-day
during the cropping season and W 1,500/man-day during the winter, when
employment opportunities in the project area and wages actually paid are much
lower. All wages were multiplied by the standard conversion factor to
express them in terms of border prices.
7.C5      Project Costs.  As calculated for the economic analysis and expressed
in January 1978 prices, the total investment cost is US$48.9 million. This
consists of civil works (US$34.9 million), equipment (US$7.4 million),
engineering and administration, consulting services and other (US$6.6 million).
Investment costs were adjusted to exclude taxes and transfer payments (cost
of civil works reduced 10%) and all local costs were multiplied by the
standard conversion factor to express them in terms of border prices. Costs
include physical contingencies but exclude price contingencies. Estimated
annual incremental O&M costs are US$101/irrigated ha (incremental financial
O&M cost is US$116/ha; the local cost portion, less taxes, is multiplied by
the standard conversion factor). A cost of US$3.5 million is incurred twice
during the project life to replace the pumps.
7.06      Development Period.  Improved irrigation, drainage and land
consolidation in the existing irrigation areas of the Nonsan FLIA (3,710 ha)
would be completed by June 1980, in time for the 1980 rice season. For the
new areas, the Bonghwa subdivision (1,930 ha) would be completed by
June 1981, the Bugbu and Wangjeon subdivisions (3,460 ha) would be completed
by December 1981 and the Nambu subdivision (1,700 ha) would be completed by
June 1982. Since releases from the Daecheong dam are scheduled to become
available by June 1980 (para. 2.11), this would allow a full year's safety
factor between the availability of fresh water in the Geum River at Ganggyeong
and the demand for this water to serve the new irrigation areas. Full water
supply from the Geum would not be required until the 1982 rice season.
Beginning with the first crop grown under project conditions, farmers would
achieve the projected yield levels over four years. The project would reach
full development in 1986.
7.07      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting costs and benefits over a 50-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return for the project is 12% (Table 7.3), which appears to be
marginal for Korea.

Economic Rate of Return = 12%
7.08      On purely economic grounds the foregoing estimate understates
the acceptability of the project for several reasons. First, with the
further maturing of the economy and the consequent increase in capital
intensity, the opportunity cost of capital could be expected to decline
over the long term. Secondly, no attempt was made to quantify the benefits
from the 1,490 ha which would receive a more assured water supply (para.
7.02). Thirdly, the project area has been sized to provide an assured water
supply in nine years out of ten (para. 3.14), and expected benefits have been
estimated accordingly. In practice, as observed in Korea and other countries
in the region, farmers outside the 12,300 ha area on which the water supply
requirements were based (Table 3.6) would use the extra water available in
average and wet years to enlarge the area under irrigation. Thus the area
actually benefitting from the project is likely to be significantly more than
12,300 ha in most years.
7.09      On social grounds, the evaluation of agricultural projects in
Korea should be carried out within the Government's policy framework which
emphasizes income distribution. Specifically, the Government's explicit
policy is to monitor and alleviate growing disparities between rural and
urban incomes and to discourage migration to the cities. It is esti-
mated that roughly 40% of the project's intended beneficiaries have farms
less than 0.5 ha in size, compared to a national average of 0.9 ha, and
per capita incomes below the 1977 rural poverty level of US$200 (para. 6.13).



- 51 -
By keeping income growth in the project area roughly in line with that in
the rest of the economy, the project would give beneficiaries a greater
incentive to remain in the rural sector. The project would therefore help
meet the Government's income distribution objective by raising rural incomes
through increased agricultural productivity, and would also contribute to the
objective of maintaining food grain self-sufficiency.
7.10      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity analysis was used to determine
which variables would be most crucial to the success of the project. These
variables would be the focus of attention for project management and super-
vision missions in the course of project implementation.
(a) Yields. The economic rate of return is most sensitive to the
assumptions made about future rice yields. If the incremental
yield at full development is only 200 kg/ha (about 15%) less than
the expected value, the rate of return would be 10%. On the
other hand, if the incremental rice yield is 200 kg/ha more than
the expected value, the rate of return would be 13%.
(b) Prices. A 20% increase in the economic farm-gate price of rice
would raise the rate of return to 15%.
(c) Construction Costs. A 20% increase in construction costs would
reduce the rate of return to 10%. However, the base cost estimate
has been checked against recent bid prices for similar work in the
Kumgang and Yong San Gang I projects, and 15% has been added for
physical contingencies, so that the actual cost is unlikely to
exceed the estimate by as much as 20%.
(d) Delay in Benefits. The rate of return is moderately sensitive to
the timing of benefits. If full benefits are delayed two years due
to a delay in construction of the Daecheong dam, the rate of return
would be 10%. However, to minimize this possibility, the existing
irrigated areas, which could continue to be served by gravity from
the Tabjeong reservoir, would be implemented first and a one-year
safety factor has been included in the scheduled completion dates
for the new areas (para. 7.06).
(e) Selection of Areas. The 10,800 ha project area for which benefits
have been estimated may be broken down into three categories -
improved irrigation (3,710 ha), irrigation of existing rainfed and
partially irrigated paddy land (5,310 ha) and conversion of upland
and forest to irrigated paddy (1,780 ha). It is possible to isolate
the incremental net value of production from each area, which is
roughly US$660/ha at full development for improved and new irriga-
tion of paddy land, and US$930/ha for conversion of upland and
forest. Because of the physical layout of the project it is not
possible to fully allocate project costs between areas, but a rough
allocation has been made to ensure that all areas would be increment-
ally justified. Costs for the main irrigation and drainage systems,
and on-farm development works were separated between the new and
improved areas. Within the new areas, however, such an allocation



- 52 -
between paddy land and upland/forest is not possible, since these
areas are largely interspersed and the conveyance system must pass
through one to reach the other. It is also impossible to allocate
precisely the cost of the pumping stations, since with the project
they would serve both new and improved irrigated areas, including
the 1,490 ha of improved water supply for which benefits have not
been estimated. Therefore, two alternative ways of allocating
this cost were tested. In Case I, the entire cost of the pumping
stations was allocated to the new areas, on the grounds that the
existing areas could continue to be served by gravity if the new
areas were not built. In Case II, the cost of the pumping stations
was prorated according to the area actually served by pumping with
the project. The results, presented in Table 7.4, show that the
two separate parts of the project area would be acceptable if
considered individually.

(%)
Case I              Case II
Existing irrigation (3,710 ha)                     15                   12
New irrigation (7,090 ha)                          11                   12
7.11      Sunk Costs.  Since the Government has already taken the decision to
build the Daecheong dam (para. 1.04 and 2.10-2.11), the costs of the dam
should be considered as "sunk costs" for evaluating the proposed project, and
should be excluded in arriving at the investment decision. Furthermore,
there is not sufficient information available to make a proper economic
analysis including Daecheong dam. However, since the dam would also provide
benefits from municipal and industrial water supply, flood control and power,
and the additional irrigated area in the project area due to the dam is only
5,160 ha compared to a total irrigable area of 66,300 ha, the rate of return
would not be expected to decrease significantly if a proper allocation were
possible.
7.12      Risks.  Given ADC's experience with projects of similar scope and
complexity, no organization or management problems are expected. Rapid
inflation in 1973 and 1974 led to sizable cost overruns on projects initiated
in the early 1970s. However, experience with actual costs for similar work has
been taken into account in estimating the costs of the proposed project,
inflation is now being brought under control, and larger provisions for price
increases have been made for this project and other projects recently financed
by the Bank. As a result, the risk of cost overruns has been reduced.



- 53 -
7.13      Perhaps the largest element of risk concerns the t'mely availa-
bility of adequate water supplies from the Daecheong dam. This has been
allowed for in the design of the project by scheduling the completion of
newly irrigated areas at least one year after the scheduled completion of the
dam (para. 7.06), and by an assurance that the Government would guarantee
sufficient releases from the dam to keep the saltwater interface downstream
of Ganggyeong, as well as to satisfy irrigation requirements (para. 3.16).
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      Assurances were obtained during negotiations on the following main
points:
(a) by June 1978 ADC would complete the study of a low-lift pumping
alternative for supplying irrigation water to the Duribong and
Bonghwa pumping stations, and would discuss its findings with the
Bank before preparing final designs for those pumping stations
(para. 3.03);
(b) the Government would guarantee releases from the Daecheong dam
sufficient to provide an adequate maintenance flow in the Geum
River at the constriction just below Ganggyeong, plus 30 cu m/sec
required in June for irrigating 12,200 ha in the Kumgang Project
and 5,000 ha in the lower parts of the Nonsan FLIA area (para. 3.16);
(c) ADC would submit operating rules for the Tabjeong reservoir to
the Bank for review and comment by December 1982 (para. 3.17);
(d) by February 1, 1978, ADC would set up a separate office for the
project under a project manager whose qualifications and experience
are acceptable to the Bank, and the office would be operating at
Nonsan by July 1, 1978 (para. 4.02);
(e) by December 1979, ADC would submit to the Bank for review and
comment, a detailed plan for the operation and maintenance of the
project (para. 4.14); and
(f) the Government would make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for
the Daecheong and Tabjeong dams to be periodically inspected to
ensure their safety, and would submit such arrangements to the Bank
for review by June 1979 (para. 4.15).
8.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$36 million for a period of 17 years including 4 years of
grace to the Agricultural Development Corporation with the guarantee of the
Republic of Korea.

/a  From Table 2.2 - 55% of the total farm  area is inside the project area and 45% is outside.
/b  From Working Paper C7.  May not exactly equal ratio of cropped area to land area in table due to rounding of area figures.
/c  Based on Annex 2, Table 4.
Id  Based on a maximum of 36 man-days/month of family labor on the 0.25 ha farm model, 40 man-days/month on the 0.7 ha model and 54 man-days/
month on the 1.7 ha model.  Based on field observations, it is further assumed that half the family labor supply is employed inside the
project area and half outside, and that peak season tasks in June (barley harvest and rice transplanting) and October (rice harvest and
cultivation for barley) must be finished within two weeks.
/e  Based on surveys in the field, 70% of agricultural income is assumed to come from inside the project area at present.  The amount is
assumed to remain the same for the future.
/f  58% of present farm household income comes from agricultural income for farms less than 0.5 ha, 791 for farms between 0.5 and 1.0 ha,
and 90% for farms over I ha, based on national averages in NAF, Report on the Results of Farm Household Economy Survev. 1976, Table 7-1,
p. 69.  The amount is assumed to remain the same for the future.
1   General taxes are 1.2% of agricultural income for farms less than 0.5 ha, 1.3% for farms between 0.5 and 1.0 ha and 2.2% for farms over
1.0 ha, based on national averages, ibid.
/h  Present water charges are W 40,000/ha for 0&M and W 15,000/ha for capital cost recovery, on 34% of the area to be covered by the project.
Future water charges would be W 75,000/ha for 0&M and W 42,000/ha for capital cost recovery (301 of cost @ 3.5Z interest p.a. for 35 years,
including a five-year grace period), for the entire area to be covered by the project.
