Memorandum of the President                                             I
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A RURAL ROADS-PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Tunisia for $51.5 million equivalent to help finance a
Rural Roads Project. The project is in conformity with the Country Assistance Strategy
discussed by the Board on May 11, 1993 and aims to strengthen Tunisia's institutions in
charge of road maintenance and network management, to alleviate rural poverty and to
improve access to rural areas. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including a five-year grace period.
2.    Background and Strategy. Over the past five years, Tunisia - a medium size
country with limited natural resourees - enjoyed fair growth with low inflation rates. From
1989 to 1993, annual GDP growth averaged five percent. Meanwhile, current account and
budget deficits have been brought down to low levels. The ongoing development strategy
intends to consolidate the steps already undertaken in the pace of privatization,
decentralization and poverty alleviation.
3.   Direction Generale des Ponts et Chaussees (DGPC - General Directorate of Bridges
and Roads), the implementing institution, under the Ministry of Equipment and Housing
(MEH), was created by decree dated July 22, 1988 to take on management of the road
network. Its main responsibilities relate to conception and implementation of the national
road policy from construction to maintenance.
4.    Public sector restructuring. The legal ownership status of local rural roads is
often not explicitly defined. No more than 2,500 kon of the about 10,000 kn of roads built
under previous rural road development programs have been classified. Responsibilities for
maintenance of the remaining roads have not been explicitly assigned. The Government
decided in 1989 to allocate a budget (art 60-12 of the Finance Law) to the Ministry of
Equipment for maintaining about 5,500 km of unclassified roads built to engineering
standards. The remaining 2,000 km, as well as other local rural roads, are implicitly
included in assets of the Regional Councils (RCs), which have however no maintenance
budget for them. The Government has confirmed in a Sector Policy Letter that the public
sector reforns wil aim at decentralizing rural roads management to RCs, without develop-
ing new road management entities.
5.    Budgetary reforms. The way funding is organized may not fully promote
budgetary discipline, accountability and transparency. The current budget classification is
disconnected from the new analytical accounting under pilot implementation. For force



2                                                     Memorandum of the President
account works, this makes it difficult to easily compare actual v/s planned expenditures
or to assess how much was actually spent on a particular road and what particular
maintenance tasks were actually carried out. Also the diversity of funding sources does not
favor separ-ion of maintenance expenditures from investments. Special funds transferred
to the RCs are often earmarked for consumables, thus diverting force account teams from
maintenance to lesser priceity construction tasks. The Government has confirmed in the
Sector Policy Letter that budgetwy reforms will aim at establishing a link between budgets
and road classification, strengthening budgetary discipline, accountability and
transparency, and improving the balance between mnaintenance and investment.
6.    Private sector development. All road maintenance activities are currently carried
out by force account, using a rather large equipment fleet spread among the 23 DREHs.
There are documented cases where rigidities in the organization of force account works
have led to few productive hours per work day. The quality of works is reduced because
quality control functions are carried out by the staff in charge of their execution. The
capacity of the equipment fleet is under-used not only because of its physical scattering,
but also because equipment maintenance is inefficiently carried out and generates long
periods of equipment unavailability. TMis situation is anachronistic, as the full potential of
thc domestic contracting industry is currently untapped in the road subsector. The
Government has cofirnned in the Sector Policy Letter that pnvate sector development will
aim at targeting specific road maintenance tasks for execution by contract.
7.    Rural road standards. The methodology used to economically justify mrual roads
upgrading works looks at the benefits of a combination of both agricultural and road
investments in a given zone of influence. As the agricultural potential of these zones is
large, so are the benefits, and this has permitted the development of unnecessarily costly
construction standards. Furthermore, the construction standards reflect the bias Tunisia has
built over time against gravel roads. Gravel pavements are considered only as stopgap
measures while the road is supposed to shift rapidly from a local feeder function to a
connecting one. Thus gravel roads are overdesigned on purpose to facilitate a prompt later
paving. It is clear that Tunisia, like numerous countries, has to develop under strict
budgetary constraints. Hence, choices have to be made at different levels and stages to
provide maximum benefits for the minimum life-cycle cost. The Government has
confirmed in the Sector Policy Letter that reforms on rural road standards will aim at
minimizing life-cycle costs by making optimum use of gravel road techniques.
8.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. Besides the wealth of experience acquired in
recent years on how to best improve road management that it would bring to the project,
the Bank can be a powerful catalyst in the institutional reform process. The Bank would
be able to promote the needed changes by exposing the rationale behind them and assisting
in overcoming the political gridlock that so often characterizes decentralization of
management responsibilities and other institutional reforms.

9.    Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. In the past, there have been
diffities with parallel agticultural schemes. The current project does not include a Bank-
funded agricultural component, as in the First Rural Roads Project (Third Highway
Project; Ln 1601-Tun), nor does it require that the Governent fimance agricultural
investments in addition to those already planned, as in the Second Rural Roads Project
(Fifth Highway Project; Ln 2108-Tun). Rather, it was designed to complement
Government agricultural investnents that have either been initiated, completed or planned
under the ona .ing Eighth Plan. The public sector investments assumed in the economic
evaluation are thus those that are already written into the Governnent's public investnent
program. The private sector investments assumed i the analysis represent the narket-
based response concluded, based on past experience, to be generated by the combination
of committed Government investments, sectoral incentive schemes and the project's road
improvement works.
10. In addition, the Project Completion Report of the Fifth Highway Project found the
projet only party sustinable because road maintenance was deficient and monitoring of
agriculual investmes was weak. The proposed project addresses the mainctnance issue
directly, is much simpler, and has improved monitoring mechanisms.
11.   Objectivs In line with the Bank's Development saegy for the 1990's in Tunisia,
the project objectives are public sector restmcturing, budgetary reforms, private sector
development, the development of improved road standards, the reduction of disparities
tween urban and rural areas, the reduction of rural to urban migration, and improving
the delivery of social services to poorer population. These objectives will be realized
through improving maintnance of nuWal roads, particularly unpaved ones; decentralizing
road management responsibilities to local govermnents, without developing new entities;
establishing a link between budgets and road classification; strengthning budgetary
disciline, transparency and accountability; targeting specific road maintenance tasks for
execution by contract to improve efficiency and to create new development opportuties
for a dynamic private sector; and finally minimizing life-cycle costs by making optimum
use of gravel road techniques.
12. Project Description. The proposed project includes:
(a)   the preparation and initial implementation of an institutional reform
program (3 % of cost);
(b)   the periodic rehabilitation of approximately 300 km of gravel roads in a
pilot program to be carried out by contract in ten Govemorates (9% of
cost); and
(c)   the upgrading of about 715 km of priority rural roads to appropriate stan-
dards (88% of cost).

13.   Project Implementation. The Borrower will be the Republic of Tunisia. The
implementing agency will be DGPC.
14. An Inemnninisterial Working Group (IWG), set up by decision of MEH to handle
institutional issues, will prepare an Institutional Action Plan detailing the specific actions
and measures for the implementation of the Sector Policy Letter.
15.   The project will include a kick-off workshop before project effectiveness. The
workshop will bring together participants from DGPC and its Regional Directorates
(DREHs), and finalize the baseline values for the inpact indicators and other details of
project implementation procedures. Also, a mid-term review workshop will be held, the
mandate of which will include the following reviews:
(a)   the implementation progress, the implementation schedule and the evolution
of indicators;
(b)   the implementation progress under the Institutional Action Plan;
(c)   proposed revisions to the impact indicators;
(d). the actual commitments and the schedule of prospective future commit-
ments and disbursements;
(e)   the actal p  ement agements and the schedule of prospective future
procurement arrangements; and
(f)  the acual and planned implementtion of public agricultural investments in
tX rural roe Is' zone of influence.
16.   SustainabDity. The project will make the development of the roads network
management much more sustainable by:
(a)   setting up an instional framework to classify rural roads, prioritize road
works and road maintenance;
(b)   defining the optimal balance between constuction and maintenance;
(c)   targeting specific mmaienane works to be carried out by contract, and
creating a suitable environment for the development of a dynamic private
sector;
(d)              road budgets;
(e) ensuring that roads are built and steadily maintained to the appropriate
standard, instead of going through the current cycle of improvement-
deterioration-improvement; and
(t)   ensuring that the limited financing available for rural roads covers the
priority needs identified by the local community and maximies the number
of beneficiaries.



Memorandum of the President                                              s
17.   Agreed Actions. The Government has sent:
(a)   a revised decision of the Minister of Equipment and Habitat setting up the
Intenninisterial Working Group (IWG) on sector institutional reforms;
(b)   the signed Sector Policy Letter; and
(c)   a signed consulting services contract for technical assistance to the IWG.
18.   Furthermore, asuances have been obtained from the Government on the following
actions:
(a)   Instiionol Action Plan
(i)   the IWG shall prepare and submit the Institutional Action Plan to
the Bank for its review and approval not later than March 31, 1996;
(ii)  promptly thereafter, the Govermnent shall approve the Institutional
Action Plan as agreed with the Bank; and
(iii) the Goverrnent shall carry out the Institutional Action Plan and
take all actions necessary to ensure its effectiveness, as follows:
a.    not later th  June 30, 1998, implement a significant portion
of the Institutional Action Plan; and
b.    not later than December 31, 2001, implement the
Institutional Action Plan in its entirety;
(b)   for each mral road proposed to be upgraded under the Project, the DGPC
shall:
(i)   prepare and submit for the Bank's review and approval before the
award of the contract for works, a standard assessment
questionnaire identifying any potential adverse environmental
effects to be produced by the proposed works; and
(ii)  follow mitigation guidelines satisfactory to the Bank and the
Tuisian Agence Nationale pour la Protection de l'Environnement
to screen and mitigate any such adverse environmental effects;
(c)   in the event a portion of land adjacent to the nural road is required to be
expropriated to upgrade a road under the Project, each affected person shall
be provided with compensation for said portion of land in accordance with
gtudelines which conform to the Bank's policy thereon;
(d)   a mid-term review shall be carried out with the IWG and the DGPC not
later than October 31, 1998.
19.   Enviroumental Inpact. As road works will be limited to the improvement and
maintenance of existing roads with no alignment change, no potentially serious adverse
envionmenal impacts are expected. The project, in fact, has enviromunental benefits, e.g.,
environment-conscious institutional improvements, improved safety and accessibility, and
reduced soil erosion. Special attention will be paid to providing adequate draiage and
ensuring slope stability. A questionnaire aimed at identifying any potential adverse



6                                                     Menmrandum of the President
environmental effect will be completed for each individual road section before the
corresponding road works are approved by the Bank (at the time the bidding documents
for the annual packages of road upgrading works ar submitted to the Bank for approval).
No specific issue has been identified so far and there will be no resettlement of people.
The project includes a provision for expropriations, to be financed exclusively by the
Government, because the upgrading of some roads may necessitate the expropriation of
narrow strips of land (about two meters on each side of the road). The Legal Agreement
spells out that such expropriation will be accompanied by approprate compensation
measures. In accordance with established guidelines, the pro.ect is rated B.
20. Project Benefits. The main benefits will involve savings in road twansport costs and
improved access to remote ural areas, which will translate into lower consumer prices,
higher farm gate prices for agricultural produce and reduction in rural poverty and better
access to social services such as schools and hospitals. The provision of agricultural
extension services will also be facilitated, with a complementary impact on agricultural
production. Implementation of the project's sector institutional reforms will clarify
classification and ownership of local access roads as assets of local govermment. FinaUy,
a shift toward road manteance works by contract should alleviate the financial impact of
maintenance works on budgetary resources.
21. Project Risks. Risk's include both under-fuixlng of the parallel public agricultural
investments that are essential for the benefits to materialize and inadequate sector
institutional reforms. The project mitigates the first risk through a declared commitment
from the Government guaranteeing a steady follow-up on agricultural infrastrucure
investme and extension work in the project roads' zones of influence. Progress on the
actual and planned implementation of public agricultural investments in the roads' zone
of influence will be monitored durig the mid-term review. The second risk is mitigated
through the Letter of Sector Strategy, the signature of which is a condition of Board
presentation.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
