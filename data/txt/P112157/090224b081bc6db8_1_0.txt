                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in its second phase of achieving its development objectives (PDO). The original objective was to increase domestic food production and reduce the loss of livestock to
                         help at least 28,000 poorest households in a timely manner to reduce the negative impact of high and volatile food prices. The project was successfully implemented by FAO and its
                         total amount of US$5 million was fully disbursed in March 2009. The first phase had fully achieved its emergency objectives of providing inputs to 94,000 households (surpassing the

                         target of 55,000 households initially planned to be covered by the project).

                         Overall the second phase of the project with the additional financing has also been successful as most of PDO indicators have been achieved and even surpassed in some cases, but
                         the progress on the fertilizer network establishment with a revolving fund has been limited due to delay in setting it up. Consequently, the progress towards achieving the PDO is
                         moderately satisfactory.

                         The implementation of Component D Community Production Groups (CPGs) has been successful with a total of 1,480 CPGs established, including 62 new wheat production groups
                         established in 2013 and 140 other CPGs in 2012 out of revolving seed/livestock funds with a total of 25,012 beneficiaries of which about 75% are women. For all crop CPGs that
                         have completed their activities, seed has been returned in the required quantities, properly stored and processed. Average net income received by CPG members in 2012 for wheat
                         production was about 2,510 TJS, barley production 2,396 TJS, potato production 2,261 TJS, alfalfa production 1,657 TJS and vegetables production 1,899 TJS. Crop yields in CPGs
                         have been usually higher than the average yields in the country. For example, in 2012, average wheat yield was about 4.7 tons per hectare compared to regional average yield of 2.8
                         tons per hectare; corn - 5 tons per hectare compared to 3.9 tons per hectare; and potato yields reached 26.2tons/ha compared to 17,7 tons/ha average in the region.

                         The vaccination program covering 2,901,499 million poultry was completed on time in Khatlon and Sogd. The project did not reach agreement with the National Association of
                         Veterinarians on carrying out vaccination of additional number of birds.

                         With respect to Component E (Agro Input Supply Market Development), despite of initial delays in its implementation, some progress has been achieved. Fertilizer (1,860 t) was
                         distributed to 12 contracted agro-dealers in July 2012, however only 1,170 t (62.9% of the total amount) have been sold on the market by April 2013 and the amount of 3,604,499 TJS
                         received from sales was deposited on the revolving fertilizers fund account. The PMU is currently working on setting up the structure that would allow the established network to
                         continue activities carried out under this component and 12 selected agri-dealers under the umbrella of Revolving Fertilizer Fund. The structure of the Public Utility Entity “Center of
                         Agricultural Producers Support? is proposed to be established under the Khatlon oblast Khukumat and Oblast level Department of Agriculture. The proposed structure will not only
                         accommodate the Revolving Fertilizers Fund, but also serve as an umbrella organization for the District level Community Seed Funds. At this stage it would be impossible to register
                         these organizations as public organizations as current legislation does not allow transfer of assets owned by the State (equipment, fertilizers) to public organizations, also overall
                         arrangement for overseeing the work and funds flow of this entity would be challenging and not sustainable. It is expected that this activity will be taken over by the proposed
                         agriculture competitiveness project.
