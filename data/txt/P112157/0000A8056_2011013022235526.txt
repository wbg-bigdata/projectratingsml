                         The objectives of the project are: (i) to increase domestic food production and reduce the loss of livestock to help at least 55,000 poorest households; (ii) to
                         improve the ability of poor households to deal with seed shortages due to poor crops; and (iii) to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food
                         production and diversification.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         With the reallocation, both components A (Support for Agricultural Inputs) and Component C (Project Management) implemented by FAO have been discontinued, given that FAO
                         had completed its emergency interventions by providing 94,000 families (against a target of 55,000 households) with quality wheat, potato, corn and alfalfa seeds and mineral
                         fertilizer. Consequently, the Project Management Unit will now implement all activities under the Project.

                         A new activity­setting up a temporary Revolving Fund for fertilizer imports has been introduced to component E (Agro-Input Supply Market Development) to help private commercial
                         farmers cope with the collapse of the existing fertilizer supply chain.
