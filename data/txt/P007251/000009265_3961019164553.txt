IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
GUYANA
SECOND STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT (CR. NO. 2168 GUA
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Structural
Adjustment Credit in Guyana, for which an IDA Credit (No. 2168 GUA) in the amount of SDR
59.8 million was approved on June 28, 1990 and made effective on August 29, 1990. The credit
was amended five times to reflect increases from IDA reflows and the Gulf Assistance Program.
The dates and amounts of the amending agreements were December 4, 1990 (No. 2168-2 GUA;
IDA reflows for SDR 3.1 million); June 14, 1991 (No. 2168-3 GUA; Gulf Assistance for SDR
13.2 million); February 7, 1992 (No. 2168-4 GUA; IDA reflows for SDR 2.4 million); June 21,
1993 (No. 2168-5 GUA; IDA reflows for SDR 2.53 million); and June 7, 1994 (No. 2168-6
GUA; IDA reflows for SDR 1.99 million).
The credit was closed on December 31, 1994, as compared with the original closing date
of December 22, 1993. The first tranche, released upon effectiveness, was fully disbursed by
September 1990; subsequent tranches were released in June 1991 and November 1993. The last
amendment (No. 2168-6 GUA), with the closing date of June 7, 1995, was fully disbursed on
August 8, 1994. Co-financing for the project was provided by the Caribbean Development Bank
(US$42 million) and Germany (US$6 million).
This ICR was prepared by Sawai Boonma, Country Officer, and reviewed by Philippe
Nouvel, Chief, Country Operations Division 2, and Robert Crown, Projects Advisor,
Department III of the Latin American and the Caribbean Region. The borrower contributed to
the preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project which is included as
Appendix A of the ICR.

SECOND STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
(Credit No. 21 68-GUA)
GUYANA
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    By 1988, Guyana's economy was in dire straights. As a result of a long period of state
intervention, mismanagement, and public sector domination, the economy had declined by about
one-third in over a decade. Exports of sugar, bauxite and rice - the major export commodities -
had sharply fallen. The private sector had increasingly turned into a parallel economy. The
public sector deficit had become unsustainable; inflation had intensified; and Guyana stopped
servicing its external debt, cutting off its access to external finance. A crisis ensued. In
response, the Government of Guyana (GOG) launched in 1988 a comprehensive Economic
Recovery Program (ERP), with the main objectives of (i) restoring economic growth over the
medium term; (ii) eliminating internal and external imbalances; (iii) incorporating the parallel
economy into the official economy; and (iv) normalizing Guyana's financial relations with
external creditors. This was undertaken with support of the international donor community. In
the process, arrears to multilateral lenders were cleared enabling Guyana to receive support from
international financial institutions (IFIs) while a considerable amount-of debt to bilateral
creditors was rescheduled or written off.
Program Design and Objectives
2.    An IDA's Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) was part of the donor community's
support for the ERP. To achieve the objectives of the ERP, the SAC supported a comprehensive
policy adjustments package designed jointly by the GOG and the donor community to address
problems particular to Guyana, which had followed a development model of "cooperative
socialism". The package was based on a strategy that would fundamentally change Guyana from
a socialist economy to a market one, to be achieved through reforms in (i) incentive framework,
including liberalization of domestic pricing and trade policy, to improve climate for private
investment; (ii) publicfinances, including streamlining of the civil service, increasing net
transfers from the public enterprises to the government, rationalizing investment programs of
public enterprises, and privatizing selected public enterprises, to help bring the public sector
operations into viable balance; and (iii) public sector investment program, to achieve consistency
between government investment and macroeconomic framework and the country's
implementation capacity. The SAC was to be disbursed in three tranches, over a three-year
period 1990-92, with each tranche tied to progress in specific areas of reforms.
ii



Implementation Experiences and Results
3.    Despite severe adversities created by unusually heavy rains and floods in 1990, which
badly affected major industries and the population, the GOG persevered and kept the ERP on
track. Reforms required under the SAC in 1990-91 were carried out. As a result, the first and
second tranches were disbursed as scheduled. Release of the third tranche, however, was delayed
for about a year. Four sets of conditions were required for the release of that tranche. The main
problem stemmed from the fact that three of these depended on actions to be carried out with
assistance of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The one that caused the delay
pertained to the levels of electricity tariff, whose increases were to depend on the outcome of two
studies financed by the IDB. These studies took much longer to complete than anticipated. They
also raised significant analytical concerns, which led to difficulties in reaching agreement with
the management of the Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC). It took almost a year to iron out
the difficulties and reach the agreement.
4.    The SAC played a significant role in support of the ERP. Reforms were carried out in a
timely manner. Financial assistance from major donors resumed as arrears were cleared. By
1991, the positive impact of the ERP started to show. Following three years of decline, real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 6% in 1991, and accelerated to 7.8% in 1992 and 8.2% in
1993. Growth was relatively broad-based. First, traditional sectors such as sugar and rice
recovered from the long decline. Second, spurred largely by foreign investment, large-scale gold
mining and timber harvesting and processing grew tremendously. Third, some private sector
activities, such as small-scale mining and trading that had taken place in the parallel economy,
again rejoined the formal sector. At the same time, internal and external imbalances were
significantly reduced. The current account deficit of the public sector declined from about 19%
of GDP in 1989 to just over 4% in 1993. The balance of payments deficit also significantly
declined and was more than covered by large capital inflows. As a result, by the end of 1993
international reserves had increased to US$246 million or over nine months of import equivalent,
from US$27 million in 1990.
5.    Although the SAC ended in 1993, except for the extension of the closing date to 1994 to
enable Guyana to receive the IDA reflows during the latter year, the GOG has continued to
deepen the reforms and is supported by the International Monetary Fund's Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF). The economy continued to perform well in 1994 with GDP growth
estimated at 8.8%. Major issues, however, have emerged and cast doubt as to whether good
performance can be sustained. First, despite some write-offs and rescheduling, Guyana's
external debt stock remains extremely heavy, at close to four times GDP. Debt to some bilateral
creditors has remained in arrears. Analyses indicate that Guyana cannot service all of its debt
and still have sufficient resources for other vital expenditures. A substantial debt stock reduction
is required. Second, despite major efforts at rehabilitation, the economic and social infrastructure
has not been brought back to full service. Inadequate infrastructure-is constraining economic
activities. Third, due mainly to low pay, the GOG has found it difficult to retain and recruit
skilled personnel. Shortages of technical and managerial personnel in the public sector are acute.
iii



This results in very low implementation of the public sector investment program and in generally
slow delivery of public services. Fourth, despite recovery, poverty remains widespread as some
40% of the population is estimated to fall below the poverty line. Evidence indicates that recent
rapid growth has benefited the poor, particularly workers in the major booming industries -
sugar, rice, gold mining and forestry. The challenge for the GOG, which is already suffering
from skill shortages, is to find a development strategy that will not only sustain growth but also
ensure that all social and ethnic groups continue to benefit equitably.
6.    The present Government is committed to carry out further adjustments as necessary and
the donor community is committed to support it. Even in case of the opposition winning the
elections in 1997, the risk of program reversal is minimal because it was the opposition that
initiated the ERP in the first place. For these reasons, the program should be sustainable.
7.    Overall performance of both IDA and the borrower is rated as satisfactory. The former
appropriately identified, prepared, appraised, and supervised the program, while the latter fully
participated in the necessary work and had continued to express a strong sense of ownership.
The change of government did not affect the program in any essential way.
Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
8.    The SAC contributed significantly to Guyana's initial economic recovery. The
conceptual design and implementation of this SAC were both challenging and risky. The
conditions attached to tranche releases called for far-reaching reforms fundamentally different
from the policies pursued over the previous two decades; these could have severe socio-political
consequences. The GOG, however, whole-heartedly adopted the reforms and implemented them
in a timely fashion. Guyana's heavy external debt burden and serious constraints in human
capital and infrastructure could put in doubt the recent substantial achievements. With GOG's
continued commitment toward reforms and donors' expressed support, the risk of policy reversal
is minimal and the achievements would likely be sustained. For these reasons, the SAC should
be regarded as helping launch the sustainable economic recovery. Overall, these are important
findings and lessons:
a)  Commitments to thorough reforms emphasizing macro-economic stabilization and
market-orientation can play a significant role in the economic turnaround.
b)  Revenue enhancement is at least as important to restoring fiscal soundness as
reductions in real expenditures and needs to be one of the earliest elements attended
to in any adjustment program.
c)  Participants in the parallel economy who are generally averse to government
regulations and taxation requirements will rejoin the official economy in response
to a well designed adjustment appropriately balancing the incentive and revenue
considerations.
iv



d)   Tranche release conditions should be geared to successful implementation of major
policy changes. If studies are needed to prepare policy decisions, they should be
carefully timed, and if financed by other donors, well coordinated.
e)  It is important that in parallel to an adjustment program, an efficient and effective
social impact alleviation program be put in place early, carefully identifying groups
most likely to be affected.
f)   The ability of the public sector to implement effectively its development programs
may be hampered by the sharp reductions in real wages in the public sector, which
make it difficult to retain skilled technicians and managers, compromising the
sustainability of otherwise promising institutions to reform. A short-period SAC
can lead to recovery. But sustaining growth requires continued deepening reforms
for a longer period. Subsequent operations may be needed to ensure sustainability.
g)   To ensure sustainability of a program involving debt reduction work-out, it is
important that all important creditors be fully associated. In this case, Guyana has
to continue to work toward finalization of agreements with some bilateral creditors.

PART I: PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Introduction
Background
1.    By 1988, Guyana's economy had been in a state of decline for over a decade. The
development model of "co-operative socialism" pursued after independence in 1966 had led the
state to dominate the economy, through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and direct control. Over
time, the private sector had increasingly joined the parallel economy. Traditional exports of
bauxite, sugar and rice had fallen sharply, causing real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to decline
by about one-third. The deficit in the public sector operations became unsustainable and
inflation intensified. Repeated efforts to adjust the economy during the 1980s did not succeed.
Guyana's overwhelming debt was in arrears resulting in cutting off of assistance by international
financial institutions (IFIs) and other donors.
2.   In 1988, the Government of Guyana (GOG) launched comprehensive economic reforms
under an Economic Recovery Program (ERP). The main objectives of the ERP were to (i)
restore economic growth over the medium term; (ii) eliminate internal and external imbalances,
(iii) incorporate the parallel economy into the official economy; and (iv) normalize Guyana's
financial relations with external creditors. The ERP was undertaken with support of the
international donor community, under the sponsorship of the Support Group for Guyana led by
Canada. In the process, bridge financing was arranged to clear arrears to multilateral lendeis,
enabling Guyana to again receive support from them. A debt work-out with the Paris Club was
arranged whereby some debt was written off while the remainder was rescheduled. Most ol thc
arrears to commercial lenders were cleared, using a grant from the IDA debt reduction facility.
Design of the Structural Adjustment Credit
3.    An IDA's Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) was part of the donor community's
support for the ERP. It was to finance critical imports needed for restoring economic growth,
which would lead to higher standards of living of the population. In policy terms, the SAC
would support a comprehensive policy adjustment package designed jointly by the GOG and the
donor community to address problems particular to Guyana whose development model, as stat;d
above, had been "cooperative socialism". The package was based on a strategy that would
fundamentally change Guyana from a socialist economy to a market one. Toward that end, the
GOG and IDA agreed that the SAC would comprise the following components:
a)   The incentive ftamework. Liberalize domestic pricing and trade policy to improve
private sector investment climate, within the context of a sound macroeconomic
framework.
I



b)  Public sectorfinances. Streamline the civil service, eliminate central government
transfers to public enterprises, increase transfers from public enterprises to the
central government, and divest selected public enterprises.
c) The public sector investment program (PSIP). Formulate a realistic PSIP consistent
with the macroeconomic framework and with the country's implementation capacity.
(These components are detailed in a policy matrix annexed as Appendix B.)
4.    The SAC was appraised in May 1989 and approved by the Board on June 28, 1990. The
Credit Agreement was signed on July 13, 1990 and became effective on August 29, 1990 with a
closing date of December 22, 1993. This was later extended to December 31, 1994.1 The initial
Credit Agreement of SDR 59.8 million, SDR 57.2 million original and SDR 2.6 million reflows,
(US$78 million equivalent) was amended five times to reflect increases from IDA reflows and
the Gulf Assistance Program. The dates and amounts of the amending agreements were
December 4, 1990 (SDR 3.2 million); June 14, 1991 (SDR 13.2 million); February 7, 1992 (SDR
2.4 million); June 21, 1993 (SDR 2.53 million); and June 7, 1994 (SDR 1.99 million). As a
result, the Credit total became SDR 83.02 million.
5.    The SAC was to be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche of SDR 38.34 million
was disbursed on effectiveness in September 1990, followed by the disbursement of a second
tranche of SDR 11.5 million in June 1991. SDR 18.7 million from the first three amendments to
the Credit was also disbursed in 1991, leaving a balance of SDR 14.48 million to be disbursed.
This was scheduled for release on December 31, 1992 but due to one outstanding condition
(electric power tariffs) was delayed until November 1993.
6.    The SAC was co-financed by Germany (US$6 million) and the Caribbean Development
Bank (US$42 million), which fully disbursed their loans in 1990 and 1992, respectively.
B. Implementation Experiences and Results
Effectiveness and Second Tranche Compliance
7.    Unusually heavy rains for five months in 1990 created extensive floods that adversely
affected bauxite, sugar and rice production. There were also extensive breaches in the protective
coastal seawall directly affecting the population. Despite these adversities, the GOG
demonstrated its resolve to keep the ERP on track by implementing essentially all major reforms
required to restore economic growth and achieve objectives of the ERP; it also fully serviced it
debt to the IFIs. As a result, the first and second tranches of the SAC were released as scheduled
in September 1990 and June 1991, respectively.
This was to allow the Credit to be amended for the fifth time in June 1994, enabling Guyana to receive the IDA
reflows of SDR 1.99 million.
2



Third Tranche Compliance                    ' 
8.    The third tranche was planned for disbursement on December 31, 1992, but was delayed
until November 1993. Four sets of conditions were required for the release of the third tranche.
9.    First, a rice export study was designed to lay a foundation for privatization of rice mills; it
covered issues of efficiency, access to credit, extension services, and improvement of regulatory
framework with respect to private sector rice export. The GOG committed itself to privatize all
state-run rice mills prior to 1992 and all were privatized except two mills installed recently under
a grant from Japan which objected to selling these mills to the private sector.
10.   Second, two studies on consumption tax were completed by the fall of 1991 and provided
a basis for subsequent tax reforms; they called for simplification of the tax system; extension of
the base to services; adoption of a five level common external tariff (CET); a drastic reduction of
exemptions for consumption tax and tariffs; limited fiscal incentives for new ventures; and
strengthening the customs and consumption tax administration.
11.   The third area of concern was the Georgetown Water Supply Master Plan. At the time of
the SAC negotiations in May 1990, preliminary proposals for this plan were expected to be ready
by late 1991. Accordingly, the conditionality covering water supply was agreed to by the
negotiating team. However, commencement of work on the master plan was considerably
delayed and had not begun even in 1992. A new project profile entitled "Georgetown Water
Supply Emergency Assistance " was prepared instead, to be funded by the IDB. This project was
expected to be easily converted to a plan -- as required by the relevant third tranche condition --
for improving Georgetown's water supply. To some extent, it would also address the issue of
water tariffs, at least for large consumers metered. In the end the IDA was unable to proceed
with the Georgetown Water Supply Master Plan as a condition and accepted the emergency
assistance outline in lieu of the original conditions being met. (See Appendix C.)
12.   The fourth and most important condition was the reform of electricity tariffs. Consultants
were contracted by the IDB to prepare (i) a ten year Least Cost Expansion Program for electricity
supply, generally referred to as the Integrated Investment Program, and (ii) a calculation of the
Long Run Marginal Cost of generating and supplying electricity given this least-cost projection.
The second electricity study was also funded by the IDB. These studies took much longer to
complete than expected; raised significant analytical concerns; and their conclusions were not
readily accepted by the management of the Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC). Eventually
these difficulties created a major delay and the third tranche release did not take place until one
year later. (See Appendix D.)
3



C. Impact of the Adjustment Program
Recovery
13.   Since the launch of the ERP, reforms were carried out quickly. The ERP's four
objectives listed above were largely achieved by the end of the SAC period in 1993. First, in
terms of growth, the ERP's positive impact started to show in 1991 as real GDP grew by about
6%o following three years of decline averaging 3% per year (Table 1). Growth accelerated to
T 9% in 1992 and 8.2% in 1993. This growth is broad-based. The traditional sectors of sugar
Jl l irice fully recovered from their depressed state, while new sources of growth have emerged.
Spurred by foreign investment, gold output and forestry products have increased tremendously.
uc,ld output went up from 19 thousand troy ounces in 1989 to 367 thousand troy ounces in 1993
(more below). Forestry output almost doubled. Non-traditional agriculture such as fruits and
vegetables and shrimp output have also grown significantly. This robust growth broughlt down
sharply unemployment to nearly 10% of the labor force and started to create critical shortages in
..any skill categories.

14.   Second, both internal and external balances improved significantly. The deficit in the
current account of the public sector declined sharply from almost 19% of GDP in 1989 to 4.5%
of GDP in 1993; the deficit in the overall balance declined from over 37% to 22% of GDP during
that period. Both revenue generation and expenditure restraint contributed significantly to these
achievements. As a result of tax reforms, current revenues rose significantly from less than 19%
of GDP in 1989 to over 29% in 1993, while expenditure restraint reduced public sector non-
interest current expenditure from 21% to 15.5% of GDP. The current account of the balance of
payments, on the other hand, showed significant improvement, with the deficit of US$133
'Iiillion (35% of GDP) in 1989 being reduced to US$94 million (20% of GDP) in 1993; this took
dace despite the liberalization of imports and a reduction of customs tariff. The deficit was
-)re than covered by capital inflows. As a result, international reserves increased from US$27
4



million in 1990 to a comfortable level of US$246 million, or about nine months of imports
equivalent, by the end of 1993.
15.   Third, although difficult to measure, economic activities that at one time were conducted
in the informal sector have been increasingly recorded in the formal sector. For example, gold
output "declared" by traditional, small producers went up sharply from 19 thousand troy ounces
in 1989 to 43 thousand troy ounces in 1990 when the Guyana Gold Board started using in March
1990 the market exchange rate to buy gold from these producers. Such "declared" output had
since gone up to 87 thousand troy ounces in 1993. Anecdotal evidence indicated that a good part
of the increases in output could be attributed to the production that used to be sold in the parallel
market when the official exchange rate was extremely overvalued.
16.   Regarding the fourth objective - nonmalization of financial relations with creditors.
Guyana has regularized debt service to major creditors and have again received assistance from
multilateral and bilateral sources. The SAC funds were used to pay for essential imports such as
petroleum and large inflows from other sources were more than sufficient to pay for other
imports needed for the recovery; international reserves increased substantially as indicated in
Table 1. Relations with bilateral donors outside the Paris Club, however, have not been fully
regularized and Guyana remains in arrears with some of these creditors, including Trinidad and
Tobago, which holds close to one-quarter of Guyana's extemnal debt stock.
17.   Adopting market-determined exchange rate, pricing and interest rate policies is an
important component of the ERP. The Guyanese currency significantly depreciated, from
G$10/US$l in 1988 to G$127/US$l in 1993. Consumer prices rose significantly in the early
years after the ERP was launched but the rate of increase has since subsided (Table 1). These
price increases had a severe impact on real income of wage earners and fixed income recipients.
Most affected were those in public service, whose real wages were cut in half during this period.
As a result, a large number of skilled personnel left the public service.
18.   The adverse social impact was well anticipated. The GOG began in July 1988
preparation of the principal instrument to address the impact - the Social Impact Amelioration
Program (SIMAP) - when an agreement was reached on the substance of the ERP and the need to
execute a social program in tandem with it. The program was funded initially through the IMF-
sponsored Guyana Support Group, to provide up to US$2 million of short-term relief in the form
of supplementary income payments to vulnerable groups. The program was supported by the
IDB in 1989 and IDA supported SIMAP in April 1992, with an IDA credit of US$10.3 million
equivalent.
Recent Results and Remaining Agenda
19.   A new government took office in October 1992 and embraced the principle and
objectives of the ERP. It continued to implement the reforms after the SAC had been fully
disbursed in 1993 and articulated its reform agenda in the 1994-96 Policy Framework Paper
(PFP) fonnulated with the assistance of IMF and IDA. The PFP provided a basis for access to
the IMF resources under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) granted in July
5



1994. IDA is also finalizing a follow-up adjustment operation, the Private Sector Development
Adjustment Credit (PSDAC). The PSDAC focuses on the development of the private sector and
will require GOG's commitment to further reforms initiated under the SAC, to increase Guyana's
international competitiveness.
20.   The positive impact of reforms continues. Preliminary estimates indicate that the
economy grew about 8.8% in 1994 (Table 1). For the first time in many years, the public
sector's current account balance recorded a surplus of about 0.3% of GDP. With continued
vigorous export performance, the balance of payments current account showed in 1994 a small
deficit of US$47 million or less than 9% of GDP, which was more than covered by capital
inflows. As a result, international reserves further increased by US$23 million to close to ten
months of import equivalent at the end of 1994.
21.   In summary, over the past five years, Guyana has taken far reaching reforms bringing
about a fundamental shift in economic policies towards a market oriented economy. Recovery
has been accomplished, with real growth averaging 7.7 percent per year during 1991-94. The
overall fiscal deficit has been reduced; the exchange and trade systems liberalized and the
exchange rate unified; virtually all price controls have been removed and consumer subsidies
eliminated; the incentive framework for the private sector has improved, while state intervention
in agriculture, industry and commercial activities has declined. Progress has been made in
restructuring and reducing the size of the public sector through tax reform, strengthening
expenditure controls, and privatization of public enterprises. A shift to market based instruments
of monetary control was initiated; arrears to most donors have been cleared; and social impact
amelioration program (SIMAP) mitigated the most adverse effects of the adjustment.
22.   For all the strong policy progress made and recovery achieved so far, Guyana's economic
position remained precarious, given (i) the heavy debt burden; (ii) dilapidated economic and
social infrastructure; (iii) acute shortages of skilled personnel in public service; and (iv)
widespread poverty. While the Government remains committed to deepen the reforms, it will
need adequate strategies to deal with these issues or they will prevent achievement of sustained
growth; continued support from donor community will remain vital.
23.   As part of the donors' support for the ERP, some debt had been written-off and most has
been rescheduled. While these measures contributed to helping the economy recover, Guyana's
debt stock remains extremely heavy at almost four times GDP. Analyses indicate that Guyana
will continue to need debt relief.2 Even if the GOG continues to borrow only at concessional
terms, its external debt service can only be sustained if it could receive substantive debt relief
from bilateral creditors.
24.   Due to widespread decay, rehabilitation work in the past five years has not brought back
the economic and social infrastructure to full service. A large part of schools, health facilities,
water and power supplies, roads, ports, sea walls, etc. remain in the state of disrepair and will

discussed with the GOG in December 1994. This paper is being revised on the basis of updated data.

need huge amounts of funds for rehabilitation. For example, rehabilitation of the sea walls alone
is estimated to need some US$300 million, or close to an annual GDP. Intensified efforts will be
needed to mobilize both domestic and external resources to meet the requirements.
25.   Despite recent raises, the public sector pay remains very low. For example, the current
19 top most civil servants' average pay is US$560/month, while mid-level salaries average
US$135/month. As a result, the GOG has found it difficult to recruit or retain needed personnel
and the quality of public service has suffered. One of the most serious consequences is the
inability to fully implement the public sector investment program (PSIP), whose design was part
of the SAC. In the past few years, implementation of the PSIP has been consistently below
programmed amounts (Figure 1). In this respect, the PSIP has been consistent with the
macroeconomic framework but not with the country's implementation capacity. Low
implementation rates may constrain future growth and thus jeopardize the sustainability of the
ERP.
26.   Despite strong recovery in recent years, it is estimated that about 40% of the population
falls below the poverty line.3 While anecdotal evidence indicates that the economic recovery has
benefited a broad spectrum of the population, in-deptfh analyses have not yet been carried out to
enforce it.4 On the other hand, pockets of dire poverty can still be easily identified. For these
reasons, the GOG is concerned that growth may not have been equitably distributed and poverty
could create undesirable social and political consequences. The challenge is to design a future
development strategy that will not only sustain growth but also ensure that all social and ethnic
groups equitably share its benefits. The GOG is now preparing such a strategy.

Program Sustainability
27.   After coming to power in October 1992, the present Government embraced the ERP.
Except for delays in a few areas, adjustment measures agreed with the donor community have
been carried out. Whether or not this Government continues in power after the 1997 elections,
the risk of policy reversal is minimal because even if the opposition wins the elections, it is likely
to continue the ERP that it initiated in 1988. IDA has continued to support the ERP through
another adjustment operation, the Private Sector Development Adjustment Credit, approved in
June 1995; the IMF does the same with successor operations; and bilateral donors provide more
assistance and debt rescheduling. For these reasons, adjustments will continue and the gains
achieved under the SAC should be judged sustainable.
IDA Performance
28.   Overall IDA performance is rated as satisfactory. The program was appropriately
identified, prepared, appraised and supervised. While the delay of the third tranche could have
been avoided if its release was not tied to work under the IDB's purview, the risk of delay was
worth taking because improving performance of the power company and its cost recovery was a
vital component of economic recovery.
Borrower Performance
29.   The borrower perforrnance is also rated as satisfactory. The Government that initiated the
ERP had unwavering commitment to and strong ownership of the program. It fully participated
in the preparation and implementation. Although privatization of state-owned enterprises was
put on hold for reassessment when the new Government came to power in October 1992, the
program was essentially unchanged as a result of the change in government. Privatization has
resumed and the overall program remains on track.
D. Assessment and Conclusions
Evaluation of Overall Results
30.   Guyana's economic recovery between 1989 and 1994 represents a very successful
demonstration of how economic rehabilitation in a developing economy can take place through
careful design of a far reaching economic recovery program, adequate support from donors, and
steady implementation by government despite external adverse conditions. For both the IDA and
the GOG, the SAC played a very instrumental part in Guyana's economic recovery. The initial
conceptual design and implementation of this SAC were both challenging and risky. The
conditions attached to tranche releases called for far reaching macro-economic changes and a
new market-oriented posture that was in sharp contrast with the policies pursued over the
previous two decades; these could have severe social impact and political consequences. The
requirements, however, were whole-heartedly adopted by the GOG and implemented in a very
timely fashion. As many of the changes to improve efficiency and kick-start the economy were
8



taking hold, the policy focus was gradually shifted towards micro-economic pricing of key inputs
such as energy and water; repair and rehabilitation of vital infrastructure; restoration of medical
and educational services; public service reform; and poverty alleviation.
31.   The incoming government in 1992 embraced the principles of the ERP and has since
further shifted the policy emphasis more towards equity considerations. These are areas in which
policies take longer to affect change, but the GOG yiews equity as part of its fundamental
mandate. While the achievements attributable to the SAC are substantial, and perhaps even path-
breaking in terms of IDA success in turning around an arrears-laden developing country, there
are still serious questions about the sustainability of these hard won results. Unless Guyana's
external debt burden is significantly lightened and serious constraints in terms of human capital
and infrastructure are overcome, Guyana will continue to be a "gap-filling dependency" with
little prospect of attaining self-sustaining development. Should this happen, the SAC will appear
to later observers as more of a holding operation, than a significant step on the path to Guyana's
complete economic recovery.
Specific Findings and Lessons Learned
32.   The most important overall findings and lessons learned are as follows:
a) Guyana's economic decline has been successfully reversed in a very short period.
While early achievements could be attributed partly to a favorable set of exogenous
factors such as good weather and external market access, commitments to thorough
reforms emphasizing macro-economic stabilization and market-orientation played a
significant role in the economic turnaround.
b) Consideration of revenue enhancement is at least as important to restoring fiscal
soundness as reductions in real expenditures. Tax reform and tax revenue
enhancement need to be one of the earliest elements attended to in any ERP; without
revenue enhancement at the early stage, to achieve viable fiscal balance, real public
sector wages may be cut to an extent that it affects the ability of the government to
retain skilled personnel and managers in the public sector.
c) Over time, the parallel economy can be gradually formalized; even though those who
have participated in the parallel economy are generally averse to government
regulations and taxation requirements, well designed ERP appropriately balancing the
incentive and revenue considerations will overcome their reluctance to join the formal
sector.
d) SAC conditionalities on the second and third tranches, which involved the
Georgetown Water Supply and the tariff rates on the Guyana Electricity Corporation,
were unnecessarily complex and difficult to achieve. Tranche release conditions
should be geared to successful implementation of major policy changes. If studies are
needed to prepare policy decisions, they should be carefully timed, and if financed by
other donors, better coordinated.
9



e) It is important that an ERP have an efficient and effective social impact arnelioration
program such as SIMAP in place early, with carefuil identification of groups most
likely to be affected. In the case of Guyana, rapid inflation and massive depreciation
of the Guyanese dollars fell with greatest impact in the short-run upon urban workers,
especially those in the public sector. Decline of real wages caused skilled personnel
to leave public service.
f) The ability of a reduced public sector to implement large-scale development programs
envisaged in the SAC period was overestimated.- Fiscal downsizing made it difficult
to raise public sector pay to the level sufficient to recruit and retain skilled technicians
and managers; inadequate public sector service may jeopardize the sustainability of
the ERP. A short-period SAC can lead to recovery. But sustaining growth requires
continued deepening reform for a longer period. Subsequent operations may be
needed to ensure such reforms, adequate finance, and sustainability of recovery.
g) To ensure sustainability of a program involving debt reduction work-out, it is
important that all major creditors be fully associated. In this case, Guyana has to
continue working toward finalization of agreements with major bilateral creditors.
33.   The SAC contributed significantly to Guyana's initial economic recovery. The
conceptual design and implementation of this SAC were both challenging and risky. The
conditions attached to tranche releases called for far-reaching reforms fundamentally different
from the policies pursued over the previous two decades; these could have severe socio-political
consequences. The GOG, however, whole-heartedly adopted the reforms and implemented them
in a timely fashion. Guyana's heavy external debt burden and serious constraints in human
capital and infrastructure could put in doubt the recent substantial achievements. With GOG's
continued commitment toward reforms and donors' expressed support, the risk of policy reversal
is minimal and the achievements would likely be sustained. For these reasons, the SAC should
be regarded as helping launch the sustainable economic recovery.

Appendix A
PROGRAM REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Introduction
I .    This Program Completion Report (PCR) is an evaluation of the Guyana Structural
Adjustment (SAC II). The policy based SAC II was approved by the Board on June 28, 1990.
The Credit Agreement was signed on July 13, 1990. The Credit became effective on August 29,
1990 with a closing date of December 22, 1993. This date was extended to December 31, 1994
so as to facilitate additional financing under the Credit. The initial amount wvas SDR 59.8
m'ilion. The Credit Agreement was amended five times reflecting increases from IDA Reflows
and Gulf Assistance Program to the tune of SDR 83.02 million. The dates of agreement and
amounts are as follows:

2.    The first tranche of SDR 38.34 million was disbursed on effectiveness in September,
1990, followed by the second tranche of SDR 11.50 million in June 1991. In addition, SDR
23.22 million was disbursed during the period 1991 - 1994 which represent amounts as IDA
Reflows and Gulf Assistance under the First to Fifth Amendments to the Development Credit.
The third tranche and IDA Reflows realized SDR 14.48 million.
20



3.    Further to these amounts from IDA, the SAC II was co-financed by the Caribbean
Development Bank (US$32.0 million) and Germany (US$6.0 million). These loans were fully
disbursed by Germany and the Caribbean Development Bank in 1990 and 1992 respectively.
4.   In addition, several major bilateral donors assisted in the financing of the program.
Resources were provided mainly in the form of commodity assistance and/or help to clear
Guyana's debt arrears to IFIs.
5.    Release of the third tranche originally scheduled for December 31, 1992 was delayed on
account of a condition regarding electricity tariff consistent with the IDB's recommendations of
long-run marginal costs. The current Government which came into office in October 1992
sought to deal with managerial and financial issues at the Guyana Electricity Corporatiox.. This
caused some initial delays, but the Government was subsequently able to prepare a time-table
reflecting a phased implementation strategy for the introduction of an electricity tariff consistent
with long-run marginal costs which will be fully implemented by the end of 1995.
6.    The Government of Guyana has met all the requirements set out in the Development
Credit and has successfully drawn down all amounts eligible under the Credit.
Background
7.    After independence in 1966, the Government pursued policies that provided a
disincentive to private sector participation in economic and financial activities. As a result, the
public sector became the main contributor to economic growth. Economic fortunes had been
mixed and especially during the latter half of the 1980s the economy worsened. Inflation was on
the rise, the public deficit widened and government resorted to external borrowing to finance
resource imbalances, foreign debt outstanding moved from 187% of total exports in 1980 to
668% in 1988 and the current account deficit widened from 7% of GDP in 1980 to 20% of GDP
in 1988. Some attempts were made to make adjustment during the 1984-1987 period but these
reforms were generally insufficient given the magnitude of the problem.
8.    As a result of these developments, in mid-1 988 the Government announced its Economic
Recovery Program (ERP). The main objectives were to:
a)  restore economic growth and later increase above historical levels over the medium
term;
b) eliminate internal and external imbalances;
c)  incorporate the parallel economy; and
d)  normalize Guyana's financial relations with its existing creditors.
21



9.    To attain these objectives the Government gave highest priority to the restoration of
incentives through a realistic exchange rate regime, removal of price distortions, trade
liberalization, promotion of private sector development, improvement in the public sector
finances through a streamlining of the civil service, generation of surpluses from state enterprises
and a selective divestment program, rehabilitation of basic infrastructure critical to exports and
private investment through a Public Sector Investment Program consistent with a viable macro-
economic framework and a Social Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) to protect groups that
are particularly vulnerable during adjustment.
10.   However, these efforts were constrained by the lack of balance of payments support to
finance needed imports to restore growth and the lack of investment resources for
complementary resources. The first step towards the turnaround came as a result of an initial
Fund supported program in mid-1988 for nine months, a one year stand-by arrangement and a
three-year arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in 1990 and a
second ESAF in 1993. In June 1990, IDA/WB approved the SAC II and also approved other
sector specific credits subsequently. Several major bilateral donors also assisted in the financing
of the program either in the form of commodity assistance and/or help to clear Guyana's debt
arrears to IFIs.
11.   The SAC was designed to support the recovery efforts of the Government. The main
objectives were to:
a)  improve the incentive framework for trade and investment;
b)  improve public sector finances through elimination of central government transfers;
c)  streamlining the civil service;
d)  increase transfers from public corporations and divestment;
e)  formulation of a realistic PSIP; and
f)  an amelioration program to help cushion the vulnerable groups during adjustment.
12.   The design of the SAC was appropriate to the circumstances at the prevailing time as
relates to the implementation capacity of the country. Further, recognizing problems that may
arise during implementation, technical assistance programs were also financed to support the
SAC.
Recent Economic Performance
13.   During the period of the SAC, with the implementation of the ERP, Guyana's economic
performance has improved considerably. In 1991, economic activities began to recover and real
GDP increased by 6%. In 1994 GDP growth was 8.5% (an average of over 4% per annum) due
mainly to strong supply response in the productive sector with the exception of the troubled
22



bauxite sector. The export performance has improved substantially. After stagnating through the
1980s, the value of merchandise exports increased by about 20% per annum during 1991-94.
Also, export volume increased by an average of about 23% per annum during 1991-94. The
growth in gold-exports and the recovery of rice and sugar accounts for about 75% of the export
growth in value terms during 1991-94 with manufactures, timber, construction and non-
traditional agricultural crops also contributing to the expansion. Merchandise imports also
increased. Much of the recent increase has been associated with the increase in capital goods
from public investment in mining, energy and agriculture. It should be noted that in 1994 the
growth experienced was export-oriented resulting from higher selling prices and increased output
especially for rice and gold.
14.   Public investment has reduced from about 35% in 1988 to about 27.5% in 1994 while
private investment has increased from about 3.6% in 1988 to about 22.7% in 1994 resulting from
Government's reduced role in the productive sector and the increased confidence of private
investors in the economy. Domestic savings increased from about 3.6% of GDP in 1988 to about
29.5% in 1994 including both public and private savings.
15.   Price and exchange liberalization and improved incentives for private sector development
contributed to increased production and has helped to integrate the parallel economy into the
official economy. Inflation declined significantly from 81% in 1991 to 7.7% in 1993, but has
moved upwards to 16.1% in 1994 as a result of increasing international prices, internal
adjustment to tariff rates and distortions in the domestic distribution system. Nominal exchange
rate which had originally depreciated significantly remained fairly stable at the end of 1994.
16.   Guyana's external financial position has notably improved but it remains precarious on
account of the large debt overhang of US$2.004 Mn at the end of 1994. While the external
current accmnit continues to record large deficits of about 22% of GDP mainly as a result of an
expansion of imports, the overall deficit of the balance of payments improved substantially due
to inflows in the capital account, reduced interest obligations from debt rescheduling, increased
private sector inflows and divestment proceeds. In all, the overall deficit of the balance of
payments narrowed to about US$63.9 Mn in 1994 as against US$195 Mn in 1990. At the same
time large flows of balance of payments support and debt relief allowed Guyana to strengthen its
international reserves considerably to an average of about five months of imports per annum
during 1991-94.
17.   Debt servicing obligations before rescheduling have declined from an equivalent of about
118% of the export of goods and non-factor services in 1989 to about 45% in 1994 while actual
debt service payments declined from 33% of exports to about 22% in 1994.
23



Implementation
18.   Guyana has implemented all the major macro-economic reforms agreed upon. It has
undertaken the following measures during the last four years:
a)  price controls have been completely eliminated;
b)  import prohibitions have been eliminated for all items except for non-processed
meat and poultry, and processed and non-processed fruit;
c)  the tariff range has been reduced to 0-45% in line with the 1991 CARICOM
Common External Tariff (CET), and a further phased reduction to the 5-20% range
by January 1997 has been agreed to in line with the revised CET;
d)  a free market for the sale of foreign exchange has been established;
e)  a privatization policy for the large public enterprises has been adopted, a
privatization board has been established to oversee the process, and a program has
begun after procedures making the privatization process more transparent were
adopted;
f)  new tax measures have been put in place, some exemptions have been eliminated
and tax revenues have been increased;
g)  rationalization of the bauxite and sugar sectors has begun, and work has been
initiated with a view towards privatization;
h) a free auction of Government Treasury Bills has been introduced, and interest rates
now reflect market conditions; and
i)  arrears to international agencies and commercial bank debts have been eliminated
and bilateral debts have been rescheduled.
19.   The Government has satisfactorily carried out its adjustment program consistent with its
macroeconomic framework.
20.   In relation to structural and institutional reforms, the Government has satisfactorily met
the conditions as stated in Schedule 3 for the release of the second tranche. It has been found
that there have been no reversals in the measures adopted prior to the release of the second
tranche.
21.   The third tranche was scheduled to be disbursed on December 31, 1992. Actually
disbursement commenced in June, 1993. The delay in the disbursement of the third tranche was
due to the unsatisfactory completion of the conditions precedent to the release of the third
tranche namely, the introduction of new electricity tariff rates consistent with the long-run
24



marginal cost. The Government took steps to fulfill all the preconditions as stated in Schedule 4
for the release of the third tranche. The outstanding condition and the action taken is described
below:
preparation of a schedule, based on the available financing for new investments, for
equating the rates for the sale of electricity to at least the long run marginal cost,
including a time table satisfactory to the Association for the implementing such schedule.
A 50% increase in tariff was required to bring the rate in line with long run marginal
cost. Increases were made in November 1993 of 14%, in January 1994 of 11% and
August 1994 of 20%. The Government also agreed to an automatic fuel adjustment
clause. Implementation of the schedule was facilitated by the IDB financed management
team.
22.   Upon satisfactory agreement with IDA, the disbursement of the third tranche commenced
in June 1993.
Assessment of Credit
23.   During the period of the SAC all the macroeconomic targets were satisfactorily achieved:
a)  domestic savings increased substantially (including public sector savings);
b)  the continuing reduction of the external current account;
c)  the reduction in the unemployment rate;
d)  the reduction in the rate of inflation;
e)  stabilization of the real effective exchange rate; and
f)   GDP growth of over 4% per annum.
24.   The principal objectives of institutional and structural strengthening were also achieved
with some degree of success. However, to sustain the very favorable performance over the
medium to long-term, there is still need for the further strengthening of the accrued benefits.
25.   While public investment has been reducing despite the enormous infrastructure works
that need to be undertaken, private investment needs to increase at a faster rate and at sustainable
levels. The expected support growth in foreign private investment did not materialize. Private
domestic investment has increased substantially especially in agriculture, construction and
trading activities. Additional incentives need to be directed to consolidate and promote
productive type investment since there is an eminent danger that domestic savings may be
diverted to consumption. The failure of private foreign investment to respond to public policy
will continue to add pressure on the Government to respond to needs. This will inevitably
25



increase the public debt/GDP ratio and limit revenue generation for debt servicing. The weak
private foreign investment response may be attributed to:
a)  inadequate supporting physical infrastructure;
b)  the underdevelopment of the domestic private sector and private sector institutions
including access to low interest credit;
c)  insufficient skills and research facilities;
d)  perceived bureaucratic red tapes; and
e)   a tax system that is regressive.
26.   The tax system needs further simplification so as to consolidate the gains presently
enjoyed. The tax base needs to be expanded and the collect further improved so as to ease the
burden on personal income tax on a very narrow base. Indirect taxation also needs to be properly
addressed. Further institutional and structural measures may prove to improve efficiency.
27.   The Public Sector Investment Program which is to be consistent with the macroeconomic
framework needs further strengthening. Efforts are currently being undertaken to improve
project selection for inclusion into the PSIP. Although the department responsible for the PSIP
benefited under the program through technical assistance there is need for further institutional
and structural strengthening. Effort is also needed at attracting and retaining experienced
personmel.
28.   T he Government with the assistance of the British Overseas Development
Administration, has restructured the public service reducing the number of ministries from
eighteen to eleven. Further a comprehensive restructuring of the public sector supported by the
Public Administration Program has been implemented in May, 1994 effective from July 1993. A
part of this program was aimed at reforming the public sector wages. At present public sector
wages are adjusted consistent with inflation. A more comprehensive approach is needed.
Currenitly a discussion with the relevant parties on a proposed wages policy has been initiated by
the Govermilent.
26



29.   With reference to poverty, during the period of the SAC it was found that the poverty gap
has widened. The amelioration program, SIMAP, was not responsive to the needs of the
vulnerable groups. Efforts are being made to reorganize the institution so as to ensure a more
efficient use of the limited resources to make them more responsive to the needs of the people. It
was found that a very large percentage of the funds were used to meet administrative and other
costs with little being directed to the vulnerable groups. The amelioration activities are focused
on the "basic needs" of the people. The Government's present objectives in the effort at poverty
reduction focuses on the development of latent skill and talents that may be available among the
various groups. Program will provide access to low interest credit, and improvement in
production, managerial and marketing skills. The Govermnent also intends to intensify its social
safety net program to the very poor including single parent families, Amerindians and
pensioners. Incentives are also proposed for the private sector to expand and create employment
opportunities. The Government poverty program is in conjunction with the Caribbean
Development Bank financed Basic Needs Trust Fund Program.
Conclusion
30.   The design of the SAC was appropriate to the circumstances at the prevailing time as
relates to the implementation capacity of the country. The results have been spectacular and
serious follow-up efforts need to be pursued in order to sustain the benefits. Already IDA has
approved other sector specific loans in support of the SAC. Government needs to capitalize on
the existing positive performance of the economy and should strive to consolidate and improve
on the performance so as to effectively reduce the disparity of income between groups.

of the SAC negotiations in 1989, a preliminary IDB finance master plan was expected to
be ready by late 1991. However, commencement of work on the plan was considerably
delayed and the plan was in fact not expected to be completed before mid 1993.
Moreover, the IDB Interim Program for the Georgetown Water and Sewage System
which could have provided the actual program required under the SAC, was also delayed.
Therefore the authorities designed and adopted an emergency rehabilitation plan to
address the most immediate water supply needs. The main components of this
emergency plan were based on the conclusions of an IDB finance study. The plan was
assessed and found to be satisfactory, however it took some time before written
confirmation of a cabinet decision to adopt the plan allowed for the IDA to conclude that
a critical conditionality of the third tranche had been met.
2.    A problem arose for the third tranche release, condition three, concerning the
preparation of the Georgetown Water Supply Action Plan. There were lengthy delays in
the commencement of the IDB-financed Water Supply Master Plan Study for
Georgetown. Thus, in November 1991 the GOG requested the IDB to initiate a study on
urgently needed rehabilitation of dilapidated water supply and sewage facilities in the
city. In turn, the IDB commissioned a consultant study which recommended a short-term
remedial program for Georgetown facilities, with a cost estimate of about US$ 10 million.
This program involved the following improvements:
a) restoration of pumping capacity and alternative power to provide adequate
pressure and water to distribution systems;
b)  maintenance of electrical-mechanical facilities and availability of spares and
standbys;
c)  operation of treatment facilities with attention given to the safety of the
water supply through uninterrupted use of chemicals;
d)  avoidance of contamination of sewage through rehabilitation of the central
sewage system; and
e)  strengthening of the Georgetown Sewage and Water Commission in the
field of operation and maintenance.

3.    Based on the IDB consultant's report of March 1992, IDA believed that the
emergency action plan it embodied would meet the requirement (condition 3, in the SAC
Credit Agreement) for the release of the third tranche. This was an effective compromise
to overcome what could have been a very difficult problem of escalating delays in
meeting conditionalities.
4.    With this outstanding condition met, the SAC third tranche was basically on track.
The Government was asked to prepare documentation to comply with the outstanding
condition, which was to be assessed in the context of the policy-framework paper, by an
August 1992 mission. A third tranche and IDA Reflow balance of SDR 12.37 million
(US$17 million equivalent) was therefore pending.

PROBLEMS OF POWER
1.   It was noted in October 1992 that the Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC) tariff
policy aimed at recovering operational costs, in agreement with an IDB loan covenant. In
this context, tariffs had been raised by over 400% in real terms between 1989 and 1991.
Yet GEC's tariffs covered marginal energy costs but not marginal capacity costs. The
IDB completed a Long Run Marginal Cost study (LRMC) in 1992 based on a Least-Cost
Expansion Program for the power sector.
2.    A consulting firm was contracted to develop a tariff structure consistent with the
recommendations of the LRMC and a draft of this report had been submitted to the
previous government. Depending upon the user category, tariffs would have to be
increased by a further 50 - 100% to be consistent with the estimated LRMC. The GOG
had to submit a policy statement which would include a base tariff structure which
avoided cross-subsidies between categories of users, a timetable for tariff increases until
such time, within say a maximum of two years, that the average electricity tariff schedule
became consistent with the LRMC computed by the IDB. A commitment to regularly
adjust the tariff schedule to reflect changes in future operational costs and evidence that
the legal and institutional mechanisms were in place to assure implementation and the
tariff schedule according to the proposed timetable.
3.    The tariff level was insufficient to cover GEC's budget for 1993 and 1994, and a
combination of fiscal budget transfer and tariff increases was the most realistic approach
to solving this issue, also enabling compliance with the IDB's loan covenants. Accepting
the IDB's position on this issue, the IMF and IDA pursued a phased tariff increase of
about 45-5-% to reach the average Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC), which was
estimated at about 14¢ per kWh. The Government resisted any tariff increase until it put
in place emergency power purchase arrangements. Assuming that the additional capacity
would be in operation at end- 1993, the GOG expressed willingness to increase the tariff
level initially by 25% in January 1994 from the present 9.3¢ per kWh.
4.    The IDB-financed Least-Cost Expansion Program (LCEP) for the provision of
electric power in Guyana and the Long Run Marginal Cost analysis associated with the
lease-cost expansion program were prepared by two different sets of consultants. Neither
of these analyses were persuasive in their economic content. While the LRMC is a very
important concept for establishing pricing, since without it one cannot on the one hand
make sure that the enterprise is pricing itself in a way in which it can break even, and on
the other hand it is not possible to end implicit cross-subsidization through misaligned
electricity tariffs, the LCEP is capable of many different scenarios, all of which rely upon
very doubtful projections of consumer and industrial demand for future power in Guyana.
Since the LRMC study is contingent upon the findings of the LCEP study, it becomes
doubly difficult to be sure that the LRMC estimates are even close to being realistic.
36



5.    The World Bank and other International Financial Institutions may need to be
very careful before using this type of inherently risky analysis as conditionalities for
major tranche releases. The borrower could have been exceedingly suspicious that the
LRMC might have been placed 30 - 40% too high as a consequence of a mistaken
projection on the Least-Cost Expansion Program and thus would have found analytical
reasons -- rather than managerial (political) reasons -- for resisting and not adopting the
changes prescribed by the reports. Nevertheless, one can understand the Bank's dilemma
without subscribing to the kind of problem solution that was advocated in this case. The
Bank should be reluctant to use this type of conditionality for SAC tranche release in the
future.
