MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 15 million (US$21.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit, which would be repayable in 40
years, including 10 years of grace, at IDA's standard terms would help to
finance an agricultural technology development project for the Republic of
Bolivia. Parallel financing for research components of the project would be
provided by the Swiss Fund for Technical Cooperation. The project is also
expected to attract considerable cofinancing from other bilateral sources once
the project gets underway and the institutional reforms of the implementiag
agency (Instituto Boliviano de Tecnologia Agropecuaria, IBTA) are put into
effect.
2.          Backaround.  The GDP of Bolivia suffered a continuous decline in
the period 1980-1984 of 2.6% per year. The New Economic Policy instigated in
1985 has stabilized the economy, but GDP still lags behind the population
growth rate. By contrast, agricultural GDP which comprised 23% of the value
added in 1988, grew by 3.5% per year from 1980-1985 and then declined by 2%
per year from 1986-1988. Nevertheless in the short term, agriculture, mining
and transport are the sectors best positioned to contribute to accelerated
growth in the Bolivian economy. Agricultural production and productivity per
hectare have remained relatively constant since 1980, except for the drought
year of 1983. The New Economic Policy provides producers of agricultural
products with the framework they require to make rational decisions on
cropping patterns and management, and offers good opportunities for growth of
the sector by satisfying both local and export markets. IDA is supporting
export growth potential through the Eastern Lowlands Natural Resource and
Agricultural Production Project (Credit 2119-BO), and through a proposed Agro-
export Development Project which would establish a Foundation to invest in and
handle the marketing of non-traditional agricultural products of primarily,
small-scale farmers.
3.            In agricultural terms, the country can broadly be divided into
two regions: the highlands, where small-scale peasant farming predominates
under harsh climatic conditions, and the lowlands, where larger farms and
modern technology are more in evidence. The agricultural sector provides
about 50% of total employment. Some 80% of the population live in rural
areas, but under conditions of extreme poverty. Most of the staple food is
produced in the highlands on small- or medium-sized farms, with very low
levels of productivity. There is little scope for increasing cropped area in
the highlands, unless considerable investment is made in irrigation. On the
other hand, the low levels of productivity of the presently cropped lands
could be raised if improved technology were used. Due to the particular



expenses; (h) Government would assume an increasing share of incremental
recurrent costs after Year 4 of the project, commencing at 10% in Year 4 and
reaching 65% by Year 7; (i) by September 30, 1994, IBTA would recruit
consultants satisfactory to the Bank to undertake a mid-term review of IBTA's
programs, performance and means to ensure the stability of the institute and
thereafter implement such recommendations as would be mutually agreed upon
between IBTA and IDA; (j) IBTA would hire consultants satisfactory to IDA to
undertake the study on Technology Transfer by December 31, 1991, and for
Research Requirements in the Lowlands by September 30, 1992; (k) IBTA would
develop and enter into contractual arrangements satisfactory to IDA which
would bind employees receiving training under the program for MSc and PhD, to
provide not less than two months of service to IZTA for each month of training
received, before sending any employee for training; (1) Government would
annually review the salary scales of IBTA and CNIEA staff so as to maintain
competi.tive salaries satisfactory to IDA; (m) the first two contracts for
goods and civil works, irrespective of their amounts, would be subject to
review by the IDA before being awarded; and (n) the accounts of IBTA and CNIEA
would be audited on an annual basis by an independent auditing agency
acceptable to IDA and the audit reports would be submitted to IDA within six
months of the close of each fiscal year.   Conditions of Effectiveness:
(a) IBTA would enter into a technical assistance arrangement, satisfactory to
IDA, with another research agency, under terms acceptable to IDA; (b) IBTA
would enter into a contractual agreement, satisfactory to IDA, and with CIFP
to carry out research on corn and grain legumes; (c) IETA would have in
position the program leaders for the agreed research program; (d) the
Government of Bolivia would enter into subsidiary agreements with IBTA for the
Technology Development component of the project; and (e) GOB would implement
the new salary scales for IBTA and CNIEA, including the positions specified as
"Cargos Criticos."
10.         Proiect Benefits and Justification.  The economic rates of return
from agricultural research are particularly high when the initial level of
technology is relatively low and there is widespread adoption by the intended
beneficiaries. In the highlands of Bolivia the current level of technology is
low. The design of the research program is such that the technology generated
would be especially tailored for use by small-scale farmers. At present,
delivery systems for technology are largely handled by NGOs and regional
corporations. The project would help to coordinate these efforts through the
CNIEA, and evaluate the need for additional mechanisms to support local or
regional extension services. The project concentrates on the most important
staples and sources of income for the smallholders in the highland areas (the
highland crops covered provide 54% of the total food consumption of grain, 67%
of tuber requirements, and close to 100% of grain legume consumption in
Bolivia). An estimated 2-3 million rural inhabitants could benefit from the
project. Net annual benefits to farmers and consumers from increased
productivity are conservatively estimated to be of the order of US$4 million
for potato, US$5 million for maize, US$0.5 million for quinoa, US$1 million
for barley and US$1 million for Faba beans. Much of the production is for
family consumption. In the case of technology to be developed to improve the
raising of sheep and cameloids, women would be the main direct beneficiaries,
as such livestock are almost exclusively tended by women. They also handle
the processing of the wool and fibers; a major source of cash income for the
family.



- s -
11.         Environment.  The project is considered environmentally benign in
that good agricultural technology and husbandry indeed signifies the control
and judicious use of resource!i. The emphasis of the project would be on such
aspects as varietal resistance and biological control of diseases and pests
that obviate the need for heavy use of noxious and expensive agrochemicals.
Furthermore, improved management of pasture in the Altiplano could help
prevent wind erosion, which is a major problem.
12.         Proiect Risks.  The basket of commodities to be researched in the
project spreads risk. Furthermore, the project's planning and evaluation
processes allow a flexible approach to resolving unexpected problems. A major
risk is that either the technology is not suitable for farmers' conditions or
that the transfer mechanisms are not effective. The project has been designed
to include an essential component of technology testing and adaptation to
minimize the risk of generating technology that does not meet producers'
needs. The special study on extension and the coordinating role of the CNIEA
should provide information on how to ensure that producers are aware of the
new technology and give insights into deficiencies that need to be corrected.
13.         A ma3or uncertainty in this project is the capacity of IBTA and
the CNIEA to execute and manage a program of this magnitude. The design of
the project includes considerable assistance by international advisers to
obviate this problem. The project also involves a reduction in the scope of
IBTA's activities and a reduction in its personnel to better focus its
efforts. In view of the political difficulties such actions frequently
encounter, the project design provides for such key actions to be taken at the
outset of the project.
Recommendation
14.         I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of IDA and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
