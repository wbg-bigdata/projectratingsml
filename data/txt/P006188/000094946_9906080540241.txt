Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural
Technology Development Project in Bolivia, for which Credit 2216-BO in the amount of
SDR 15 million (US$21 million equivalent) was signed on April 16, 1991 and made
effective on February 14, 1992. The project was co-financed by the Government of
Swiss Federation for about US$4 million equivalent.
2.    The credit was closed on October 31, 1998, as originally forecasted. Total
disbursement reached SDR14.85 million after last disbursement, prior to closing the
account on February 28, 1999.
3.    Matthew McMahon, Task Manager of the Environmentally and Socially
Sustainable Development Sector Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Region, assisted
by Juan Morelli (Agricultural Economist), World Bank Consultant prepared the ICR. The
report was reviewed by Pierre Werbrouck, Sector Leader, LCC6C. The ICR was
forwarded to the COSUDE (Swiss Federation), La Paz, Bolivia for comments.
4.    Preparation of the ICR began during the Bank's completion mission of
November-December 1998. It is based on materials in the project file and interviews
with local stakeholders, including a representative of the co-financier. The Borrower
contributed to the preparation of the ICR by providing opinions reflected in the mission's
Aide Memoire attached as Appendix A and the research program individual evaluation
reports, prepared by the Borrower, the executive summary of which is attached as
Appendix B. The Borrower has reviewed this ICR.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.   At the time of project preparation, about 50 percent of the population in Bolivia
were rural with over two million people in extreme poverty in the rural areas of the
Altiplano, Valleys and Yungas. In these areas, where the basic foodstuffs, i.e., potatoes,
maize, wheat, barley, quinua and livestock were produced, agricultural productivity had
stagnated. Public spending in agricultural research was extremely low, being less than
0.2 percent of AgGDP. These factors led the GOB and IDA to the conclusion that new
investment was needed for the generation of new knowledge and technology which
would lead to increases in productivity of the agricultural sector. Since the country's
resources, both in terms of capital and human capacity, were scarce, IDA's strategy was
geared to improving the productivity of the more traditional crops and areas, and with the
long term goal of strengthening the system of technology generation and agricultural
extension.
A. Project Objectives
2.  The project had two main objectives: to improve the overall efficiency of research
and extension, and to directly support technology development in the highland
agricultural sector. This would be accomplished by: (i) establishing a Consejo Nacional
de Investigacion y Extensi6n Agropecuaria (CNIEA) to more effectively coordinate those
activities; and (ii) strengthening the national agricultural research agency, the Instituto
Boliviano de Tecnologia Agropecuario (IBTA), and focus its efforts on developing
technology suitable for small holders in the target areas of the Altiplano, Valleys and
Yungas. The project objectives were clear and realistic.
B. Implementation Experience and Results
3.   The project was partially successful in its technical, and physical objectives but had
little positive impact in terms of institutional and public sector reform. The project
established relevant research programs in six basic food commodities which have
provided new knowledge and technology and which if supported in the future will
contribute to increasing rural productivity in the target areas. The training component has
developed a significant technical capacity to undertake relevant research improvements in
the future, whatever institutional arrangements are put in place. This may be, by far, the
most important achievement of the project.



iii
4.   The objective of improving the overall efficiency of research and extension in
Bolivia was not met. The CNIEA ceased to operate in late 1992 and was dropped as a
component of the project. Political interference in the management of IBTA, leading to
several changes over the life of the project, created a great deal of uncertainty and low
morale among the staff, both at headquarters and in the field. The Decentralization Law
and the Supreme Decree that regulated it, determined that the funding and execution of
agricultural research would be decentralized to the Prefecturas. As a result IBTA Central
ceased to exist and the GOB did not have a coherent strategy to maintain and strengthen
the projects activities.
C. Summary of Findings
Sustainability
5.    Sustainability of project achievements is considered uncertain. With the
decentralization process during the last two years, budget allocations from the
Prefecturas have been inadequate. Salaries have been significantly reduced, and there
are few resources in the operational budget. The GOB is not addressing this situation
adequately. On the positive side, the recent creation of PROINPA Foundation
(Fundaci6npara la Promoci6n e Investigaci6n de Productos Andinos) with Swiss
funding and the PROTRIGO cereals program financed with EC money, assures
sustainability of these two programs which were supported by the project. However, it
should be noted that both are dependent on outside funding.
Bank and Borrower Performance
6.    The Bank's performance is considered unsatisfactory since certain risks were not
adequately dealt with during appraisal, and the Bank was overly flexible in abiding with
political interference and poor management decisions during supervision. At the end of
1993 the Borrower was informed that unless swift actions were taken, it would be very
difficult for the Bank, to justify continuing support for the project. Following that crisis,
corrective actions were agreed to. Due to IDA's warnings, the new administration team
of IBTA, remained unchanged for two years showing considerable improvements, and
justifying the Bank's optimism at the time. Later the situation deteriorated once again.
In hindsight, the Bank was overly patient with the poor administration of the project and
the political interference which was a continuous problem
7.    Borrower's performance was judged by the completion mission and confirmed
with GOB representatives, to be deficient. During implementation the project was badly
weakened by the continuous administration changes and by the failure to keep in place a
sufficiently competent techrical and managerial team. Some commitments that were not
sufficiently followed were: (i) to accept new staff management practices based on
transparent recruitment and promotion mechanisms; (ii) to pay an increased share of the
higher salaries; (iii) to recognize and adequately assign returning trained researchers to
activities as their abilities would demand; and (iv) to put in place a personnel evaluation
system.



iv
D. Future Operation
8.    At present the GOB is preparing a new proposal for financing by IDB, and if
approved it would not be fully operational until year 2000. At the time of the preparation
of this ICR, the mission had the opportunity to analyze the concept document for this
proposal. It noted that the document did not address several critical issues, and therefore,
in the mission's opinion was not adequate to the sector's needs. Besides, even if an
adequate strategy is defined and implemented, the time lag towards implementation is
critical, since many of the achievements of this project may be lost in the meantime.
E. Key Lessons Learned
9.    The key lessons learned from the project are as follows:
(a) because of their long term nature, research programs require long term
Government commitment that is maintained despite changes in Government;
(b) well defined research programs that are focussed in critical areas can be very
effective in getting results;
(c) continuing changes in local project management severely handicaps
implementation;
(d) salary scales should be kept in line with those in other parts of Civil Service,
otherwise there would be an increased political interference in the appointment
of the agency staff and not enough attention would be paid to professional
qualifications;
(e) management and technical staff selection criteria, should be respected.
(f) project risks identified at appraisal should be closely monitored and credible
solutions found if those risks do materialize; and
(g) project management and M&E capacity are key elements for project
performance.

PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Introduction
1.   With an estimated population of seven million, Bolivia was, and continues to be
among the poorest countries in Latin America. The New Economic Policy which was
initiated in 1985 stabilized the economy after a five year period of economic decline and
hyperinflation. At the time of project preparation about 50 percent of the population in
Bolivia was rural with over two million people in extreme poverty in the rural areas of
the Altiplano, Valleys and Yungas. In these areas, where the basic foodstuffs, i.e.,
potatoes, maize, wheat, barley, quinua and livestock, are produced, agricultural
productivity had stagnated. Public spending in agricultural research was extremely low,
being less than 0.2 percent of AgGDP.
2.  IDA's strategy for Bolivia's agricultural sector aimed to support the market and
private sector-oriented agricultural development policy of the GOB. This included:
(i) the consolidation of macroeconomic stability; (ii) increased efficiency and investment;
(iii) the generation of employment and increased incomes for the poor; and (iv) the
provision of social services as targeted interventions to underserved populations.
Specifically, IDA's strategy was geared to improving the productivity of the more
traditional crops and areas, and with the long term goal of strengthening the system of
technology generation and agricultural extension. Earlier IDA projects in rural
development were focused on the larger scale commercial productive sector, and faced
serious implementation problems due to their complexity, coupled with general economic
and political instability, shortage of counterpart funds, and rapid changes in political
appointments. However, at the time of appraisal, the country was experiencing greater
stability, and an atmosphere more conducive to establishing viable projects.
A. Project Objectives and Description
3.   Project's Objectives. The project had two main objectives: to improve the overall
efficiency of research and extension and to directly support technology development in
the highland agricultural sector. This would be accomplished by: (i) establishing a
Consejo Nacional de Investigaci6n y Extensi6n Agropecuaria (CNIEA) to more
effectively coordinate those activities in the country as a whole; and (ii) strengthening the
national agricultural research agency, the Instituto Boliviano de Tecnologia Agropecuaria
(IBTA), and focus its efforts on developing technology suitable for small holders in the
target areas of the Altiplano, Valleys and Yungas, where the majority of the poor reside.



2
4.   Project Description. The proposed credit would fund institutional support for;
CNIEA and IBTA, a limited amount of infrastructure, IBTA salaries for a limited time,
and studies to determine the future agricultural extension system. IBTA's research
programs were to be restructured and strengthened on a commodity basis. This new
IBTA would have responsibility for developing agricultural production, processing and
marketing technology, and for demonstrating its feasibility in the following commodities;
potatoes, cameloids, sheep and forage, maize, wheat and barley, grain legumes and
quinoa.
5.   Major project components included: (i) support of CNIEA for the coordination
and monitoring national agricultural research and extension activities, evaluation of new
activities, advising the MACA' on the status of current activities, and commission of
relevant sector studies; (ii) reorganization of IBTA to focus on technology generation
and adaptation, improvement of its strategic and operational planning, provision of more
efficient support and services to research and field staff, and improvement of personnel
policies and management; (iii) training of IBTA staff to improve its capacity to carry out
research; (iv) support to some Research Stations to make them fully operational;
(v) selected research program support; (vi) strategic studies; (vii) external evaluation
of IBTA and CNIEA programs; and (viii) technical assistance to be provided by a
research agency from abroad to provide research program's continuity whilst local staff
were absent on study leave and to advise and assist IBTA in planning and operations.
6.   The total cost of the project was estimated at US$29.8 million equivalent
(Tables 7 and 8). The IDA credit would finance US$21 million (70 percent) of
incremental project costs during a seven-year period. Bilateral financing from
Switzerland's Technical Cooperation Program (COSUDE) would provide US$3.5 million
and the Government of Bolivia (GOB) would finance the balance of US$5.3 million
(18 percent of project costs).
7.   Evaluation of Objectives. The project objectives were clear and realistic. In order
to reform the weak institutional setup it was necessary strengthen research coordination
and policymaking and to strengthen a reduced number of research programs which were
considered to be strategic to poverty reduction and increased agricultural productivity.
Agreements were reached with the Borrower on several critical covenants including that
a qualified management staff which would be appointed and retained for the duration of
the project, unless otherwise agreed with IDA. Objectives were maintained during
implementation but strategies had to be adjusted in response to changes in Borrower
circumstances. With the third amendment the strengthening of CNIEA objective was
dropped and the coordination and policy setting functions for agricultural research and
extension system were to be assumed by the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock
(SNAG) and IBTA.
1 In August 1993 the new Government substituted the Ministry of Agriculture and Campesinos Affairs
(MACA) by the Secretary of Agriculture and Livestock (SNAG). In August 1997, a new Government
changed again from SNAG to the actual Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development
(MAGDR).

8.   The key project risks identified at appraisal were related to those normally
associated with research projects and those, specific to this case. Under the former, it
was recognized that the research programs might not achieve their goals, because of the
uncertain nature of the research process, and that technolcgy transfer to farmers would be
inadequate. Under the latter, the capacity of IBTA and CNIEA to execute and manage a
program of the projected magnitude was uncertain. The measures for minimizing these
risks were inadequate as proven during implementation. As a result the project was
subject to political interference, which was compounded by the insufficient commitment
from the Government to maintain an effective project administration. For example, the
higher salaries paid by the project in order to retain qualified people resulted in increased
pressures for changing management and technical staff positions based on political rather
than professional criteria. Failure in establishing appropriate implementation
arrangements to cope with this problem, resulted in IBTA's effectiveness and prestige
being seriously affected from the beginning.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
9.   The project was partially successful in its technical, and physical objectives but had
little positive impact in terms of institutional and public sector reform.
10.  The project's first objective, to improve the overall efficiency of research and
extension in Bolivia was not met. The CNIEA was organized and met several times
during 1991 and 1992 but it never developed into an effective body. It was perceived by
the sector as the superimposition of an additional layer of bureaucracy. It ceased to
operate in late 1992, and was dropped as a component of the project. SNAG and IBTA
stepped into the vacuum that was created by the demise of CNIEA, and assumed the
responsibility for coordinating research in the sector. Due to continuous political
interference and the resulting changes in administration, the effectiveness of IBTA in this
role was greatly diminished. The management changes created a great deal of
uncertainty and low morale among the staff, both at headquarters and in the field. The
Decentralization Law and the Supreme Decree that regulated it determined in 1997 that
IBTA Central would cease to exist and a complete decentralized, uncoordinated system
emerged under the local Government administration and financial capabilities.
11. Concerning the second objective of supporting technology development in the
highland agricultural sector, the project has produced good results. The selected
commodity research programs had very positive results in spite of the administration
problems. IBTA developed strong programs in potatoes, maize, wheat, quinoa and grain
legumes with newly trained leadership. Its quality, if maintained and/or improved will be
a solid basis on which to build a capable research and extension system in the future.
12. The training of IBTA staff is one of the project's most important achievements. At
the beginning, there were 2 Ph.Ds and 16 M.Sc. working for IBTA. The project financed
the training of 3 additional Ph.Ds and 24 M.Sc. who successfully completed their
programs. These professionals have contributed a lot to the improvement of the quality
of the research programs and hopefully will continue to do so in the future. However, the
potential impact of the returning trainees was reduced as on return to the country they



4
were. not always assigned to appropriate positions as their abilities would demand. Some
left the institute being forced out allegedly for political reasons, or because they were not
being paid according to their capacity.
13.  Three different independent consulting firms reviewed IBTA's activities
recommending changes toward its reorganization. Because of these studies, the Mid-
Term Review was suspended considering that they covered its purpose. Two main
studies "Research Systems for the Tropics" prepared by IICA-CATIE and "A National
System for Technology Transfer" prepared by NRI were completed under project
financing. These studies were the basis for design of new mechanisms for developing
research and extension in Bolivia after the termination of this project. The project also
financed studies on the roles and responsibilities of the various participants as outlined in
the ADL and for the preparation of alternative approaches for the new project to follow
the ATDP. Impact studies have also been completed on the quinoa, potatoes and wheat
programs financed by the project.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
14.  The project has had a poor record of implementation and has been repeatedly rated
as unsatisfactory by the Bank's supervision missions. The project had a considerable
delay in credit effectiveness, which was caused by protracted contractual negotiations
between IBTA and the agency providing technical assistance. Subsequently
implementation was continuously disrupted by changes in management/staff at the
administrative and research leadership levels. Positions were often filled by people who
did not have the corresponding qualifications. The lack of experience of project
coordinators and key personnel, and high turnover in administration were the result of the
GOB's insufficient commitment to project objectives. During the last two years of
implementation, the transfer of the project administration responsibilities from IBTA to
the Project Unit in the MAGDR, accompanied by delays in naming the project
coordinator, and uncertainty for the personnel about their future, resulted in the
stagnation of research programs.
15.  Disbursement of the credit proceeds has been timely and even faster than
anticipated, mainly due to the increased importance of salary payments and other
operational expenses (Category 6). IBTA hired more people to its payroll, creating a top-
heavy bureaucracy at headquarters in La Paz and paid salary levels higher than forecast at
appraisal. Since salaries escalated above those in other parts of Civil Service, there was
an added incentive for interference on the part of politicians to create new posts and
appoint unqualified people. Because of these increases in costs, the Government had
contributed US$3.6 million to the project, by the end of 1995, instead of the
US$1.27 million which had been projected at appraisal. Loan resources in Category 6
had to be refilled through three amendments to the Credit Agreement between 1996 and
1998 to maintain the research activities operational and trained personnel in place, until
the proposed follow-up project which was under preparation would become effective by
late 1997 as was planned.
16. Through the promulgation of the Administrative Decentralization Law (ADL)
which came into effect in 1996, the administration of key public services, including



5
agricultural research with accompanying resources, were transferred to departmental
(pre,`ectura) level. Project executing responsibility was assumed by the Direcci6n
General de Desarrollo Tecnol6gico (DGDT) of the MAGDR. The disappearance of
IBTA before the establishment of a new agricultural research and extension system
resulted in instability and disruption of the research programs in most of the decentralized
regional IBTA's. Efforts were developed to build a working relationship with the
Prefecturas and legal studies carried out to clarify the interpretation of the ADL thereby
helping the transition to the new situation. Although uncertainties remained, the project
support helped to maintain the research system, while preparing a proposal for a
sustainable system under the new legal framework.
17.  Since November 1995, as part of project activities, preparation work, supported by
the Bank, for this sustainable system began. The proposed Sistema Nacional de
Innovacion Tecnol6gica Agropecuaria (SINTA) was designed to work within the
framework of the two laws governing the political and economic administration of the
country (the PPL and ADL). These laws provide for the co-financing of services,
including extension with communities and municipalities, and of agricultural research
through departmental (Prefecturas) budgets. After a year of preparation work, the
SINTA was ready for appraisal (second semester of CY1 997), but the new Government
decided to take a supposedly different approach and is now in the process of defining a
new Sistema Boliviano de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (SIBTA). The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) is supporting and would finance the SIBTA, which is expected
to be operative by the end of 1999. The uncertainty engendered by these changes
contributed to undernine personnel morale and continuity of research programs, thereby
putting in doubt the sustainability of the project.
18. Project costs reached US$28.57 million (95.9 percent of SAR estimates).
Operating costs category including salaries were US$17.12 million (60 percent of project
total costs) and 25 percent over SAR estimates. The lowest disbursing category was
infrastructure which reached 80 percent of planned estimates. COSUDE parallel
financing reached about US$4.86 million (17 percent of total project costs).
19. The project's poor performance reflected a more general implementation problem
with the Bank's portfolio in Bolivia. Political interference and inadequate management,
in spite of Government's promises to ensure maintaining managers with qualifications
and rigorous selection processes, are common factors affecting development objectives.
D. Project Sustainability
20.  Sustainability of project achievements is considered uncertain. The future
sustainability of IBTA's financing was seen as a central issue during implementation and
successive Bank Aide Memoires made reference to this issue. Because of the
decentralization process during the last two years, budget allocations have become
critical. The Prefecturas (with the exception of Tarija) are not meeting their budget
obligations for the financing of agricultural research that is now their responsibility. The
Central Government is not addressing this situation adequately. In most of the cases,
research salaries were significantly reduced and there is not enough budget to execute the
on-going research programs.



6
21.  However, the increased research capacity developed under the project is still
working, although in a limited way, and may provide the basis for the future
transformation of the research and extension systems if the financing is acquired and the
institutional proposals are adequate. The recent creation of PROINPA Foundation
(Fundaci6n para la Promoci6n e Investigaci6n de Productos Andinos), with strong
support of COSUDE and the International Potato Center (CIP), assures sustainability of
one of the best research program supported by the project. Likewise, the PROTRIGO
program for wheat and barley which is supported by CIMMYT is being financed by the
Programa de Ayuda de Seguridad Alimentaria (PASA) for the next three years.
However, it should be noted that this support is entirely from outside donors.
E. Bank Performance
22.  The Bank did not adequately deal with the risks inherent in the design of the project
during appraisal. Early on in the project, the Bank expressed its concern several times
over project performance. By the end of 1993 the Borrower was informed that unless,
swift actions were taken to deal with management problems, it would be very difficult to
the Bank, to justify continuing support for the project. Following that crisis, a qualified
management team was appointed and significant, far reaching actions were agreed on.
Due to the Bank's warnings to the GoB about possible suspension, the new team
remained unchanged for two years showing considerable improvements in performance,
diminished political pressure and improved staff morale. By April 1995 the overall rating
for the project was upgraded to satisfactory and on the basis of that progress the
preparation of a new project was decided.
23.  In order to limit political pressure, the third amendment (1995) introduced several
modifications to the Credit Agreement. For example, some of the new commitments that
were incorporated included: (i) IBTA's salary scale would be reduced in order to avoid
contributing to distort the levels paid in the public sector; (ii) IBTA's staff performance
would be evaluated; and (iii) the appointment or dismissal of all IBTA's staff receiving
salary supplements from IDA's credit, would be done in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.
24. By the end of 1996, because of new management changes, problems began to
surface once again. In hindsight, the Bank was overly patient with the political
interference and poor management decisions taken in the project at this time.
The Bank's attitude to be flexible, in order to gain time until the new project with
completely different institutional arrangements was approved, proved to be unsuccessful.
The follow-up SINTA project appraisal planned for mid-1997 was delayed until the new
Government was in office, but the new project and the Bank's support to it, were
rejected. Because of this outcome, the Bank's overall performnance was rated as
unsatisfactory.
F. Borrower Performance
25. The Borrower's performance was judged by the completion mission and confirmed
with GOB representatives assessment, to be deficient. During preparation, the Borrower

performed well and with the assistance of FAO/CP and Bank Staff, adequate technical,
financial and institutional solutions were proposed. During implementation the project
was badly weakened by the continuous administration changes, and by the failure to keep
in place a sufficiently competent technical and managerial team.
26. Even though the Government accepted several commitments, and in spite of the
continuous supervision efforts, it did not comply with several conditionalities covering
sector policies, institutional development and physical objectives. Some of the most
relevant agreements that were not sufficiently honored were; (i) to accept new staff
management practices based on transparent recruitment and promotion mechanisms;
(ii) to pay an increased share of the higher salaries; (iii) to adequately assign returning
trained researchers to activities, as their abilities would demand; (iv) to put in place a
personnel evaluation system; and (v) to promote the participation of farmers and NGOs
in research management.
G. Assessment of Outcome
27.  The project has been successful in establishing research programs which have
produced several new technologies for basic crops, such as corn, potatoes, wheat, quinoa
and grain legumes, which are produced by small farmers in the resource poor areas of the
Altiplano and Valleys. The positive performance of the training component was also
important as about 27 agricultural scientists received graduate degree training and helped
to improve the quality of the research programs. However, considering that most of its
institutional development, and poverty alleviation objectives show partial or negligible
achievements and the unlikely sustainability of the overall achievements, the overall
assessment of the project's outcome is considered to be unsatisfactory.
H. Future Operation
28.  Bolivia's pervasive poverty is the GOB's most serious challenge since 70 percent
of the population and 94 percent of the rural people, is poor. As part of the poverty
alleviation strategy, increasing agricultural productivity is critical. This would require:
(i) increasing investment in human capital; (ii) greater access to quality land; (iii) the
adoption of new technologies; and (iv) improving rural infrastructure. With the
administrative decentralization of the country, a new system for the support and delivery
of agricultural services including extension, needs to be put in place that would ensure a
smooth transition to a decentralized system. This system would have to be responsive to
the demands of the sector and should integrate and sustain these activities nationwide.
29.   In June 1998, the Government prepared an outline Strategy for rural and
Agricultural Development that needs to be developed further to indicate priorities and
institutional roles and responsibilities. The new proposals are still under preparation and
it seems that if financed, they would not be fully operational until 2000. At the time of
the preparation of this ICR, the mission had the opportunity to analyze the concept

de Politica Social, Mapa de Pobreza, UDAPSO, La Paz 1994.

document for this proposal. It noted that the document did not address several critical
issues, and therefore, in the mission's opinion was not adequate to the sector's needs.
Besides, even if an adequate strategy is defined and implemented, the time lag towards
implementation is critical, since many of the achievements of this project may be lost in
the meantime. Moreover, resources directed to agricultural research (including external
support) are still among the lowest in Latin America, and have been consistently less than
0.5 percent of AgGDP. There are virtually no public funds committed to agricultural
extension, thereby limiting the potential effects of a good research program.
I. Key Lessons Learned
30.  The key lessons learned from the project are as follows:
(a) because of their long term nature, research programs require long term
Government commitment that is maintained despite changes in Government;
(b) well defined research programs that are focussed in critical areas can be very
effective in getting results;
(c) continuing changes in local project management severely handicaps
implementation;
(d) salary scales should be kept in line with those in other parts of Civil Service,
otherwise there would be an increased political interference in the appointment
of the agency staff and not enough attention would be paid to professional
qualifications;
(e) management and technical staff selection criteria, should be respected;
(f) project risks identified at appraisal should be closely monitored and credible
solutions found if those risks do materialize; and
(g) project management and M&E capacity are key elements for project
performance.

PROYECTO DE DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO
AGROPECUARIO (CR. 2216-BO)
MISION DE CIERRE
Noviembre 30- Diciembre 10, 1998
1. Una misi6n del Banco Mundial integrada por el Sr. Matthew McMahon (Task
Manager) y Juan Morelli (Economista Agricola, Consultor) visit6 Bolivia entre el 30
de noviembre y el 10 de diciembre de 1998, a los efectos de realizar la misi6n de
cierre del Proyecto de Desarrollo Tecnologico Agropecuario (PDTA). Fueron
visitadas las regionales de Cochabamba y Tarija, y se mantuvieron reuniones con los
responsables de la Intervencion del IBTA-La Paz, PROTRIGO y la recientemente
creada Fundaci6n PROINPA. Asimismo se mantuvieron reuniones con personal y/o
representantes del Vice-Ministerio de Inversi6n Publica del Ministerio de Hacienda,
Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Desarrollo Rural (MAGDR) y de la Agencia
Suiza para el Desarrollo y la Cooperaci6n (COSUDE). La misi6n agradece la
colaboraci6n prestada por el Ing. Gonzalo Romero, Director General de Desarrollo
Tecnol6gico del MAGDR, el Ing. Efrain Pozo, el personal de la Unidad Ejecutora del
Proyecto y por los diversos cientificos e investigadores del ex-IBTA.
EVALUACION PRELIMINAR
Los Objetivos del Proyecto
2. El objetivo general del proyecto era mejorar la eficiencia del desarrollo tecnol6gico
agropecuario de Bolivia, con enfasis en el altiplano y los valles interandinos, donde la
mayor parte de la poblaci6n rural pobre de Bolivia reside. Para ello, la estrategia se
bas6 en: (i) establecer mecanismos de coordinacion entre las diversas agencias
nacionales, departamentales, publicas, semipuiblicas y privadas que actuaban en la
investigaci6n y/o extensi6n, (ii) concentrar y revitalizar las acciones que venia
desarrollando el IBTA sobre la base de un nihinero limitado de actividades
agropecuarias de importancia para la poblaci6n objetivo, y (iii) identificar
mecanismos para el disenio de un proyecto subsiguiente que continuaria mejorando la
eficiencia del sistema de desarrollo tecnol6gico sectorial.
Logros en Torno a los Objetivos
3. La mision considera que los objetivos y estrategias originales del PDTA eran
adecuados y realistas. Era necesario coordinar esfuerzos escasos y dispersos entre las
instituciones del sistema y fortalecer al IBTA, concentrando sus actividades en

aquellas mas relevantes para el desarrollo tecnol6gico en las regiones problema, para
que una vezjerarquizada la funci6n y la instituci6n, poder encarar objetivos mAs
amnbiciosos en un proyecto subsiguiente. El proyecto tuvo exitos y fracasos. Entre los
exitos del proyecto se puede mencionar el incremento de la capacidad tecnica del
sistema de generaci6n de tecnologia y la puesta en marcha de programas de
investigaci6n en torno a productos basicos y criticos para impulsar el desarrollo de
las regiones del altiplano y valles andinos. Por otra parte, el PDTA fracas6 en su
intento de coordinar at sistema de generaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia en el pais
y de consolidar institucionalmente las actividades de generacion de tecnologia.
Tampoco logr6 el compromiso necesario del Gobiemo de Bolivia (GOB) para que
asuma sus responsabilidades de orientador, coordinador y financiador de actividades
como las involucradas, que apuntan a objetivos sociales de alivio a la pobreza y de
producci6n de bienes publicos no apropiables.
Factores que Afectaron ta Implementaci6n
4. La misi6n considera que la implementaci6n del PDTA se vio seriamente afectada por
un insuficiente compromiso real de las sucesivas administraciones del GOB con los
objetivos del proyecto. Ello se manifest6 en una falta de visi6n de largo plazo
respecto al desarrollo y el financiamiento del sistema y en la constante interferencia
de intereses politicos de corto plazo en la selecci6n del personal t6cnico. En el abmbito
de los programas de investigaci6n, las presiones politicas que tambien afectaron la
eficiencia en la utilizaci6n de los recursos financieros y humanos, no impidieron sin
embargo, que se lograran progresos significativos en la capacidad tecnica y relevancia
de los programas priorizados. Hoy existe una mayor capacidad, conocimientos y
recomendaciones tecnol6gicas desarrollados por el proyecto, los que constituyen nma
base significativamente superior a la original para encarar su fortalecimiento.
5. La administraci6n del proyecto se caracteriz6 por la inestabilidad funcional tanto en
el ambito central como de las regionales y en la coordinaci6n de los programnas. La
excesiva rotaci6n del personal de administraci6n del PDTA, incluyendo en muchcs
casos, personal no capacitado para la funci6n, quit6 continuidad y coherencia al
proyecto y deriv6 en un ambiente laboral con limitaciones para las actividades de los
investigadores. En demasiadas ocasiones, el personal capacitado en el exterior, no era
reconocido funcionalmente a su retomo e inclusive separado del cargo por razones
politicas como resultado de la mencionada falta de continuidad en la administracion y
la continua injerencia politica indebida.
6. Durante 1995 se promulg6 la Ley de Descentralizaci6n, mediante la cual se deriv6 un
conjunto de responsabilidades desde el gobierno central a las Prefecturas
departamentales, incluyendo la ejecuci6n de las funciones de generaci6n y
transferencia de tecnologia. Como consecuencia de ello, el IBTA dej6 de existir en
1997, transfiriendose todas las instalaciones, el personal tecnico y de apoyo de las
regionales y la responsabilidad de su financiamiento a las Prefecturas. Estos cambios
institucionales modificaron drasticamente la situaci6n original sobre la cual estaba

BOLIVIA. PROYECTO DE DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO AGROPECUARIO (CR. 2Z26-BO)
MISION DE CIERRE. Noviembre 30- Diciembre 10, 1998
disefiado el proyecto. Para adecuarse a esa nueva realidad y con el objetivo de
procurar la sostenibilidad del sistema de generaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia, el
MAGDR con el apoyo del PDTA y del Banco Mundial realiz6 una serie de estudios
que resultaron en una propuesta de creaci6n del Sistemra Nacional de Innovaci6n
Tecnologica Agropecuaria (SINTA). Esta propuesta se basaba en las leyes de
Descentralizacion Administrativa y Participaci6n Popular y tenia como objetivo
principal la sostenibilidad tecnica y financiera del sistema. Posteriormente con el
cambio de gobierno de agosto de 1997, la propuesta del SINTA fue rechazada por las
nuevas autoridades. En los iultimos meses el MAGDR viene elaborando una nueva
propuesta, el Sistema Boliviano de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (SIBTA), cuya
conceptualizaci6n se presenta en el Anexo 1, la que se elevaria para su financiamiento
al Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) durante 1999. Los mencionados
acontecimientos, contribuyeron significativamente a la inestabilidad y falta de
orientaciones claras para el sistema, afectando tambidn a la implementacion del
PDTA en sus ultimos dos anos.
7. Durante la implementaci6n, la administraci6n del IBTA determin6 aumentos
salariales y la incorporaci6n de personal adicional por encima de lo convenido
originalmente. De las cinco enmiendas realizadas al convenio de credito, las dos
primeras debieron flexibilizar fechas de los compromisos originales y las otras tres,
reasignar recursos hacia las categorias de costos operativos, incluyendo salarios. Estas
ultimas se aceptaron con el objeto de impedir la suspensi6n de actividades por falta de
recursos para gastos operativos y permitir la continuidad de los programas de
investigaci6n. Como resultado de estas instancias, la categoria de costos operativos
que se previ6 utilizaria el 43% de los recursos del pr6stamo. termin6 insumiendo el
62% del credito. En contrapartida, las categorias de inversiones en infraestructura.
equipamiento, asistencia tecnica y capacitaci6n, debieron ser reducidas respecto a sus
montos originales.
8. La opini6n del MAGDR es que debido a "la excesiva permeabilidad del sistema a los
efectos de cambios de gobierno, se generaron efectos negativos en la estabilidad
institucional y del personal profesional, los que a su turno afectaron la eficiencia del
IBTA en su capacidad de generar tecnologia". Asimismo, "la falta de una gerencia y
administraci6n eficiente cre6 condiciones limitantes, como la asignaci6n insuficiente
e inoportuna de recursos financieros a los proyectos de investigaci6n, para una
performance optima de los recursos humanos calificados"'. El GOB reconoce
tambien como logros significativos del proyecto: (i) la capacitacion de los recursos
tecnicos del sistema;. (ii) el desarrollo de varios programas de investigaci6n; y (iii)
los estudios realizados en torno a la identificaci6n de propuestas para un nuevo
sistema de desarrollo tecnol6gico descentralizado donde el sector privado tendra una
mayor participaci6n y responsabilidad en su desenvolvimiento.

investigaci6n de papa (PROINPA) que es el componente por ellos financiado, log-6

MISION DE CIERRE. Noviembre 30- Diciembre 10, 1998
los objetivos buscados al no haber habido interferencia politica indebida en los
nombrarnientos del personal involucrado en el programa. Consideran ademas que la
sostenibilidad de los logros del PROINPA es altamente probable debido a que ante la
disolucion del IBTA y sobre la base del programa, se constituy6 una estructura
institucional moderna, competitiva y aut6noma, la Fundaci6n PROINPA, cuyo nuevo
significado es Promocion e Investigaci6n de Productos Andinos. Es una fundaci6n
privada sin fines de lucro y con participaci6n estatal en su direcci6n, que reforzara en
primera instancia sus actividades de generaci6n, validacion y transferencia de
teenologia en torno a la cadena agroalimentaria de la papa. Progresivamente
incorporarian otros productos andinos empezando con la cadena de la quinua. ParaL su
financiamiento, se reforzaran las sinergias ya establecidas (COSUDE cubre mas del
70% de su presupuesto actual) y se desarrollaran otras con el MAGDR, con otros
cooperantes internacionales, centros y redes internacionales, Universidades, ONGs,
Prefecturas, Municipios, sector privado, etc.
Sostenibilidad
10. La misi6n considera que con la excepci6n del PROINPA y del programa de
investigaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia en trigo (PROTRIGO), la sostenibilidad
del proyecto a la luz del avance actual de las propuestas que vienen siendo
consideradas, es incierta. Actualmente las tareas de generaci6n y transferencia de
tecnologia agropecuaria se encuentran bajo la responsabilidad de las prefecturas
departamentales: sostenida con recursos regionales que son escasos y que responden a
prioridades regionales y no a las nacionales. Bajo el esquema de descentralizaci6n, es
obvio que ninguna prefectura podri invertir a los niveles 6ptimos de acuerdo a los
intereses nacionales. Por ende siempre es necesario que exista una estrategia nacional
para asegurar una eficiente inversi6n en esta area. En la actualidad, la falta de una
estrategia claramente definida, que incluya mecanismos de coordinaci6n y los
compromisos financieros correspondientes, ha resultado en inestabilidad institucional
en el sistema, desaliento y fuga masiva de personal altamente capacitado2. Si bien se
viene trabajando en la formulaci6n del SIBTA, su puesta en marcha seria, en el mejor
de los casos hacia fines de 1999, siendo poco probable que para ese entonces se
mantenga todo el capital humano formado con el apoyo del proyecto. Los progranias
de trigo y papa tendrian ascgurada su continuidad, al menos por tres afios, sobre la
base de la fundaci6n PROINPA co-financiada por COSUDE y del PROTRIGO co-
financiado por el Programa de Ayuda de Seguridad Alimentaria (PASA).
11. La mayor parte de las necesidades de investigaci6n agropecuaria en Bolivia Se
caracteriza por constituir las tecnologias bienes piublicos sin derecho propietario. E'or
ende, cualquier estrategia nacional deberia tomar esa realidad en cuenta y
comprometer el rol del estado en el financiamiento de la investigaci6n y
transferencia. La misi6n considera que la propuesta SIBTA no es suficientemente
2 Se esta gestionando un prestamo no reembolsable con el BID para retener a unos 30 investigadores que
habrian abandonado o lo estarian por hacer por razones econ6micas (bajos salarios), hasta que entre el
SIBTA a operar.

clara respecto al compromiso del financiamiento estatal, una vez terminado el
financiamiento externo. El sistema descentralizado propuesto institucionaliza la falta
de coordinaci6n y duplicaci6n de esfuerzos entre las cuatro fundaciones a ser creadas.
Estas por necesidad deberan responder en forma creciente a las cada vez mas escasas
fuentes externas de financiamiento y menos a las necesidades de generar bienes de
caracter publico y/o conducentes a solucionar los problemas de los campesinos.
Evatuacion de los Resultados Obtenidos
12. El objetivo de fortalecimiento de la capacidad tecnica del sistema fue alcanzado en
gran parte. Las evaluaciones de impacto desarrolladas para los programas de quinia,
papa y trigo muestran resultados positivos. La capacidad tecnica cientifica
desarrollada por el programa de capacitaci6n se evidencia en el analisis de la calidad
de los resultados que se vienen obteniendo en la mayor parte de los programas
financiados por el proyecto. Sin embargo la pdrdida de investigadores por razones
politicas y/o econ6micas y la demora en definir la estrategia de desarrollo y politicas
respecto al futuro del sistema, deterrninan un grado de incertidumbre preocupante.
13. Con relaci6n a los objetivos de politicas sectoriales, que involucraba la creaci6n de
una instancia de coordinaci6n de la investigaci6n y extensi6n sectorial, indispensable
para mejorar la eficiencia del sistema, los resultados han sido insatisfactorios. El
Consejo Nacional de Investigaci6n y Extensi6n Agropecuaria que se propuso crear,
solo funcion6 durante el primer afno. En 1993 dichas funciones fueron delegadas al
IBTA, funciones que nunca logr6 asumir. Como consecuencia de su mala
administraci6n, el IBTA continu6 desprestigiandose y fue posteriormente disuelto
como instituci6n. El propuesto SIBTA que probablemente sea implementado, al
momento actual solo existe como concepto. Asimismo, en lo que tiene que ver con
los objetivos institucionales del PDTA, que previeron fortalecer al IBTA y concentrar
sus esfuerzos en desarrollar tecnologias seleccionadas para el altiplano y valles
andinos, se lograron los objetivos en forma parcial. Se fortalecieron las estaciones
regionales del IBTA, tanto en capacidad tecnica, calidad de programas de
investigaci6n e infraestructura. Sin embargo, la sostenibilidad de esos logros es
considerada incierta debido a las razones mencionadas.
14. Con relaci6n a los objetivos de mejoramiento de la capacidad de gesti6n puiblica, el
proyecto tampoco fue exitoso. Finalmente, el objetivo de identificar mecanismos
claros para mejorar la ericiencia del desarrollo tecnol6gico sectorial, se considera que
fue alcanzado en forma parcial. En efecto, con el apoyo del proyecto se lleg6 a
elaborar una propuesta y proyecto de investigaci6n y extensi6n (el SINTA) que daxia
continuidad al proceso a partir del cierre del PDTA, pero ellos fueron descartados por
el actual gobierno. Sin embargo. sirvieron de base para la nueva propuesta que seria
implementado a partir de fines de 1999 con financiamiento del BID.

BOLIVIA. PROYECTO DE DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO AGROPECUARIO (CR. 2216-BO)
MISION DE CIERRE. Noviembre 30- Diciembre 10, 1998
la puesta en marcha de programas de investigaci6n s6lidos y confiables como en
papa, trigo. maiz, leguminosas, quinua, etc., los resultados obtenidos por el proyecto
en su totalidad con relaci6n a sus objetivos originales, no son satisfactorios.
PROXIMAS ETAPAS DE LA EVALUACION
16. El Banco no ha recibido aun el levantamiento de las observaciones al Informe de
Auditoria del ejercicio 1996, que con la anterior misi6n de junio de 1998, se acordara
enviar en forma perentoria. Tampoco se ha recibido el Informe de Auditoria
correspondiente al ejercicio 1997 cuyo plazo de presentaci6n venci6 el pasado 30 de
junio. La misi6n mantuvo reuniones con los funcionarios de la Unidad Ejecutora y
con los Auditores contratados para preparar los mencionados informes y el
correspondiente a 1998, acordandose su presentaci6n conjunta antes del 31 de enero
de 1999. Se reitera la urgencia en cumplir con dicha fecha limite por el riesgo
inrninente de afectar los desembolsos del Banco en el marco de otros proyectos que el
GOB viene implementando.
17. Con referencia a] informe de evaluaci6n desde el punto de vista del Prestatario, se
acord6 enviar el Resumen Ejecutivo de no mas de 10 paginas antes del 31 de enero de
1999. El contenido de dicho resumen deberia incluir: (i) su evaluaci6n de los
objetivos originales, del diserlo, de la implementaci6n y de la operaci6n del proyecto
(etapa que se inicio a partir del 31 de octubre pasado en que se cerr6 la etapa de
implementaci6n); (ii) su evaluaci6n de la gestion del Prestatario y del ejecutor (IBTA)
durante la evoluci6n e implementaci6n del proyecto, con 6nfasis en las lecciones
resultantes que puedan ser relevantes para futuras operaciones; y (iii) su evaluaci6n
de la actuaci6n del Banco y de COSUDE durante la evoluci6n e implementaci6n del
proyecto, incluyendo un juicio sobre la efectividad del relacionamiento con el GOB y
el IBTA, con enfasis en las lecciones relevantes para el futuro.
18. Considerando que el futuro de la generacion y transferencia de tecnologia en Bolivia
estarA pautado por el SIBTA que viene siendo estructurado, no existe un Plan
Operativo para la fase operacional del PDTA. En su lugar, el Prestatario le ha
proporcionado a la mision el documento de propuesta del SIBTA que se incluye en el
Anexo a esta Ayuda Memoria.

(CONVENIO DE CREDITO 2216 BO)
PRESENTACION
El presente documento es el Resumen Ejecutivo del Informe Final Tecnico o la parte
tecnica del Informe Final de Evaluaci6n del Prestatario (IFE) sobre el Proyecto de Desarrollo de
Tecnologia Agropecuaria (PDTA) del Convenio de Credito 2216 BO, firmado entre el Gobierno
de Bolivia y la Asociaci6n Intemacional de Fomento (AIF) el 16 de Abril de 1991.
Este resumen incluye acapites sobre los logros alcanzados, los factores que afectaron la
implementaci6n del proyecto, la sustentabilidad esperada, el desempefio del BM y del Prestatario,
los principales resultados, y las lecciones aprendidas en el proceso de implementaci6n y ejecuci6n
del proyecto. La informaci6n tecnica sobre los programas de investigaci6n se la obtuvo del
Informe Final Tecnico de Cierre (IFC) en inextenso -que tambien sera entregado al BM- y que
contiene siete gestiones agricolas (1991 a 1998), aunque estas involucran un mayor nuimero de
afios de trabajo sacrificado generando tecnologia agropecuaria.
Pese a los efectos negativos de las malas administraciones del IBTA Central e IBTA's
Regionales, debido a injerencia politico-partidista que afect6 a la instituci6n en los ultimos seis
afios y que ha sido de conocimiento general, los programas nacionales de investigaci6n supieron
sacar adelante un proceso de innovaci6n tecnol6gica que se vio traducido en incrementos en los
rendimientos, debido principalmente a una mejora sustancial de las practicas de manejo de
cultivos, el uso de semilla de calidad, el manejo y cria de ganado camelido y ovino, la sanidad de
suelos, el uso de implementos agricolas mejorados, la mejor organizaci6n comunal, la adecuada
infraestructura productiva y otros rubros por parte de los pequefios productores de la zona andina
de Bolivia.
Por consiguiente, la informaci6n contenida en este documento sirve para entender que el
esfuerzo de los siete afios agricolas que dur6 el PDTA, si tuvo exito en lo que a impacto tecnico-
cientifico y a capacitaci6n cientifica-academica se refiere, aunque administrativamente este
proyecto no fue id6neamente conducido por las razones que se detallan en el presente documento.
Este resumen ejecutivo es un producto del Prestatario, por lo que el BM debera dar su
opini6n y comentarios al respecto. Complementariamente un informe sobre la parte econ6mica-
financiera del proyecto sera presentada oportunamente.

CAPITULO I. RESUMEN EJECUTIVO
1.1 INTRODUCCION
El 4 de abril de 1991, mediante Decreto Supremo NO 22768, fue autorizada la suscripci6n de un
convenio internacional de credito, 2216 BO, para la ejecuci6n del Proyecto de Desarrollo de Tecnologia
Agropecuaria (PDTA). El 16 de abril de 1991, el Gobierno de la Repuiblica de Bolivia y la Asociaci6n
Intemacional de Fomento (AIF) del Banco Mundial (BM) suscribieron dicho convenio, estableciendose en
la secci6n 2.03 del citado convenio, el 31 de octubre de 1998 como fecha de conclusi6n. A partir de 1992 el
proyecto fue implementado, con siete Programas Nacionales de Investigaci6n, Papa, Quinua, Trigo y
Cereales Menores, Leguminosas de Grano, Ganaderia y Forrajes, Maiz, y el Centro de Germoplasma
Riberalta. El Programa Frutales y Hortalizas y el Centro de Germoplasma, Sapecho fueron incorporados al
PDTA recien en 1995.
El 28 de Julio de 1995, el gobierno de Bolivia, promulg6 la Ley 1654 de Descentralizaci6n
Administrativa, que en su articulo 25, mandaba disolver las entidades descentralizadas sin fines de lucro
como el IBTA. Sin embargo, seguin el articulo 99 del Decreto Supremo N0 24206 de la misma Ley, el
PDTA que estaba siendo ejecutado por el IBTA Central y que tenia financiamiento extemo del BM debia
mantenerse bajo responsabilidad del IBTA Central hasta su conclusi6n segun las condiciones acordadas
con la AIF.
Estas Leyes y Decretos, provocaron el cierre de operaciones y la desaparici6n del IBTA Central a
fines de Julio de 1997 como instituci6n descentralizada, aut6noma y con personeria juridica;
contrariamente facultaron a los IBTA's Regionales, creados por la Ley de Descentralizaci6n y dependientes
de las prefecturas, a hacerse cargo de los programas de investigaci6n, los centros experimentales y los
recursos fisicos y humanos del IBTA.
Finalmente el 31 de octubre de 1998 el PDTA fue oficialmente culminado y la desaparici6n del
IBTA fue consumada. Sin embargo meses antes del cierre oficial del PDTA, en reuniones conjuntas entre
la Coordinaci6n Nacional del PDTA y los representantes del Banco Mundial establecieron en documentos
Ayudas Memorias, la elaboraci6n de un Informe Final de Evaluacion (IFE) que represente el criterio del
Gobierno de Bolivia (GOB) con relaci6n al Proyecto.
A continuaci6n se presenta el resumen ejecutivo del Informe Final Tecnico o Informe Final de
Cierre de la parte tdcnica.
1.2 CUERPO PRINCIPAL
1.2.1 OBJETIVOS DEL PROYECTO
Mejorar la eficiencia general del desarrollo de tecnologia agricola en Bolivia, con especial enfasis en las
areas altas rurales donde residen la mayoria de los pobres.



31
Appendix B                                                                         Page 6
Fortalecer el sistema de generaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia agropecuaria, para los rubros
tradicionales de procducci6n.
Para el logro de estos objetivos, el proyecto debia implementar las siguientes estrategias:
(i) Establecer un mecanismo para mejorar la coordinaci6n de varias agencias ya existentes
dedicadas a la extensi6n y a la investigaci6n privada, semi-privada, departamental y nacional. Esto se
refiere al Consejo Nacional de Investigaci6n y extension Agropecuaria (CNIEA);
(ii) Revitalizar y enfocar claramente los esfuerzos del IBTA en un nuimero limitado de programas
de importancia para las tierras altas; Papa, Ganaderia y Forrajes, Trigo y Cereales Menores, Quinua, Maiz,
Leguminosas de Grano, Frutales y Hortalizas, y Germoplasma; y
(iii) Identificar mecanismos y disefiar un proyecto de seguimiento para mejorar auin mas la
eficiencia de la difusi6n de tecnologias.
1.2.2 LOGROS ALCANZADOS
Para el analisis de estos se ha considerado los siguientes parametros u objetivos:
(i) Politicas sectoriales (disefio e implementaci6n de un mecanismo -CNIEA- para una mejor
coordinaci6n de la investigaci6n y extensi6n agropecuaria en el pais);
(ii) metas fisicas (obras civiles realizadas, equipos y vehiculos incorporados, personas capacitadas,
postgrados logrados, proyectos completados, publicaciones, incremento de rendimientos fisicos o de
precios medios como resultado de mejoras en calidad, ensayos de validaci6n y programas de entrenamiento
a extensionistas, etc.);
(iii) objetivos financieros y econ6micos (estimaci6n de incremento de ingresos de beneficiarios
tipo, TIR y VAN econ6micos del proyecto);
(iv) desarrollo institucional del IBTA para desarrollar tecnologias apropiadas para minifundios de
las tierras altas, etc.;
(v) objetivos sociales;
(vi) objetivos ambientales, etc.
Con respecto a los parametros i, ii, iii, iv, v, y vi
(i) El proyecto no logr6 impacto alguno en las politicas sectoriales, y el CNIEA no se consolid6
como tal porque no recibi6 el apoyo de las instancias politicas correspondientes -Ministerio de Agricultura,
de Hacienda, etc.- porque se creia que era una entidad bur6cratica simplemente.
(ii) El proyecto alcanz6 un exito parcial en el aspecto de infraestructura ffsica. Si bien se equiparon
parcialmente las estaciones experimentales y por ende los programas de investigaci6n con vehiculos,

Appendix B                                                                            Page 7
equipcs (computadoras, impresoras, etc.) y maquinaria (trilladoras, tractores, etc.), otra parte del
presupuesto fue utilizado en la refaccion y remodelaci6n de edificios y ambientes de la Unidad Central del
IBTA en la ciudad de La Paz, donde esta unidad funcion6 en los ultimos afios del proyecto. Sin embargo,
un aspecto que cabe destacar fue la capacitaci6n del personal tecnico del IBTA. Desde el punto de vista de
impacto, este quiza ha sido el componente mas importante puesto que los recursos humanos capacitados
podran desarrollar sus capacidades y conocimientos inclusive despues de la finalizaci6n del proyecto,
dentro el nuevo sistema boliviano de investigaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia. Las personas capacitadas -
la mayoria de ellas con grado de maestria y doctorado- seran en definitiva la medula cervical de la
estructura de la investigaci6n agropecuaria en Bolivia, y podran desarrollar sus potencialidades en el
SIBTA siempre y cuando este sea eficiente, competitivo y sin injerencias politicas. Respecto a lo generado
por el proyecto en terminos de estudios y publicaciones, existe un detalle pormenorizado por programas en
el informe inextenso final tecnico de cierre de proyecto. Tambien hay una descripcion del incremento en
rendimientos de los cultivos debido a la aplicaci6n de tecnologias mejoradas. Sin embargo, el incremento
en rendimientos es una variable complicada porque no se puede estandarizar para todos los casos -estratos
de agricultores- ni zonas homogeneas de producci6n, esto debido a la heterogeneidad de los sistemas de
producci6n campesinos. Esta es la razon por la cual la mayoria de los programas no mencionan porcentajes
promedios de incremento en el rendimiento, pero si detallan laoferta tecnol6gica y el estado o proceso en
que el que se encuentran las tecnologias -validaci6n, adopci6n, difusi6n, etc-. El informe final tecnico,
incluye una descripci6n de los logros alcanzados en t6rminos de generaci6n de tecnologia, pero no asi del
impacto a nivel de comunidades campesinas. Y es justamente en este punto en el que se origina una
controversia porque mientras el Banco Mundial exigio o esper6 encontrar impacto en el area rural como
producto del trabajo de los programas, el componente de Transferencia de Tecnologia no fue incluido en el
proyecto original, por lo tanto los programas no tuvieron presupuesto para planificar actividades de
transferencia de tecnologia en comunidades campesinas. Los documentos generados, caso informes
anuales, semestrales, trimestrales, de trabajo, memorias institucionales, compendios manuales, articulos
cientificos, documentos de divulgaci6n, boletines tecnicos, etc., son una fuente invalorable de informacion
que ha sido generada por el proyecto y que no tiene parang6n con otras organizaciones puiblicas o privadas
en el pais. Es, por lo tanto, un producto fisico tambien resaltable que significa un logro importante
alcanzado por el proyecto.
(iii) Respecto a los objetivos financieros y econ6micos, debido la ausencia del componente de
trasferencia de tecnologia en el proyecto original, la medici6n de metas econ6micas es algo contradictorio.
Los dos trabajos conocidos de consultoria sobre impacto econ6mico Ilevados a cabo en quinua y papa,
deberian haberse imitado en los otros rubros -maiz, ganaderia, leguminosas, frutales y hortalizas, etc.- para
conocer los incrementos monetarios en los sistemas de producci6n campesinos afectados por las mejoras
tecnol6gicas generadas por los programas. Sin embargo, y reiterando la inexistencia del componente de
transferencia de tecnologia, no se deben esperar impactos econ6micos significativos a nivel rural en este
periodo de siete afios no por una falencia en la generaci6n de tecnologia en los centros de investigaci6n del
ex-IBTA por parte de los programas nacionales sino por incongruencias en los terminos de referencia del
proyecto original como es el caso de la carencia del componente de transferencia de tecnologia. La oferta
tecnol6gica esta dada, lo que queda es hacer uso de ella al inmediato plazo para evitar que se desactualicen
y queden obsoletas sin antes haber sido adoptadas por los agricultores. La investigaci6n agricola es
dinamica y debe ir ligada a la transferencia de tecnologia para medir su eficacia, realismo y principalmente
su aplicabilidad en fincas de agricultores.

(iv) El IBTA no tuvo un desarrollo institucional adecuado. Si bien el Convenio de Credito 2216
BO contribuy6 en gran medida al fortalecimiento del IBTA, trajo consigo una serie de problemas
administrativos causados por la injerencia politico-partidista que afect6 a esta instituci6n debido
principalmente al nivel salarial existente y a las opciones de trabajo que se generaron con los recursos
econ6micos del convenio. Lastimosamente, y a pesar de que el documento escrito del Convenio asi lo
estipulaba, los reglamentos para contrataci6n de personal tecnico, administrativo y particularmente
ejecutivo para garantizar los niveles acad6micos y de responsabilidad de los profesionales agr6nomos, y
muchos otros aspectos no fueron respetados y por el contrario fueron ignorados. La injerencia politica
puso de manifiesto, una vez mas, la permeabilidad y vulnerabilidad del sistema a los cambios de
gobierno. El IBTA no fortaleci6 sus unidades de investigaci6n, por el contrario algunos centros
quedaron a merced del magro presupuesto local asignado por el gobierno. A pesar de existir
infraestructura esta no fue refaccionada, implementada ni ampliada para un mejor desenvolvimiento de
los investigadores, t6cnicos y obreros encargados de la generaci6n de tecnologias apropiadas para los
agricultores de las tierras altas.
(v) Excepto en el caso de los agricultores que se beneficiaron, adoptando y adaptando
tecnologias mejoradas y apropiadas, los objetivos sociales del proyecto no se alcanzaron. Las razones
tienen diverso origen, pero el mas importante quizA el hecho de la monodisciplinariedad que tuvo el
proyecto. Para alcanzar impactos sociales, no solamente basta implementar un proyecto agricola como el
PDTA, sino debe implementarse un proyecto multidisciplinario, que involucre la construcci6n de
caminos, ofrezca servicios basicos, asistencia social, credito, educaci6n, etc., a nivel de comunidades
campesinas. Las metas sociales son mas dificiles de alcanzar porque tocan a la poblaci6n rural que es
parte neuralgica del sistema nacional y requieren de un proceso de cambio y mejora mucho mas largo
que el vivido con el proyecto.
(vi) En terminos de impacto ambiental, si bien no se evidencia dicho impacto tampoco se han
generado practicas que deterioren o vayan en desmedro del medioambiente. Por el contrario, existen
practicas de manejo integrado que evitan el uso abusivo de pesticidas o el sobrepastoreo de ganado por
citar algunos ejemplos. Pero por falta de una adopci6n masiva y una difusi6n de estas practicas,
obviamente, no se ha logrado ningun impacto ambiental. En todo caso, el efecto de un cambio en los
habitos de explotaci6n de recursos naturales se podria evidenciar mas a nivel de tr6pico -norte y este de
Bolivia- que de las zonas altas.
1.2.3 FACTORES QUE AFECTARON LA IMPLEMENTACION
Entre los factores que afectaron la implementaci6n del PDTA, se citan a continuaci6n, factores
fuera del alcance del IBTA pero si del Gobierno y los factores institucionales que podian haber sido
controlados por el IBTA pero que no fue asi. Sin embargo, la relaci6n entre estos dos tipos de factores es
alta, estan muy ligados y los factores internos son consecuencia de los extemos.
Sin embargo, existieron algunos factores fuera del alcance humano, los factores climaticos, tales
como sequias, heladas, granizadas, etc. que afectaron la implementaci6n del proyecto. Por ejemplo en la
campania agricola 1997/98 el efecto del Fenomeno del Niiio, provoc6 en zonas altas y valles una aguda
sequia, y en la regi6n subandina caus6 un retraso en la epoca de Iluvias las que se prolongaron hasta la
estaci6n invemal.
a) Factores externos: Entre los factores extemos que afectaron negativamente el desarrollo del
proyecto estan la falta de politicas agropecuarias claras de incentivo a la generaci6n de tecnologia. Por

otro lado, el Gobierno implemento grandes cambios estructurales en la economia del pais dictaminando
leyes y decretos. Una ley que afect6 profundamente a las instituciones publicas desconcentradas como el
IBTA, fue la Ley de Descentralizaci6n en 1995.
Durante la ejecuci6n del proyecto ocurrieron dos cambios de gobierno que influyeron radicalmente
en los cambios a nivel del personal ejecutivo y t6cnico del IBTA. La injerencia politica en las actividades
del IBTA se hizo patente, particularmente a nivel de la unidad ejecutora central donde fue un factor
negativo para el desarrollo de las actividades del Proyecto. La intervenci6n politica tuvo efectos en los
cambios de autoridades del IBTA y en las modificaciones en normas y procedimientos de ejecuci6n del
Proyecto, y principalmente en la falta de manejo gerencial desde la unidad ejecutora central. Se contrat6
improvisadamente personal administrativo sin formaci6n academica. Estos aspectos negativos afectaron
negativamente a todos los programas de investigaci6n que tenian financiamiento del BM, y con menos
intensidad a aquellos programas (caso Papa) que tuvieron control y supervisi6n directa de la agencia de
financiamiento (COSUDE). El manejo arbitrario de los recursos humanos influy6 en la inestabilidad
institucional del IBTA, por intereses politicos de los partidos de gobierno se provocaron cambios sucesivos
del personal directivo, ejecutivo y administrativo.
La falta de cumplimiento del compromiso del Gobiemo, tanto en volumen como en oportunidad de
los desembolsos comprometidos, - primero, entre 1992 y 1995 por el Tesoro General de la Naci6n y
despues entre 1996, 1997 y 1998, por las Prefecturas - para efectuar los desembolsos correspondientes al
aporte local, fue un otro factor limitante de tipo econ6mico.
Es pertinente recordar que el Gobiemo y la AIF acordaron, a traves del Convenio 2216 BO y sus
posteriores enmiendas, una escala de contribuci6n de recursos financieros, tanto de la AIF como del
Gobiemo, definiendo como pardmetro de cambio de tramo, cuando el proyecto liegaba a un determinado
monto de desembolsos. El Gobierno no cumplio oportunamente con el cambio de tramo, manteniendo la
escala de contribuci6n anterior por un periodo de tiempo adicional. De esa manera, en el perIodo
inmediatamente posterior al cambio de tramo, el ejecutor del proyecto (el IBTA) continuaba ejecutando sus
gastos en sueldos y gastos operativos seguin el tramo anterior, utilizando recursos adicionales del credito y
reduciendo asi la disponibilidad de fondos del credito para la etapa final del proyecto.
b) Factores internos e institucionales: Un factor institucional fue la contrataci6n de consultores
internacionales incompetentes. Algunos de los que llegaron a la instituci6n, no eran profesionales capaces
como supuestamente se esperaba, 6stos no cumplieron una buena labor, no respondieron a los terminos de
referencia ni a los objetivos propuestos. Esto tambien influy6 en la perfornance global de algunos
programas.
Durante la ejecuci6n, del Proyecto, lamentablemente debido a la inestabilidad institucional, siete
directores ejecutivos (algunos interinos) ocuparon la maxima posici6n del IBTA. Varios-de estos no
estuvieron a la altura de las exigencias del puesto y por el contrario su incapacidad, irresponsabilidad y falta
de idoneidad y criterio provocaron serios desajustes en el IBTA como consecuencia de sus decisiones
desatinadas, parcializadas y politizadas. Varios directores tecnicos, y administradores tambien fueron
cambiados por razones politicas.
Estos cambios se debieron a la carencia de instancias de control, fiscalizaci6n y seguimiento de las
normas y reglamentos institucionales. En efecto, no se evidenci6 el trabajo de las instancias normativas, de
control y supervisi6n del ejecutivo, como el Consejo Tecnico, el Consejo Administrativo, y el Consejo
Directivo del IBTA. La presencia de representantes de otras instituciones como las Universidades, las

Appendix B                                                                        Page 10
organizaciones campesinas, y las asociaciones de productores en el Directorio para la aprobaci6n de planes
y presupuestos fue practicamente nula. La ausencia de estas instancias gener6 decisiones arbitrarias y un
manejo administrativo
deficiente.
Finalmente la asignacion del presupuesto destinado a gastos operativos, evit6 que los montos
destinados a equipamiento de las estaciones (ej. equipos de computaci6n) vayan a las mismas, lo cual fue
en desmedro de los Programas, los cuales subsistieron con equipos obsoletos adquiridos en la mayoria de
los casos antes del anio 1991.
1.2.4 SUSTENTABILIDAD ESPERADA
La sustentabilidad del Proyecto esta en funci6n del rubro o programa y de lo que el MAGDR
realice con el SIBTA y las FDTA's. Para una mejor comprensi6n de este acapite se hard un analisis por
separado de cada programa.
1.2.4.1 Programa Raices y Tuberculos Andinos y Programa Quinua:
En el caso de PROINPA, cuya actividad en realidad no ha cesado ni sufrido interrupciones durante
el cierre del PDTA, su sustentabilidad parece asegurada con la creaci6n y consolidaci6n de la Fundaci6n
PROINPA (Promoci6n e Investigaci6n de Productos Andinos) que ha empezado a trabajar en los rubros de
papa, quinua y muy pronto lo hard en el rubro camelidos. En realidad este programa fue en terminos de
performance e impacto el mejor del PDTA debido principalmente al grupo humano calificado y bien
entrenado que formaba parte del mismo y tambien debido a que la Cooperaci6n Suiza de Desarrrollo
(COSUDE) di6 un apoyo econ6mico importante desde la creaci6n de PROINPA en 1989 hasta 1998 afio en
que el programa se convirti6 en Fundaci6n. Ademas COSUDE no permiti6 intervenci6n politica de ningun
partido y supo controlar, supervisar y fiscalizar las acciones del personal tecnico y administrativo durante
todos los afios que este programa tuvo vigencia.
1.2.4.2 Programa Trigo y Cereales Menores
Al igual que el programa Papa, el Programa Nacional de Trigo y Cereales Menores tuvo un buen
desempeiio dentro el PDTA, debido a que tambien tuvo financiamiento complementario de otra fuente. En
este caso fue el PL-480 que apoy6 econ6micamente a ete programa, este hecho favoreci6 el normal
desenvolvimiento de las actividades de este programa por lo menos en las ultimas gestiones agricolas
cuando el caos empez6 a aduenarse del IBTA. La sustentabilidad de este programa tambien parece estar
asegurada con la creaci6n, mediante Resoluci6n Ministerial N 074 del 4 de Noviembre de 1998, del
Programa Nacional de Investigaci6n y Transferencia de Tecnologia para el Cultivo de Trigo (PROTRIGO)
que tendra un financiamiento mixto de PASA y PL-480 por un monto equivalente a US$ 5'915,449 para
los pr6ximos seis afios.
1.2.4.3 Programas Maiz, Ganaderia, Leguminosas de Grano, Frutales y Hortalizas y Centros de
Germoplasma
Excepto el ex-programa ganaderia que se especializara en camelidos como fue explicado arriba, y
que pertenecera a la Fundaci6n PROINPA a ser denominada Fundaci6n ANDINA, los otros programas
corren un riesgo grande por la incertidumbre en la que se ven sumidos al presente. Por un lado esta la
suspensi6n total de presupuesto del Banco Mundial como consecuencia de la finalizaci6n del convenio
2216 IBTA-BM y por ende del PDTA, y por otro la inconsecuencia de las Prefecturas al descuidar el

Appendix B                                                                          Page 11
aporte. local para la continuidad de los citados programas. Sin embargo, conociendo la mala politica de los
gobiernos prefecturales y su incapacidad de Ilevar adelante la generaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia
agropecuaria en el pais, el MAGDR a traves de la DGDT ha estado trabajando en una propuesta para la
creaci6n del nuevo Sistema Boliviano de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (SIBTA), que promocionara, iniciara y
consolidard la formaci6n de cuatro Fundaciones de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (FDTA's) en el Altiplano,
Valles, Tr6pico y Chaco (Ver documento Propuesta SIBTA) y que tendrA financiamiento del BID. Con la
consolidaci6n de la Fundacion PROINPA solamente tres fundaciones restan por crear juridica y
fisicamente. Los recursos humanos ya capacitados (ex-tecnicos del IBTA) que formen parte de estas
fundaciones estan disponibles y listos para enfrentar el nuevo desafio.
1.2.5 DESEMPENO DEL BANCO
En general, la oficina del Banco Mundial encargada del PDTA 2216/BO no tuvo un desempefno
satisfactorio debido a la carencia de instancias de supervisi6n. En la fase de identificacion y preparacion
del Proyecto la performance del Banco fue regular porque no particip6 activamente en la gestaci6n del
Proyecto, y dicha preparaci6n se dej6 a cargo de los representantes nacionales. El seguimiento y la
evaluaci6n fue deficiente porque la misi6n del Banco no lleg6 oportunamente a la mayoria de las sedes del
Programa y sus respectivas areas de impacto; mientras que la supervisi6n fue regular porque esta no fue
frecuente y estaba limitada a escala central. Por otro lado, el BM fue demasiado flexible y permiti6
modificaciones sustanciales al Convenio original, 5 enniendas al convenio en 7 anios. Otro grave error
fueron los excesivos cambios de la cupula del IBTA por flexibilidad del BM, en diez oportunidades en un
periodo de siete afios, que caus6 inestabilidad y p6rdida de liderazgo institucional.
Sin embargo, pese a las limitantes mencionadas, el salario de t6cnicos y trabajadores en las
estaciones experimentales fue mejorado obstenciblemente. Esta mejora ayud6 significativamente a un
mejor desempefno en los trabajos de investigaci6n. Otro aspecto positivo fue el haber beneficiado a
profesionales j6venes (en la mayoria de los casos) de la instituci6n con becas de maestria y doctorado,
hecho que quiza sea el que mas repercusi6n va a tener en los pr6ximos afnos por el cumulo de
conocimientos y experiencias que trajeron consigo los ex-becarios del BM.
1.2.6 DESEMPENO DEL PRESTATARIO
La actuaci6n del gobierno y los ejecutores en las fases de preparaci6n e implementaci6n de
proyectos se considera que fue deficiente. No se cumpli6 con el cronograma establecido para el inicio y
ejecuci6n del proyecto. La supervisi6n del convenio tambien fue deficiente. No existieron politicas ni
estrategias claras y consistentes del gobierno para el sector agropecuario y menos para la generaci6n y
transferencia de tecnologia agropecuaria. La carencia de politicas sectoriales fue evidente por el poco
apoyo mostrado al Convenio 2216 BO. Esto esta corroborado por la escasa asignaci6n presupuestaria del
Estado al sector agropecuario y en el caso de la generaci6n de tecnologia la asignaci6n presupuestaria fue
minima. Asimismo, el GOB implement6 medidas econ6micas y politicas que afectaron al Convenio y al
PDTA, por ejemplo, la Ley de Descentralizaci6n alter6 la estructura programatica de la investigaci6n al
interior de la instituci6n, favoreciendo la creaci6n de unidades regionales que fortalecidas con la Ley
empezaron a desmembrar el presupuesto asignado a los programas.
Los dos cambios de gobierno -1993 y 1997- causaron desajustes a todo nivel pero principalmente
en la estructura del IBTA que cedi6 ante la presi6n de los partidos politicos de turno para imponer cargos y
crear nuevos puestos burocraticos para sus allegados. De ese modo se form6 una masa burocratica sobfe-
dimensionada que consumi6 gran parte del presupuesto destinado a gastos operativos e indujo a la
reformulaci6n de montos presupuestados por categorias para mantener precisamente esa burocracia, en



37
Appendix B                                                                         Page 12
desmedro de los recursos destinados a equipar las estaciones experimentales y mejorar la calidad de la
investigaci6n.
Por otro lado, hubieron constantes obstaculos para el desembolso de fondos de contraparte del
TGN aprobados y comprometidos, y eso que esto era responsabilidad gubemamental. La asignaci6n
presupuestaria del GOB al proyecto siempre fue inoportuna, esto ocasion6 la permanente reprogramaci6n
de los recursos provenientes del Banco Mundial.
La inestabilidad funcionaria y la intromisi6n politica fueron la caracteristica principal en el IBTA.
Debido a ello, hubo ineficiencia e ineficacia para cumplir con las actividades programadas o con los
objetivos trazados en terminos institucionales, sociales, y de infraestructura fisica. Hubieron fallas en los
procesos de adquisici6n de materiales, insumos, equipos y otros activos y fallas en la contrataci6n de
servicios para el fortalecimiento de los Programas.
El Prestatario no defini6 una estrategia clara sobre que hacer con sus recursos humanos
capacitados. Una vez retornados al pais los t6cnicos de los programas en la mayoria de los casos no
recibieron ningutn tipo de apoyo y peor auin fueron maltratados y desvalorizados profesionalmente. No se
les dio el nivel, ni el sueldo correspondiente, ni el lugar de trabajo adecuado y acorde a su nuevo nivel
academico y profesional.
1.2.7 RESULTADOS
1.2.7.1 Programa Raices y Tuberculos Andinos (PROlNPA): Entre los resultados mas importantes del
PROINPA se pueden citar los siguientes: Se fortaleci6 el Banco Nacional de Germoplasma de raices y
tuberculos andinos de la Estaci6n Experimental Toralapa, a partir de 1990 con el ordenamiento de 1,290
entradas de papa (727 variedades), 480 de oca, 130 de papalisa y 55 de isafio. Se seleccionaron variedades
tolerantes a factores abi6ticos (heladas y sequia). Se generarron dos estrategias de control quimico del
tiz6n, una para variedades susceptibles y otra para variedades resistentes. Se liberaron cinco variedades
con resistencia a tiz6n que deben ser utilizadas preferentemente dentro de un manejo integrado. Se
desarroll6 una estrategia de manejo integrado de la marchitez bacteriana ocasionada por la bacteria
Ralstonia solanacearum. Se implementaron facilidades para la detecci6n serol6gica deR. solanacearum en
tub&culos-semilla, con el fin de detectar la infecci6n latente y evitar la diseminaci6n del pat6geno. Se
obtuvieron seis variedades potenciales con resistencia a verruga y tiz6n que ya fueron evaluadas
exitosamente por agricultores y se pretende incrementar la cantidad de semilla disponible para continuar su
validaci6n con productores y ONGs. Se desarroll6 una tecnica de control quimico para la rizoctoniasis que
permite reducir dramaticamente la enfermedad y lograr mayores rendimientos. Esta t6cnica se encuentra en
fase de difusion a nivel nacional. Se determin6 la distribuci6n, incidencia y severidad deN. aberrans y
Globodera spp., confirmando que las principales zonas paperas estan afectadas con estos nematodos. Se
produjo semilla de variedades resistentes aNacobbus aberrans (Jaspe y Gendarme). Se desarrollaron
estrategias para el manejo integrado de plagas, principalmente del gorgojo de los AndesPremnotrypes spp.
Se desarrollo un manejo integrado de la polilla (Phthorimaea operculella). Se produjo la producci6n de un
bioinsecticida especifico (MATAPOL) para esta plaga, en una planta de producci6n de baculovirus en
Toralapa (Cochabamba). Esta planta tiene una capacidad de 5.8 t/afno. El Baculovirus (Baculovirus
phthorimaea) producido tiene 90% de eficiencia cuando los tuberculos son tratados oportunamente (menos
de 5% de danlo), no es t6xico para los humanos y ademas la papa tratada con este bioinsecticida tiene mayor
vigor como semilla. Actualmente cerca a dos toneladas de Baculovirus son comercializadas por anlo. Se
capacitaron tres profesionales con grado de doctorado, siete con grado de Maestria y un postgrado. Se
benefici6 con becas tesis a mas de cien egresados del Sistema Nacional de Ensefianza Superior de las
carreras de Ingenieria Agron6mica, Biologia, Economia y Comunicaci6n Social; varios de ellos continiian

su carrera profesional en PROINPA. Se capacitaron 456 productores en la gesti6n 1991/92, 444 en
1993/92, 2,174 en 1993/94, mas de 2,000 en 1994/95 y mas de 2,000 en 1995/96. Se publicaron una serie
de publicaciones tecnicas (ver Cuadro 9 del Informe Final Tecnico) en las siete gestiones agrIcolas del
PDTA. Se determin6 una taza interna de retorno (TIR) de 16% del MIP-Tiz6n. Este estudio tom6 en cuenta
un periodo de 20 afios, entre 1985 y 2005. Para el MIP-Polilla se determinaron los siguientes indicadores
econ6micos: TIR 18 %, VAN 58,450 US$, y B/C 1.51. Los indicadores de rentabilidad para el MIP-
Gorgojo son los siguientes: TIR 19 %, VAN 89,457 US$, y B/C 1.57.
1.2.7.2 Programa Quinua: En el Programa Quinua, los principales resultados fueron los siguientes: se
evaluaron 2,010 accesiones del Banco de Germoplasma en condiciones de campo, y se caracterizaron
agromorfol6gicamente 2,511 accesiones. Se entregaron oficialmente siete variedades (Sajama, Samaranti,
Kamiri, Chucapaca, Sayafia, Ratuqui y Robura) en 1996. Se liberaron cinco nuevas variedades Santamaria,
Intinayra, Surumi, Jilata, Jumataqui y Patacamaya en 1997. En el Sur se logr6 la sustituci6n en un 90% de
los insecticidas fosforados por piretroides sinteticos y/o extractos naturales y se recomend6 el uso adecuado
de equipos ULVA en el control de plagas. Se difundi6 la Satiri I para siembra mecanizada en el altiplano
sur y el uso de la carpa y la trilladora mecanizada en post cosecha de quinua. Se public6 un catalogo de
variedades mejoradas. Se produjeron 22 kg de semilla genetica, 10,385 kg de basica, 18,950 kg de
certificada y 7,342 kg de corriente. Se capacitar6n siete tecnicos a nivel de MaestrIa en diferentes
Universidades de EEUW, Mexico y Chile. Se capacitaron 56 egresados quienes realizaron sus tesis cpon el
programa.
1.2.7.3 Programa Maiz: Los principales resultados del Programa Maiz fueron los siguientes: Se
recolect6, clasific6 y caracteriz6 germoplasma nativo como material base de trabajo en la regi6n de los
valles de Tarija, Potosi y en Chaco de Algarrobal (Yacuiba). Se obtuvieron hibridos intervarietales,
mediante la cruza de germoplasma nativo x introducido. Se liberaron variedades mejoradas de maiz para la
regi6n de los valles templados, la regi6n subandina y Chaco. Se produjeron lineas endogamicas en
generaciones avanzadas de S3 y S6 para las regiones subandinas del Chaco, subtropical y regiones con
suelos acidos. Se gener6 un paquete tecnol6gico sobre manejo y conservaci6n de suelos. Se organiz6 y
realiz6 el Primer Curso Intemacional sobre Enfermedades de Maiz para investigadores de la zona Andina y
el Seminario Taller de Investigadores de Maiz. Se realizaron eventos de capacitaci6n en el ambito tecnico
sobre tecnologias de cultivo, metodologia de investigaci6n y problemas fitosanitarios en maiz, para
aproximadamente 600 profesionales de 42 diferentes instituciones del pais. Se asesoraron 43 trabajos de
tesis de egresados de las diferentes facultades de agronomia del pais. Se realizaron cursos de capacitaci6n
de agricultores sobre tecnologias de cultivo a traves de cursos cortos, dias demostrativos y ferias
educativas. Se publicaron 5 boletines divulgativos, 6 tripticos y 22 articulos cientificos relacionados sobre
tecnologia e investigaci6n cientifica en maiz. Se elaboraron tres proyectos cientificos, dos de ellos
financiados dentro el convenio IBTA - Programa Maiz - ODA, CIMMYT; IBTA - Programa Maiz -
PREDUZA de la Universidad de WAGENINNGEN, Holanda; y el tercero en gesti6n de financiamiento a
traves del Proyecto Latinoamericano de Maiz (LAMP), en coordinaci6n con el Centro Fitoecogenetico de
Pairumani. La cantidad de semilla producida entre 1991 y 1998 por el Programa Maiz en cada una de sus
subsedes (Algarrobal, Erquis, Zudafiez y Pajonal) y por categoria fue la siguiente: Semilla Prebasica:
1991/92, 3,388 kg; semilla basica: 23,390 kg; semilla registrada: 39,462; semilla fiscalizada: 6,240 kg; y
semilla certificada: 106,100 kg. Se capacitaron tres tecnicos con becas de maestria en EE.U-U. y Mexico y
43 egresados realizaron sus trabajos de tesis en el programa.
1.2.7.4 Programa Trigo y Cereales Menores: Los resultados mAs importantes en el cultivo de Trigo
fueron los siguientes: se liberaron variedades con resistencia a enfermedades, mayor rendimiento,
productividad, precocidad, calidad y adaptaci6n. Para trigo harinero, las variedades liberadas fueron: IBTA-
Waylla, IBTA-Toralapefio, IBTA-Riera, IBTA-Barja, IBTA-Redenci6n, IBTA-Pel6n, e IBTA-Charcas.

Para trigo macarronero, las variedades fueron: IBTA-Huasa Rancho, IBTA-Corcos, e IBTA-PL-480.
Variedades de cebada: San Lorenzo, Runa, Yacu, y Kolla. Variedades de avena: Amanecer, Primavera, y
Tunari. Se propici6 y organiz6 la Primera Reuni6n Latinoamericana de Cebada Maltera (noviembre/94-
Cochabamba). Se elaboro un Plan Quinquenal de Producci6n de cebada maltera en base a un proyecto de
mejoramiento de cebadas malteras que fue propuesto a la FAO-CEE como entidad financiera. Se
determinaron los herbicidas mAs eficaces en el control de las principales malezas problema como
Eragrostis sp, Avenafatua y Spergula arvensis. Se logr6 confeccionar una estrategia de conservaci6n de
humedad del suelo mediante metodos de labranza y uso de rastrojo. Se disefiaron sistemas de siembra en
terrenos con pendiente. Se identificaron los agentes causales de las principales enfermnedades del trigo,
cebada y avena. Se logro evaluar todo el material de introducci6n y ensayos regionales, sobre lineas y
variedades resistentes a enfermedades. Valorizaci6n de los recursos humanos tecnicos a traves, primero de
una mejora sustancial de sus salarios, y en segundo lugar, a traves de la capacitaci6n tecnica, cientifica y
academica en Universidades de EE.UU., Mexico. y Chile. Tres tecnicos del Programa obtuvieron el grado
de maestria en las areas de fitomejoramiento, fitopatologia y agronomia, y otros dos tecnicos fueron
entrenados durante seis meses en Agronomia y mejoramiento en el CIMMYT. Veinticinco egresados de las
Facultades de Agronomia del pais realizaron sus trabajos de investigaci6n con el Programa para obtener su
titulo academico. Se Ilevaron a cabo 35 eventos de capacitacion para tecnicos y agricultores en tecnicas de
producci6n de cereales. Se produjo semilla de tres especies de cereales: trigo harinero y duro, cebada y
avena: 164 kg de semilla genetica, 787 kg de semilla bAsica, 910 kg de semilla registrada y 681 kg de
semilla certificada. Se increment6 el area de cultivo de trigo, cebada y avena, con variedades mejoradas a
trav6s de la implementaci6n de tecnologias generadas por el Programa. Se equip6 parcialmente al Programa
con vehiculos, trilladoras estacionarias, fumigadoras, etc. Se construyeron dos ambientes pequenios para
oficinas en los predios del Programa de la localidad de Tarata que sirven en la actualidad como base de
funcionamiento del PROTRIGO. Se realizo la perforaci6n de un pozo para agua de 140 m. de profundidad.
Se ampliaron las zonas de acci6n del Programa al incluir los Departamentos de Chuquisaca y Tarija. Se
elaboraron y difundieron 18 articulos tecnicos, 8 manuales tecnicos, 7 Tripticos, y otros.
1.2.7.5 Programa Ganaderia y Forrajes: Los principales resultados del Programa Ganaderia fueron los
siguientes: se logro la recolecci6n de animales (material genetico) adaptados a condiciones especificas. Las
especies de animales recolectadas fueron: 60 llamas, 55 ovinos criollos, y 15 Alpacas. Se cuenta con
planteles de reproductores mejorados en las estaciones y subestaciones de Patacamaya, Chinoli, Iscayachi,
Sapecho y Maya las areas de impacto del Programa y en otras zonas con potencial para el mejoramiento
genetico. La relaci6n de animales hasta Junio del 98 era la siguiente: 303 Ovinos Corriedale, 65 Ovinos de
Pelo, 49 Cabras Saanen, 31 Cabras Nubia, 412 Alpacas Huacaya, 27 Alpacas Suri, 12 Bovinos Pardo
Suizo, 10 Bovinos Criollos, 20 Bovinos Holstein, 70 Cuyes nativos. Se produjo semilla no certificada de
cebada, avena, y de pasto llor6n para su distribuci6n a los productores. Durante la vigencia del proyecto
PDTA, se vendieron mas de 750 reproductores ovinos Corriedale, Targhee, y Rambouillet en las
Estaciones de Patacamaya, y Chinoli. Con fines de validaci6n en fincas ganaderas, se otorg6 en calidad de
prestamo 15 reproductores alpaca de las razas Suri y Huacaya en la Estaci6n de Ulla Ulla. Ademas, se
distribuyeron reproductores caprinos de razas lecheras Saanen y Anglo Nubia en Chinoli y Mayra. En la
Subestaci6n de Sapecho se distribuyeron a los colonos mas de 20 reproductores ovinos de pelo de las razas
Santa Ines y Morada Nova. En la Estaci6n Patacamaya se prest6 servicios de monta directa de bovinos
criollos con capacidad para producci6n de came. En la Estacion de Naranjitos, Beni, se vendieron terneros
Holstein adaptados al tropico como futuros reproductores. Se publicaron 17 tripticos, 9 boletines tecnicos,
4 series de trabajos, 2 manuales. Se capacitaron con becas del BM a I Ph.D, 4 M.Sc., 2 cursos de
postgrado, en Universidades de EE.UU. y Chile. Se dictaron constantemente cursos de capacitaci6n a
productores, un total de 270 tecnicos, promotores de instituciones no gubernamentales, y estudiantes
participaron de las distintas actividades de capacitacion desde 1991 hasta 1998. El Programa Ganaderia y
Forrajes (PGF) otorgo siete becas a egresados de las universidades del Sistema Nacional .

1.2.7.6 Programa Leguminosas de Grano: Los resultados mas importantes de este Programa fueron los
siguientes: Se logr6 establecer un Banco de Germoplasma constituido por: 450 entradas de haba 50
entradas de arveja, 100 entradas de frijol. Se caracterizaron y seleccionaron 200 entradas de haba y 30 de
arveja, 15 lineas promisorias de haba, 20 lineas promisorias de arveja, 5 variedades o lineas de frijol, 9
lineas promisorias de garbanzo, 120 lineas de haba con resistencia duradera a enfermedades foliares, 300
lineas sobresalientes de haba para exportaci6n, 100 lineas de arveja con tolerancia a la sequfa, oidiosis y/o
antracnosis con caracteristicas agron6micas deseables. Se logr6 producir anualmente un promedio de 12
Tm. de semilla de haba; determinar el dafio econ6mico ocasionado por enfermedades e insectos plaga del
cultivo de haba: Se identificaron las principales enfermedades y agentes causales que afectan al cultivo de
haba, Roya de haba (Uromnycesfabae), Mancha chocolate (Botrytisfabae) Altemariosis (Alternaria spp),
Pudrici6n radicular (Fusarium spp), Virosis (Virus). Se logr6 identificar y caracterizar 7 de los virus mas
importantes en el cultivo de haba y se determin6 que una de las enfermedades virales es transmitida por
semilla. Se logr6 control fisico de enfermedad viral mediante aplicaci6n de la termoterapia. Se identificaron
las principales enfermedades que inciden en el cultivo de arveja: Oidiosis (Oidium spp) Antracnosis
(Ascochytapisi), Septoriosis (Septoriapisi), Bacteriosis (Xanthomnonac cainpostris). Se identificaron las
principales enfermedades que inciden en el cultivo de frijol: Roya del frijol (Curomyces phaseoli), Afiublo
de halo (Xanthomonas phaseoli), Pudrici6n radicular (Fusarium spp). Se identificaron insectos plaga haba
en zonas de valle y altura: Valles: Mosca Barrenadora del tallo (Melanagromyza spp), Mosca minadora de
la hoja (Lirio7rlyza spp), Altura: Pulgones (Myzus persicae), Gusano cortador (Agrotis spp). Se realizaron
al menos 25 cursillos de capacitaci6n a tecnicos y agricultores. Fueron capacitados 60 tecnicos y 680

o Urucui (Bixa orellana) en el Beni, Riberalta-Beni- 1996" y un Boletin divulgativo. El Programa apoy6
logisticamente a siete egresados para que realicen sus tesis de grado. Se produjo semilla en 1995/96 de cayu
50 kg, 30 kg de urucu, y 80 kg de goma, en 1996/97: 75 kg de cayui, 40 kg de urucui, y 100 kg de goma,
finalmente en 1997/98: 100 kg de cayu, 60 kg de urucu, 130 kg de goma. De acuerdo a la especie y al ciclo
de maduraci6n en los Bancos de Gernoplasma y Sistemas Agroforestales implantados, a partir del primer
anlo de producci6n (gesti6n 95-96), la cantidad obtenida por cultivo aumenta en un 20-25% anualmente,
situaci6n que motiv6 a los agricultores a cultivar estas especies, habiendose llegado a establecer
aproximadamente 100 ha de Cayui (150 beneficiarios), 200 has de urucu (250 beneficiarios), y 10 has de
goma cultivadas en esta Regi6n amaz6nica, con material proporcionado por el Programa.
1.2.7.9 Centro de Germoplasma Sapecho: Los resultados mas importantes del Programa Centro de
Germoplasma Sapecho fueron los siguientes: Se recolectaron e incorporaron en el Banco de Germoplasma,
31 accesiones de citricos, 2 de achiote y 5 de palmaceas. Se evaluaron y caracterizaron 58 accesiones de
achiote, 13 accesiones de bananos y platanos. Se caracterizaron 32 accesiones de achiote con contenidos
expectantes de bixina (colorante natural). Ademas se cuenta con 53 accesiones de cacao, 44 de citricos, 13
de musaceas, 61 de achiote, 12 de arroz, 10 de palmaceas, y 7 de pifia. Se evaluio el grado de
compatibilidad clonal en cacao para la producci6n de semilla hibrida con el fin de otorgar tolerancia a la
enfermedad Mal de machete, a nuevos individuos resultantes de labores de injertaci6n. Se logr6 introducir
12 variedades de arroz, 12 variedades y 3 hibridos de maiz. Se produjeron 2,500 mazorcas de cacao para la
obtenci6n de semilla hibrida. Se desarrollo un metodo de control dePhytophthora palmivora en cacao
mediante la aplicaci6n racional de diferentes fungicidas no t6xicos. Se estudiaron sistemas tradicionales de
almacenamiento de granos y la validaci6n de tecnologias poscosecha (silo metalico familiar) en colonias
de la regi6n, para disminuir las perdidas ocasionadas por humedad, plagas, hongos y roedores. Se
realizaron 21 cursos de capacitaci6n, y 3 seminarios-taller de los cuales se beneficiaron 1,300 tecnicos,
promotores, agricultores y estudiantes de colegios tecnicos agropecuarios. Se realizaron dos ferias
exposici6n Expo-IBTA, para aproximadamente 2,000 personas. Se estableci6 un convenio con el Proyecto
FAO Poscosecha, para la difusi6n de tecnologias poscosecha en granos (maiz-arroz), por un anio calendario
(1998).Se inici6 un programa de producci6n de semilla certificada de arroz. En cacao se liberaron hibridos
(TSH-565 x IMC-67, IMC-67 x TSH-565) de buen comportamiento, en citricos se produjeron plantas
injertadas de naranja, variedades Valencia late y Washington Navel sobre el patr6n Mandarina Cleopatra.
Se capacitaron 100 tecnicos de ONG y 1,200 productores en manejo de recursos geneticos, manejo de
cultivos tropicales y tecnologias poscosecha . Siete egresados defendieron sus tesis con el programa,
aunque no tuvieron becas.
1.2.8 LECCIONES APRENDIDAS
* Modificaciones estructurales en el marco legal -caso Ley de Descentralizaci6n- provocan serios
cambios a todo nivel, principalmente cambios de propietario de bienes, presupuestos y recursos
humanos regionales. Deben tomarse medidas para evitar que estos cambios -que podrian estar
concebidos con fines positivos a nivel nacional- afecten seriamente el desarrollo y alcances de un
proyecto como el PDTA.
* La injerencia politica es un factor que hace mucho danio a cualquier proyecto. Mientras exista injerencia

Appendix B                                                                          Page 17
politica siempre habra inestabilidad funcionaria e incumplimiento de objetivos y metas, y se pondra en
riesgo el logro de los objetivos del proyecto.
* El personal ejecutivo y administrativo tiene que optar sus cargos a trav6s de un concurso de meritos,
poseer alta calificaci6n profesional y experiencia en el area de trabajo que va desarrollar y buen
curriculum parajerarquizar la instituci6n. Caso contrario se beneficia la burocracia administrativa va en
desmedro de los trabajos de investigaci6n, quita eficacia y orden a las instituciones y principalemente
resta recursos econ6micos destinados a generaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia.
* Para proyectos como el PDTA deben existir instancias de control, fiscalizaci6n y seguimiento para la
aprobaci6n de planes y presupuestos de los programas de generaci6n y transferencia de tecnologia, y
tambien para garantizar la estabilidad funcionaria del personal tecnico, administrativo y de apoyo.
* Mejoras del nivel salarial al personal tecnico acorde con las exigencias de su nivel de capacitaci6n,
conocimientos, grado acAdemico, grado de responsabilidad y experiencia son muy importantes para
motivar a un trabajo eficiente y competitivo.
* El incumplimiento de los compromisos de contraparte a los financiamientos externos es un mal
antecedente para este tipo de proyectos y se lo debe prever y controlar oportunamente. Por otro lado el
manejo econ6mico no debe ser encomendado a una administraci6n publica vulnerable a la intervenci6n
politica.
* El fortalecimiento de la investigaci6n agricola debe estar acompaniada de un equipamiento oportuno de
estaciones experimentales para facilitar el trabajo de los tecnicos. Ademas una unidad de comunicaci6n
y transferencia es necesaria para la difusi6n de los resultados y alcances del proyecto.
* Los asesores y consultores internacionales que sean contratados deben ser conocedores del medio,
aptos, capaces y criteriosos para comandar y asesorar los trabajos de programas de investigaci6n.
3 Se deben implementar toda vez que sea posible programas de capacitaci6n de alto nivel
-academico y cientifico- para el personal tecnico que este involucrado en generaci6n y transferencia de
tecnologia. La capacitaci6n de los recursos humanos debe ser un principio fundamental para mejorar la
calidad de la investigaci6n.
* El componente de transferencia de tecnologia tiene que ser incluido en este tipo de proyectos si es que
se quiere crear impactos a nivel rural y que los agricultores obtengan los beneficios de la generaci6n de
tecnologia.
