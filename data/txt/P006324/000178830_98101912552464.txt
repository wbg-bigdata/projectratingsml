I. INTRODUCTION
A.   The Northwest Region Development Program
First Phase Projects
1.01      This report presents and evaluates the road component of the Northwest
Region Development Program. Phase I of this program, to be carried out over
the years 1981-1986, would be supported by three World Bank loans, totaling
US$320 million, which would cover about 35% of the total Phase I project cost.
1.02      The three loans would include:
(a) The reconstruction of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho Highway, strengthening
of the Rondonia Highway Department and construction of feeder roads.
Loan amount US$240 million.
(b) The Rondonia Health Project (SAR No. 3537b-BR). Loan amount
US$13 million.
(c) The Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection
Project (SAR No. 3512b-BR). Loan amount US$67 million.
1.03      These three projects, which form the first phase of Bank participa-
tion in the Northwest Region Development Program, have been appraised and
processed in parallel for presentation to the Bank's Executive Directors at
the same time. Government commitment to carry out the entire program, includ-
ing measures concerning the protection of the rights of Amerindian communities
in the Program area as well as environmental protection, is reflected in Decree
86,029, signed by the President of the Republic on May 27, 1981. In order to
emphasize the integrated nature of the three projects comprising Phase I of
the Program and the Bank's intention with respect to the exercise of its
remedies under the General Conditions, it was confirmed during negotiations
that, in the event of default under any of the three projects, the Bank would
consult with the Government on the effect of such default not only on the
project concerned but also on the other first phase projects. However, the
Bank would reserve its right to suspend simultaneously any or all Bank loans
for the first phase projects.
B.   The Region
2
1.04      The Northwest Region of Brazil covers approximately 410,000 km
about three-quarters the size of France, although slightly less than 5% of the
Brazilian territory. It includes the entire federal Territory of Rondonia and
14 western municipalities of the state of Mato Grosso, all officially consid-
ered within the area of influence of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway, BR-364
(Map IBRD 14865R2). The regional population was estimated in the neighborhood of
1,060,000 in 1980 and has been growing at 10.8% per year during the last
decade (7.8% per year in Mato Grosso and 15.8% per year in Rondonia). The
average population density of the region is still less than three inhabitants
per km (1.6 if the city of Cuiaba/Varzea Grande is excluded), mostly concen-
trated in towns and agricultural settlements built along BR-364. The dominant
feature of the region is the east-west oriented ridge of the Serra dos Parecis
(altitude about 600 m), continued in Rondonia by the Serra dos Pacaas Novos,
and separating the Amazon basin, north, from the River Plate basin, south.
North and east of the Serra dos Parecis is an ancient sandstone plateau. The



-2-
natural landscape of Rondonia is of virtually uninterrupted tropical moist                  Af
forest, giving way to grassland and swamps on poorer soils to the southwest.
North of the Pacaas Novos ridge, rainfall is above 2,000 mm. A central
settlement area of some three million hectares, established by the National
institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) during the last ten years,
has 'large patches of very fertile soils. Older settlements, resulting mainly
from private colonization, are to be found within the nine municipalities of
Caceres, Mirassol d'Oeste, Jauru, Salto do Ceu, Quatro Macros, Rio Branco,
Araputanga, Barra do Bugres and Tangara da Serra in Mato Grosso. They lie
over a landscape starting in tropical forest in the west and gradually shifting
to "cerrado" or savannah (1,600 mm rainfall) and the highly specialized
environment of the seasonally flooded Plantanal (13200 mqm rainfall) to the
southeast. A few very large ranches established with Government incentives
(which have since been abolished) occupy a large segment of the Guapore valley
along the Mato Grosso border with Bolivia, with several relatively small
Nambikwara Indian reserves scattered among them. Extensive Amer-Indian and
natural reserves are found north of the central stretch of the highway, and
the very large municipality of Aripuana in the Northwestern cornier of Mato
Grosso remains virtually uninhabited.
1.05       Socio-economic development of Rondonia is almost exclusively con-
centrated along the BR-364 axis, mainly within the area of the proposed
Agricultural Development Project. The Territory of Rondonia is expected to
achieve statehood by early 1982. Until then, its administration will remain
under federal authority. No major modifications are expected to result in
the structures or functions of existing institutions. However, their staffs
are expected to be strengthened considerably, and, while the state gradually
develops its own financial base, federal funding would remain available during
a financial transition period of a few years.
1.06       Highways and roads constitute the core of the Northwest's transport
system. In 1978, the region was estimated to have exported about 513,000 tons
of goods, 98% by truck and the rest by air and river. The vehicles moving
these exports brought an estimated 840,000 tons of goods into the region.
There are about 3,000 km of federal highways, including the Cuiaba-Porto Velho
highway, which is the spinal axis of the system. In addition, there are about
2,000 km of state feeder roads and 6,500 km of municipal access roads. How-
ever, the present condition of the road system is clearly a major impediment
to development, since most of the roads, particularly in Rondonia, are tracks
open only for seasonal use.
C.   Further Region and Program-Related Information
1.07       Since the subject SAR, as explained in section A, is presented
simultaneously with two other projects, some of the information relevant to
the highway project is already included in other SARs and therefore not
repeated in the present report. This refers specifically to the objectives
and strategy of the POLONOROESTE Program and to the protection of the natural
environment and the Amer-Indian communities. These subjects are dealt with i-n
the Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection Project SAR. The
general background on transportation in the Northwest Region is given in
Chapter IX of Report No. 3042a-BR, The Integrated Development of Brazil's
Northwest Frontier (December 23, 19_80).

II. HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR ADMINISTRATION
A. Transport Plarnning, Coordination and Financing
2.01      The Brazilian transport sector (except aviation) is under the
authority of the Ministry of Transport, which controls its operation through:
(a) two autonomous agencies, called "autarchies"': DNER, which is res-
ponsible for the federal highway system and road transport; and
SUNANAM, which controls inland and coastal shipping; and
(b)  four public enterprises:  PORTOBRAS, which runs the country's
ports; RFFSA, which runs the federal railways; EBTU, which is
a holding company for urban transport; and GEIPOT, which is a
transportation consulting agency providing support services
and adxvice.
The autarchies are agencies endowed with administrative autonomy but supported
by Government revenues. Public enterprises are mixed economy companies with
limited liability, subject to Brazilian private law. They have their own
by-laws and regulations and are intended to be self-supporting. The Ministry
of Transport acts as a coordinating body; it frames the activities of its
autarchies and enterprises within the Government's overall transportation
policy and appoints their key officers, but is not involved in executive
activities. Civil aviation is controlled by the Ministry of Aviation, essen-
tially a military body, which has delegated ground- and in-flight infrastruc-
ture facilities to the Empresa Brasileira de Infraestructura Aeroportuaria
(INFRAERO), also a public enterprise.
2.02      The Ministry of Transport's coordination with the rest of the
federal structure is managed by the Secretary General through two secretariats:
the Programing and Planning Secretariat, which coordinates the yearly budget and
multi-year rollover programs of all the agencies in the sector; and the Trans-
port Coordination Secretariat, which monitors execution of approved activities.
2.03      Development of the national transportation network has absorbed a
considerable proportion of the country's total investment. From 1974 to 1978, I/
transport investment accounted for about 20% of gross fixed investment. in
1978, Cr$ 142.2 billion (about US$7,700 million) was invested in the trans-
portation sector: about 72% went to road transport, 12% to rail transport,
11% to ports and marine transport, 2% to air transport and 3% to pipelines
and terminals. Since 1974, transport policy has been, to a certainl degree, a
corollary of the Government's policy to reduce dependency on imported oil and
to alleviate the impact of high prices of petroleum products. This policy has
led to a higher emphasis on rail and water transport, large increases in
taxes on petroleum products, and other measures to save fuel such as limiting
opening hours of gasoline stations, mixing alcohol with gasoline and reducing
speed limits. Tranport investments have also been affected by measures to
restrain public expenditures. Taxes previously earmarked for use by transport
agencies are now transferred to the National Development Fund, controlled by
the Ministry of Planning. Since late 1976, ceilings have been set by the
Ministry of Planning on investment budgets of public agencies. Centralized
financial control has proved effective in containing expenditures and redirect-
ing policies, but it has provided a precarious framework for investment planningt
1/   Starting 1979, the statistics are no longer arranged to show total



- 4 -
2.04      The Ministry of Transport has two advisory groups for the formulation
of transportation policies: the National Transportation Council (CNT) and
GEIPOT. CNT was created in 1961, and reorganized in 1969, to provide the
economic development framework of transportation policy. However, it meets
rather infrequently and has not played an active role in policy matters since
GEIPOT was organized as a public enterprise and emerged as the main advisory
body of the Ministry of Transport.
2.05      The more austere economic environment of the last few years has also
affected the planning for the road subsector. The phasing out of the earmarked
taxes has given the Ministry of Planning (SEPLAN) a much increased role in
the overall planning process. This matter is dealt with further in paragraphs
2.11-2.18.
B.   Highway Administration, General
2.06      Administration of highways and roads in the Northwest Region, as
in other parts of Brazil, is split by jurisdiction. Responsibility for the
federal network rests with the Federal Highways Department (DNER), which has
a well organized and staffed Federal Highway District (DRF) in Mato Grosso.
Because of the remoteness of the area, federal responsibilities in Rondonia,
including the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway, are shared between DNER's federal
district of Manaus and the Brazilian Army Engineering Batallion. The state
highways are administered by the State Highway Departments (DERs), of which
there is one in Mato Grosso, DERMAT, reporting to the State Secretariat of
Transport and another in Rondonia, DER-RO, under the Territory's Secretariat
of Works and Public Services. Responsibility of local roads normally rests
with the municipal government of the area in which they are located. The
lines dividing jurisdiction are at times blurred, however, and agreements have
been entered into between agencies for the execution of certain functions on
each other's roads. The federal government, for example, has at times built
state roads and vice versa, or the maintenance of municipal roads has been
done by the states.
C.   The Federal Highway Department (DNER)
2.07      DNER is responsible for about 85,000 km of the federal highway
network in Brazil. DNER was created in 1937 and was last reorganized in 1974,
as shown in Chart 2.1. DNER operates in each state through its Federal Highway
District (DRF). The District Engineer is a direct representative of the
Director General of DNER and has similar functions in his jurisdiction. Each
DRF is further broken down into Residencies, which are mainly operational
units taking care of construction (mostly supervision of contractors, but also
some force account) and maintenance (mostly carried out by contract and by
delegation to state highway departments). DNER has over 1,400 senior staff
(about 1,000 engineers); of these, 70% are stationed with the DRFs and 30% at
headquarters.
2.08      During the 1960s and the early 1970s, the Brazilian road network
expanded rapidly. As the agency responsible for the execution of this expansion,
DNER not only grew in staff and activities but also acquired a quite high degree
of independence with respect to planning and defining the work programs to be
carried out. This new planning approach was accompanied by a de facto financial



- 5 -
independence which was based on an assured and growing revenue from earmarked
taxes. In addition, whenever there was an inconsistency between the physical
program and the financial resources, DNER was usually able to cover the
difference by various measures such as additional budgetary allocations,
domestic or foreign borrowing, or borrowing from the federal funds for state
and municipal road programs which were channeled through DNER.
2.09      During the second part of the 1970s, the economic environment started
to change. The resources were getting scarcer, and relatively more emphasis
was given to other modes of transportation. The earmarked taxes were being
phased out, the possibilities to borrow were decreased, and generally more
central control was being exercised through the Federal Ministry of Planning.
This new financial situation did not translate into reduced DNER operations
quickly enough. Therefore, in June 1980, DNER had to stop work carried out
by contractors because of lack of funds, despite the fact that the transfers
assigned in that year to states and municipalities and channeled through DNER
had not been passed on but had largely been used by DNER.
2.10      DNER's management was changed in early 1981, and a stricter control
of its activities was introduced. The process presently under way is one of
decreasing the autonomy of DNER, making it more responsive to centrally issued
directives and more adapted to the present situation.
(i) Highway Investment Planning
2.11      The changes in the economic environment described above have also
resulted in a change in DNER's investment planning. The system in use had been
essentially one of planning from the bottom up, with annual reviews at various
levels (DNER, Ministry of Transport, SEPLAN) of a three-year sliding program
with detailed programing for the next year. The process allowed for some
coordination and control. However, the earmarking of funds fragmented the
system and hampered control of aggregate spending. The measure of control
was also constrained by the Ministry of Planningts limited ability to scruti-
nize the feasibility and rationale of specific projects.  The rapid inflation
made it difficult to project financial requirements, and DNER's spending was
maintained at a high level through borrowings and mid- or end-year supplements
to DNER's budgetary allocation.
2.12      Since the advent of the new administration in 1979, efforts have
been made to increase central control over DNER's spending. The dismantling
of the tax earmarking system has been accelerated, broad powers have been
given to the Ministry of Planning to control investments, strict spending
ceilings have been imposed and a special office has been created within the
Ministry of Planning to oversee the activities of Government agencies and
enterprises (Secretaria Especial para as Empresas Estatais, SEST). This
tightening of controls, coupled with: (a) the reduction of resources;
(b) a strong perception in the Ministry of Transport that a closer review
of the nature of projects was necessary; and (c) the pressures owed to the
energy crisis and balance-of-payments disequilibria, has brought about the
gradual implementation of a new transport planning system. This new system
places more emphasis on central controls at the Ministry level; it should
bring DNER's spending under control and lead to consistency between physical
planning and financial programing.

(ii) Highway Engineering and Construction
2.13      Highway studies are contracted out to domestic consulting firms,
some of which are of international standing. DNER's 21 DRFs supervise con-
sultants' work directly, under guidelines provided by headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro. The standard of engineering in Brazil is good, although, as pointed
out in the PCRs for the Second, Third and Fourth Highway Projects, too little
emphasis has been placed in the past on in-depth geotechnical studies. DNER
is giving more attention to these studies.
2.14      The Brazilian construction industry is highly competitive; there
are numerous well organized and experienced contractors. DNER's records show
that, in the 1976-1979 period, some 350 construction firms registered for
highway works. About 200 of these firms have their headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. The capital of about 59% of the firms is
less than US$1.5 million, but at least six firms have more than US$50 million.
In the Sixth Highway Project, about 58 firms prequalified for paving and rehab-
ilitation works costing some US$150 million; 52 firms have been prequalified
for the construction of the proposed Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway (para 4.24).
2.15      Supervision of construction has improved considerably; it is usually
carried out by consultants under the authority of the local DRF chief engineer.
At headquarters, DNER's Works Directorate is responsible for overall supervision
and coordination. All construction contracts under previous Bank-financed
projects have been administered by the Works Directorate, which, over the years,
has developed an efficient system to coordinate project execution.
(iii) Highway Maintenance and Rehabilitation
2.16      DNER is maintenance-conscious.  However, because the network is
facing increasing strengthening and rehabilitation requirements, the planning
organization of annual maintenance and rehabilitation programs needs tightening.
In recent years, expansion of the federal highway network has further strained
the capacity of the maintenance organization. Contracted maintenance has,
therefore, increased significantly since 1970 and now covers 25,000 km or 60%
of the paved federal network; this has proved to be more efficient, but
costly. In 1979, DNER spent an average of US$3,500 per km; this amount,
however, included some improvement works and a high portion of non-essential
activities. A maintenance management system (SAC) to properly plan, program,
control and report maintenance activities was developed under the Fifth
Highway Project and is gradually being implemented. The system, however, has
yet to be fully adopted by DNER's management at headquarters and the DRFs.
Maintenance contracting is being improved by the introduction of unit-price-
type contracts against cost-plus contracts. In the frontier regions, many
roads are built by the Army, which maintains some 8,700 km of federal highways,
mostly unpaved.
2.17      DNER's present policy is to gradually delegate the maintenance
of federal highways to the states in order to avoid duplication and to reduce
costs. However, DNER would retain prime responsibility for the Primary
Interstate Highway System (SBI), which comprises some 32,000 km of principal
arterial highways. After an initial thrust, the delegation program has fallen
behind schedule, mainly because state DERs have required that necessary



- 7-
pavement rehabilitation and strengthening be carried out before accepting
responsibility for the federal roads. To assist in this objective, the Fifth
and Sixth Highway Projects included programs to strengthen the DERs of Minas
Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul and Parana and provided for 1,500 km of rehabilita-
tion work. Since January 1979, maintenance of delegated highways has been
paid for by DNER on the basis of unit prices developed under the Fifth Highway
Project.
2.18      It is difficult to measure the condition of the nation's highways,
even on a sampling basis. Such an effort was completed, however, in mid-1979,
for some 35,600 km of the 44,000-km paved federal highway network. l/ The
inventory and more recent information collected by DNER's Maintenance Directorate
show that about 9,400 km are in need of rehabilitation or strengthening and
that 22,000 km require overlays and resealing. Even though DNER's rehabilitation
and periodic maintenance programs reached an average of about 1,300 km and 800
km per year respectively, in the 1978-1980 period, it is clear that the
periodic maintenance effort should be stepped up if the deterioration of the
paved federal network is to be checked. During negotiations, commitment was
obtained (a) that DNER would, in 1982, accomplish at least 2,500 km of periodic
maintenance and rehabilitate at least 1,300 km of paved highways, (b) that
adequate budgetary allocations would be made for the purpose (para 2.32) and
(c) that, in subsequent years, the maintenance and rehabilitation levels
would be set in light of the recommendations of a pluriannual highway reha-
bilitation and maintenance program "Programa de Preservacao do Ativo Rodoviario"
being prepared by DNER's Directorates of Maintenance and Planning and scheduled
for completion by June 30, 1982. The rehabilitation component of the Sixth
Highway Project was progressing well until mid-1980 when it was halted for
lack of counterpart funds. DNER is reformulating the program; the works are
being reactivated.
(iv) Road User Charges
2.19      Highway activities in Brazil (administration, maintenance and
investments) are financed by means of road user charges (taxation and tolls),
general revenue appropriations, and domestic and foreign borrowing. The total
volume of resources generated in 1980 was about Cr$ 104 billion (about US$1.9
billion). Table 2.1 shows the development, during the 1975-1980 period, of
those road user charges that are directly linked to road transport.
2.20      Of the various road user charges, the most important is the fuel tax.
In 1980, it accounted for about 50% of the total directly identifiable road
user charges. Beginning in 1975, the Government followed an aggresive pricing
policy aimed primarily at inhibiting fuel consumption to relieve the country
of the heavy balance-of-payments effect of petroleum imports. Revenues
generated by the fuel tax more than doubled in real terms between 1975 and
1976; the Government slowed tax increases subsequently to help reduce infla-
tionary pressures. This reduction, together with a slight slump in cGnsump-
tion, brought a gradual decline in the revenues, in real terms, produced by
the tax. In fact, in 1980, the revenues generated by the fuel tax represented
about one-third, in real terms, of those collected in 1976 and about one-half
of those collected in 1979.
1/   DNER is responsible for about 41,000 km of the paved federal highway
network. The remaining 3,000 km belong to the State of Sao Paulo.



- 8 -
2.21      Of all the different road user charges, four items - the fuel tax,
the road transport tax, the motor vehicle registration tax and the road tolls -
can be directly and unequivocally ascribed to road traffic. The relationship
of these charges to total road expenditure, i.e., current and capital costs
for federal, state, and municipal roads, is as follows:
Cr$ million (January 1981)
1975     1976      1977      1978
(1)  Road User Charges          150,093  265,215  254,050  242,391
(2)  Total Road Expenditure   173,527  155,267  143,286  133,807
(3)  (1)/(2)                       0.86      1.71      1.77      1.81
The road user charges have thus, since 1976, covered total road expenditure
by about 180%. It should be noted, however, that only parts of the proceeds
have been channeled back to the highway sector.
2.22      The prices of petroleum products are established by the National
Petroleum Council (CNP). Since 1973, the prices have been continually
adjusted upward, and gasoline is now at an internationally high level
(3.26 US$/gallon February 1981). Average yearly prices and tax shares of the
gasoline and diesel oil price are shown in Table 2.2.
February 1981 Prices and Costs Cr$/liter
Retail  Ex-Refinery  Taxes   Distribution Cost
Gasoline          60.00      34.50       20.88         4.62
Diesel Oil        26.00      14.20        8.35         3.45
The opportunity costs of these products as measured by the Santos CIF price
are 19.43 and 18.89 CR$/liter for gasoline and diesel oil respectively;
thus, no subsidy is involved.  However, in terms of the level of relative
retail prices, an incorrect price signal is being communicated to diesel oil
consumers relative to gasoline consumers.
(v) DNER's Revenues
2.23      DNER's revenues have come essentially from four sources, i.e., direct
budgetary allocations, road user charges through earmarked taxes, borrowings,
and fines and tolls. The development of the revenues for the period 1975-1980
and the forecast figures for 1981-1984 are given in Table 2.3 and summarized
on the following page:

2.24          The  level  of  total DNER  revenue  is decreasing  over  the period
considered. The shift from about Cr$ 120 billion in the 1970s to about
Cr$ 80 billion in the early 1980s represents a reduction of about a third.
2.25          In  the  1970s,  DNER had  an  assured  source  of revenue  in a portion
of earmarked taxes which represented well over half of its total revenue.
This source is now being phased out. Another source which played an impor-
tant part previously was borrowing, which was used quite extensively earlier,
but efforts are 11ow being made to reduce it. Also to be considered is the
corresponding increase in the resources coming directly from the federal
government budget. With the earmarked taxes virtually eliminated, it is
envisaged that, in 1982, the direct budgetary allocation will account for
about 60% of DNER's total revenue.

- 10 -
2.27      The marked reduction in total expenditure has been accompanied by
significant changes in the distribution among different expenditure items.
Between 1975 and 1980, construction decreased to about one-third in absolute
terms and from about 46% to about 21% of total expenditure. This decrease
is a reflexion of the reduced economic possibilities and the changing priori-
ties between roads and other modes of transportation referred to in para-
graph 2.03. The proposed Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway would represent 30%, 38%,
and 64% of the total foreseen construction budget for 1982, 1983 and 1984
respectively. The significant concentration shown by these percentages implies
a sustained high level of commitment and rigorous control of the federal
construction program.
2.28      In contrast, maintenance and rehabilitation have remained constant
in absolute terms, thereby increasing their share of total expenditures from 14%
in 1975 to 23% in 1980. The levels of maintenance expenditure foreseen for
1982, 1983 and 1984 should be adequate to meet the objectives outlined in
paragraph 2.18.
2.29      Administrative and highway patrol and control expenses were maintained
roughly at a constant level between 1975 and 1979; in 1980, however, they
decreased by about 20% in absolute terms. This happened partly because of a
reduction in the number of staff employed and partly because salaries did not
increase at the same rate as prices in the economy as a whole.  The portion OL
total expenditures represented by administrative expenses, about 20% throughout
the periods mentioned, can be considered a normal and adequate level ccmpareC
with those of other highway agencies in large countries of the LAC Region.
2.30      Because of the relatively extensive use that DNER has previously
made of financing its activities by borrowing, the debt servicing has been
increasing and will peak in 1981 with Cr$ 21.5 billion, which represents about
21% of total expenditure. Although it represents a high level of debt service,
it is not expected to be the source of any major problem in the future.
2.31      DNER has prepared projections of capital expenditures for 1982, 1983
and 1984. From 1982 onward, DNER will depend to a high degree upon Federal
Government contributions, which are less reliable than earmarked resources.
Allocations have also been frequently reduced by failure to compensate for
the effect of higher-than-expected inflation (77% in 1979; 110% in 1980 and
estimated to be at least 90% in 1981). Hence, budget planning for DNER has
been difficult, Ir 1981, DNER has mainly been paying off debts to the States
and Municipalities and to its contractors and suppliers, and it still has a
financing gap of about Cr$ 15 billion in its budget. It appears, however,
that, because of the late reinitiation of construction and rehabilitation works
which have been halted since mid-1980, DNER will not be able to fully implement
the budget now envisaged, and, therefore, the current financing gap would, in
practice, be limited.
2.32      DNER's 1982 preliminary budget has now been approved by the Ministry
of Transport and SEPLAN. The Federal Government has established a ceiling on
its budgetary allocations to DNER which amounts to Cr$ 51.5 billion (Cr$ 124.4
billion in mid-1982 Cr$). DNER has a financing gap in 1982 of about Cr$ 8.9



- 11 -
billion, which represents about 10% of total expenditures. Additional budgetary
allocations from SEPLAN are expected to cover this financial gap. Although
the level of resources allocated to maintenance in 1982 would be sufficient to
meet the objectives outlined in paragraph 2.18, it represents a reduction from
previous years. This reduction has to be seen in the context of the present
tight economic and financial conditions of Brazil. It should also be borne in
mind that supplementary budgetary allocations during the year, although in no
way guaranteed, have been quite common and that, therefore, the figure given
can be construed to represent a lower bound, which is likely to be raised.
For 1983 and 1984, the maintenance budget levels are planned to increase to
about the levels of 1980 and 1981. The precise targets for 1983 and onward
would be set in light of the recommendations of the "Programa de Preservacao
do Ativo Rodoviario" (para 2.18). During negotiations, agreement was reached
that resources would be made available to DNER for an adequate rehabilitation
and maintenance program for the existing highway network and for the construc-
tion of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho Highway. This commitment would be monitored,
starting in 1982, through an annual exchange of views between DNER and the
Bank on DNER's proposed budgets and related financial plans. Particularly,
these reviews would assess the adequacy, as defined in paragraph 2.18, of the
maintenance and rehabilitation programs.
(vii) Accounting and Auditing
2.33      DNER's accounting and financial functions are the responsibility
of DNER's Administration Directorate and are carried out by competent profes-
sionals who enter the institution following a competitive selection process.
The budgeting practices of DNER are carried out by the Planning Directorate;
however, the budgetary accounting control is performed by the financial
division within the Administration Directorate. There is a need for improved
coordination between the Administration and the Planning Directorates for
updating budget requirements so that financial needs can be reliably projected
well in advance. This coordination has been difficult to achieve because of
the continuous reviews of budgetary allocations, due mainly to shortages of
funds and changes in government priorities. Specific related measures would
be reviewed during the annual exchange of views on DNER's budget mentioned in
paragraph 2.32 preceding.
2.34      DNER has two internal audit offices.  One, which is staffed mainly
by lawyers and accountants, is responsible for the legal, administrative and
financial matters of DNER and reports directly to the Director General. The
other audit office, which is staffed mainly by engineers, is responsible for
systems, technical planning and review of the implementation of the investment
program; this office reports to the Deputy Director General. Both offices are
staffed adequately and provide good audit support to DNER's top management.
2.35      Control of investment program expenditures is carried out in many
stages.  For instance, the monthly certificate of a contractor is approved
for physical and technical accomplishment and budgetary, contractual and
financial appropriateness by the consultants and by DNER's Resident Engineer
responsible for supervision. Thereafter, the payment certificate has to be
approved by DNER's district and regional managers, by the responsible head-
quarters directorate (construction, transit, maintenance, etc.) and financial
division, and finally, by the Director General or his representative.  The
procedures followed by DNER are in accordance with those generally applied in
the industry.



- 12 -
2.36      DNER is subject to three types of external audit:  by the Ministry
of Transport, which basically performs an accounting audit; by the Secretaria
Central de Controle Interno da SEPLAN (Central Secretariat of Internal Control
of SEPLAN) 1/, which performs a financial, budgetary and investment audit;
and by the Tribunal de Contas da Uniao (Federal Controllers Office), which
performs mainly a legal audit. The Lei Nacional de Contabilidade (National
Accounting Law) is applicable to DNER. In the first quarter of each year,
the balance sheet of DNER and a complete and detailed account of its financial
transactions of the previous year are submitted through the Director General's
office to the Secretaria Central de Controle Interno, SEPLAN (National Audit
Office within the Ministry of Planning) for its examination and approval.
The Secretaria Central acts as the outside auditor required by the Lei de
Contabilidade and is entitled to examine all documents which it considers
necessary. At negotiations, the Government confirmed that it would, commencing
with the fiscal year ending December 31, 1982: (a) have DNER's accounts and
financial statements for each fiscal year audited, in accordance with sound
auditing principles consistently applied by the Secretaria Central de Controle
Interno da SEPLAN; and (b) furnish to the Bank, as soon as available, but in
any case not later than six months after the end of each such year, the report
of such audit by SEPLAN, including certified copies, by the Secretaria Central
de Controle Interno, of DNER's financial statements for such year, with a
statement of sources and application of funds, a statement of budgetary
execution and such other information concerning its accounts and financial
statements and the audit thereof as the Bank shall reasonably request from
time to time.
D.  Road Administration in Rondonia
(i) Organization and Administration
2.37      Rondonia's highway network consists of some 8,100 km of road, of
which about 1,690 km are federal roads under the responsibility of DNER's
federal district of Manaus. Administration of the Territory highway network
(about 1,065 km) comes under DER-RO, while primary responsibility for building
and maintaining local roads (about 5,350 km) rests with the municipalities.
In practice, it is difficult to clearly identify the areas of action of the two
levels of government because road activities are carried out by DER-RO jointly
with the municipalities. Most roads were originally opened by INCRA (National
Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) as access tracks, with practically
no earthworks and no drainage structures. Also, the Rondonia Secretariat of
Agriculture (SEAC) has a program to assist the municipalities in improving and
building farm access roads.
2.38      DER-RO is a department of the Secretariat of Public Works and Services
(SOSP) which reports to the Territory's Governor. DER-RO headquarters in Porto
Velho consists of seven divisions (Programing, Engineering, Construction,
Supervision, Geotechnic, Maintenance, and assistance to municipalities) plus
1/   A recent decree (No. 84352 of December 12, 1979) transferred the respon-
sibilities for the external audit of all Federal Government Companies
and "Autarquias" from the Inspectoria Geral da Fazenda to the Secretaria
Central de Controle Interno.



- 13 -
a central administrative and accounting service (Chart 2.2). In the field,
DER-RO operates through the road units of six municipalities (Ouro Preto, Ji
Parana, Ariquemes, Cacoal, Pimenta Bueno and Vilhena) which are assisted with
equipment and personnel. These arrangements have been possible so far because
of the present federal character of the territory and the municipal governments.
A review of the work of DER-RO indicated the following major deficiencies:
(a)  lack of an effective organization structure with clear lines
of authority, responsibility, and communication;
(b)  information required for road planning, programing and
design; traffic data and road inventory, particularly, are
limited and unreliable;
(c)  lack of information on highway financing and expenditures;
(d)  shortage of qualified technical personnel and little training
activities; and
(e)  lack of adequate knowledge of maintenance work on the part of
DER-RO technical personnel (from planning, programing and budgeting
through execution).
2.39      In recognition of the fact that its present organization is not
suitable for efficient management of roads, particularly in view of the workload
envisaged for the next four years (para 6.01), DER-RO prepared, in December
1980, a report for its reorganization. The reorganization (Chart 2.2), which
would be revised and implemented with the support of the technical assistance
team provided under the project, should improve DER-RO's capabilities in admin-
istration, planning, maintenance and training. The proposed reorganization
would prepare DER-RO to become an autonomous organization when Rondonia
reaches statehood, foreseen by 1982.
(ii) Staffing and Training
2.40      At present, all DER-RO personnel are classified as permanent and
are governed by federal laws applying to the Territory; the staff comprises
290 persons (12 engineers, 11 administrators, 173 skilled and 94 unskilled
laborers). About half of these personnel are assigned to the municipalities.
It is expected that, by 1985, the work force would increase to about 500.
Personnel policies, including recruitment and classification, are still in
their infancy, although they will be, in time, similar to those adopted by
other DERs. Basic salary scales are higher than in many other DERs since
personnel receive a 40% incentive increase to work in Rondonia. During
negotiations, the Government confirmed that DER-RO would prepare, before
June 30, 1982, a plan of action for recruiting and retaining DER-RO personnel.
2.41      Presently, some training of road foremen and mechanical personnel
is being carried out on an ad hoc basis through informal on-the-job coaching
by more experienced staff. Given the need to expand the work force, it is
essential for DER-RO to establish the capability for systematic training of
its personnel. A four-year manpower development program including functional



- 14 -
training of new staff, retraining and upgrading of skilled and semi-skilled
staff and the establishing of a permanent training unit is included in
the proposed project (para. 6.03).
(iii) Financing
2.42      Construction or betterment of roads in Rondonia has been financed
in the past from Federal grants (POLAMAZONIA) and through federally supported
programs such as INCRA's colonization projects and agricultural development
programs financed through the territory's Secretary of Agriculture. Also,
since 1980, Rondonia has received contributions from the National Highway
Fund (FRN), of which Cr$ 92.8 million (about US$1.8 million) were allocated
for 1980. The funds devoted so far to road maintenance have been modest and
have been limited to urgent road repairs and occasional grading. Data on past
road budgetary allocations and expenses are scarce since DER-RO does not have
a budget or accounting system separate from that of SOSP. However, a rough
estimate for 1979 shows that DER-RO's expenditures amounted to about
Cr$ 250 million (about US$9.5 million) and that DER-RO is capable of designing
and constructing, mainly through contract, some 400 km of roads per year.
2.43      The main source of future road financing in Rondonia would continue
to be the Federal Government budget under allocation to regional programs such
as POLAMAZONIA and POLONOROESTE. Under the latter program, some 1,530 km of
feeder roads (to be financed through the Feeder Roads Program of the National
Development Bank (BNDE)), and about 3,900 km of farm access roads (to be
executed by CODARON, with DER-RO assistance, as part of the Agricultural
Development and Environmental Protection Project) would be constructed or
rehabilitated, over the period 1981-1985, in support of the agricultural
development activities. The projected annual DER-RO investment and recurrent
budget, including the proposed strengthening program, the necessary maintenance
allocations, and BNDE's feeder roads construction program, represents a
substantial increase in annual road expenditure from US$9.5 million in 1979
to about US$31 million in 1984 (para 6.06).
E.   Road Administration in Mato Grosso
(i) State Highways and Roads
2.44      The state network is administered by the State Highway Department
(DERMAT) which is organized in a manner similar to that of DNER (Chart 2.3)
and reports to the state Secretariat of Transport, which, in turn, is respon-
sible to the State Governor. DERMAT is well staffed (about 1,330 employees)
and reasonably well equipped; its 1981 budget amounts to about US$45 million
equivalent. DERMAT has established a system for functional classification of
roads and for collection of traffic data which forms the basis for adequate
road planning.
2.45      Most of the 9,344 km of state roads have gravel or earth surfaces,
many of which have only seasonal use; only 217 km of state roads are paved.
The state network has been built mainly through the first, second and third
state roads projects, the last one assisted by the BNDE Feeder Roads Program.
Presently, DERMAT is preparing projects for improvement and construction of
about 2,520 km of state feeder roads, of which 1,350 km located in the area
of the proposed Mato Grosso rural development subproject would be proposed for
financing under the BNDE Feeder Roads Program. The remaining 1,170 km would
be proposed for IDB financing.



- 15 -
(ii) Municipal Roads
2.46      Responsibility for building and maintaining about 92550C km of
municipal access roads rests on the municipalities, of which there are 55 in
Mato Grosso. Municipalities, however, lack technical capability and usually
have insufficient budgets for road needs, particularly for maintenance;
consequently, the state provides them with equipment and some technical
assistance through DERMAT. About 1,470 km of municipal access roads located
in nine municipalities would be improved and reconstructed under the Mato
Grosso rural development project proposed for Bank financing. These access
roads would feed the feeder road system to be improved under the ENDE feeder
roads program.
F.   Feeder Roads Financing
2.47      Feeder roads are usually the responsibility of municipalities and
consequently financed by them. Municipalities, however, have limited finan-
cial resources. States have, therefore, provided, insofar as possible,
financial support to municipal efforts to improve and maintain their road
networks. States, however, except for a few, are also comparatively poor
and hard pressed for resources. A significant portion of the funding for
the feeder roads has, therefore, come from BNDE.
2.48      BNDE was created in 1952 and operates as a public company under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. BNDE has administrative
and financial autonomy, independent judicial personality, as defined in private
law, and its own assets and liabilities.  According to its bylaws, BNDE is
the main instrument for the execution of the Federal Government's investment
policy, and its purpose is to provide support to programs, projects, works
and services connected with the development of the national economy.  BNDE has
participated in the construction and improvement of about 25,000 km of feeder
roads, including two ongoing Bank-assisted Feeder Roads Projects (paras 3.09-
3.11).
2.49      A national policy toward rural roads dates to 1967 -when BNDE, in
agreement with DNER, established the "Programa Nacional de Estradas Viciriais";
more recently, the creation of "Consorcios Rodoviarios Municipais" has helped
to bring about a better micro-regional integration and increased technical
assistance to municipalities from BNDE, DNER and the State Highway Departments
(DERs). These schemes have improved the technical and financial planning
and the supervision of rural road projects. BNDE and DNER have made their
expertise available to states and municipalities by aiding them in the analysis,
design and construction of feeder roads, a task that has been significantly
assisted by the ongoing Bank-financed Feeder Roads Projects.

III. PAST AND ONGOING BANK ASSISTANCE TO HIGHWAYS
A.   Highway Projects
(i) Completed Projects
3.01      The First Highway Project (Loan 567-BR, US$26 million, October
1968) was instrumental in setting the framework for Bank involvement in
the Brazilian transport sector. Together with this loan, the Bank reached
agreement with the Government on a Plan of Action which included, among other
things, the reorganization of DNER, the revision of road user charges, the
reduction of railway deficits and the improvement of port administration. The
project included detailed engineering, construction, paving, and supervision
of seven road sections totaling 429 km in four states; the project was success-
fully completed in September 1972, about a year later than expected. The
delay was mainly due to design changes and problems with earthworks. Despite
cost overruns in some sections, total project costs were lower than anticipated.
The audit rates of return for the roads were, except for one road, equal to or
higher than the appraisal estimates; they ranged from 14 to 40% (PPA Report
No. 1026 dated February 12, 1976).
3.02      The Second Highway Project (Loan 676-BR, US$100 million, May 1970)
included construction and paving of 2,136 km of roads, detailed engineering
of 2,369 km, and feasibility studies of 3,256 km. The project provided
technical assistance to strengthen the planning and supervisory capabilities
of DNER. Problems were encountered during construction, and delays occurred.
As a result, the project was not completed until August 1976, two years behind
schedule. Final cost was about 6% above appraisal estimates. The audit rate
of return for the project was higher than the appraisal estimate (36 as against
27%), mainly because of much higher than anticipated traffic growth. This was
the first major road project carried out entirely by Brazilian firms under
strict specifications and quality controls agreed with the Bank. The expe-
riences gained by the Brazilian construction industry and DNER during the
execution of the project were considerable, as demonstrated by the performance
of followup projects (PPA Report No. 1644, dated June 21, 1977, based on
the PCR dated October 27, 1976).
3.03      Feasibility and engineering studies included under the Second
Highway Project formed the basis for the Third and Fourth Highway Projects
(Loans 813-BR, US$89 million, April 1972; and Loan 854-BR, US$51 million,
August 1972). They included construction of 1,849 km, paving of 681 km of
roads, and related supervision. Civil works in both projects faced the same
problems encountered during the Second Highway Project. Completion of both
projects, initially scheduled for 1976, was at the end of 1977. Underestima-
tion of physical quantities and acceleration of inflation in 1973 and 1974
caused substantial cost overruns. Returns, however, were considerably above
appraisal estimates: 45% and 29% against 25% and 16% respectively (PCR dated
May 30, 1978, PPAR No. 2571 of June 28, 1979).



- 17 -
(ii) Ongoing Projects
3.04      The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR, US$110 million, January
1975) set the basis for Bank involvement in road maintenance, rehabilitation
and strengthening. The project includes (a) construction and upgrading of
612 km of federal highways; (b) highway maintenance programs in the States
of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul and technical assistance to DNER to
improve maintenance planning; (c) Phase I of a Weighing Stations Program
(73 stations); (d) detailed engineering for road construction, upgrading
and rehabilitation; and (e) feasibility studies for three new highways total-
ing about 900 km. The project will not be completed before the end of 1982,
i.e., a delay of more than two years.
3.05      The project has been affected by cost overruns in civil works and
delays in the implementation of the Weighing Station Program and the highway
maintenance programs in Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul. Completion
of the project is well advanced, and, as of SeptembeT 30, 1981, about 81% of
the Bank Loan had been disbursed. The 17 road sections (612 km) to be con-
structed or upgraded are completed. However, construction works on 73 weighing
stations were halted in July 1980 because of budgetary restrictions. DNER is
redefining the Weighing Stations Program (Phase I under the Fifth Highway
Project and Phase II under the Sixth Highway Project) so that it would first
complete 73 stations and get them into operation before proceeding to build
the complete system of 127 stations.
3.06      The Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1557-BR, US$114 million, August 1978)
provides continuity to the Bank's involvement in rehabilitation and maintenance
and its assistance to DNER in federal highway administration. The project
includes (a) rehabilitation of about 1,509 km of paved federal highways and
the execution of the detailed engineering for about another 3,000 km of
rehabilitation works; (b) a highway maintenance program in the state of
Parana; (c) Phase II of the Weighing Stations Program (54 weighing stations);
and (d) consulting services to the Road Research Institute (IPR) to carry out
research into pavement overlay designs and to GEIPOT to complete research
studies necessary to improve the Highway Design and Maintenance Model.
3.07      The project has been affected by delays in the implementation from
the beginning, and, as of September 30, 1981, only about 18% of the loan had
been disbursed. The project is having difficulties because of DNER's present
financial restrictions. In fact, civil works were halted in July 1980 after
the financial crisis of DNER (para 2.09).
3.08      The Loan Agreement required DNER to develop a pavement management
system for resealing, strengthening and rehabilitation of paved federal
highways; also, DNER should present to the Bank, no later than October 31 of
each year, annual and pluriannual programs for strengthening and rehabilitating
the federal highway network. Progress on these two activities has been slow.
The new management of DNER has taken an effective approach to the reformulation
of the Project, particularly: (a) the rehabilitation component is being
revised in light of overall maintenance requirements for the federal network;
(b) orders to reactivate works on the ongoing 26 rehabilitation contracts
were given in mid-June 1981; (c) ongoing works requiring retendering and
new sections to be included in the rehabilitation program would be under
contract by the end of 1981; (d) the revolving fund set up under the project



- 18 -
to pay contractors has been replenished in line with the Loan Agreement; and
(e) DNER's Maintdnance Directorate has prepared a preliminary pluriannual
program for maintenance and rehabilitation of the federal network.
B.   Feeder Roads Projects
3.09      The First Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1207-BR, US$55 million, March
1976) represents an innovative approach to the problem of channeling Bank
support toward the improvement of secondary and access roads, which, in
Brazil, is the responsibility of the states and the municipalities. The
project is a line of credit extended to Brazil's National Development Bank,
BNDE, to finance roughly 50% of the subloans extended by BNDE to DERs or to
municipal consortia to carry out secondary and feeder road programs in support
of agricultural production. The subprojects are prepared and evaluated in
accordance with agreed and well publicized criteria embodied in a manual.
3.10      The project was slow in starting because beneficiaries took more
time than anticipated to familiarize themselves with the procedures and to
establish their working relationships with BNDE. By mid-1981, disbursements
had reached only US$19.0 million instead of the full US$55.0 million. The
loan has been fully committed since the end of 1979, but implementation has
been slowed down by financial problems. Because the purchasing power of the
ORTN (the monetary unit in which subloans are made) has decreased and because
of cost overruns, the subborrowers have seen their share of the cost increase
by 40% to 60% and have not been able to keep up the pace of execution of their
subprojects. BNDE prepared, in May 1981, a reformulation of the subprojects
under the First and Second Feeder Roads loans: (a) to reduce the scope of
individual subprojects, in line with the capacity of the subborrowers, so that
all subprojects can be completed by the end of 1983 for the First Loan and by
the end of 1985 for the Second; and (b) to provide additional financing for
13 of the ongoing 16 subprojects in order to restore the participation of
BNDE/IBRD to its initial level. Supplementary subloans for subprojects under
the First Loan would be financed under the Second. The Bank concurred with
the principle of this reformulation. BNDE is proceeding with its implementa-
tion through renegotiations with the subborrowers. Also, DNER has confirmed
to BNDE that its 1981 contributions to the project would be provided from
DNER's budget.
3.11      The Second Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1730, june 1979, US$110 million)
is intended to provide continuity to the program assisted by the First Project.
It became effective December 1979. Nine subprojects had been approved by July
1981, and it is expected that six more would be approved by November 1981. The
loan would be fully committed by the end of 1981. This project faces the same
difficulties as does the First Feeder Roads Project and is being reformulated
along the same lines.
C.   Road Components of Agricultural Projects
3.12      Since 1972, the Bank has been assisting the road components of
agricultural settlement and rural development projects. Eleven ongoing
agricultural projects, mainly in the northeast, cover approximately 11,200
km of roads with a total cost of about US$160 million equivalent. Apart from
providing for construction and improvement of access roads to eliminate
obstacles that render the farm-to-market roads impassable or passable only



- 19 -
with difficulty by four-wheel drive vehicles, the objective of the road
components is to assist in developing a system for maintaining essential
municipal access and feeder roads for year-round transit. The Bank is
contributing toward these objectives by providing guidance and financing for
the training of local maintenance staff, the acquisition and utilization of
road maintenance equipment and spare parts, and support of institutional
strengthening, particularly the coordination of state highway departments and
the municipal administrative structure.
3.13      The road components of agricultural projects are generally proceed-
ing well, although often at a slow pace, because of technical, financial and
administrative problems. Technical and administrative difficulties stem from
the lack of adequate road work experience of the technical units of POLONORDESTE,
the entity responsible for project preparation and coordination, the DERs and
Municipal Road Consorcios, and the fact that project municipalities lack
technical capabilities and depend upon technical assistance from agencies of
state governments. Financial factors include reductions and slow transfers of
federal government counterpart funds. Also, maintenance has yet to be under-
taken in a systematic fashion. A summary of the ongoing Bank-financed road
components of agricultural projects follows:

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives and General Description
4.01      As part of the POLONOROESTE Program, the proposed project would aim to:
(a)  reduce transport costs and improve traffic conditions by providing
permanent road transport facilities in the region; and
(b)  strengthen the institutional capabilities of the Rondonia Highway
Department in order to improve and rationalize the territory's
road administration, particularly to cope with its increased
responsibility under the POLONOROESTE Program.



- 20 -
4.02      The lack of physical access to markets, which results in high levels
of crop loss, has been recognized as a major constraint in the development of
the Northwest Region. The POLONOROESTE Program consequently places a special
emphasis on the upgrading and paving of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho Highway as well
as on the improvement of the feeder road network in the areas of greatest
agricultural potential. The POLONOROESTE Program, therefore, envisages
construction or improvement of about 2,880 km of feeder roads and about 5,400
km of farm-to-market municipal access roads. The feeder roads, with an
estimated cost of about US$140 million equivalent, would be financed under two
subprograms: one oF 1,530 km in the territory of Rondonia and one of 1,350 km
in the state of Mato Grosso. These two subprograms are being prepared by
DER-RO and DERMAT for financing under the BNDE/IBRD feeder road program. The
two subprograms are being broken down into smaller three-year packages in line
with the requirements of the rural development projects and the implementation
capacities of DER-RO and DERMAT.
4.03      The first packages, which would cover about 488 km for Mato Grosso
and 500 km for Rondonia, would be financed under the present project through
the existing BNDE/DNER/IBRD financing mechanism for the Second Feeder Roads
Loan (Loan 1730-BR). Subsequent packages should be prepared so that there
would be continuity in the execution of the feeder roads. These future
packages would be financed through the proposed Third Feeder Roads Project
with BNDE, which is under preparation. During negotiations, the Government
confirmed that the subsequent packages would be prepared and that timely
funding for financing these packages would be available.
4.04      The proposed project would consist of:
(i) Highway Construction and Operation
(a) civil works by contract for upgrading, including paving, of
about 1,084 km 1/ of highway between Corrego Campinas and
Ariquemes, the construction of four bridges in the Cuiaba-
Caceres section, and the construction of three maintenance
residences, one weighing station and about nine highway patrol
stations and depots along the entire highway;
(b) consulting services to assist DNER in the supervision of the
civil works, and for installation of the weighing station; and
(c) acquisition and installation of (i) a weighing scale;
(ii) vehicles and radio units for the federal highway patrol
unit; and (iii) equipment, vehicles and traffic counters for
monitoring pavement behavior.
(ii) Strengthening of Rondonia's Highway Department (DER-RO)
Restructuring and strengthening DER-RO's organization and functions
to provide for the planning, programing, execution and control of
the territory's road network. The project would include:
(a)  construction by contract of about 10,000 m2 of residences,
maintenance depots and workshops;
1/   The two end sections, Cuiaba-Corrego Campinas and Ariquemes-Porto Velho,
totaling 355 km, are being reconstructed and paved by the Army.



- 21 -
(b) acquisition of about 370 units of plant, equipment and
vehicles for road maintenance, training and traffic control;
(c) equipment for offices, laboratories, workshops and stores; and
(d) technical assistance to improve DER-RO's administrative
and implementation capabilities and to train its personnel
as well as that of the municipalities.
(iii) Feeder Road Programs in Mato Grosso and Rondonia
(a) Three-year (1982-1984) programs for construction of new, and
improvement of existing, feeder roads, including 488 km in Mato
Grosso and 500 km in Rondonia. Both programs to be carried out
through BNDE.
(b) Preparation of further feeder road construction and improvement
projects in Rondonia and in Mato Grosso in support of POLONOROESTE.
4.05      The bulk of implementation of the project is expected to take about
four years (1982-1985). A detailed description, evaluation and specific
covenants concerning each component are given in subsequent chapters.
B.   Cost Estimates
4.06      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$687 million
equivalent. The foreign exchange component, which is about 35% of the total
cost, i.e., US$240 million, would be financed by the proposed loan. The
remaining cost (US$447 million) would be financed by the Federal Government,
either directly or through BNDE. A summary of project costs is given on the
following page; base costs are at May 1981 prices.
4.07      The total cost of the Corrego Campinas-Ariquemes highway construction
is estimated at about US$487 million equivalent, including about 20% of taxes
as well as supervision and physical contingencies (Table 4.1). These cost
estimates are based on awarded contracts (para 4.26). The average construction
cost per km for all road sections in the project is about US$365,000 equivalent,
excluding supervision and physical contingencies; including these contingencies,
the cost is US$449,000 per km. Supervision costs are based on past experience
in Brazil and amount to about 7% of construction costs.
4.08      Table 4.2 presents a cost estimate and a tentative list of equip-
ment for the operation and control of the highway. The cost of supply,
installation and two-year maintenance of equipment for the weighing station is
based on actual costs under the Weighing Station Program financed under the
Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects. The cost of vehicles and equipment for
DNER's highway patrol unit and for monitoring pavement behavior was estimated
on the basis of recent quotations.
4.09      The cost of the DER-RO strengthening program (Chapter VI) is
based on estimates prepared by DER-RO with DNER's assistance and reflects
a preliminary analysis of requirements for buildings and various types of
equipment and vehicles. Consulting services required to strengthen DER-RO's
technical and managerial capabilities, to assess DER-RO's personnel training
needs and to undertake complementary training are estimated at US$3.9 million,
which is 12% of the strengthening program. A total of about 420 man-months

- 23 -
would be required over a four-year period. The average cost per man-month of
US$6,400 equivalent includes the basic salary, social benefits and overhead.
In addition, ten fellowships for DER engineers and training instructors have
been included at a cost of US$16,000 equivalent each, as well as IPR training
courses for middle and high level staff costing US$182,000 equivalent, and
training material and equipment costing some US$110,000.
4.10      The feeder roads are estimated to cost about US$35,600/km in Rondonia
and US$40,000/km in Mato Grosso. These estimates, which include supervision
and physical contingencies, are based on feasibility studies and samples of
detailed engineering and are similar to those obtained in similar projects.
4.11      A contingency of 15% has been added to the costs of civil works
and construction supervision to allow for increases in quantities, A quantity
contingency of 5% was used for all other items. The 15% contingency for
highway works is justified in order to deal with changes due to traffic,
maintenance acti-:it-ies and weather conditions between the site investigations
and actual construction. Although a 15% contingency is lower than physical
overruns in previous Bank-financed projects (Table 4.3), it is considered
adequate taking into account that: (a) soils are rather homogeneous and
earthworks consist mainly of embankments which normally do not suffer large
quantity overruns; (b) during updating of engineering designs (para 5.07), a
special effort was made to improve the geotechnical information and location
of materials quarries; and (c) DNER has tightened control of design changes
during construction.
4.12      The total price contingency over the project period amounts to about
23% of the base cost and physical contingencies, expressed in May 1981 US
dollars, assuming that the road construction would take place over the period
1981-1985. The price contingency rates which have been applied are 9% p.a.
for 1981, 8.5% for 1982, and 7.5% p.a. thereafter, all applied to US dollar
cost (at May 1981 prices). These represent the best estimates for price
contingency requirements, given worldwide inflation rates and recent dollar-
cruzeiro exchange rate trends.
4.13      Estimates of the foreign exchange component for civil works are
based on the following assumptions:
(a) all labor would be local and all works would be awarded to
local contractors, as has been the case since the early 1970s;
(b) most construction equipment is manufactured or assembled in
the country;
(c) Brazil is a net importer of oil; and
(d) ordinary steel, fuel, asphalt and cement are produced domes-
tically but have a significant foreign exchange component.
The direct and indirect foreign exchange component of civil works averages
about 35%. Consulting services to assist in the supervision of the construction
would be provided by local consultants; the estimated foreign exchange component
for these services is about 24%. The supply, installation and two-year main-
tenance of weighing equipment has a foreign exchange component of 37%. The



- 24 -
foreign cost of vehicles and equipment for the highway patrol and for DER-RO
is estimated at 50%, considering that some equipment would have a higher level
of foreign cost. Specialized testing equipment to monitor pavement behavior
would have to be imported and has a 100% foreign cost. The cost of consulting
services for strengthening of DER-RO has an estimated foreign cost of 40%,
assuming that the services would be provided by a local firm assisted by
foreign specialists.
C.   Financing and Disbursement
4.14      The loan would be made to the Federal Government. The Government's
contribution to the cost of the project would be provided through POLONOROESTE's
budget and through Federal funds provided in the budget of the agencies
concerned. The decree establishing the POLONOROESTE program and a tentative
budget for that program has been approved and signed by the president of the
Republic (para 1.03). Counterpart funds for the highway construction would be
met through special budgetary allocations to DNER. A tentative financing plan
for the project and total Feeder Roads Program is presented below.

During negotiations, the Government confirmed that sufficient and timely
counterpart funds for the project would be available (para 2.32), including
agreement on the estimated annual financing requirements. Retroactive financing
of up to US$10 million equivalent would be required to cover eligible expendi-
tures incurred after October 1,1981 for startup activities, such as mobilization
of contractors and supervision consultants and for civil works executed before
signature of the loan agreement.



- 25 -
4.15      The local cost of the DER-RO strengthening program would be met
through POLONOROESTE funds provided in the budget of the Ministry of Interior.
During negotiations, commitments were obtained concerning counterpart funds for
DER-RO's strengthening program, including funding of expenditures for mainte-
nance of the territory roads (para 6.06). Funding requirements for the
feeder roads program are given in paragraph 7.01.
4.16      The proposed loan would be disbursed on the average as follows:
(a)  highway construction - 35% of total expenditures, for civil works,
supervision of construction and vehicles and equipment for highway
patrol;
(b) supply and installation of weighing equipment, and equipment to
monitor pavement behavior - 100% of foreign expenditures;
(c)  strengthening program for DER-RO - 35% of  otal expenditures;
and
(d) feeder roads construction - 47% of reimbursable payments made
by BNDE to beneficiaries under subloans (para 7.01).
4.17      Bank disbursements for strengthening of DER-RO would initially be on
the basis of 55% of total cost. This rate would be applied for disbursement
applications received until March 31, 1983. Thereafter, the percentage would
be decreased so that the average disbursement rate of 35% would be achieved.
4.18      In order to reduce the interval during which the project executing
agencies would finance the Bank's share of project costs with their own
resources, Government may request the Bank to make advance payments from the
loan account into a Special Account, to be opened in US dollars in the Banco
Central, and which would be available for financing only the Bank's share of
the project cost. The amount deposited in the Special Account could be
increased or decreased by the Bank as required for project execution, but
would not exceed US$15 million. The project executing agencies would be
entitled to make withdrawals from the Special Account at the exchange rate
applicable on the day the expenditures were made. The Special Account would
be audited by the internal auditing department of the Banco Central. Loan
disbursement applications to the Bank would be made by the Banco Central.
Loan disbursements would be made against full documentation.
4.19      DNER would establish a revolving fund for the specific purpose of
carrying out its obligations related to the highway construction. The revolv-
ing fund would be replenished with contributions from the Federal Government
and with the withdrawals from the Special Account to reimburse for project
expenditures made and eligible for Bank financing. For this purpose, DNER
would open an account in a suitable Bank and make into this account an initial
deposit of US$12 million equivalent. The revolving fund should be audited by
the Secretaria Central de Controle Interno of SEPLAN (para 2.36). During



- 26 -
negotiations, the Government confirmed that: (a) DNER would establish a
revolving fund with an initial deposit of US$12 million equivalent at a
suitable Brazilian bank; and (b) DNER would make regular deposits in the
revolving fund as required to ensure that, on the first day of each month,
there would be sufficient funds available to cover project costs during the
forthcoming month according to work and procurement schedules. Establishment
of the revolving fund and of DNER's initial deposit would be a condition for
disbursement of the proposed loan funds for construction of the highway.
4.20      Disbursements for the feeder roads would take place through BNDE
in accordance with the same procedures in force for the ongoing Second Feeder
Roads Project (Loan 1730-BR) (para 7.01). Disbursements for eligible expen-
ditures under the DER-RO strengthening program would be fully documented.
4.21      The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 4.4.
The estimated disbursements have been broken down into each of the project
components so that it would be possible to monitor the disbursement for each
of them. Although the Government expects to complete construction of the
Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway by the beginning of 1985, it has been assumed, for
the purpose of estimating the disbursement schedule, that construction of the
highway would be finished only by the end of 1985, which is probably more
realistic. The resulting schedule provides for faster disbursement than the
profile for the highway subsector; this is legitimate in view of the advance
contracting to the proposed working fund and to the provision for accelerated
disbursement at the beginning of the project (para 4.18).
4.22      DNER and DER-RO would each maintain separate accounts of their
proiect expenditures. These accounts would be audited annually by the
Secretaria Central de Controle Interno of SEPLAN according to standard
Government practice, which is satisfactory to the Bank. The audited accounts
should be submitted to the Bank not more than six months after the close of
each fiscal year. BNDE would include its project expenditures in the same
accounts as those for the Second Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1730-BR). To meet
financial requirements under this Second Feeder Roads Project, BNDE submitted
to the Bank audited acounts for 1979 and 1980. The accounts, audited by Price
Waterhouse, Independent Auditors, were carried out thoroughly and in accord-
ance with accepted practices. Agreement was reached during negotiations that:
(a) BNDE, DNER and DER-RO would maintain separate accounts for their project
expenditures; and (b) copies of audited statements of project accounts would
be provided to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
D.   Project Execution
4.23      The overall coordination of the POLONOROESTE program has been
entrusted to the superintendency for the Development of the Center West
Region (SUDECO) attached to the Ministry of the Interior. An Interministerial
Coordination Group, in which the Ministries of Finance, Transport, Agricul-
ture, and Industry and Commerce would be represented along with the Ministry
of Interior and the Planning Secretariat, would be set up to facilitate
coordination among the various federal agencies. To ensure that coordination
of the three projects of Phase I of POLONOROESTE would be achieved from
the beginning of its implementation, effectiveness of the loan agreements for
the proposed Rondonia Health Project and the Agricultural Development and



- 27 -
Environmental Protection Project would be conditions for loan effectiveness of
the proposed Highway Project. Also, during negotiations, it was agreed that a
mid-term evaluation of progress in POLONOROESTE program activities up to
March 31, 1984 would be prepared through SUDECO and a report furnished to
the Bank by June 30, 1984.
4.24      Execution of the project would be the responsibility of the following
agencies:
(a) DNER would be Executing Agency for the highway construction; its
Works Directorate would supervise all civil works (para 5.10),
its Transit Directorate would supervise the installation of
equipment for the weighing station and the operation of the
highway patrol's vehicles and equipment; its Planning Directorate
and IPR would supervise monitoring of pavement behavior;
(b) The Rondonia Secretariat of Public Works and Services through
DER-RO would be Executing Agency for the program to strengthen
Rondonia's Vighway Department. However, DER-RO would assume
the responsibility for execution of its strengthening program
when it becomes an autonomous organization; and
(c) BNDE would be the apex executing agency for the feeder road program,
which would be carried out by DER-RO and DERMAT.
The project implementation schedule covering all project items is shown in
Table 4.5.
4.25      Highway works for the Caceres-Ariquemes highway sections (1,037 km)
were tendered in April 1981, and contracts were signed in September 1981.
Works would start in October 1981 and last for about four years. The 47-km
section between Corrego Campinas and Caceres would be tendered in December 1981.
This section would be completed within the above four-year period. The
schedule is consistent with climatic conditions in the project area (about six
months dry season each year) and gives special consideration to the construc-
tion of the upper layers of the pavement during the drier periods. Highway
maintenance during the construction period would be carried out by the same
contractors in charge of construction works. Execution of the program to
improve the organization of Rondonia's Highway Department would be in accordance
with preliminary documents prepared by DER-RO "Estudo para Estructuracao e
Fortalecimento do DER-RO" dated December 1980.
E.   Procurement
4.26      Prequalification documents for construction of the Caceres-Ariquemes
highway (Edital 148/80) were prepared by DNER and reviewed by the Bank in
January 1981. The international community was informed, according to Bank
Guidelines for international competitive bidding, of DNER's invitation to pre-
qualify. Fifty-nine construction firms (none foreign) submitted documentation.
Fifty-two firms qualified: 51 firms for concrete structures and 43 for
earthwork, pavement and concrete structures. On May 25, 1981, 310 tenders
were received from 45 firms for the 18 lots. The bid prices were opened once
the supporting documents were reviewed by DNER. A report with the completed
evaluation of tenders and award recommendation was prepared by DNER and
reviewed by the Bank staff in mid-July 1981.



- 28 -
4.27      For contract purposes, the five road sections in the Caceres-
Ariquemes highway section were divided into 17 construction lots. There was
one additional lot for the construction of four bridges in the Cuiaba-Caceres
section. Contract awards were made on the basis of the lowest evaluated
combination of bids. Contracts for the individual road sections range between
US$15 million and US$35 million equivalent; the bridges contract is estimated
to cost about US$1.2 million.
4.28      For supervision, DNER intends to use the same consultants who carried
out the detailed engineering (para 5.07). This is acceptable. Consultant
services for supervision of the installation of the weighing scales, and for
DER-RO's technical assistance would be contracted with specialized Brazilian
consultants, all under qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions to
be acceptable to the Bank.
4.29      The supply and installation of the weighing equipment (about
US$400,000) and the testing equipment to monitor pavement behavior (about
US$200,000) are of a specialized proprietary nature and would be procured from
the suppliers or their representatives in Brazil, following DNER's restricted
invitation to bid procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank and allow for
adequate competition. Awards would be reviewed by the Bank after signature of
the contracts (ex-post basis).
4.30      Procurement of civil works contracts for DER-RO maintenance facilities
would be done following the Bank's procurement guidelines. Contracts of less
than US$1.5 million equivalent would be procured following local competitive
bidding procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Bids would be advertised
locally since the contracts would be too small and scattered to attract foreign
firms not already established in Brazil. The Bank would review and approve
procurement documents prior to invitation to bid (ex-ante), but awards would be
reviewed on an ex-post basis. Work contracted under this procedure would not
aggregate more than US$8.0 million.
4.31      Vehicles and equipment for the highway patrol, and vehicles and
equipment for DER-RO's maintenance residences, laboratories, workshops, offices
and training facilities would be procured on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. However, contracts of less
than US$500,000, which would be too small to attract foreign firms not already
represented in Brazil, would be awarded following local competitive bidding
procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Purchases contracted under this
procedure would not aggregate more than US$4.0 million.
4.32      For the feeder roads, the sub-borrowers, i.e., the State of Mato
Grosso and the territory of Rondonia, through DERMAT and DER-RO respectively,
would be responsible for the execution of the program following the require-
ments of the BNDE Feeder Road program as set out in the manual (para 7.02).
Procurement of civil works would follow the Government's competitive bidding
procedures with local advertising only, which is acceptable and in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for these types of works. Although these procedures
allow foreign contractors to bid, it is expected that all civil works would be
contracted to local firms. Local advertising is appropriate for these works
since the roads would be of relatively low standard, and foreign firms, not
already established in Brazil, would not be interested.

V. THE CUIABA-PORTO VELHO HIGHWAY
A.   The Existing Road and its Condition
5.01      The Cuiaba-Porto Velho Highway, which is part of the Primary Highway
Interstate System (SBI), provides a connection for the territory of Rondonia
with Cuiaba in Mato Grosso and thence to the entire eastern portion of Brazil
(Map IBRD 15729). The existing road begins in Cuiaba and proceeds westerly
along BR-070 through Corrego Campinas, Caceres and on to BR-174 to the junc-
tion with MT-386, some 30 km beyond Porto Espiridiao. Then the route proceeds
north along MT-388 to join BR-364, close to the Juruena river. BR-364 con-
tinues northwest across the Parecis Plateau, which separates the Amazon River
Basin from the River Plate Basin, to Barracao Queimado and Vilhena. As the
road leaves the Parecis Plateau near Vilhena, the terrain begins to descend,
and tropical rain forests appear. Through Rondonia, the road continues in
a northwesterly direction through the villages of Pimenta Bueno, Cacoal,
Ji-Parana, Ouro Preto and Ariquemes to Porto Velho (Map IBRD 14865R2).
5.02      Tne initial 163 km of BR-070 between Cuiaba and Corrego Campinas are
currently being reconstructed and paved by the Army. The BR-174 section has a
good alignment and a gravel surface in fair condition, having had reasonable
maintenance in the past. MT-388 is a secondary gravel road of low standard in
poor condition. On the Parecis Plateau, soils become silty, and erosion along
some parts is severe; also, materials for road construction and maintenance
are deficient along this 230-km section. Roadway width varies considerably,
but averages about nine meters. The surface is poor and actually hazardous in
many areas; during the rains, most vehicles cannot get through this area
without becoming stuck several times. From Vilhena to Ji-Parana (370 km),
thie road hlas a good alignment and is generally flat; surface condition is
poor, and there are some sections of the road where erosion has created deep
ruts. From Ji-Parana to Porto Velho (365 km), there are numerous sections
which have poor alignment and drainage. The last 192 km between Ariquemes and
Porto Velho are being reconstructed and paved by the Army.
5.03      Traffic varies between 250 and 700 vehicles per day on the different
road sections. More than half of the vehicles are trucks. Truckers must
allow at least five days to make the trip from Cuiaba to Porto Velho, and it
usually takes longer, depending on weather conditions. Heavy traffic and poor
surface and drainage conditions have contributed to the deterioration of parts
of the highway to a point where normal maintenance is no longer possible.
B.   Ongoing Works
5.04      The two end sections, Cuiaba-Corrego Campinas (163 km) and Ariquemes-
Porto Velho (192 km), are being reconstructed and paved by the Army on the
basis of designs prepared in 1974 by Brazilian consultants; some 190 km have
been completed since 1978 when works commenced. The two Engineering Batallions
of the Army in charge of construction have a capacity to build about 80 km
per year; construction of the remaining 165 km is expected to be completed by
the end of 1984. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that the
works would be completed before the end of 1984. Progress of the works and
funding arrangements, including next year's budget allocations, would be
reviewed from time to time by DNER and the Bank to ensure adequate progress.



- 30 -
5.05      A service road between Pontes Lacerda and Barracao Queimado (214 km)
through the Guapore Valley, to replace MT-388 and a portion of BR-364 on
the Parecis Plateau, is being constructed by the Army, linking up existing
earth roads. This track would provide a more reliable wet weather road link
between Cuiaba and Rondonia and would facilitate construction of the proposed
new road section along the same alignment.
C.   The Proposed Highway Route
5.06      The proposed highway route would follow most of the existing align-
ment, including that of the service road through the Guapore Valley. It
consists of the reconstruction and paving of about 1,084 km comprising the
sections of Corrego Campinas-Caceres, the BR-174 between Caceres and Pontes
Lacerda (222 km), a new road between Pontes Lacerda and Barracao Queimado,
through the Guapore valley (214 km), and BR-364 from Barracao Queimado to
Ariquemes (601 km).
D.   Engineering Studies
5.07      In 1974, DNER contracted seven local firms to prepare detailed
engineering studies for the construction and paving of the highway. By mid-
1979, when the Government decided to go ahead with the project, the original
engineering had become partly obsolete because of changed traffic conditions,
especially heavy vehicle traffic, intervening maintenance activities, and
progressive erosion along parts of the existing road. DNER, in consultation
with Bank staff, decided to revise the original engineering and recontracted
the consultants who had prepared it. The engineering revision concentrated
particularly on improvement of geotechnical studies and survey and testing of
sources of construction material, a revision of pavement designs to study
alternative solutions, and improvements in drainage and erosion control
measures. As a result of these revisions, a more modest design than before
was adopted both for the cross section of the road and for the pavement.
Also, updating of the engineering provided more detailed and reliable soils
and material quarries information.
5.08      A 214-km variant through the Guapore Valley to replace the material-
scarce and silty-soil sections along the Parecis Plateau was studied and found
justified both on economic and technical grounds. The variant avoids crossing
existing and envisaged Indian reserves, although it passes near them. Special
measures for protecting and assisting these Nambikwara tribes are discussed in
the report Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection Project
(IBRD Staff Appraisal Report 3512-BR).
5.09      Design standards are shown in Table 5.1.  Given the uncertainties
of the future traffic mix and volume, the subbase and base courses would be
built to withstand long-term traffic, while a triple asphalt surface treatment
would be provided for the surface, accepting the need for early strengthening,
say, after five to ten years of service. The timing of subsequent strengthenm
ing would be determined by regularly assessing traffic and pavement conditior
along the entire highway (para 5.13). During negotiations, agreement was
reached on: (a) construction of the highway according to the agreed design
standards; and (b) arrangements to regularly measure traffic and pavement
condition.



- 31 -
E.   Supervision of Construction
5.10      Arrangements for supervision are similar to those adopted in
previous highway projects. Supervision of highway works would be the respon-
sibility of DNER. There would be three basic levels of management associated
with the supervision (Chart 5.1). Five field resident offices would be
responsible for supervision of the construction contracts. Field supervision
would be carried out by consultants under the authority of DNER's resident
engineer. At the regional level, the chief engineers of DNER's 1lth DRF in
Mato Grosso (MT) and First DRF in Amazonas (AM) would have the duties of the
engineer for the supervision of the works. DNER's Directorate of Works would
coordinate activities centrally. The Works Directorate has built up consider-
able experience under previous highway projects; it would create a special
coordinating group, including an expert in civil works contract administration,
and a quality control, materials and pavement specialist. During negotiations,
the Government confirmed that, by March 31, 1982, DNER would establish the
coordinating group, including the two supervision experts, and the terms and
conditions for the supervising consultants.
F.   Maintenance of the Project Highway and Monitoring of Pavement Behavior
5.11      Consistent with DNER's present policy of retaining responsibility
for maintaining the Primary Highway Interstate System (SBI) and of carrying
out maintenance activities through contract, maintenance of the Cuiaba-
Porto Velho highway would be carried out by contract and supervised by
DNER's 11th and first DRFs in Mato Grosso and Amazonas respectively.
5.12      There would be six maintenance residences along the highway,
three of which - Pontes Lacerda, Pimenta Bueno, and Ji-Parana - would be
built together with the road; the other three - in Amapa, Caceres, and Porto
Velho - would use existing DNER facilities. Table 5.2 shows preliminary
maintenance standards and an estimate of the annual maintenance cost per
kilometer (about US$3,500). During negotiations, the Government confirmed
that it would provide the funds required for the adequate maintenance of the
highway once built.
5.13      Monitoring and evaluating of the pavement would have two main
objectives: (a) to check whether the expected performance is being achieved
and (b) to provide information for the timely execution of strengthening
works. Pavement behavior would be monitored in about 60 control sections
distributed along the highway; these sections would be defined once the road
is complete and would take into consideration construction characteristics.
traffic and climatic factors, as well as initial deflection and roughness
measurements. A flow chart showing the activities for monitoring pavement
performance and for reassessing maintenance and strengthening requirements
is in Chart 5.2, while Table 5.3 presents the monitoring frequency.
5.14      DNER estimates that one two-way traffic weighing station would be
required to provide good coverage of heavy traffic control along the highway.
The station would be installed in the proximity of Vilhena, It would carry
out automatic weighing of vehicles and would be used as a highway patrol post
to check cargo, registration, vehicle road worthiness and permits. DNERRs
Transit Directorate would be responsible for manning and operating the station.



- 32 -
DNER's Highway Patrol, also under the authority of this Directorate, would be
responsible for enforcement. These arrangements have been in effect in
weighing stations already built under the Fifth Highway Project and are
adequate. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that existing truck
weighing regulations would be enforced on all the federal highways and
particularly on the Cuiaba-Porto Velho Highway.
G.   Highway Construction Impact
5.15      Improvement of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway would cause immediate,
as well as secondary, effects on the social, economic and physical environment.
The secondary, or long-term effects, in the form of the POLONOROESTE Program,
and changed patterns of social and economic activities, are probably more
important than the immediate effects caused by the highway improvement itself.
The need to control such secondary effects is recognized in the POLONOROESTE
Program, whose aim is to promote the orderly settlement of the region and
provide measures to protect the natural environment and the interest of the
indigenous population. Specific measures concerning the protection of Indian
rights, particularly in the area of the section through the Guapore Valley
(para 5.08), and ecological protection for the Northwest Region are being
implemented by FUNAI (Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection
Project, IBRD Staff Appraisal Report 3512-BR).
5.16      The most important immediate impact of the highway on the natural
environment would occur during the construction phase. The present seasonal,
earth-gravel road would be replaced by a paved, safer, and relatively problem-
free facility. The increment of change may be inferred by comparing the
descriptions of the existing road with the proposed project. Several measures,
particularly in regard to erosion control and ponding on borrow pits, have
been included in the engineering design and construction specifications. The
specifications also include specific measures to reduce health hazards to the
indigenous population, the contractor personnel and other persons near the
construction site. These measures commit the contractors to comply with
SUDAM's resolution 3750 of March 14, 1979, which regulates the provision of
health care during the implementation of development projects in the Amazon
Region, as well as with the requirements established by FUNAI to protect the
Amerindian communities from the dangers associated with the presence and
activities of construction crews in their areas. These arrangements were
reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
VI. STRENGTHENING OF RONDONIA HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT
A.   Background and Preparation
6.01      Institutional deficiencies of DER-RO, specifically in the areas
of organization, highway administration and maintenance, have been noted
(para 2.38). The project would include a program to strengthen DER-RO's
ability to administer and maintain the territory's highways and roads effi-
ciently and to provide assistance to municipalities, particularly with regard
to their increased road maintenance responsibility under the Program. DER-RO,
with DNER's assistance, estimated the scope of the work of the Department for
the 1982-1985 period and the required resources. According to these estimates,
by 1985, DER-RO would be responsible for the administration and maintenance of



- 33 -
about 4,300 km of roads (Table 6.1). The subproject items have been designed
on the basis of DER-RO's assessment of requirements, described in the Estudo
para Estructuracao e Fortalecimento do DER-RO of December 1980, which would
be used as a guide during initial execution of the program.
B.   The Strengthening Program
6.02      The project would provide consultant services over a period of
about four years to assist DER-RO in improving its organization and imple-
menting work programs and management practices for more effective highway
administration. Initially, the consultants, jointly with DER-RO, would review
DER-RO's preliminary assessment of requirements and assist DER in the imple-
mentation of a four-year program including the following:
(a) Highway Administration: establishing an organizational
framework, in head office and in the field, for carrying
out highway operations more effectively;
(b) Planning and Budgeting: developing and implementing standard
procedures for road planning, accounting, auditing and budgeting;
identifying needs and preparing annual work programs; and for
performance evaluation of the various programs;
(c) Personnel Training: developing manpower requirements,
personnel management practices, and a phased training plan
including municipal road personnel;
(d) Highway Maintenance: establishing a system for adequate
maintenance of the territory highways and roads, and preparing
and implementing annual maintenance programs.
6.03      DER-RO would establish a task group which, jointly with the consul-
tant, would be responsible for preparation of the strengthening program and
for assistance in its implementation. DER-RO's Task Group would include at
least five professionals: a senior highway engineer, a senior highway main-
tenance engineer, a mechanical engineer, a training adviser and a municipal
engineer. Also, DER-RO would create a permanent training unit responsible
for the planning, implementation and supervision of all current and future
training activities. A brief description of the proposed four-year training
plan, aimed at some 700 DER-RO and municipalities staff, is given in Annex 1.
The Training Unit would be assisted by five technical assistance staff: a
training adviser, the chief of a road training production unit, and three
instructors together with at least five counterpart instructors. During
negotiations, it was agreed that, as a condition for disbursement for the
DER-RO Strengthening Program, DER-RO would have established the Task Group
and Training Unit and assigned the five professionals and five training
instructors as counterpart staff to the project.
6.04      The technical assistance would be carried out by a local firm
assisted by foreign specialists as needed. The terms of reference for
technical assistance were prepared by DER-RO, with DNER and Bank assistance.



34 -
Special emphasis has been given to training and maintenance aspects. Con-
sulting services would be provided by a firm specializing in Highway Adminis-
tration and road maintenance, and with experience in the development and
implementation of training programs. In addition to the five staff which
would assist the Training Unit, the technical assistance team would 4nclude
four experts (one highway management specialist, one road maintenance engineer,
one equipment fleet manager, and one cost and accounting specialist) for a
period of 18 to 48 months eac i. The group would also include three municipal
engineers for a period of about -fouir years each to assist the municipal road
units to improve their organization and to prepare and carry out their work
programs, particularly in road maintenance.  During negotiations, the Govern-
ment confirmed that DER-RO would employ consultants for the technical assist-
ance whose qualifications would be satisfactory to the Bank, and that their
selection and terms and conditions of employment would be in accordance with
Bank policies and procedures.
6.05      DER-RO has drawn up an estimate of required resources for its work-
load during the 1982-1985 period. The workload was based on the best available
information of the existing territory road network and the proposed programs
for construction and improvement of feeder and access roads to be carried out
through the Bank-financed BNDE Feeder Roads Program and through the access
road component of the Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection
Project. DER-RO's maintenance responsibilities were then defined on the
assumption that DER-RO would have to maintain about 20% of the municipal road
network and that most of the existing equipment (about 190 units in fair
condition) would remain in the municipalities. Estimates of required re-
sources were then obtained using guidelines developed by DNER's Maintenance
Directorate under the Fifth and Sixth Highway projec s.  These estimates show
that about 370 new equipment units and some 10,000 m of building facilities
would be needed to attend the maintenance responsibilities of DER-RO. The
estimates are preliminary and would be revised by the technical assistance
consultants and DER-RO's Task Group during implementation of the strengthening
program. In particular, construction of road maintenance facilities close to
the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway would be coordinated with DNER so that DNER and
DER-RO's maintenance personnel would use the same facilities. Complete
organization of DER would take time; therefore any increase in output would
be gradual. It is expected, however, that, by 1985, the organization and
maintenance facilities in Ariquemes, Ji-Parana and Cacoal would be substantially
completed.
C.   Budgetary Requirements
6.06      Specific estimates of DERR3's financial requirements for the
duration of the proposed project were prepared on the basis of the estimated
1982-1985 workload. Table 6.2 shows the resulting estimates of annual re-
quirements for the operational and investment budgets, including provisions
for equipment operation and maintenance and materials and labor for road
maintenance as well as the investments required for the road construction
and institutional strengthening programs. Table 6.3 shows the monitoring
indicators to assess the performance of the strengthening program. The level
of the envisaged total annual expenditures is about US$31.3 million. Of this
amount, recurrent expenditures for highway maintenance and administration
would be about US$4.0 million or about US$1,000 per km, which would be adequate.
At the time of negotiations, the Government confirmed (a) that DER-RO would



- 35 -
maintain the highway network adequately and that the funds necessary for this
purpose would be made available to it through sufficient and timely budget
allocations; estimates of annual requirements for this purpose were confirmed;
(b) that DER-RO would establish, starting 1983, adequate accounting and
auditing procedures; and thereafter (c) that DER-RO would furnish to the Bank,
not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, an audit report
of its accounts.
VII. FEEDER ROADS CONSTRUCTION
A.   General Description
7.01      Since the two ongoing Bank loans to BNDE would be fully committed by
the end of 1981 and could not accommodate the feeder roads programs being
prepared by the Territory of Rondonia (1,530 km) and the State of Mato Grosso
(1,350 km) under the POLONOROESTE Program, the proposed project would provide
financing for about 988 km of feeder roads in Rondonia (500 km) and Mato
Grosso (488 km) through the existing Second Feeder Roads Loan (Loan 1730-BR)
financing mechanism (para 4.03). Under existing arrangements, the two feeder
road subprojects would be funded jointly by IBRD, BNDE, DNER, and the federal
government respectively as follows:
-----US$ million equivalent-
Participation    Rondonia    Mato Grosso         Total
(%)            (500 km)      (488 km)
IBRD                      32.8              7.1            7.7           14.8
BNDE                      37.0              8.0            8.6           16.6
DNER Grant                10.2               2.2            2.4           4.6
Subborrower (Federal
(Government Grant)      20.0              4.3            4.7            9.0
Total                    100.0              21.6           23.4          45.0
BNDE would continue its present system of disbursing subloans in tranches.
Each tranche disbursed by BNDE includes its own, the Bank's and DNER's grant
contributions. BNDE subsequently obtains reimbursement from DNER. The Bank
would reimburse BNDE 47% of disbursements made by BNDE under its subloans to
Rondonia and Mato Grosso. During negotiations, the Government confirmed
that it would make funds available to BNDE on a non-reimbursible basis to
cover DERMAT's and DER-RO's share of the feeder road costs.
B.   Preparation, Review and Execution
7.02      The proposed feeder roads project would be administered according
to the procedures in force for the ongoing Second Feeder Roads Project and
the guidelines of the Segundo Manual de Rodovias Vicinais, which has served
since 1979 as the basis for the preparation of applications under the Bank-
assisted Second Feeder Roads Project. The manual describes in detail the
steps required to assess the economic feasibility of roads and establishes
guidelines for the preparation of engineering, procurement, supervision and
monitoring of road subprojects.



-~ 36
7.03      Responsibility for the preparation and presentation of subloan
applications rests with the subborrowers, i.e., DERMAT and the Territory of
Rondonia, both of which presented their respective subloan applications to
BNDE in July 1981- The subloans are expected to be approved by January 1982.
7.04      In Rondonia, DER-RO, jointly with the Secretariat of Agriculture,
prepared a tentative list of feeder roads comprising some 1,530 km, of which
500 kmi, including 13 road sections (Table 7.1), would constitute the first
package included in the proposed project.  The 13 road sections, to be con-
structed to class D standards of the manual, would be located in the area of
the Agricultural Development Project (para 1.02). Feasibility studies for the
total program of 15530 'Km, and engineering, including bidding documents for
some 230 km, are being completed by DER-RO with assistance of local consultants.
Works would start in October 1981 and be completed by the end of 1983.
7.05      in Mato Grosso, DERMAT, jointly with the State Secretariat of Agricul-
ture, also prepared a tentative program of feeder roads with a total length
of about 1,350 km to provide mainly for the existing settlement areas located
in the municiDalities of Caceres, Mirassol do Oeste, Tangara da Serra, and
Barra do Bugres. A development project involving these municipalities has
been prepared as part of POLONOROESTE and has been appraised by Bank staff.
DERMAT's first package includes 11 sections of priority roads, totaling some
488 km (Table 7.1), to be implemented in the 1982-1984 period. DERMAT, with
the assistance of Consultants, is carrying out the corresponding feasibility
studies which were presented to BNDE for consideration in September 1981.
The proposed roads would be constructed to classes C and D standards of the
manual following results of the feasibility studies. Works would start in
March 1982 and be completed by mid-1984.
7X06      BNDE would be responsible for approving the two subloans and
would benefit from the assistance of DNER. DNER would analyze the technical
adequacy of the proposal, including a review of the standards, the costs, the
capability of the applicant to supervise the construction and carry out the
maintenance of the roads, the compatibility of the proposal with federal or
state road or highway development plans, and the suitability of the plan for
the execution of the project. BNDE would be responsible for the analysis of
the economic viability of the subprojects and would have to seek Bank concur-
rence before signing the subloans.
VIII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
8.01      The proposed project is an integral part of the POLONOROESTE Program.
The various components of this program are mutually dependent to a high degree
and are, therefore, conceived of only in the context of the total program.
The benefits and, to some extent, the costs also can thus not be taken in
isolation from each other. The main economic evaluation is therefore the one
for the whole program (Annex 2). This overall evaluation indicates that the
program is economically well justified, having discounted benefits almost five



- 37 -
times as large as the discounted costs. The POLONOROESTE Program, with
a total estimated cost of about US$1.5 billion, is expected to benefit an
existing population of about one million, which is growing rapidly, and to
increase agricultural and timber production in the area from an estimated
800,000 tons in 1979 to about 5.7 million tons in 1994.
8.02      The Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway component is a major item in the
POLONOROESTE Program, representing about 41% of the total investments.
It has therefore been considered to be of interest to have a separate evalua-
tion of this component to assure that the high economic rate of return of
the program as a whole does not hide an uneconomic highway component. Since,
because of the interdependence of the different program components, the
assignment of benefits to the road becomes rather arbitrary, it has been
assumed that, for purposes of the economic evaluation of the highway, the
other components are not implemented. This can then be seen to represent the
lower bound of the return on the highway investment with the program implemented,
or the situation which would exist if, for some reason, only the highway and
none of the other components were built.
8.03      The strengthening of the Rondonia Highway Department is a pre-
requisite for the POLONOROESTE Program. Its justification is given in
Chapter VI.
8.04      The economic evaluation for the feeder roads will be included
in the feasibility studies to be submitted to and reviewed by BNDE and the
Bank.
B.   Meth3dology
8.05      In carrying out the analysis, it has been assumed that (a) the
Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway would be the only element of the POLONOROESTE
program to be implemented; and (b) that this investment would not create
any traffic in addition to that which would take place without it. These
are clearly conservative assumptions since the highway would not be built
without other components and since, by its reduced transport costs, the
improved highway would "generate" some traffic above and beyond what would
take place in its absence.
8.06      Savings in vehicle operating costs for existing traffic and its
growth due to the region's own vigorous development are the only benefits
against the costs of reconstructing and paving the road. Non-quantified is
the possibly significant benefit of keeping the road open to traffic at all
times. Presently, the road is closed for weeks at a time during the six-
month rainy season. The "without project" case has therefore additional
costs that are not quantified in the present analysis.
8.07      The traffic volumes on which the calculations are based, as well as
their underlying assumptions, are discussed in Section C following. The
forecasts are based on counts of existing traffic and forecasts of agricultural
production and export volumes in the "without POLONOROESTE" scenario. The seven
sections for which forecasts have been made coincide with the sections used for
design purposes. The analysis was also carried out, in addition to the Caceres
to Ariquemes section, which comprises the project proper (sections 1-5), for
each section separately and for the whole highway from Cuiaba to Porto Velho
(sections 1-7). For the 47-km long section between Corrego Campinas and
Caceres, it was assumed that, for the purposes of economic evaluation, the
conditions were identical to those for the whole section from Cuiaba to
Caceres.



8.08      The "without project" case is defined as maintaining the condition
of the highway at about the same level as it is today. This would require,
because of the growing traffic volumes, a considerably increased maintenance
level.
8.09      For the economic evaluation, the costs are net of taxes, subsidies
and transfers. A shadow price for foreign exchange, which is 15% above the
official exchange rate, has been used. The unit costs used - financial,
economic and foreign exchange components - are shown in Table 8.1. All
calculations have been done in January 1981 Cr$ (US$ = 68.1 Cr$).
8.10      The calculations necessary have been carried out using the HDM
(Highway Design Model) in the Bank.
C.   Traffic
(i)  Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
8.11      Road transport accounts for the vast majority of regional traffic
flows. In 1978, an estimated 1.3 million tons of freight and well over five
million passengers were carried by this mode. Although complete information
on the composition of freight carried overland is not available, it would
appear that the major items are those typical of a frontier area at an early
stage of development. Regional exports consist mainly of primary goods such
as minerals, lumber, and agricultural products; imports are mainly manu-
factured goods such as machinery, parts, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.
8.12      While the flow of vehicles along the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway
varies seasonably, the average daily flow may be inferred from traffic counts.
Traffic for each of seven sections was estimated on the basis of counts
carried out in Rondonia (June, July, August and October 1980) by GEIPOT and
in Mato Grosso (1979 and first, second, and third quarters of 1980) by DERMAT.

8.13     Virtually no information is available on traffic flows on state
and local roads. Yet, a sizable proportion of the passengers and freight
moved on the main trunk roads originated in areas removed from the main
highway and, therefore, must have initially used the secondary and local
network. However, only case-by-case reviews of activities in relevant sub-areas
would provide the necessary information.



- 39 -
8.14     Based on the estimates of present traffic and forecasts for agricul-
tural, forestry and livestock production, the 1984, 1989 and 1994 traffic on
the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway was estimated. These estimates were made under
two different assumptions. The first is essentially a continuation of past
trends without major concerted investments. This is the forecast used in the
economic evaluation. The other includes the investments foreseen under the
POLONOROESTE Program. The purpose of this forecast is to check the adequacy
of the road design against the expected traffic volumes. In more detail, the
two scenarios imply the following:
(ii) Scenario A. "Without POLONOROESTE"
8.15      The first scenario envisages the future as a continuation of past
trends. It is based on the assumptions that there would be no investments
to improve the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway or the feeder roads network; no
strengthening of institutions responsible for land use zoning, Indian affairs,
and environmental protection; and no improved land titling or additional tech-
nical support for agriculture, leading to a continuation of the present,
largely exploitative, methods of agriculture. Yields would decline in the
medium and long terms. Market access would become increasingly difficult as
the agricultural perimeter expands, preventing access to inputs, and leading
to larger on-farm losses because farmers could not evacuate their production.
(iii) Scenario B. "With POLONOROESTE"
8.16      The second scenario represents the future with a full range of
government activities as expected to be implemented in the POLONORESTE Program.
More specifically, upgrading of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway and improvement
of the feeder roads network would be linked to a comprehensive program of
agricultural development. The latter would include measures to ensure that
land is zoned according to agricultural potential and that feeder roads and
physical and social infrastructure and services (including land titling) are
implanted only in agricultural zones. Institutions responsible for non-
agricultural reserves (e.g., FUNAI, IBDF) would be strengthened to prevent, as
much as possible, settlement land clearing in these areas. Indiscriminate
land clearing would be checked, and, by good initial land selection, improved
land use and technical support, there would be a move toward sustained cropping
(emphasizing tree crops) rather than short-term exploitation of the land.
Use of better land, plus technical support, would lead to an upward trend in
yields in the medium to long term, and the integration of feeder roads with
agricultural support would reduce on-farm loss.
8.17      In order to arrive at the traffic estimates of future traffic
volumes, two categories of traffic were distinguished and handled separately,
i.e., agricultural export traffic and other traffic. For the agricultural
export traffic, the forecasts of exportable agricultural surpluses (Table 8.2)
were allocated to specific, geographically defined administrative units, and
thence to road construction lots (Table 8.3), thus establishing a direct link
between agricultural export production and traffic. Next, these relationships
were translated into number of originating trucks (Tables 8.4 and 8.5).
It was assumed that exports originating in Mato Grosso would all go toward
the southeast, whereas exports from Rondonia would be evenly split between
the southeast and Manaus.



- 40 -
8.18      The balance of the traffic, i.e., traffic other than agricultural
export traffic, has been assumed to develop at the same rate as the agricultural
production, which is taken as a proxy for the general economic development.
Tables 8.6 and 8.7 show the sum of the forecast agricultural export and other
traffic. These results are summarized in the following table:

8.19      The average daily traffic according to Scenario B is what represents
the forecast traffic with the implementation of the POLONOROESTE Program.
The geometric and structural design of the road is compatible with this
forecast traffic.
D.   Beneficiaries
8.20      Within the POLONOROESTE context, the highway is a prerequisite
for the implementation of the program objectives. As such, the benefits of
the highway are indistinguishable from the benefits of the program, which
would accrue to the whole area of influence and, more indirectly, to the
Brazilian economy at large.
8.21      However, in the context of the present economic analysis, it is
assumed that the project would result in primarily reduced vehicle operating
costs. The impact of the proposed project would therefore first be felt by
the road transport industry. The high degree of competitiveness of this
industry in Brazil would insure that, in the medium to long run, project
benefits would be passed on to farmers and consumers in the region. The
intraregional income distribution effect of the project is estimated to
be negligible because no specific group consumes more transport services
than others in the region. Since the major part of the population consists
of relatively poor migrant settlers, the proposed project may be expected
to have a positive income-distribution effect vis-a-vis the country at large.
E.   Economic Assessment
8.22      The economic cost and benefit streams for the "without" and "with"
project cases are shown in Table 8.8 and summarized below:
"Without" Project Costs                        "With" Project Costs
(Million US$ January 1981)                  (Million US$ January 1981)
Construction   Maintenance  Veh. Operat.   Construction  Maintenance  Veh. Operat.
Costs         Costs         Costs             Costs         Costs         Costs
0             148         7,867              353           184          4,674



- 41 -
8.23      The maintenance costs would increase by about 25% in the "with"
as compared to the "without" project case over the life of the project.
The maintenance costs in both cases are very small, however, in comparison
to the vehicle operating costs. Not only are the absolute amounts of the
vehicle operating costs large, but also are their relative differences.
The quantifiable benefits would thus be derived almost entirely from a
reduction in vehicle operating costs, which would decrease by about 40% with
the implementation of the project.
8.24      The following table summarizes the outcome of the economic analysis:
Net Present
Value at 12%   Economic Internal    First Year
Road Section                       (Million US$)  Rate of Return %   Rate of Return %

Caceres to Porto Espiridiao              125               49.8               72.6
P. Espiridiao to Barracao Queimado    109                  24.4               24.4
B. Queimado to Rio Rondon                106               29.6               32.1
Rio Rondon to Ji-Parana                  141               34.0                25.3
Ji-Parana to Ariquemes                    73               25.2               23.6
Ariquemes to C. Campinas                 570               30.2               30.0
Cuiaba to Porto Velho                    625               27.6               27.4
No section has an internal rate of return below 23%, and the average weighted
for the project as a whole is about 30%, which is about the same as for the
highway as a whole between Cuiaba and Porto Velho. Since each of the sections
considered represents a clearly feasible investment, it follows that an
alternative which foresees upgrading and paving only the worst parts of the
road, i.e., between Porto Espiridiao and Rio Rondon which is presently not
passable all year, would not yield as high a return as the foreseen project.
F.   Sensitivity Analysis
8.25      The economic return is rather insensitive to variations in both
costs and benefits as illustrated by the table following:
Internal Rates of Return of Net Streams
Base Benefit       -10%       -20%        -50%
Base Cost             30.2            27.9       25.5        17.0
+10%                  28.1             25.9      23.6        15.5
+20%                  26.3             24.2      22.0        14.2
+50%                  22.0             20.1      18.1        11.1
This table indicates that the project would become economically unfeasible
only if the benefits decreased by 50% at the same time as the construction
cost increased by the same percentage. Since the benefits consist almost
entirely of the difference in vehicle operating costs without and with the
project and since this difference is essentially proportional to the forecast
traffic levels, it would take a radical decrease in traffic forecasts, and



- 42 -
also in the underlying agricultural production assumptions, for the benefits
to decrease to such a degree. A lesser decrease in benefits of about 20%,
coupled with an increase of the same magnitude in the construction costs,
would still leave the project with a 22% internal rate of return.
G.   Conclusion
8.26      Thus, even with existing traffic alone, i.e., without taking into
account generated traffic and without considering the impact of the imple-
mentation of the full POLONOROESTE Program, the proposed project generates a
large enough flow of expected benefits to justify the proposed investment.
The proposed project is therefore suitable for Bank financing.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
9.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
on the following:
(a) default under any of the three loan agreements (para 1.03);
(b) DNER to accomplish in 1982, at least 2,500 km of periodic main-
tenance and 1,300 km of rehabilitation works in the paved highway
network and that, in the subsequent years, the maintenance and
rehabilitation levels would be set in light of a pluriannual pro-
gram being prepared by DNER (para 2.18) and DNER to have adequate
resources for rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing highway
network, and for the construction of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway
(paras 2.32 and 4.14);
(c) auditing and accounting requirements (paras 2.36, 4.18, 4.22 and
6.06);
(d) DER-RO to prepare, before June 30, 1982, a plan of action for
recruiting and retaining personnel (para 2.40);
(e) subsequent feeder road packages to be prepared (para 4.03),
and the Government to provide timely funding for financing
their implementation (para 4.03) and to make funds available
to cover DER-RO's and DERMAT's share of the first packages
(para 7.01);
(f) counterpart funds for DER-RO's strengthening program, including
funding of expenditures for adequate maintenance of the territory
roads, to be made available through sufficient and timely budgetary
allocations (paras 4.15 and 6.06);



- 43 -
(g) DNER to establish a revolving fund with an initial deposit of
US$12 million to meet its obligations related to the highway
construction and to make regular deposits as required to
ensure that there would be sufficient funds available to cover
project costs (para 4.19);
(h) implementation schedule for the two end sections Cuiaba-Corrego
Campinas and Ariquemes-Porto Velho (para 5.04);
(i) construction of the highway according to the agreed design
standards, and arrangements to regularly measure traffic and
pavement condition (para 5.09);
(j) the establishment, by March 31, 1982, of a coordinating group,
including two supervision experts, and the terms and conditions for
the supervising consultants (para 5.10);
(k) financial resources to be allocated for maintaining the highway,
once built (para 5.12);
(1) existing truck weighing regulations to be enforced on all federal
highways and particularly on the Cuiaba-Porto Velho Highway (para
5.14); and
(m)  the arrangements between DNER and FUNAI to control Aimerindian
matters during construction of the highway (para 5416).
9.02      Effectiveness of the loan agreements for the proposed Rondonia
Health Project and the Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection
Project would be conditions for loan effectiveness of the proposed Highway
Project (para 4.23).
9.03      Establishment of the revolving fund and of DNER's initial deposit
would be a condition for disbursement for construction of the Cuiba-Porto
Velho highway (para 4.19).
9.04      It was agreed that, as a condition for disbursement for DER-RO's
strengthening program, DER-RO would have established the Task Group and Train-
ing Unit and assigned the five professionals and five instructors as counterpart
staff to the project (para 6.03).
9.05      The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$240 million.
The loan would be for a period of 15 years, including a three-year grace
period.

Proposed Training Program
1.        DER-RO's four-year (1982-1985) training program is primarily
addressed to road foremen/overseers, equipment operators/drivers, and mecha-
nical personnel, although other categories of personnel would be included as
necessary. The program, aimed at some 700 DER-RO and Municipalities staff,
would include the: (i) establishment of a DER-RO permanent Training Unit;
(ii) recruitment of training specialists/instructors; (iii) organization and
operation of two field production units for road supervisors and mechanical
staff; (iv) allocation of training equipment and materials; (v) organization
of periodic seminars and short courses for senior staff; and (vi) training
(fellowships) of middle and high level maintenance personnel and training
officers.
2.        Training of road foremen and overseers, heavy equipment operators
and drivers would be carried out mostly in the field through the operation
of a mobile Road Training Production Unit (RTPU). Thus, trainees would
learn under actual working conditions while performing needed maintenance or
pavement rehabilitation works on specific sections of roads. Training of
mechanics would be carried out principally at the Ji-Parana workshop by
establishing a Mechanical Training Production Unit (MTPU). In addition to
some general courses, training of mechanical staff would focus on preventive
maintenance and repair of equipment, under the supervision of experienced
mechanical instructors, thus enhancing DER-RO and Municipalities' equipment
maintenance capabilities and raising the level of equipment availability.
DER-RO would provide adequate spare parts for the training of mechanics
through the duration of the program. Seminars on different topics related
to maintenance management, accounting and administration would be conducted
periodically for middle and high level maintenance staff by technical assist-
ance staff and IPR Training Division. Short visits/courses abroad for
seven maintenance engineers and three staff members of the proposed Training
Unit are also included in the proposed training program.
3.        Limited physical training facilities would be built at Porto Velho
and Ji-Parana for theoretical and on-the-job training of road supervisors
and mechanical staff. Training equipment and materials, varying from road
maintenance equipment to workshop tools and audio-visual training aids, would
also be provided through the proposed loan. All training activities would
be coordinated by the Training Unit, which would initially be assisted by
five training technical assistance specialists/instructors (a training advisor,
the Chief of RTPU, the Chief of MTPU and two instructors). DER-RO would assign,
as counterparts, five instructors including one experienced administrator,

ANNEX 1
Page 2
three senior technicians (RTPU and MTPU), one senior equipment operator,
and other personnel (RTPU). They would work closely with the technical
assistance training specialists, and it is expected that they would take
over after the specialists' assignment is completed to follow up and
consolidate action taken during the four-year program. In addition to
on-the-job production training expected to be carried out by technical
assistance staff and DER-RO instructors as they become available, other
programs would be implemented by the equipment manufacturers/suppliers,
SENAI, PIMPO, and IPR. The terms of reference for technical assistance
services, including training, were reviewed and agreed during appraisal.
To establish the necessary coordination, it is expected that the same
consulting firm which would provide the technical assistance would assist
in developing and implementing the training program. The estimated man-months
of consulting services of training activities to be provided under the project
are as follows:
Training advisor                                   24 man-months
Chief of Road Training Production Unit (RTPU)   36 man-months
Mechanic instructors (MIPU) (2)                    36 man-months
Equipment Operator Instructor                      24 man-months
Total                      120 man-months
4.        The total estimated cost of the training program is about
US$1.7 million including:
120 man-months of Training Advisors and Instructors  US$636,000
Seminars and Training Courses in IPR                        182,000

Economic Assessment of the POLONOROESTE Program
1.        The economic assessment of the POLONOROESTE Program is based on a
comparison of the economic consequences of a situation with and without
the Program implemented. The general descriptions of the without and with
program cases are the following:
Scenario A: "Without POLONOROESTE"t
2.        The first scenario envisages the future as a continuation of past
trends. It is based on the assumptions that there would be no investments
to improve the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway or the feeder roads network; no
strengthening of institutions responsible for the land use zoning, Indian
affairs, and environmental protection; and no improved land titling or addi-
tional technical support for agriculture, leading to a continuation of the
present, largely exploitable, methods of agriculture. Yields would decline in
the medium and long terms. Market access would become increasingly difficult
as the agriculture perimeter expands, preventing access to inputs, and leading
to larger on-farm losses because farmers could not evacuate their production.
Scenario B: "With POLONOROESTE"
3.        The second scenario represents the future with a full range of
government activities as expected to be implemented in the POLONOROESTE
Program. More specifically, upgrading of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway and
improvement of the feeder roads network would be linked to a comprehensive
program of agricultural development. The latter would include measures to
ensure that land is zoned according to agricultural potential and that feeder
roads and physical and social infrastructure and services (including land
titling) are implanted only in agricultural zones. Institutions responsible
for non-agricultural reserves, (e.g., FUNAI, IBDF) would be strengthened
to prevent, as much as possible, settlement land clearing in these areas.
Indiscriminate land clearing would be checked, and, by good initial land
selection, improved land use and technical support, there would be a move
toward sustained cropping (emphasizing tree crops) rather than short-term
exploitation of the land. Use of better land, plus technical support, would
lead to an upward trend in yields in the medium to long term, and the integra-
tion of feeder roads with agricultural support would reduce on-farm loss.
4.        The program generates two main kinds of quantifiable benefits, i.e.,
value added of agricultural production because of improved and expanded
agricultural output and vehicle operating cost savings due to the improved
Cuiaba to Porto Velho road connection.

ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        The costs included are those of agricultural production costs,
vehicle operating costs for agricultural traffic, and construction and
maintenance costs for the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway as well as the feeder
roads.
6.        Tables 1 and 2 show the costs and benefits for the "without" and
"with" program situation respectively. The agricultural production value
added is,   in all cases, given net of on-farm costs.  The off-farm agricul-
tural production costs are included in the "Agricultural Production Cost"
column. The "without" program scenario does thus, by definition, not have any
"Agricultural Production Costs." The "Vehicle Operating Costs Savings" column
includes only nonagricultural vehicles, and, for the traffic that materializes
only in the "with" program case, only half of the vehicle operating cost
savings has been included. The average trip distance on the feeder roads has
been assumed to be 20 and 40 km in the "without" and "with" project cases
respectively.
7.        Foreign exchange has been shadow-priced 15% above its nominal value.
Labor has not been shadow-priced. Costs and benefits are net of taxes and
subsidies.
8.        Table 3 shows the incremental costs and benefits due to the program.
The present values of the incremental costs and benefits, taken over the
20-year period under consideration and discounted 12%, which is considered
to be the opportunity cost of capital in Brazil, are the following:
Present Value                         Present Value

9.        The program thus yields a present net of more than US$3,900 million.
Differently stated, the expected benefits are about five times as large as the
expected costs. The corresponding internal rate of return is higher than 50%.
This suggests that the POLONOROESTE Program is economically very worthwhile.
10.       There are also major expected benefits of the program of a largely
non-quantifiable nature. They include the protection of large ecologically
sensitive areas (see Annex 7, Agricultural Development and Environmental
Protection Project SAR), the protection of the Amer-Indian population, consider-
able strengthening of the institutional capacity in the region and improved
knowledge of the Amazon Basin environment. There are also difficult-to-quantify
costs attached to the development of the Northwest region, such as those
associated with invasions of unsuitable soils, potential endangerment of
native flora and fauna species and pressure on previously isolated Amer-Indian
populations. Since, however, the occupation and development process of the
region has already substantially begun, such costs would be far higher if
development activities were not guided and coordinated through the proposed
program. Environmental monitoring built into the program (see paragraph 4.24,
Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection Project SAR) should
considerably enhance the capacity to detect and respond to adverse ecological
trends.
