PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURUNDI
FIRST FORESTRY PROJECT
(Cr. 918-BU)
PREFACE
1.       This project, the first  in  the  forestry  sector in Burundi, was
identified in May 1977 and appraised in June-July 1978. Credit 918-BU for
US$4.3 million equivalent was approved by the Board in May 1979 and became
effective in October. The credit was closed in September 1985, more than
one year later than scheduled, and was fully disbursed.
2.       This Project Completion Report  (PCR)  was  prepared by the Africa
Regional staff and is based, inter alia, on the Borrower's PCR, the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan Guarantee, and Project Agreements, supervision
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal
Bank memoranda.
3.       This PCR was read  by  the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and to cofinanciers on February 23,
1989, for comments by April  13,  1989.   Comments received are attached as
Annexes 5 and 6. The Borrower's comments have been fully integrated into
the text.

by the Government, IDA, FAC, EEC and the UNDP.
Obiectives
2.       The project had two main  objectives:   to strengthen the Forestry
Department, and to promote tree planting.
Implementation Experience
3.       The  project  was  implemented  by  the  Forestry  Department (FD)
between 1979 and 1985.   The  physical  targets were largely achieved.  The
quality of management and of output were good, and the project was rated
'1-' throughout.   The  main  implementation  problems  were occasional late
availability of counterpart funds, land conflicts with the population, and
the fact that the project was mainly being implemented by expatriates. The
j           latter  two  problems  will  be   further  dealt  with  under  respectively
'Findings' and 'Sustainability".
Results
4.       To strengthen the Forestry Department,  the project, with the help
of UNDP technical assistance, trained some 80 middle-level forestry
technicians at a local training  institute.   On the higher or professionrl
level, the project was less successful, providing only one two-year
scholarship to the Forestry Faculty at the University of Antananarivo in
Madagascar, whereas four other scholarships were unused due to lack of
candidates. The project also financed vehicles and a headquarters building
for FD.
5.       As regards tree  planting,  the  project  established 81 nurseries
which, during the implementation period, produced seven million seedlings
for sale in rural areas.   With  these  seedlings, 2,700 ha of communal and
1,100 ha of individual plantations were established, which, over the next
three decades, can be expected to produce more than a million cubic meters
of wood, besides soil protection and other environmental benefits. The
project also established industrial  plantations:   2,000 ha of eucalyptus,
mainly for charcoal and building poles, and 4,000 ha of pine, mainly for
sawtimber. The industrial plantations can be expected to yield about two
and a half million cubic meters of wood over the next three decades.



- vi-
Sustainability
6.       The project's main sustainability  problem  during the first phase
was the fact that it was mainly being implemented by expatriates. However,
in December 1988, about half-way through the second phase, the project was
'Burundizedu, the three remaining expatriates being nomiaated advisers.
7.       Although the seedlings from  the  project nurseries are being sold
to communes and individuals, not distributed free as in many other
countries, the sales prices do not cover the cost of production, nor is it
likely that such complete cost recovery can be achieved, except in the case
of seedlings sold in urban areas. However, if FD becomes more active about
marketing the output from its industrial plantations, the revenue, even
though it would go to Treasury, could offset the cost of maintaining the
nurseries.
Findings
8.       Obtaining  land  for  the  industrial  plantations  in  a  densely
populated country like Burundi occasionally led to conflicts with farmers
and pastoralists. For that reason, in the second phase of the project
which is now being implement'd, the area of new industrial plantations has
been reduced, while there is a greater emphasis on agro-sylvo pastoralism.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURUNDI
FIRST FORESTRY PROJECT
(Cr. 918-BU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The Burundi Forestry Project Credit Agree_ent 918-BU was signed
in October 1979. The Project was co-financed by IDA (US$4.30 million),
FAC (US$1.86 million), EEC (U$1.2 million), the UNDP (US$0.70 million),
and the Government of Burundi (US$0.77 million). The Project's
estimated costs thus totalled US$8.83 million. The Project was the
first stage of a long-term program to develop basic forestry services
and plantations supplying fuelwood, building poles, and pine timber.
The original components were: (i) establishment of 30 communal
nurseries to produce eucalyptus seedlings; (2) the development of 2,0000
ha of short-rotation eucalyptus plantation; and (3) the development of
about 5,000 ha pine plantation. Additional components were technical
assistance, studies and training.
1.2      Overall there were no major revisions, and implementation
differed little from the original proposals. The Project achieved
nearly all of its original objectives. Especially well established is
the rural nursery component. It created over twice the number of
nurseries originally planned, although the numbet of seedlings per
nursery was reduced by half, so the total number of seedlings sold
approximately equalled the original target. Noteworthy is the success
the Project had in its ability to sell, rather than merely give away,
its seedlings. The Project was least successful in achieving its target
of training Burundi nationals as professional foresters to take over the
project management.
1.3      The Project was designed to address three long-term forestry
development issues:
a. The need for trained Burundi foresters. At the time of the
Project's inception Burunei had only one trained forester.
The Project achieved moderate success in addressing this
issue by training 80 middle-level foresters. However, the
goal of training enough high-level (professional) foresters
in five years to replace the Project's e..patriate experts
proved to be over-ambitious.
b. The need for a forest policy, and for a price structure
reflecting the real cost of forest products. This
component of the Project was largely achieved in 1985 when
a forest policy was prepared by the Government with the
help of FAC, EEC, IDA and other development agencies.
Because of the recent inception of the new forest policy,
and the fact that the pricing structure is still not
finalized, it is still too early to tell how effective the
aeolicy and the pricing will be.
c. The need for treeplanting, taking into account Burundi's
keen competition for farmland, grazingland and forestland.
The Project's rural nursery and plantation components were
largely successful in meeting the targets in this respect.

II. FORESTRY SUBSECTOR
A. Resources and Consumption
2.1      Burundi's forests and plantations, which presently occupy about
7% or 200,000 ha of the country's total area, are being depleted far                   H
more rapidly than they are being replaced, due partly to the weakness of
the forest service. Wood consumption - estimates vary from 0.25 to
1.0 m3 per person per year - is primarily for fuel, especially in rural
aracss, although polewood is also used there for construction of homes,
and sawnwood is used in urban areas for construction and for furniture
production.
B. Forestry Department
2.2      The Forestry Department (Departement des Eaux et Forets) is
part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (see Annexes 1 and 2).
The Government allocates very little of its budget to the Forestry
Department (US$190,000 in 1983). The latter is organized at provincial
and arrondissement levels. Its effectiveness is hampered by lack of
transport and supervision. Substantially more resources are needed if
forestry objectives are to be realized. Presently, nearly all forestry
investment is carried out through outside development agency financing.
C. Forest Policy
2.3      The 200,000 ha of forested land in Burundi is made up of
approximately 702 man-made plantations and 30% natural forests. It
falls into four ownership categories: Government forests and
plantations, religious communities' plantations, communal plantations
and privately owned plantations. Utilization rights and maintenance
duties of forestlands are often unclear, and market prices of forest
products are often far below their replacement value. The Government is
taking steps to address these problems. In 1980, the Government
restructured the Forestry Department so as to be better able to control
and enforce forest policy. Then, in 1985, with the help of FAC, the
Project, and various other development agencies, the Government issued a
new Burundi Forestry Code, redefined forest policy, and issued a new
price structuring strategy. These documents will facilitate forest
resource management in Burundi.
2.4      Charcoal is the preferred fuel of Bujumbura's population.  It
is normally produced and marketed by jobbers using traditional and
highly inefficient techniques (yields of charcoal from wood using
traditional methods - 10% on a weight basis). Bujumbura's annual demand
for charcoal is estimated at 7,000 tons and traditional techniques
require approximately 90,000 to 100,000 m3 of wood to meet this demand.
Prices of wood commodities are difficult for the Government to control,
especially because in Burundi, unlike in Kenya, the Government owns
little of the country's plantations and therefore cannot control the
price at the supply point (plantation), as the Kenyan Government can.



-3-
D. Future Energy Needs
2.5      Estimates of Burundi's future energy needs are varied, but it
is clear that the future demand for fuelvood and - though less important
- construction wood cannot Le met solely from conventional plantations.
The problem is that the theoretical requirement for plantations
(approximately 50,000 ha in year 2,000) far exceeds both the capacity of
the Forestry Department and suitable available public land resources.
Thus, the size of conventional plantation projects will be determined
more by what is possible than by what is desirable. For the rural
population, the ideal solution would be for most households to have
their own small woodlots to supply their fuelwood and construction wood
needs. Assuming that the average rural household requires at least 2m3
of wood annually, then about two-tenths of one hectare (320 trees, or
less if free-growing) would be sufficient to meet their needs more or
less indefinitely. As for the urban population, a combination of more
efficient charcoal-making and charcoal-using techniques along with
alternative energy sources is probably the most realistic solution.
E. Alternative Energy Sources
2.6      Peat seems to be the most attractive of the energy alternatives
now known. Burundi has large unutilized peat resources which, in
theory, could supply a large part of energy needs for many decades.
However, considerable research and trials will be required before this
potential can be exploited. Petroleum products would generally be
prohibitively expensive for the rural population, but suspected large
reserves within Burundi are now being investigated by Amoco. Thus,
petroleum in the form of kerosene may one day prove to be an important
and appropriate substitute, for the relatively wealthier urban
population. However, for rural households it is difficult to envisage
fuels other than wood and (with detriment to farm productivity)
agricultural residues.
F. Ongoing Forestry Projects
2.7      A number of forestry projects other than that financed by IDA
and FAC are currently underway in Burundi. Belgium is financing an
afforestation Project over 12,000 ha in south central Burundi
(previously co-financed with Saudi Arabia). The EEC's European
Development Fund will finance the afforestation of 3,200 ha at Rugazi
and 6,000 ha near Gihofi. FAC is financing the planting of a 500 ha
protection belt around the natural forest of the Zaire/Nile Divide in
northern Burundi. Three IDA-financed rural development projects
(Kirimiro, Ngozi III, and Muyinga) have forestry components. Most of
these projects have a regional rather than a sectoral focus, and they
generally concentrate on tree-planting through extension work.



-4-
III. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin
3.1      The first formal discussions for possible Bank financing for a
Burundi Forestry Project took place in October 1976 (see Basic Data
Sheet), when a Bank forester visited Bujumbura. An identification
mission including an IDA forester and an FAO forestry consultant visited
Burundi in May 1977. On the basis of the identification report, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock confirmed the Government's
interest in the Project b" letter in October 1977 and requested Bank
assistance in Project preparation. An IDA mission visited Burundi in
March 1978 to assist the Government with preparation of a Project
proposal. Details of the proposed investments, implementation
procedures and major issues raised by the Project were reviewed with
Government officials at the conclusion of the preparation mission and in
letters to the Government. The Government formally requested IDA
appraisal in a cable signed by the Prime Minister. The preparation
mission prepared a report in Washington, but Government officials did
not have an opportunity to review it prior to appraisal.
B. Appraisal Issues
3.2      In reviewing the Project with senior Government officials, the
following long-term forestry development issues were discussed:
(a) Need for coordination of investments within the forestry
sub-sector. Most of the money invested in Burundi's
forest resources comes from outside agencies.
(b) Need for manpower planning and training for the forestry
sub-sector. The Project recognized that without trained
foresters, Burundi has little hope of efficiently
determining, implementing and monitoring its own forest
resource policy. The Project's original intentions were
to determine the number of foresters Burundi would need in
the near future and then begin their tec.hnical training.
(c) Lack of clear long-term forest policies, notably for
pricing of forest products and control of existing and
planned plantations.
(d) Land use for forestry development. The keen competition
for farmland and grazingland necessarily leaves forestland
as a lower priority amongst the rural population.



-5-
C. Targets and Goals
3.3      There were no substantial changes between the original Project
proposal and the final Staff Appraisal Report. The Project was to be
the first stage of Burundi's long-term program for the development of
basic forestry services and plantations supplying fuelwood, building
poles and timber, and establishing long-term production and marketing
policies for its forestry sub-sector. The Project proposed in the Staff
Appraisal Report comprised the following components, to be implemented
over five years:
(a) The establishment of nurseries in 30 of the 79 Communes of
Burundi. These nurseries, which would be managed by the
Forestry Department, would produce high quality seedlings
of eucalyptus and other species to be sold to communal
organizations or private farmers. The staff assigned to
the nurseries would strengthen existing forestry extension
services at the communal level by providing technical
advice on, inter alia, planting and maintenance of
seedlings.
(b) Development of 2,000 ha of eucalyptus near Bujumbura as
short-rotation plantations to supply charcoal, firewood
and building poles for the population of Bujumbura.
(c) Development of a 5,000 ha pine plantation near Bururi in
the south to produce saw timber.
(d) Training of Burundi forestry staff, principally through
courses for higher and middle levels.
(e) Technical assistance for Project management and on-the-job
training for Burundi counterpart staff.
(f) Studies and applied trials, notably a study of Burundi's
energy use and needs, trials of more efficient charcoal
production techniques and development of new designs for
cooking stoves for the rural population.
D. Board Approval
3.4      The Board approved the Project without discussion on May 24,
1979, and the Development Credit Agreement (918 BU) was signed between
IDA and the Burundi Government in June 1, 1979. IDA, FAC, EEC, UNDP and
the Burundi Government shared the costs of this US$8.83 million Project
(see para. 1.1). The Project's actual costs equalled its estimated
costs. However, the allocation to cost categories of the US$4.3 million
IDA Credit was slightly modified during implementation. Distribution of
Project costs are discussed more fully in para. 5.05.



-6-
E. Benefits
3.5      The Project's principal production benefits were in the SAR
seen to be seedlings for plantations in 30 communes (it was hoped that
thereafter the Forestry Department would create similar rural nurseries
in the remaining 49 communes), eucalyptus for fuelwood and building
poles (the first harvest to be about year 9), and pine timber production
(beginning about year 12, but major production not beginning before year
25). Other expected benefits would be training of forestry staff,
strengthening existing institutions and assisting in development of
clear long-term pricing and exploitation policies for forest resources.
In the short-term, there were direct benefits to the rural population
through the Project nurseries enabling them to develop their own
plantations, and through increased employment opportunity in areas
chosen for Project plantation development. Long-term benefits included
increased soil fertility and soil stabilization and, especially for the
urban population, lower costs of fuelwood and construction wood.
F. Risks
3.6      The Project was relatively simple, appropriately addressing
Burundi's forestry sub-sector needs. It was designed to require little
reliance on non-project administrative services or farmers' involuntary
support. Instead it appealed to the farmers' self-interest, either by
paying them for their labor, or by providing them with Project-produced
seedlings, i.e. it provided incentives to farmers. No unusual project
risks were identified. Delays arising from material delivery problems
would have no significant impact upon the Project's eventual benefits.
The principal risk related to the rural nursery component was the
uncertainty of whether farmers would pay for the seedlings. The
Goverrment had been giving its agricultural seedlings (coffee, tea etc.)
away free. During implementation, the Project worked with the
Government to require payment for all seedlings, and it found the rural
population quite willing and able to pay, especially when the Project
increased its production of multiple-use and fruit tree species.
Another risk identified was the possible lower-than-anticipated mean
annual increment (MAI) of the plantations. Because soil conditions are
relatively poorly known in Burundi, initial estimates were difficult to
determine. During implementation, it appeared that the low soil
fertility on large parts of the plantations will result in yields
slightly lower than originally projected. However, through these
experiences a better knowledge of local soil conditions and growth rates
has been attained, which allows more accurate planning for future
forestry investments.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Dates of Effectiveness and Completion
4.1      The Project Development Credit Agreement (918 BU) was signed in
June 1979. The original completion date was September 1984. However,
due to the late arrival of the three technical assistants, and their
consequent inability to take advantage of the 1979/80 planting season,
the completion date was extended to June 1985. This extension gave the
Project five full planting seasons with which to work.
B. Main Components
Rural Nurseries
4.2      The Project's objective was to sell 60% of the seedlings to
individuals and 402 to communes. Survival rates are generally much
higher in individual woodlots (about 80% average survival) than in
communal plantations (about 20Z). However, during the first year, only
19% of the seedlings were sold to individuals. Also, the production
cost during the first year was far above the selling price of seedlings.
Fortunately, the Project was flexible enough to make changes in the
implementation methods suggested in the SAR. The Project Manager took
effective steps to decrease production cost, increase selling price, and
increase percentage of sales to individuals. The Project Manager's
strategy was as follows: (a) increase revenues by diversifying
production away from solely eucalyptus, to sell more pine, cypress,
multiple-use and fruit tree species; (b) decrease transport costs to the
consumer by creating a greater number of smaller nurseries; (c) decrease
production costs by shifting from purely potted stock to over half bare-
root stock in the nurseries; (d) increase the emphasis on the
information and extension programs in the rural areas; and (e) work with
the Government to have them sell rather than give away seedlings
produced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. These
modifications were successful, and resulted in higher survival and
higher cost recovery.
4.3      According to the SAR, the development of rural nurseries
capable of generating enough income to meet their production costs was
to be one of the Project's most important indicators of long-term
success. By the close of Phasa I, the Project nearly had the selling
price in line with the production cost. If these rural nurseries become
economically self-sufficient, private nurseries can be created and the
rural population's access to tree seedlings will be improved. 95% of
the Burundi population lives in rural areas and has little cash to pay
for its fuelwood, which traditionally was cut or collected by its
consumers without payment. Thus, the rural nursery program represented
an appropriate attempt to make the rural population self-sufficient in



-8-
fuelvood by making seedlings available at affordable prices. Since the
rural nurseries are small (producing 40,000 to 60,000 seedlings per
annum) and depend upon the surrounding population for their sales, they
respond quickly to changes in demand for particular species. Also, the
size and location of the nurseries enable the nurserymen to develop an
effective extension system to directly respond to the surrounding
population's concerns and strategies in meeting their energy and other
forest product needs.
4.4      Originally the Project expected to create one nursery for each
of 30 communes chosen from among the 79 communes in the country. Each
nursery was to produce 100,000 eucalyptus seedlings per annum (E.
grandis, E. tereticornis anc E. camaldulensis) and a few ornamantals.
During implementation, project management found that it would be more
appropriate to establish a denser network of smaller nurseries, so, with
the concurrence of IDA, it actually established 81 nurseries of 40,000
to 60,000 seedlings each. It is hoped that as these nurseries become
economically more self-sufficient, the program will continue to expand
until all of Burundi's population has access to seedlings.
4.5      As for the types of seedlings plantedt  although the Project
found the farmers quite willing to pay for seedlings, they wtere more
selective than anticipated. Consequently, instead of supplying only
eucalyptus seedlings, the Project supplied pine, cypress and multiple-
use species such as Grevillea, Acacia, Leucaena, Albizia and fruit
trees. These products sold at higher prices than the eucalyptus.

Eucalyptus Plantations
4.6       The SAR proposed a 2,000-ha short-rotation eucalyptus
plantation to supply the population of Bujumbura with firewood, charcoal
and construction poles. The principal species suggested was E. grandis,
and selected high quality seeds, unavailable in Burundi, were imported.
The principal technical aspects of the plantation development were
implemented as outlined in the SAR: manual ground preparation, seeding
in one or more nurseries, manual planting and weeding. Plantations are
scheduled to be coppiced at eight-yearly intervals with one seedling and
three coppice rotations.



-10-
4.7      The SAR-estimated growth was as follows:
Yr.                           Yield (m3/ha)         MAI (m3lha)
8 (seedling rotation)               120                  15
16 (coppice rotation 1)             120                  15
24 (coppice rotation 2)             96                   12
32 (coppice rotation 3)              80                  10
The total MAI was thus estimated at (120 + 120 + 96 + 80)/32 - 13 m3
/ha.
4.8      The Project created just over the targeted 2,000 ha of
eucalyptus plantations, with two slight modifications to the SAR. The
first modification was in the site.  The proposed site did not, in fact,
measure a full 2000 ha - there had been a cartographic error during
preparation. Also, the land in the proposed site turned out to be
rockier and poorer than originally supposed. Consequently, three
separate areas -- Mageyo (the original site, 30 km from Bujumbura),
Gakara (55 km from Bujumbura) and Ryarusera (near Bugarama) -- had to be
planted to achieve the planned total of 2000 ha. In choosing these
three sites, the Project held to its decision not to select presently
utilized farmlands so as to avoid land-use conflicts, although that
decision resulted in placing the plantations on slightly marginal lands.
4.9      The second modification was that planting was not restricted to
E. grandis, but included other eucalypts and a small area of pine. The
principal species was E. grandis which grows fastest and gives good
results at elevations between 1,400 to 2,200 m. E. tereticornis and E.
urophylla were planted at the lower and middle elevations, and Pinus
caribaea and P. kesiya were chosen for the poorest sites. The
eucalyptus plantation component also achieved its targets for indirect
afforestation activities: 57 km of new roads were opened and 208 km of
existing roads were maintained; 98 km of firebreaks were constructed; 4
permanent buildings, 2 lodgings, 1 home/office, 1 store room, 8
traditional lodgings and various diverse service buildings were
constructed (Key Indicator Chart, Annex 3).
4.10     The final results of the eucalyptus plantation will not, of
course, be available until the final cutting. It should be noted,
however, that the surface area target was met, the 95Z survival rate is
better than originally estimated, and that appropriate species for each
altitude and soil type have been identified. On the other hand, because
three separate sites had to be used, a more extensive road network had
to be built, along with the construction of more administrative
buildings than the SAR targeted. The production rates will probably be
slightly lower than expected because the soils are worse than originally
estimated.



-11-
4.11     Plantation maintenance:  the importance of initial weeding was
underestimated. While such weeding increases production cost, the
Project Manager felt that the optimum schedule would include two to
three weedings the first year and one to two the second year.
The increased growth rate of the trees due to weeding (reduced
competition for water, nutrients and sunlight) apparently compensated
for the additional cost of weeding. The high cost of fertilization, on
the other hand, appears justified only if the treatment is used as a
substitute for later weedings, permitting quicker cro.ni m-losure and
associated weed suppression.

The SAR estimated 200 ha (1OZ) to be fertilized and 1,600 scedlings/ha
to be planted.  Actually 495 ha (24Z) were fertilized and 1,375 to 1,500
seedlings/ha were planted.
Pine Plantation
4.12     The goal of a 5,000-ha pine plantation was not quite met:
4,034 ha were realized.  The species used, the manual ground preparation
and planting, and the housing and road construction were all implemented
more or less as planned. There were, however, three main issues which
arose during the implementation. First, there was a lack of laborers in
the area (Bururi) when the Project began. After the first two years,
however, enough laborers were attracted to the sites by increased wages
and by supplementary food rations supplied by the World Food Programme
jWFP). Second, the original site had less than the expected 5,000 ha of
productive land, due to steep slopes and poor soils. The result is that
about 251 of the plantation cannot be economically harvested and thus is
classified as a 'protective'. While the pines will indeed add
protection to the sites, the intention was to provide sawtimber. On
these steep hillsides a less-costly investment than pine plantations
would have been preferable, if possible using tree and shrub species
more valuable as fodder and soil protection, and less inflammable.
However, at present, the only species that bear up on the "protection
forestry" sites of Vyanda are Callitris and Pinus eliottii. No
multiple-use species suitable to these conditions are yet known. The
last issue, land use conflicts, ties in with the second issue. The
appropriation of the 5,000 ha of productive land was made difficult
because herders saw the plantation land as their own. The herders have
not vandalized any part of the plantation, but it is important that the
Project resolve this land use conflict. The project is attempting to
integrate grazing into some of the pine plantations. This is a good
solution which should reduce weeding costs, maximize economic return



-12-
from the plantation, *nd way encosrage good Project-herder relations.
Phase II of the Project will continue to work towards the development of an
economic and socially acceptable livestock-forestry program for the
plantations. If such a program can be developed, it will become much
easier to locate more land suitable for possible future pine plantation.
In the SAR, par&. 3.06, it was expected that ultimately about 25,000 ha of
pine would be planted in the Bururi region of southern Burundi. In
retrospect, this *sems most unlikely, considering the scarcity of land and
labor in this mainly cattle-raising region. Such a large area would in any
case not be needed to sustain a sawmill. Even the 751 of the 4,034 ha
which in the first phase were planted on harvestable sites can be expected
to eventually yield about 18,000 m3 of sawlogs p.a., which is enough to
foed quite a siseable sawmill.
4.13     The pine plantation component met Its indirect afforestation
targets by opening 89 km of forest roads, 290 km of firebreaks and
constructing six permanent :uildings, several lodging quarters, a
workshop, one store room, one office, 16 locally constructed lodging
quarters, four camps and three nursery offices (Key Indicator Chart,
Annex 4).

and higher than the expected 902.

Training Component
4.15     The SAR intended the project to train personnel at all levels.
Eighty middle level agriculture-forestry technicians ("agronomes
forestiers") were trained at ITAB between 1979 and 1984 with UNDP/FAO-paid
teachers, as part of the Project. The training program Was designed by a
UNDP specialist i-_ cooperation with Government officials, and was
supervised by the Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture. The
number of technicians thus trained corresponded to FAO's estimate of needs,
and to the Project target. Only one high-level forester was trained under
the Project (para. 4.17a below), but (a) there now exists a number of
middle-level foresters from whom suitable candidates can be selected for
further training, and (b) independently of the Project, the Institut
Superieur d'Agriculture (ISA) in 1983 began professional training in
Burundi of graduates in environmental management, including forestry.
4.16     The reason why only one high-level forester was trained under the
project, was that qualified school-leavers were not interested in taking up
the scholarships offered for studying forestry at the university level
abroad. In any case, the Project's original objectives were too ambitious:
it was unrealistic to expect that enough high-level foresters could be well
enough trained in only five years to take over the project. This is
especially apparent when one remembers that at the Project's inception
Burundi had only one trained forester.
4.17     The following are the results of the training component:
(a) Two scholarships for study outside Burundi:
1 scholarship of two years to Madagascar, professional level
1 scholarship of one year to Addis Ababa, technician level
4 other scholarships were available but lost due to lack
of candidates
(b) One training session to Kenya and Madagascar for three of the
Project's forestry agents.
(c) The Agricultural Technical Institute of Burundi (ITAB)
trained 80 agro-forestry technicians. The first two classes
received two years of forestry training (besides their
agricultural training), the later classes three.
(d) ITAB created a four-year professional resource management
program. In light of the shift towards agro-forestry and
livestock-forestry integration, this program is perhaps a
more appropriate schooling for Burundi's foresters because of
its integrated land-use techniques.



-14-
(e) Short-term sessions:
(i)  ITAB students trained under Project supervision
during school breaks.
(ii)  All levels of Project personnel received in-the-
field training for numerous aspects of Project
operations.
(iii)  Periodic training sessions for Project personnel of
similar duties to encourage dialogue and promote
the most efficient techniques.
(f) Short-term study tours. Project personnel toured forestry
projects in Tunisia, Rwanda, and China.
Studies and Trials
4.18     The SAR recognized the importance of three principal studies:
(a) to determine Burundi's Projected energy needs until the year 2000;
(b) to develop more economical and efficient cooking stoves especially
for the rural population; and (c) to determine a more efficient means to
produce charcoal modeled after a method now widely used in Kenya and
Uganda.
4.19     The first study consisted of two surveys in rural areas and one
survey in an urban area. From 1979 to 1983 little progress was made in
the study, and the subsequent work done by the Deputy Director of the
Government statistical office proved too difficult to interpret and
thereby of no use in the formulation of the 1985 forestry policy. Phase
II should either reconduct the study through the Government Statistical
Office or hire an outside consultant team to produce an accurate, useful
estimate of Burundi's energy needs.
4.20     The rural stove trials were entrusted to International
Association for Rural Development (AIDR). After manufacturing 1,000
wood-burning clay stoves all of which cracked, AIDR abandoned the study,
concluding that the Burundi clay is unsuitable, regardless of the type
of kiln used. Another IDA Project, Urban Development of Buiumbura (DUB)
is developing a fuel saving charcoal stove for upper income arban
groups, and USAID is developing a peat-burning stove, mainly for
institutions like schools, hospitals etc. As the Project's stove
component for the rural population went poorly, it was not continued in
the second phase. The Ministry of Energy was deemed a more suitable
agency to carry out this type of work than the Ministry of Agriculture.
However, the Project should offer its resources to NGOs and/or other
groups and aid them in the dissemination of appropriate wood-burning
stoves for rural areas. The Project already has a significant
infrastructure established in several rural areas into which other stove
projects could feed to facilitate the dissemination of new stove
technology in the countryside. Such programs might evolve around the
Project's rural nursery progrsm, for example. (In Niger a rural stove
Project successfully disseminated the new technology by "paying" rural
stove builders with seedlings instead of cash.)



-15-
4.21     Charcoal-making trials using imported steel to manufacture an
improved metal kiln were carried out in 1984 by an FAO consultant. The
trials were very successful and the consultant trained a few charcoal-
makers in this and other techniques. The most popular method, the
"casa-ance" method, requires little capital investment, is very similar
to traditional techniques, and increases charcoal yields by 202.
4.22     The Project also funded a feasibility study for the Kayongozi
protection afforestation project. Because it would have a negative
financial rate of return, it was at the time deemed unsuitable for Bank
financing, but the economic return was not estimated.
Proiect Management Support
4.23     When the project began, it shared one office with another
project, and the Forestry Department in general was housed in very
cramped quarters. During Phase I the project financed the construction
of buildings for Project headquarters at Bujumbvra, which are today part
of a functional new Forest Department headquarters, as foreseen in para.
3.07 of the SAR.
C. Theft
4.24     Two cases involving money losses occurred.  Firstly,
approximately US$20,000 was stolen in a hold-up of a Project vehicle
carrying monthly salaries. Reasonable prudence in delivering the money
had been observed. Secondly, paysheet irregularities occurred over a
two-month period on one of the plantations. This resulted in the prompt
d&smissal of three staff members.
D. Revolving Fund
4.25     Under Section 3.01 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement (918
BU), the Government was to provide a revolving fund with a value of
US$200,000. This was done. The Government, however, failed to
replenish the fund every three months as agreed, occasioning late
payment of salaries or delays in purchase of local materials. During
implementation, the Project created a foreign currency revolving fund or
special account, using the US$200,000 previously unallocated under
Category 5 of the IDA Credit 918 BU (para. 5.25). IDA replenished this
fund regularly and thereby maintained a liquid cash reserve for the IDA
reimbursenent of local purchases and salaries.



-16-
V. OPERATING (BANK. FINANCIAL. INSTITUTIONAL) PEWFORMANCE
A. SuHprvision
5.01     The Bank's performance in the supervision of the Project was
satisfactory. Missions to Burundi vwre conducted approximately every
six month. thereby lsimting the effect of any problms. The working
relationship between the Bank and the Borrower was good. The Bank's
flexibility in allowing the Project Manager to modify the rural nursery
component was a significant factor in that component's success. The
accounting and auditing procedures were effective. The Project was
relatively simple in design, and strong support by the Government and
the Forest Department resulted in a relatively problem-free and
successful Project.
B. Compliance with Credit Terms
5.02     The Borrower satisfactorily complied with the terms of the
Development Credit Agreement. The creation and maintenance by IDA of a
second rovolving fund (under section 3.01 (b) of the Development Credit
Agreement 918 BU) worked out well for the implementation period of the
Project. During Phase II, the Project should work to ensure that the
Borrower will be able to maintain a liquid cash roserve sufficient to
cover daily operating expenses once IDA funding support ends.
C. Costs and Procurement
5.03     The Forest Department within the Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock and Rural Development was the executing agency. It obtained
and accounted for funds and materials without major issue. During pre-
Project negotiations, it was agreed to allocate EEC funding specifically
towards civil works expenses in order to allow tho Project to purchase
vehicles and materials from non-EEC countries. This modification saved
the Government money and time in procurement, delivery and maintenance
of vehicles and materials.
5.04     The actual costs of the Project equalled the estimated costs
and totalled US$8.83 million. The costs were shared as follows:

-18-
D. Expatriates
5.06     The expatriate experts from CTFT were largely responsible for
the success of the Project due to their aboility to maintain good
dialogue between the Government, Project staff and IDA. The use of the
four French "volontaires du progres was highly effective, and the FAO
consultant hired for the charcoal-making study worked well.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01     The actual costs of the eucalyptus and pine plantation
components - the only ones to be subjected to economic analysis in the
SAR - were somewhat higher that anticipated, due to dispersed planting
sites in the case of the eucalypts and higher than expected labor costs
in the case of the pines. Also, the average increment is somewhat lower,
due to poorer than expected land in the case of the eucalypt plantations
and steeper than expected land (non-harvestable) in the case of the pine
plantations. The overall rate of return of these two components is
therefore somewhat lower than estimated in the SAR.
6.02     The rates of return estimated in the SAR and in the present PCR
are as follows (details are set out in Annex 6 below, and especially in
the Table Notes which follow it):
Eucalyptus          Pine         Total
plantations     plantations
SAR                    17%             22%            20%
PCR                    11%              17%           15%
Although the above re-evaluated economic rates of return, varying from
11 to 17 percent, are merely estimates - only 7 years have elapsed of
the 37-year period of analysis, and harvesting in the project
plantations has not yet begun - the indications so far are that the
project will be worth while from the economic point of view.
6.03     As regards the project's effect on income distribution, it can
be expected that most of the benefits will go the lower income groups,
because: (a) unskilled rural labor for plantation establishment was a
major cost item; (b) fuelwood, charcoal, and building poles, which are
all related to basic needs, will be some of the major project outputs.
This is even more the so in the case of the rural treeplanting
component, the rate of return of which was not calculated in the SAR or
here.
VII. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
7.01     The Project had several beneficial environmental impacts.  The
trees planted within the framework of the pine plantation and the rural
nursery component improved protection against wind and water erosion of



-19-
the soil. The poles and timber produced from the plantations will soon
be available which will decrease the need of cutting the increasingly
rare local species. Also, the increased fuelwood supply will decrease
household use of agricultural residue for fuel, thereby improving soil
fertility and increasing crop yields.
7.02     On the other hand, the new roads established by the Project
will result in increased soil erosion, especially on the steeper slopes,
if they are not properly maintained. And there is also a risk that the
eucalyptus plantations impede herb growth as has happened in several
other countries. The thin canopy cover naturally formed by eucalypts,
combined with the scant herbaceous soil cover, can actually result in
increased soil erosion.
VIII. ISSUES AND RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP
8.01     Overall, the Project represented an important first step in
developing a long-term program in Burundi to create basic forestry
services and begin more rational forest management. The Project began
Phase II in 1985, and it is vital that the implications of each
component of Phase I are recognized.
A. Rural Nurseries
8.02     The selling price of the seedlings is approaching the
production cost. The implications of Phase I for Phase II are the
following:
(a) Coatinue work to decrease seedling production costs by
decreasing thefts and gifts of seedlings, through closer
monitoring of sales. Methods to give more responsibility
and increased incentives for nurserymen to run profitable
nurseries should be investigated.
(b) Increase income to the nurseries by growing higher
percentages of the more valuable multiple-use and fruit
tree species.
(c) Continue monitoring of consumer demands and expand
extension services further into rural areas.
(d) Assimilate new discoveries of appropriate agro-forestry
and livestock-forestry techniques into the extension
programs to encourage economically, socially and
ecologically sound multiple-use strategies.



-20-
B. Eucalyptus and Pine Plantations
8.03     The implications of Phase I for Phase II are the following:
(a) Increase the development of a livestock-forestry program
for the plantations. If successful, this will allow
plantations to be created on better sites without co-.flict
between the Project and traditional user groups (herders).
(b) Don't reforest lands where reforestation is uneconomic.
On those lands which are so steep that they obviously will
be uneconomical to harvest, no known fodder species or
soil/site protective shrub/herb species will survive.
(c)  For the pine plantation, determine ard establish the
minimum number of harvestable hectares necessary to
support a sawmill.
(d) Monitor the MAI of the plantations, and on the basis of
the new figures re-estimate from time to time the rate of
return, to assess the justification for additional
plantations.
C. TraininR
8.04     The Project was successful in training Burundi's first middle
level foresters, but not in the training of high level foresters.
Phase I has the following implication for Phase IIt
(a) Increase the emphasis on training high level foresters and
incorporate into their training short and long-term visits
to neighboring countries' forestry Projects. Also,
incorporate management, administrative and specialized
business training into the program for higher level
foresters. Ensure that every expatriate in Phase II has a
suitably qualified Burundian counterpart who participates
fully in project work.
D. Studies
8.05     The Project did not achieve its objectives with regards to the
study program except in the charcoal techniques study. The implications
for Phase II are the following:
(a) Incorporate the new charcoal-making techniques into the
eucalyptus plantation harvests.
(b) Continue to disseminate information on the use of the new
charcoal-making techniques.
(c) Help NGOs and other organizations disseminate and monitor
their newly developed cooking stoves. Encourage these
organizations to work towards developing a more efficient,
low-cost and easily fabricated rural wood burning stove.



-21-
(d) Reconduct the study to determine Burundi's future energy
needs using either the Government Statistical Office or an
outside consulting agency.
IX.  BURUNDI FORESTRY PROJECT PHASE II
9.01     The Burundi Forestry Project Phase II continues much of the
work of Phase I. The goals and implementation methods for Phase II
reflect the lessons learnt from Phase I. The purpose of Phase II is to:
(a) speed up reforestation attempts on individual farms while reducing
the development of new large-scale plantations (because of the land
availability problems experienced during Phase I); (b) continue
development of viable agro-forestry and sylvo-forestry techniques; (c)
strengthen the Forestry Department's capacity to manage investment
programs and staff training, and to train charcoal-makers in the more
efficient techniques developed during Phase I; and (d' continue
development of long-term pricing strategies for forest products.
9.02     Phase II will attempt to accomplish the above goals over five
years (1986-90) through the following components:
(a)  Development of 90 Government-run nurseries (an average of
more than one per commune)  .icluding maintenance of 60
existing nurseries and establislhment of about 30 new ones,
each producing 40,000 to 50,000 seedlings (3 to 4 million
altogether) per year; development of forestry extension
scrvices and a pilot agro-forestry scheme; and
establishment of up to 2,000 ha of demonstration fuelwood,
pole, fodder and fruit plots in communes throughout the
country (up to 5 ha per year close to each rural nursery).
(b)  Establishment by the Government of:
(i) 3,500 ha of eucalyptus fuelwood plantations; and
(ii) 1,500 ha of pine sawlog plantations.
(c)  The protection, maintenance and exploitation of existing
plantations established under Phase I.
(d)  The initiation of a program to promote integrated sylvo-
pastoral activities in a few selected plantation areas
with high population densities.
(e)  Institutional strengthening of the Forest Department
through the creation of a planning and mon.itoring unit and
two new regional forest inspectorates including support
for additional staff, buildings, equipment and running
costs and expatriete technical assistance and
strengthening of the Project management unit.

(f) An agro-forestry training program including foreign
scholarships for foresters at university level and local
training, and studies, trials and training consultancies
in agro-forestry, charcoal making, forest exploitation and
wood utilization.

ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATIONs TABLE NOTES
(1) Table 5 of the SAR also contained somewhat lower alternative benefit
streams for eucalyptus and pine, based on other assumptions for estimating
the economic value of wood, and those streams resulted in ERRs of
respectively 122 and 11Z. For the whole-plantation model, however, only one
ERR was calculated, and it came to 202. Therefore, for the eucalyptus and
pine, only the benefit streams corresponding to the one used in the
analysis of the whole-plantation model was used, so as to ensure internal
consistency.
(2) The costs of the eucalyptus and pine components of the SAR whole-
plantation model were obtained by multiplying the costs in the per-ha
models with the relevant areas. For example, the SAR target plantation
rate for eucalyptus was 100, 300 and 400 hectares in respectively years 1,
2 and 3. As the costs per ha in those years were estimated at 38.5, 7.8 and
5.2 units, the cost of the eucalyptus component in the whole-plantation
model in year 3 was estimated at: (400 x 38.5) + (300 x 7.8) + (100 x 5.2)
= 18.3 units; because in the third year of the project there are 400 ha to
be planted, 300 ha which were planted in the second year and are therefore
due for weeding, and finally 100 ha which were planted in the first year of
the project and which are therefore also due for weeding, though lighter
than in the case of the stands which are two years old.
(3) The expected and the actual costs of the eucalypt and pine components,
total and per ha, were as follows:
Tot. cost, FBu mill.    Ha planted    Cost/ha. FBu '000
Euc.      Pine         Euc.   Pine       Euc.    Pine
SAR, Table 1         116.3     250.3        2000   5000       58.1    50.1
Actual               173.2     275.0        2041   4034       84.9    68.2
The SAR figures include physical and price contingencies, to make them
comparable with the actual costs over the project period. The figures in
the last two columns of the table above indicate that the actual costs per
ha were 84.9/58.1 = 1.46 times higher in the case of eucalypts, and
68.2/50.1 = 1.36 times higher in the case of pines. In the case of the
eucalypts this can be ascribed mainly to the fact that the planting had to
be spread over three areas instead of one as originally planned, and that
this increased the costs of management, nurseries and protection. In the
case of the pines, the fact that actual costs were higher than anticipated
can be ascribed mainly to the labor scarcity in the pine plantation area,
necessitating incentives in the form of higher than normal pay, and in the
form of labor quarters which had not origninally been planned for.
The cost figures for the PCR economic analysis of the per-ha
models were obtained by multiplying the ones used in Table 5 of the SAR by
the above multipliers of 1.46 and 1.36.

These multipliers were also applied to the costs after the five-
year project implementation period, on the perhaps pessimistic assumption
that the reasons which caused the actual costs to be higher than the
estimated costs in the first place, will influence costs to the same degree
during the post-implementation period.
(4) The eucalyptus benefits per ha in Table 5 of the SAR were multiplied by
0.8 for the purpos. s of the PCR analysis, because the sites planted to
eucalypts have on the average been less productive than estimated in the
SAR, and because the longer than estimated transport distances to the main
market in Bujumbura will result in somewhat lower wood values than
originally estimated.
The pine benefits per ha in Table 5 of the SAR were multiplied by
0.75 to reflect the fact that only 75Z of the area planted to pine is
expected to be harvestable.
(5) The costs in the PCR whole-plantation model were calculated by
multiplying the per-ha costs by the actual areas planted, in the same way
as explained in Note 2 above. These areas were, as indicated in Tables 4
and 5 of the PCR:
Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Total
Eucalypts, ha      200     320     643      556     322      2041
Pines, ha         220      820     980    1016      998      4034
(6) The total cost of the study of fuelvood consumption, and the study of
and training in charcoal-making, was estimated at FBu 45.6 million over the
project period, i.e. at an average of FBu 9.1 mill. annually.
(7) The eucalypt and pine benefits in the whole-plantation model were
calculated in the same way in the PCR analysis as in the SAR analysis.
E.g., the total pine benefits in year 20 were estimated at the value of the
thinning at 16 years (FBu 246.0 thousand) times the 16-year old area in
that year (998 ha), plus the value of the thinning at 19 years (FBu 276.8
th.) times the 19-year old area (820 ha).

Dear Mr. Donaldson,
Thank you for your letter of 6 March 1989 inviting
my comments on the completion report for the First
Forestry Project in Burundi.
I welcome your confidence, but must advise with
regret that it is quite beyond my present capacity to be
able to undertake a responsible indepth review of this
report and to convey my comments to you by 13 April 1989.
I have a serious backlog of work in my own office and two
further missions to undertake by that date.   I would
simply add for your information that I have read the
summary and skimmed the report and find it to be a well-
balanced analysis. The shift of emphasis toward social
forestry is understandable and a forewarning of what I
think aid agencies are going to increasingly experience
in other countries.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely,
/ Chuck J. Lankester
