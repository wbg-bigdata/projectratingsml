NEMORANDWH AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENt ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BOLIVIA
FOR A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
Bolivia for SDR 12.5 million (US$16.1 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, including 40
years maturity and 10 years grace.
2.      Background.  The Government has dominated the Bolivian economy during
the last three decades, both as a regulator of activities and as a producer of
goods and services. During this period, the State accounted for over two-
thirds of total investment. The limited private investment which took place
was geared to distorted incentives, resulting from a complex protectionary
system of tariffs, import quotas, and subsidized credit provided by the State-
dominated banking system. The years of palitical instability and economic
mismanagement resulted in a small, cautious, dichotomized private sector,
consisting of a highly concentrated formal sector (chiefly La the financial,
mining, and energy sectors) and a large number of very small or informal
activities in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.
3.      In the context of the stabilization program launched in 1985 and the
reactivation measures taken in 1987, the Government introduced a number of
reforms to enhance performance of the private sector. These reforms are
oriented towards stabilizing the economy, reintroducing a free market policy
framework, and eliminating constraints which impede resumption of economic~
growth and restoration of a more favorable business environment to reactivate
the private sector. The reforms include: (i) unification of the exchange
rate and institution of an auction for U.S. dollars; (ii) removal of quantita-
tive restrictions on trade and reduction of tariffs tc 5Z for capital goods
and to 20? for other goods; (iii) institution of an expor; rebate system for
nontraditional exports in November 1988, reimbursement to exporters for value
added tax payments, and streamlining of export procedures; (iv) elimination of
almost all price controls; (v) submission to Congress of a new investment law
establishing clear "rules of the game" for foreign investors, as well as of a
new decree expanding opportunities for joint ventures with foreign partners;
(vi) a major tax reform in 1986, streamlining the former regime of over 400
different taxes; and (vii) measures to reform the financial sector, including
liberalization of all interest rates, except those for development credit, and
removal of restrictions on financial transactions.
4.      In the manufacturing sector, which is composed essentially of small
enterprises, the production response to the 1985 stabilization and the Govern-
ment's reactivation program has been slow. This is largely attributable to a
number of structural phenomena which constrain the recovery and expansion of
private industrial activities. These include infrastructure deficiencies; a
weak financial system, characterized by high real interest rates; inadequate
technical and managerial training; cumbersome procedures in connection with
the establishment of new companies and exporters; and a lack of confidence in
the stability of the economic and political environment, after a long history
of frequent shocks. Most of these constraints have had a particularly severe
effect on the small enterprises which overwhelmingly compose the private
industrial sector.

5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  IDA assistance in recent years has
focussed primarily on supporting the Government's economic reform efforts,
through two Reconstruction Import Credits, a Financial Sector Adjustment
Credtt, and technical assistance operations designed to strengthen public
institutions critical to macroeconomic management. A second central focus has
been on ameliorating the negative impact of adjustment on the poorest groups
in Bolivia; in this regard, two Emergency Social Fund credits (1829-BO and
1882-BO) ha e been approved.
6.      More recently, IDA assistance has focussed on supporting the supply
response to economic adjustment. In this context, an Export Corridors proj-
ect, directed at improving road transportation along key export routes, was
approved last year, as well as a Mining Rehabilitation Project, directed at
rationalizing the operations of the Corporacion Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL)
and supporting diversification and private sector development in the mining
sector. Currently, projects directed at supporting natural resource manage-
ment and agriculture, as well as a project to strengthen health services and
infrastructure, are under preparation. To sustain and deepen reforms launched
in the financial sector, a second financial adjustment loan is also in the
planning stages.
7.      The proposed credit would buttress the industrial private sector's
adaptation to a new macroeconomic environment, consistent with efforts already
under way in the mining and agricultural sectors. In addition, it would sup-
port the social objectives of IDA's assistance strategy, by attempting to
increase access to the credit system for groups presently excluded. Finally,
it would support continued efforts to carry out adjustment in the financial
sector, pending preparation of a second financial sector adjustment credit.
8.      Proiect Obiectives and Description.  The proposed project would
address constraints to the development of private manufacturing described
above by: promoting a broader client base for the banking system; providing
training and technical assistance targetted to groups presently excluded from
the formal financial system; supporting the simplification of the bureaucratic
regime governing establishment and operation of industrial and export-oriented
companies; strengthening key institutions in the sector; and undertaking steps
towards full liberalization of interest rate policy, in the context of IDA's
overall strategy in Bolivia's financial sector. Its major elements include:
(i) increasing private industry's contribution to production, value added,
employment creation, and exports, by facilitating access to longer-term work-
ing capital and investment credit from the banking system; (ii) providing
technical/managerial assistance to private firms, and in particular small
firms, in order to improve their productivity and commercial possibilities;
(iii) improving the quality of services provided by public and private sector
institutions dealing with industrial sector enterprises; and (iv) simplifying
the regulatory framework affecting the establishment of new businesses.
9.      Major components would include:  (i) a credit component of US$14 mil-
lion to finance the needs of private manufacturing and tourism firms in fixed
assets, working capital, and subproject-related technical assistance expend-
itures; and (ii) a technical assistance (TA) component of about US$2.0 million
to finance activities in support of the manufacturing sector, with a special
focus on small and micro enterprises and on women.   Under this component, a
Technical Assistance Fund would be established, which would channel resources



- 3 -
on a grant basis to private and public agencies providing developmental, pro-
motional, or training services to the industrial sector. In addition, direct.
technical assistance would be channelled to the Central Bank to strengthen the
Development Credit Department and support project management. The TA compo-
nent would also provide for the strengthening of participating private and
public institutions and studies or actions in support of private sector
development.
10.     To ensure achieving the project's objectives and to avoid an exces-
sive concentration of credit and other project benefits, the maximum loan or
series of loans to any subborrower would be US$120,000. Funds allocated for
credit would be onlent by the Central Bank to approved financial institutions
(ICIs) at the prevailing London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR). The ICIs in
turn would onlend to eligible enterprises at a rate equal to the higher of:
(i) a rate no more than 7.5 points below the prevailing market-determined on-
lending rate for U.S. dollar or U.S. dollar-linked loans; or (ii) the average
term deposit rate for U.S. dollar or U.S. dollar-linked deposits. The subbor-
rower would bear the foreign exchange risk, and the Central Bank would bear
the cross-currency risk. The interest rate would be periodically revised,
consistent with the action plan described below in para. 12, which would
achieve full liberalization of all interest rates by March 31, 1993.
11.     A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bolivia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map has been included, and the Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8445-BO, dated April 26, 1990 is attached.
12.     Agreed Actions.  During the course of project preparation, the Gov-
ernment prepared the framework program of the Technical Assistance Fund, as
well as draft statements of policies and procedures for operation of the
Technical Assistance Fund and the proposed credit line. As conditions of loan
effectiveness, execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and the Central Bank for the transfer of the credit line component proceeds;
execution of a technical assistance grant agreement between the Government and
the Central Bank for the transfer of the technical assistance component
proceeds; adoption of the agreed Policies and Procedures for the credit
component; establishment of the TAP and adoption of its agreed Policies and
Procedures and first year operating plan; and execution of three agreeme: :s
between the Central Bank and participating ICIs would be required. In addi-
tion, the BCB would take measures to ensure that the development credit
onlending rate to final borrowers is as set out above in para. 10. Finally,
the Government would prepare, before loan effectiveness, a financial sector
strategy and action plan satisfactory to the Bank, with the objectives of
liberalizing development credit interest rates completely during the next
three years and defining the future operation of the development credit
function. The action plan would have as objectives, inter alia, the full
liberalization of development credit interest rates by March 31, 1993, and, as
an interim step, a reduction in the spread between development credjt onlend-
ing rates to the final borrower and the average market-determined U.S. dollar
or U.S. dollar-linked onlending rate to 4 percentage points or less by
September 30, 1991. Onlending rates under this credit would be revised as
needed, to comply with the action plan mentioned above.



13.     The proposed project would also provide for joint reviews of interest
rate policy in October each year and in April 1993. In the event that 502 of
the credit line is committed before October 1991, an additional review would
be held as soon as possible after the 502 level is reached. The purpose of
these reviews would be to assess the Government's progress with respect to the
interest rate policy goals set out in the action plan. In the event IDA finds
such performance unsatisfactory, it would have the option of stopping approval
of additional subloans. A proposal for establishing a guarantee fund (or
alternative arrangements to increase guarantees available to the private sec-
tor) would be required by May 31, 1991. The technical assistance program
would be reviewed and revised as needed annually and submitted to IDA for
approval by September 1 each year. Inclusion of a technical assistance activ-
ity in the approved program would be a condition for disbursement of each
technical assistance grant. To provide flexibility in the operation of the
public enterprise development program, up to one-third of the resources allo-
cated to either the credit line or to the technical assistance fund could be
reallocated to the other component.
14.     Benefits.  The proposed project, in addition to assisting in the
recovery of the economy in Bolivia and by complementing other Government/IDA
operations in increasing production, value added, and employment creation in
the private manufacturing sector, is expected to pr ide financing for some
800 subprojects for modernization, creation, or expansion of private sector
firms. It is expected to generate or help to maintain about 8,000 jobs, at a
cost of about US$2,500 per job (in line with statistical evidence in smi.ll- to
medium-size manufacturing firms in Bolivia). The expected employment impact,
as well as the increase in productivity and competitiveness in manufacturing
enterprises, would make a significant contribution to poverty alleviation ir.
Bolivia. The TA component is expected to reach up to 1,500 beneficiaries and
encourage and support the emergence of new entrepreneurs, chus facilitr ing
expansion of Bolivia's private sector. Finally, the project provides *r full
rationalization of interest rate policy in less than three years.
15.     Risks.  The main implementation risk associated with the project lies
in the ability and interest of participating commercial banks to expar-d lend-
ing to newer and sometimes smaller clients. To mitigate that risk, tLey would
receive training under the project's TA component. Establishment of a Gaaran-
tee Fund is also expected to help overcome the reluctance of financial inter-
mediaries to participate in the smaller projects. It is expected that the
project will require a higher frequency of supervision missions during the
initial stages of implementation.
16.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with IDA's Articles of Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
