ENERGY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:         Ethiopia
Amount:           SOR 53.7 million (US$62.0 million equivalent)
Beneficiaries:    The  Ethiopian  Electric  Light  and  Power  Authority
(EELPA), the Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation (EPC); the
Ministries of Agriculture, State Farms, Tea and Coffee
Development, Mines and Energy, and Industry.
Terms:            Standard 1/
Project           The  proposed  project  would  help  the  Government  to
Objectives:       establish a least-cost expansion program for the power
subsector and implement its highest priority projects.
It would assist the power subsector to attain greater
efficiency through the improvement of its organization
and management, the strengthening of its planning and
de.Mgn capability and operational practices, and the
improvement of its financial  performance.   It would
assist the Government to develop and implement integrated
least-cost plans to expand the supply of household energy
products and correct imbalances In their prices.
Final ly,  it would  aim  to  stimulate,  to  the extent
possible, an increased, more diversified, and coordinated
aid flow from other donors towards the power and the
household fuels subsectors.
Project
Description:      The project would comprise for the power subsector:  the
implementation of the highest priority projects included
in EELPA's investment program for the period 1987-1991, a
comprehensive manpower and organizational improvement
program for EELPA, and the studies urgently needed to
support sound future expansion and operation of the
Ethiopian power subsector, including the feasibility of a
possible interconnection with Sudan.
For the energy sector it would comprise:   commercial
scale production and end-use trials of novel agricultural
residue fuel briquettes and modern industrial scale
charcoal production systems; cooking efficiency studies
and  technology  dissemination;  strengthening  energy
1/ Onlending terms are 9% interest rate, repayment periods of 5 to 20
years after grace period of 2 to 5 years.

planning centrally and in each sub-sector with emphasis
on woody biomass strategic planning; and studies and
preinvestuent work on petroleum supply, industrial energy
efficiency,  and  biomass  fuel  supply  and  marketing
arF mgements.
Project Risks:   Power  sub-sector  components  would  face  normal  risks
associated with transmission and distribution works.
However, EELPA has a good safety record, and experience
suggests that design and construction delays would be
unlikely.   Some household energy components would be
applying technologies previously untested on this scale.
Benefits arising from fuel briquette components may be
reduced by unfavorable seasonal factors and delayed
equipment causing a harvest to be missed. New household
fuel  techniques  may  take  longer  to  acquire  than
expected. Such risks would be acceptable in view of the
pilot nature of the household energy components, and the
high  benefits  to  be  expected  from  the  successful
development of new cooking fuels from waste.

This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission, which visited
Ethiopia in November 1984, consisting of M. Aguilar (Mission Leader),
A. Alberti (Senior Training Specialist), E. Bundi (Financial Analyst),
K. Newcombe (Energy Specialist) and G. Schraum (Senior Economist).   The
project was further discussed during a post-appraisal mission in April
1985.  The technical, financial and economic chapters of the report were
updated in April 1986 prior to negotiations to reflect recent changes.

I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Country/Sector Background
1.01       Ethiopia, with its 1.22 million square kilometers, is the, eighth
largest country in Africa. In 1982, its population was estimated at about
32 million, but the recent census places the 1984 population at about 42
million. In spite of a number of favorable features, Ethiopia remains one
of the poorest countries on earth. The per capita GNP was estimated to be
US$140 in 1982. The Ethiopian economy is predominantly agricultural, with
some 841 of its population living in rural areas. About three quarters of
the population lives more than a half day's walk from all-weather roads.
1.02      Final energy consumption in 1982 totalled about 9.8 million toe,
or 0.247 toe per capita, of which about 9.2 million toe, or 94Z, were
biomass fuels used almost entirely for household cooking. 1/ Total energy
consumption is forecast to attain some 13.3 milllon toe by 1992 (0.254 toe
per capita) of which about 12.1 million toe, or 91X, would be household
energy (Annex 1.2).
1.03        Ethiopia's major energy resources are hydropower, which it is
believed could be economically developed to between 15 and 30 GW; natural
gas, in amounts important for the size of Ethiopia's modern sector
requirements, geothermal energy, for which recent drilling has indicated
large   reserves   of   high-enthalpy   steam;   and,   despite   intensive
deforestation, forest and other woody biomass resources in economically
significant quantities.
1.04          The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MHE) is responsible for
designing and implementing energy policies and shares with the National
Committee for Central Planning (NCCP) the task of ensuring the consistency
in planning and investment programming for the various energy related
agencies.   The MME carries out its energy planning functions with the
assistance of the Ethiopian National Energy Committee (ENEC), an advisory
body consisting of the heads of Ethiopian Electric Light and Power
Authority (EELPA), Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation (EPC), and other
government departments and agencies. An organizational chart showing the
main interrelations within the energy sector is attached as Annex 1.1.
1.05      The Forestry and Wildlife Conservation and Development Authority
(FAWCDA), an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, had until recently
principal responsibility for management of existing forests, including
reforestation, although it shared responsibility for forestry protection
with the Soil and Water Conservation Department (SWCD) in the same
ministry.   The Wood and  Charcoal Production, Processing and Marketing
Enterprise (WCPPDE) was formed in 1981 as an agency of FAWCDA, with
responsibility for firewood and charcoal production and marketing.
However, to date WCPPDE has been unable to capture from private enterprises
more than a small percentage of the total woodfuels trade, and the great
majority of its outlets are concentrated in Addis Ababa.  The Government
has recently reorganized the administration of forestry. It has dissolved
FAWCDA and assigned most of its functions to a new Natural Resources branch
I/  Ethiopia:   Issues and Options in the Energy Sector (July 1984) and
revised population data.

within the Ministry of Agriculture.   Other functions relevant to enurgy
resources and development, such as the administration of State Forests--
which produce large volumes of high quality forest residues--are being
regionalized into eight regions.  In addition, the Ministries of Agricul-
ture, State Farms, and Coffee and Tea Development are responsible for cash
crops which produce large volumes of residues with energy potential.   For
the purpose of project implementation, understandings have been reached
with the Government that it would establish a Project Management Unit (PMU)
within the KME (para. 3.22).
1.06        In practice, energy related parastatals plan their budgets and
long-term investment programs without significant consultarion with ENEC.
They raise their respective subsector concerns directly with the NCCP. The
latter, however, is not adequately equipped to undertake an advisory
function for the energy sector either with respect to broad sectoral issues
or to specific subsectoral matters.  As a result there is a lack of sound
and integrated technical, economic and financial planning as a basis for
setting investment priorities.
1.07      In the course of its continuing dialogue with the Government, IDA
has proposed the creation of a high-level independent Energy Secretariat
which would be responsible for establishing the necessary consistency
between government objectives in the energy sector and subsector planning,
investment programming and overall resource allocation. The Government is
at present considering various options, but it has been slow in delineating
the role and functions as well as the level of the Energy Secretariat.
Because the lack of qualified experienced staff is an important constraint
to achieving meaningful changes in this respect, IDA would provide under
the proposed credit financing for training, energy studies and energy
planning (para. 5.07 f, k, 1).
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.08      The Bank Group has lent for three energy operations in Ethiopia,
two for power and one for petroleum exploration promotion.  Loan 375-ET to
EELPA in 1964 helped finance the Awash II and III hydroelectric plants and
associated transmission and distribution, and Loan 596-ET in 1969, also to
EELPA, helped finance the Finchaa Hydroelectric Project. Credit 1386-ET in
1983 is assisting the Government to promote the exploration of petroleum
pocential, to acquire and improve seismic data, to study potential uses of
natural gas, and to study the commercial potential of geothermal energy.
The Awash II and III hydroelectric plants and associated facilities were
satisfactorily completed though with a delay of about two years due to
construction difficulties.   The Project Performance Audit Report for Loan
596-ET (Report No. 1102 dated March 23, 1976), concludes that the project,
which was completed with minor delays in 1973, remained economically
justified and that international competitive bidding permitted the purchase
of major project items at prices considerably lower than those quoted under
originally proposed tied-financing arrangements.
1.09      Under the joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program, and at
the request of the Government of Ethiopia, the Bank conducted in 1983 an
energy assessment for Ethiopia. The report entitled "Ethiopia: Issues and
Options in the Energy Sector" (Report No. 4741-ET), published in July 1984
after detailed review by the Government, concludes that the sector issues



- 3 -
which require urgent action are: (i) the increasing scarcity and high cost
of household cooking fuels au a result of inadequate and inefficient



- 4 -
promising for hydropower development.   The potential of these basins
combined has been estimated at betweeu 11 and 13 GW.
Petroleum
1.12         There appears to be a reasonable prospect of establishing
commercial oil and gas reserves in Ethiopia.  In 1975, drilling by TENNECO
confirmed the existence of gas in the Ogaden desert (proven reserves
1L.3 TCF). However, the gas field was abandoned because of the poor gas
export market at that time. MOBIL also found indications of gas in the
Red Sea. Oil shows, though not involving significant flows, have consis-
tently appeared in other drilling in the Ogaden region. As part of the IDA
financed Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1386-ET), studies
were completed during 1984 which define the petroleum reserve potential,
propose additional seismic work in the Red Sea, define the gas market and
propose a gas development strategy.  The USSR is financing and drilling
four exploratory wells in their 10,000 km2 concession area in the Ogaden.
The two wells drilled to date have been dry, resulting only in small oil
shows.  Exploitation of the Ogaden gas resource for power generation would
not be economically feasible in the short term, given the large hydropower
excess capacity expected between 1987 and 1995. HE-wever, other potentially
economic gas development optiions are currently under review. These are the
production of fertilizers, and gas utilization as industrial, commercial,
residential and transport fuel, including the construction of pipelines to
the Addis Ababa and/or Dire Dawa regions, or through wellhead development
alternatives.
Geothermnal Resources
1.13        Recent drilling in the Rift Valley south of Addis Ababa has
tapped good quality steam. However, the economic potential of geothermal
power is uncertain in the light of near term surpluses of electric power
and the prospect of cheaper large-scale hydropower and perhaps natural
gas. Further exploration is being proposed and appears justified in the
north of the Rift Valley within transmission distance of both northern
urban centres and possible potash mining where other power supply options
may prove more expensive.
Forest and Biomass Resources
1.14      About 2.7Z of Ethiopia's land is covered by high forest and 16Z
by Acacia savannah. An important part of this forest resource is being
rapidly  depleted  through  uncontrolled  and  inefficient  exploitation,
involving constant thinning and clear felling both for agrlcultural
development and woodfuel production. Total forest clearing each year is
estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000 ha. Unauthorized clearing alone
results in the loss of an estimated 20 NO3 of woody fuel each year (the
equivalent of all biomass household fuels consumed annually in Ethiopia).
1.15       Other sources of household fuels are the fuelwood plantations
established around several major cities in Ethiopia this century (there
are about 20,000 ha of fuelwood plantations in the vicinity of Addis Ababa
alone).   However, their productivity has seriously deteriorated as a
consequence of poor management and over-exploitation.



1.16       Agricultural crop residues and wood waste from forest clearing
and the timber processing industry constitute an important energy
resource. In 1982, unutilized crop residaes included about 320,000 t from
cereals, 240,000 t from cotton, 100,000 t from coffee and about 40,000 t of
oven-dry bagasse, equivalent to about one million t of firewood (the energy
value of these wastes could be recovered if processed into fuel
briquettes).  Wood waste recoverable from present forest logging and some
of the clearing operations amounts to about 500,000 m3 per annum and is
expected to increase to about 800,000 m3 by 1992. Sawdust and slabs waste
from sawmills would increase from the present 63,000 m3 per annum to about
215,000 n3 by 1982. In addition, forest clearing by the Coffee Plantation
Development Corporation is expected to increase from its present annual
level of 2,000 ha of high forest to some 6,000 ha by 1990, generating over
a million m3 of recoverable waste.   Finally, other forest and savannah
woodland clearing by the State Farms administration will generate some
130,000 =3 of wood waste per year.   Wood wastes represent a potential
annual production of about 275,u00 t of charcoal, almost twice the present
national charcoal consumption.
Other Energy Resources
1.17       Ethiopia has some prospects for economic utilization of solar
energy for water heating and low-grade industrial process heating.   The
potential for developing other renewable sources of energy such as wind and
biogas  is limited.   There are  also  isolated outcrops of low-quality
lignite, though further exploration is required to determine if lignite or
coal exists in commercially significant quantities.
Energy Demand
1.18       Energy balances for Ethiopia for 1982 and for 1992 are included
in the energy assessment report (para. 1.09).  A summary of actual and
forecast final energy consumption for 1982 and 1992 respectively, is
provided in Annex 1.2. The demand for modern fuels grew rapidly between
FY78 and FY83 with petroleum and electricity demand growing at 7.4% and
13.0% per year, respectively.   These high growth rates were possible
largely because of the then existing low capacity factors in major
industrial plants. However, in FY82 and FY84, as factory capacity became
fully utilized, growth was markedly lower. At present, more than 92Z of
total final energy consumption is biomass household fuels, of which more
than half are agricultural residues and animal dung. The growth in biomass
fuel demand over the next decade is expected to grow less rapidly than
population as combustible cellulosic residues are substituted with
petroleum fuels and electricity. However, by 1992, biomass fuels are still
expected to reptesent 91Z of total energy use. The removal of the tree
cover and the use of animal dung and crop wastes as household fuels are
reducing the returns of nutrients to the soil and affecting agricultural
productivity in certain regions. Soil erosion is becoming an increasingly
serious problem. As a result of massive deforestation, Ethiopia's cover of
closed canopy forests had declined from about 40% in the early 1900's to 3%
in 198Z.  If the required investments are not made, or if novel biomass
fuels do not prove viable within ten years, the increase in the quantity of
dung and agricultural residues used annually (an additional 7 million t)
will greatly increase soil erosion and loss of food production.

Energy Supply
Electricity
1.19       Electricity supply is discussed in detail in Chapter IV.  In the
period FY86-FY95, electricity will be supplied almost entirely from
hydroelectric plants.   Existing and committed facilities are expected to
comfortably cover the demand through 1995 (para. 4.03). In the long term,
the most likely options for generation of electricity are hydropower,
geothermal energy and possibly natural gas.
Petroleum and Petroleum Products
1.20        Ethiopia is entirely dependent on imported crude and refined
products for its supply of petroleum products.   The burden of petroleum
purchases on the balance of payments is now considerable and constitutes a
major constraint on economic development. Petroleum imports rose from 18%
of export earnings in FY78 to 53% in FY82.   From the government-owned
800,000 t/year refinery at the Red Sea port of Assab, refined products are
delivered by truck to the main markets 800-100W  km away in the central
highlands.  Because the existing process (simple hydroskimming) produces
more fuel oil and less refined products than demand requires, large
quantities of petroleum products (about 150,000 t/year) have to be imported
and excess fuel oil re-exported (about 200,000 t/year).   The existing
petroleum supply solution is far from optimAl, but further studies are
required to decide whether the appropriate solution would be to install
thermal cracking facilities or to close the refinery and to import all
refined products.  The construction of a product pipeline from Assab to
Addis Ababa appears to be economically viable. However, this option will
be analyzed in the context of the general need to upgrade transport
facilities from the port of Assab to the Addis Ababa region. Some studies
on this subject are to be undertaken as part of a proposed IDA-financed
Transport Sector Project.
1.21      Petroleum prices are generally close to their economic cost.  The
exceptions are motor spirit, which is priced well above, and LPG and
kerosene, which are priced below this cost. The prices of the latter have
been kept low to provide some respite for low-income families in urban
areas in view of the high cost of firewood. However, limited supply of
kerosene and kerosene stoves rather than price has restricted its use to
date.   Some 200,000 kerosene stoves recently imported by the Government
would not alleviate substantially the household cooking situation unless
the Government increases the share of kerosene for household fuel uss. At
present, supplies are limited, partly due to the consumption of kerosene as
aviation fuel.
Biomass Fuels
1.22       The current crisis in the supply of woody fuels is reflected in
the Addis Ababa marketplace where for the last ten years, the price of
woodfuels has increased at an average annual rate of 9% in real terms.  It
is usual for poorer urban dwellers to spend one quarter of family income on
cooking fuels. Because of the rapid depletion of natural forest resources
and of savannah land and tree stocks within reach of the urban markets, and
the declining productivity of existing perl-urban fuelwood plantations, the



-7-
price of woodfuels will continue to increase and will reach levels
prohibitively expensive for many low-income families. 2/  The continuing
high cost of conventional woodfuels may sake economic the exploitation of
other novel household energy sources such as crop residue fuel briquettes,
as well as electricity for increased use for household cooking. The latter
option may prove   particularly attractive in view of the large hydro-
electric surpluses expected until the year 2000 (para. 4.03).
1.23        The demand for woodfuels in the rural areas is on average 2.5
times the supply, though in some populous agricultural zones the ratio is
10-20:1.    Almost  60Z of the shortfall between demand and supply for
woodfuels occurs within the four northernmost, and now quite desolate,
provinces of Eritrea, Wollo, Tigrai and Gondar.   By contrast, there is
forest production considerably in excess of demand in most parts of the
less populous south-western provinces of Kaffa and Illubabor.   Severe
drought and famine which have recently reached calamity levels in Ethiopia
are undoubtedly linked to the loss of tree cover and decline of land
productivity (para. 1.18).
1.24      In order to satisfy tne projected 1992 demand, the equivalent of
2.85 million ha of fuelwood in the form of woodlots, dispersed tree
planting in agricultural lands and plantations weold have to be established
during   FY86-FY95   including   510,000   ha   of   peri-urban   fuelwood
plantations.3/  Although this target cannot be met, it is estimated that
with appropriate support and a rapid expansion in the supply of trained
mLanpower, a target of about 1.2 million ha might be achievable during the
next ten years.
II. THE P^'WER SUBSECTOR
Organization
2.01       The Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA) is the
sole agency responsible for public electricity generation and supply in
Ethiopia.  The company was established in 1955 as an autonomous government
agency and has been under the Ministry of Mines and Energy since 1976. In
the Eritrea region, power was originally supplied by two privately owned
utilities, the Societa Electrica del'Africa Orientale (SEDAO) and the
Compania Nazionale  Impresse Electriche  (CONIEL).   These companies were
nationalized in 1975 and started operating in 1976 as a single entity, the
Eritrean Region Electrical Supply Agency (ERESA).   The main reasons for
creating FRESA were to maintain appropriate separate accounting for
compensation purposes, and to permit a smooth transition towards an
integrated power subsector organization, particularly on tariffs and on
personnel related matters  such as salaries and labor unions.   ERESA,
however, does not exist as a separate company and legally is EELPA's
Eritrea regional office, with headquarters in Asmara. EELPA's organization
and management are discussed in detail in Chapter III.
2/ Average retail prices surveyed by IDA in Addis Ababa in April 1985 were
75 US$/t for leaves and twigs, 68-100 US$/t for bundles of fuelwood
and 377-464 US$/t for charcoal.
3/ Current planting rates are estimated at about 45-50,000 ha/year of
demonstration and protection forests, and 30 to 35 million seedlings,
equivalent to about 20,000 ha/year.



-8-
Sector Facilities
2.02      The major subsector facilities have been generally constructed to
high standards. However the chronic lack of foreign funds has prevented a
timely replacement of spare parts and appropriate maintenance and has
resulted in a reduction of the service life and reliability of many
facilities. A number of components of the proposed project consist of the
rehabilitation of existing facilities including the replacement of various
items of equipment and provision of spare parts to bring these facilities
to their full operating capability (para. 5.07).
2.03         Electricity in Ethiopia is supplied almost entirely through
public service facilities.   In 1985, public sector generation capacity
represented about 98Z of total as shown in Table 2.1.   In the central
highlands and southern part of the country, electricity is supplied through
a relatively large Main Interconnected System (Main ICS) and 40 small
Self-Contained Systems (SCS), and in the Eritrea region, through a small
Interconnected System and 13 self-contained systems. The Main ICS and the
Eritrea region ICS are not interconnected.

Access to Service
2.05      The energy assessment report estimated the population with access
to electricity in Ethiopia at about 3 million in 1981 which represented
about 8Z of the total population.   Based on present consumption  and
population figures1 average per capita electricity consumption in 1985 is
estimated at about 18 kWh, which is one of the lowest in the region.  Data
for a sample of other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are shown in

Power Subsector Planning
2.07      Power expansion planning is mainly carried out by EELPA with the
assistance of  consultants.    EELPA's  proposed  investments  have  to  be
approved by the MMF and ultimately by NCCP, prior to their incorporation in
the expansion  program.    However,  the company lacks  highly qualified
personnel to plan its expansion and to provide the required counterpart
during studies prepared by consultants. As a result, there has been a lack
of reliable planning studies, including reasonable load forecasts.  BELPA's
planning needs improvement.  However, before a least-cost long-term plan
can be prepared, EELPA has to complete the evaluation of its main basins
and establish their relative merit and optimum development sequence. . The
proposed project would include Technical Assistance and Training to



- 10 -
strengthen EELPA's planning. EELPA has scheduled for completion within the
next few years the preparation of prefeasibility studies for four major
promising hydro power projects and final feasibility for the most economic
development within these four projects. However, these studies will not be
undertaken under the proposed project, considering the limited availability
of funds and that, with the present load forecast, the next generation
expansion would not need to be started before 1995.
2.08       Partly because of planning weaknesses in the energy sector, the
Government has in recent years decided to undertake major projects without
due regard to economic merit and mostly considering favorable bilateral
financial arrangements that had been made available.   As a result of
deficiencies in power subsector expansion planning and decision making, the
present power expansion program does not represent the least-cost solution
for the country, mostly be.ause of over-investment in capacity expansion.
This excessive capacity will dltimately result in a heavy burden for the
national budget (para. 5.03 i) and considerable surpluses (spillover) of
available  hydro  generatic.n  (para.  4.03).    The  decisions  for  such
investments, including the arrangements for their full financing by other
donors, were taken at a time when IDA was not actively involved in the
subsector (para.  5.01).   Power subsector expansion planning and future
investment additions have been addressed in detail in the proposed
project.  In addition, the proposed project includes studies of a possible
interconnection with Sudan which, if timely implemented, would utilize part
of the hydroelectric surplus (para. 5.07 g). Recent technical discussions
between the two countries, supported by the two Governments, and an
agreement to appoint the same consultants for project feasibility are
encouraging results worth mentioning.
2.09        During negotiations agreements were reached on a reasonable
load forecast (Annexes 4.1 through 4.7) and a Power Subsector Investment
Program  (PSIP)  for  the period  FY86-92.    Furthermore,  the  agreements
establish that: (i) EELPA should not, until the completion of the project,
undertake any major expansion project not included in the Government's PSIP
agreed with the Association unless EELPA shall have furnished to the
Association evidence satisfactory to the Association that such major
project is economically and technically justified; and (ii) the PSIP, which
would cover at least 7 years, would be reviewed annually by March 31, or as
needed, and revised if required.   However,  any   major changes to the
program shall be satisfactory  to IDA.   Major changes would  be  those
requiring capital expenditures which shall exceed 1.5X of EELPA's gross
revalued assets in operation in any fiscal year.
Power Subsector Objectives
2.10        The main objectives of the Power Subsector, as discussed by
EELPA, the Government and IDA are:  (a) to ensure adequate production and
supply of electricity throughout the country in accordance with planned
economic and social objectives; (b) to supply electricity at the least cost
for the country;   (c) to avoid negative impacts and mitigate possible
adverse effects of power projects on the environment; {d) to increase
access to electricity throughout the country; (e) to increase--where
economically justified--self-reliance in electricity supply by reducing
dependence on imported sources of energy and by promoting the development



- 11 -
of indigenous energy sources for electricity generation; and (f) to export
electricity to neighbouring countries.
Power Subsector Strategy
2.11       The following strategy has been designed by the Government and
EELPA to meet the subsector objectives, subject to verification of
economic,  technical  and  financial  viability:    (a)  to  promote,  where
economic, the development and utilization of indigenous energy resources
such as hydropower, natural gas and geothermal energy for electricity
generation; (b) to interconnect the Ethiopian grid with those of its
neighbouring countries with the purpose of exporting electricity; tc) to
carry out studies to determine the feasibility of potential power projects;
(d) to adequately reflect the opportunity cost of fuels used for power
generation and other economic parameters in the determination of the power
subsector's least-cost expansion program; (e) to reduce the system losses
by improving operation and maintenance and, where economically justified,
by rehabilitating existing fa,ilities; (f) to regulate electricity tariffs
to meet financial and social objectives while at the same time encouraging
the efficient use of energy; (g) to expand existing regional systems and
install generating facilities and distribution networks in remote areas;
and (h) to interconnect the regional systems to the main grid.
Aid Inflow and Coordination in the Subsector
2.12      The Bank/IDA participation in the power subsector has been rather
limited (para.  1.08).   There has not been a Bank/IDA operation in the
subsector in the last 17 years since Loan 596-ET to EELPA in 1969. During
this period, particularly in the later years, other donors including the
USSR, the Democratic Republic of Korea (DRK), and the Governments of
Finland and Italy have been the major contributors towards financing the
subsector expansion.   However,  although aid  inflow  towards  the power
subsector has been sizeable during this period, it has been inadequate to
cover the subsector requirements, it has not been efficiently allocated and
it has not focussed on policy formulation and institution building.   As a
consequence, the subsector weaknesses have increased, particularly in key
areas such as expansion and financing planning, investment decision,
organization and management and training (paras. 3.05 through 3.21), and
sector investments show large imbalances with respect to the optimum mix of
major categories of facilities required for least-cost electricity supply
(paras. 5.01 through 5.03).
III. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
The Borrower
3.01      The Government of Ethiopia would be the borrower of the proposed
IDA Credit of SDR 53.7 million (about US$62.0 million equivalent at the
rate of 1.15584 US$ISDR).
3.02       The proceeds of the credit would be used as follows:  (a) SDR
39.4 million (about US$45.5 million equivalent will be onlent to EELPA at
commercial rates (para. 5.15) to finance the foreign exchange cost of the
power components of the proposed project; and (b) SDR 14.3 million (US$16.5
million equivalent), would be spent under the coordination of the PMU of



- 12 -
the MME, to finance the foreign exchange costs of the energy components of
the proposed project (para. 5.16).  Of these US$983,000 equivalent will be
onlent to EPC at commercial rates (para. 5.15) to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the petroleum studies.
The Implementing Agencies
3.03      The implementing agencies would be EELPA for the power components
and six Project Implementation Units (PIU) under the coordination of the
PMU for the energy components of the project.   The organization and main
functions o' these agencies are described in paras. 3.04 through 3.21, and
3.22 through 3.24, respectively.
EELPA
3.04      EELPA is a state owned autonomous corporation established in 1955
by General Notice No. 213 with the objective of improving the electricity
service and acting as an agent for the Government in all electricity
matters in Ethiopia except for the Eritrea region.   Responsibility for
electricity matters in the latter were also assigned to EELPA in 1975
(para. 2.01).
Organization and Management
3.05       EELPA's corporate powers are exercised by a Board of Directors
consisting of six members and a Secretary.   The Chairman and the Vice
Chairman are  the Minister  and the Vice Minister of Mines and Energy,
respectively.   The other members represent EELPA and the Ministries of
Finance, Industry, and Housing and Urban Development, respectively.   The
Secretary, without voting power, is EELPA;s financial comptroller. EELPA's
General Manager, who is appointed by the Government, is EELPA's Chief
Executive and also EELPA's representative on the Board.   In practice,
because there is not a clear distinction between these two functions of the
General Manager, board meetings are seldom convened. As a consequence, the
Board does not fully exercise its functions, particularly in policy making,
strategic planning and in providing an effective interface between EELPA's
management and the MME and other government agencies.   Because of its
managerial weakness, EELPA requires close supervision and, though an
autonomous parastatal (para. 2.01), it is in practice managed as a
ministerial department receiving instructions directly from the KME.
EELPA's autonomy is further restricted by its strong dependence on the
national budget to finance new investments (para. 6.03). The strengthening
of EELPA's organization and management will be undertaken under an
Organizational and Manpower Development Program (para. 3.17), to be
financed under the proposed credit (para. 5.07 f). An organizational chart
of EELPA is attached as Annex 3.1.
Planning
3.06         Partly because the existing information and data processing
support are unreliable, but mostly because of the lack of staff with
appropriate economic/technical expertise, EELPA is unable to prepare
suitable load forecasts and least-cost expansion analyses (para. 2.07
through 2.09).



- 13 -
Engineering and Design
3.07         EELPA has developed satisfactory expertise in the design and
construction of distribution and sub-transmission projects.   In the last
few years, the company has also succeeded in designing, constructing and
commissioning 132 kV substations with the assistance of personnel from the
manufacturers of the major equipment and selective consulting support.
However, the number of experienced personnel is insufficient to allow EELPA
to undertake all the engineering work required by the distribution,
transmission  and substations  components  of  the  proposed  project.    In
consequence, EELPA will require the assistance of consultants, particularly
for final preparation of bidding documents and for supervision during
construction of the 132 kV lines and substations and the generation
rehabilitation works. Also, though experienced, gELPA's engineers need to
update their particular fields of expertise to fully take advantage of
latest technological developments in equipment and control design, as well
as in modern construction techniques.   Finally, EELPA needs to develop
technical expertise in the area of feasibility studies, project evaluation
and design of large civil works, to be able to establish a more productive
dialogue as local counterpart in studies and designs prepared by foreign
consultants and to adequately follow-up the execution of technical studies
and construction of new power facilities.  These aspects would be covered
appropriately under the the Organization and Manpower Development Program
included in the project (paras. 3.17 through 3.19).
Operation and Maintenance
3.08         EELPA's facilities, particularly steam and diesel generating
plants, are generally not well maintained.   Insufficient managerial and
maintenance staff capability as well as constraints in foreign exchange
funds  have  resulted  in  inappropriate  preventive maintenance practices
(para. 2.02).   Training and Technical Assistance components under the
proposed project (para. 5.07 f) are expected to allow EELPA to solve these
problems.
Information and Data Processing
3.09       Information is not produced and processed appropriately across
the company, which makes it difficult for higher level staff and management
to monitor results and to run EELPA efficiently. The lack of adequate data
processing services and staff as well as up-to-date software does not
permit EELPA to prepare its accounts, financial, technical and planning
studies and management information in a timely fashion.   Training and
Technical Assistance to be provided under the proposed project would
provide EELPA with the means to solve this problem (para. 5.07 f).
Billing and Collection
3.10      Meters are read once a month.  However, the information -submitted
by meter readers is not verified and may contain errors.  Meter readings
are sent from the regional offices to Addis Ababa (where they arrive about
two weeks after the reading took place) for their centralized processing.
Billing is computerized, but the process takes two to three months due
mostly to computer technical problems and the lack of experienced staff
(para. 3.09).   As a consequence of delayed billing,  at July 7, 1985,



- 14 -
EELPA's accounts receivable were B 56 million. This is equivalent to about
seven months of total sales. Effective end FY86, BELPA is aiming to issue
bills 10 days after the meter readings are received for Addis Ababa
customers and two weeks later for the rest.   EELPA expects that accounts
receivable will reach an acceptable level of about 90 days by end FY87.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that EELPA shall reduce its
accounts receivable to no more than 90 days of sales as of FY87.  These
appear to be reasonable targets in view of the billing system improvements
and training to be undertaken by EELPA (para. 3.18).
3.11        EELPA's collection procedures are satisfactory.  Customers are
presented with their bills by EELPA's collectors and required to pay the
full amount on receipt of the bill. Customers that do not pay within seven
days  are  disconnected.  4/    Restoration  of  service  requires  prior
settlement of the bill, payment of the required two-month deposit and a
penalty charge of B 10.
Accounting and Audit
3.12        EELPA's financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis
using the double eutry system.   At present, only the payroll, billing,
inventory  control  and  financial  reporting  are  computerized.    Gradual
computerization is planned for recording fixed assets, works orders, and
accounts with foreign agencies. To assist EELPA in updating its accounts,
Coopers and Lybrand prepared in May 1984 preliminary financial statements
for FY82 and FY83.   However, EELPA is still about two years behind in
closing its accounts.
3.13       EELPA has an internal Audit and Inspection section with a staff
of about 13 including the Chief Internal Auditor. However, due to lack of
qualified and experienced personnel and up to date ledger balance (since
accounts are not fiinalized on time) the auditing work cannot be carried out
satisfactorily. EELPA's external auditor is the Audit Service Corporation
(ASC), a publicly-owned corporation created in 1977 by Proclamation 126.
ASC has  insufficient  qualified  accounting staff.   However,  assistance
financed  by  the UNDP has provided some relief.    Under  the Technical
Assistance Project (CR 1522-ET, 1984), further support is being provided
for training ASC's staff. The present auditing arrangements are acceptable
to IDA.   During negotiations,  agreement was reached  that EELPA shall
continue to employ qualified auditors and adhere to the following table
with respect to closing its books and forwarding reports to IDA:

4/ Large industries and Government agencies are not disconnected.



- 15 -
Insurance and Taxes
3.14         EELPA has satisfactory insurance coverage of its plant and
equipment against the risks of machinery breakdown, explosion and collapse
of boilers, fire, loss and damage in transit, workshops and vehicles.  It
also has a workman's compensation insurance for all staff, and is in the
process of increasing its insurance coverage for cash-handling staff.
EELPA is subject to the levy of import duties on equipment and spare parts
and pays corporate taxes at 50Z on its net income.
Personnel and Personnel Administration
3.15       At the end of 1985, EELPA had about 7,000 employees of which 2%
were top and middle level managers, 45% technical, financial and
administrative staff, and the remaining 53% were lower-level employees.
Personnel structure has a pyramidal distribution with a very broad (lower
skill) base, because since 1974 EELPA--in response to pressure from the
Government-has been hiring more  lower-level  personnel  than  it needs.
EELPA is aware of its overstaffing at lower levels and plans no new hirings
in those categories, as shown by planned performance indicators (para. 3.21
and Annex 3.2).   Most of EELPA's professionals are graduates from the
University of Addis Ababa. Of these, only a few have been trained abroad.
EELPA has faced difficulties in hiring professionals, because there is a
shortage of university graduates, particularly in the areas of engineering
and computer science, and because graduates are assigned to the various
industries or agencies according to priorities established by NCCP. Under
the project, arrangements will be made with the University of Addis Ababa
to bring a team of lecturers for improving the graduate-level curricula and
providing training which would allow EELPA to hire at least 20 engineers
per year (paras. 3.18 and 5.07 f). Personnel administration at EELPA is in
accordance with the Labor Proclamation No. 64 of 1975 which regulates
principles of employment, salary levels, labor unions and collective
agreements  in  Ethiopia.    EELPA's  labor union negotiates a collective
contract agreement once a year. The General Manager decides on promotions,
disciplinary matters, labor disputes and award of scholarships, assisted by
committees consisting of three members from management, three from the
staff and a chairman elected by the six members.
Training
3.16       EELPA has a training center, which Electricite de France (EDF)
supported in the past with the preparation of course syllabi and experts to
organize and deliver courses under French Government assistance. However,
present arrangements only provide training to upgrade technicians to the
level  of  electro-mechanics.    This  training  curriculum  is  no  longer
appropriate for EELPA's needs. Training aspects were reviewed in detail by
the  ILO  in  1984  (para.  3.17).    Based on the ILO recommendations,  a
comprehensive training program for EELPA has been included in the project
(para. 5.07 f).
Organizational and Manpower Development Program (OMDP)
3.17       Most of EELPA's weaknesses (paras. 3.04 through 3.21) have been
analyzed in some detail in the report 'Ethiopia:   Manpower and Training



- 16 -
Requirements in the Electric Power Sector' recently released by the ILO.
The report identlfles, among others, the following major Issues: (i)
EELPA's organizatlonal structure is out-of-date with modern management
practices, e.g. nineteen managers report directly to the General Manager;
llnes of authority are not always clear; (IL) training is neither linked to
the utilization of staff nor adequate for providing the skills necessary to
operate the utility effectively; and (iii) manpower management information
systems are virtually non-existent.   The report recommends a number of
remedial actions, including changes to the organization, improvement of
managerial practices, redesign of training activities, and the establish-
ment of appropriate information systems.
3.18       In addition to discussing In detail the ILO report with EELPA,
IDA has had an extensive and fruitful exchange of views with EELPA and the
Government concerning objectives, priorities and goals for institution
building in the power subsector. As a result of this dialogue, the project
includes an Organizational and Manpower Development Program (OMDP) for
EELPA (para.  5.07 f).   A detailed description of the OMDP,  including
estimates of the various inputs and associated costs and implementation
schedule is included in pertinent IDA documents (Annex 8.1). The OMDP will
include:    (i)  providing  consulting  services  to  review  in detail  the
organization of EELPA including the functions and composition of its Board
and recommend measures for its improvement; during negotiations agreement
was reached that the review would be completed by October 31, 1987 and that
EELPA rill present to IDA a plan of action based on the conclusions of the
study; (ii) implementing a program jointly designed and coordinated by
EELPA and the University of Addis Ababa (UAA) to increase the number of
students graduating in engineering by about 50 per year, of which at least
20 will be assigned to EELPA, and to provide special training to about 20
EELPA engineers per year. Such program will include construction of about
450 sq meters of classrooms at the Faculty of Technology of the UAA, and
laboratory and training aids. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that EELPA and the UAK shall enter into an agreement containing the details
of such program, and that a draft agreement will be presented to the
Association for its review and comments by December 31, 1986; (iii)
providing consulting services to redesign EELPA's training activities and
to train EELPA's staff; (iv) providing Technical Assistance through a team
of experts to assist EELPA to improve its performance in its key areas of
operation while the training program starts producing results; and (7)
providing consulting services to assist BELPA in the follow-up and
coordination of the various components of the OMDP.
3.19        A timely implementation of the OMDP and a full commitment of
higher management to the program both during its implementation and
subsequently during its application would be essential to transform EELPA
into and maintain it afterwards as a modern, dynamic and efficient
institution.   Accordingly, during negotiations agreement was reached that
hiring the consultants for the component in para. 3.18 (i) will be a
condition for effectiveness of the proposed credit. Terms of reference for
these consultants have already been discussed in detail with EELPA.



- 17 -
Management Information System (MIS) and Performance Indicators
3.20      EELPA urgently needs an appropriate Management Information System
(MIS) which, by assisting better decision making, would ultimately help to
Improve  the  company's  efficiency  throughout  its  organization  and
activities. Such system would be a part of the OMDP of ELUPA and it would
establish a number of performance Indicators to sonttor EELPA's technical
and financial performance.
3.21        IDA and EELPA have agreed on a set of performance indicators
(Annex 3.2), which would be used while the MIS is defined and implemented.
Such indicators represent only tentative targets for EELPA in view that
they have been defined on the basis of preliminary estimates.
Project Management Unit (PMU) and Project Implementation Units (tIU)
3.22         The PMU of the MME will be responsible for coordinating and
supervising the implementation of the energy components of the proposed
project by the PLU of the Ministries and agencies concerned. The functions
and organization of the PMU are described in detail in Annex 3.3. The PMU
will have a Manager, and a Deputy Manager, both satisfactory to IDA, and
sufficient staff to carry out its functions. The PMU's Manager will report
through the Executive Secretary of ENEC to the Vice Minister of Mines and
Energy. The PKU will be assisted by a SteerIng Committee of five members
who  will  represent  respectively  the  five ministries  involved.    Each
Ministry concerned and the Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation would establish
FIU which, under the direction of a manager would be responsible for the
execution of the respective energy components.  PIUs for the execution of
the various energy components of the proposed project would be established
as follows: (i)  Ministry of Coffee and Tea Development:   Coffee residue
briquetting and carbonization; (ii) Ministry of State Farms:  Cereal and
cotton crop residue briquetting; (iii) Ministry of Industry:  (a) Bagasse
briquetting; (b) study of utilization of residue fuel briquettes in
industry; and (c) energy efficiency audits in industries; (iv) Ministry of
Agriculture: (a) charcoal products; (b) woody biomass strategic planning;
and tc) forest and tree resource inventory; (v) Ministry of Mines and
Energy:     (a)  energy  planning  studies;  (b)  cooking  efficiency  and
biomass-fuels marketing studies; and (c) institutional strengthenaing for
energy   agencies   (excluding  EELPA);   and  (vi)  Ethiopian  Petroleum
Corporation: petroleum-subsector studies.
3.23       During negotiations, agreement was reached that prior to credit
effectiveness the PMU shall have been satisfactorily established in the HME
and appropriately staffed for the purpose of the project.
Accounting and Auditing
3.24      Accounting for the energy components will be carried out by the
PMU and should be fully satisfactory. Annual auditing would be performed
by ASC or by other satisfactory external auditors.   During negotiations,
agreement was reached that IDA should receive accounts audited by
independent auditors within six months after the end of each fiscal year.

IV.  IHE MARKET
Electricity Market
Historical Market
4.01       Growth of public electriclty sales in Ethiopia has been rather
uneven in the last few years (Annexes 4.1 through 4.7). During FY77 and
FY78, growth exceeded 20% per year as the country recovered from the civil
disturbance of the aid-seventies, the utilization of existing factory
capacity increased and power supply to the northern provincial capital of
Asura and to isolated centres throughout the country was fully restored.
In FY80 and FY81, the demand for electricity stagnated and sales grew by
less than 3% per annum as a result of factory capacity saturation and of
the global economic recession caused by the impact of sharp increases in
oil prices. The main EELPA ICS, which supplies about three-quarters of
publicly-supplied power followed the same pattern. Sales in the ICS grew
at 12.7% per annum during FY78-FY83. Within this period the lowest growth
rate was 1.4% in FY81 which recovered sharply to 12 in FY82 and FY83. The
rather large growth of electricity sales has been influenced strongly in
the latter years by the commissioning of large electric boilers. Actual
growth in the EELPA ICS in the period FY81-FY85 was only about 8Z,
substantially less than the 14% per annum estimated by EELPA's
coasultants.  The lower than expected load growth was due to delays in
implementing the planned 56 MW boiler electrification program and to slower
than expected economic growth.
Demand Forecast for Electricity in the Main ICS
4.02        In the context of the UNDP/World Bark energy assessment for
Ethiopia conducted in 1983, the Bank reviewed the demand for power and
energy in the EELPA ICS and projected an overall demand growth for the
period 1983-95 of 9.3% per annum. During project appraisal IDA reviewed
again the load forecast in the light of more recent generation and
consumption statistics and also taking into account the updated industrial
expansion plan included in the Government's ten year development plan. As
a result of these analyses, IDA and the Government have agreed on a load
forecast for the period FY86-FY95, which resulted in an average annual
growth for sales of 9.6% when including committed electric boiler loads and
9.2%   per annum without thea (Annex 4.1 through 4.4).  Demand analyses
assume that electric boilers would be connected only during periods of
bydroelectricity surplus and that consequently their loads are not used in
planning  to  justify  system  expansion.    The  pattern  of  electricity
consumption is expected to change moderately during the forecast period as
shown in Table 4.1, mostly due to increases in the share of industrial
consumption.
Generation and Capacity Balances in the Main ICS
4.03      The actual and forecast peak-demnds in the period FY80-FY95 is
shown in detail in Annex 4.2. Peak demand, excluding electric boilers, is
expected to grow at an average annual rate of 9.1% in the period FY86-
FY95. Peak-demand growth would be mostly due to industriel expansion and
to the interconnection with the ICS of presently self-contained diesel

powered systems.  To ensure a reasonable system reliability, generation
capacity requirements were determined assuming a minimum capacity reserve
equivalent to 18Z of the system's peak demand or the size of the largest
unit, whichever is smaUler.  Firm available generation has been determined
from operational records for existing plants and from design studies for
the Malka Wakana and Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric plants under construction.
During the FY86 through FY95 period, the gen-ration balance shows surpluses
ranging from 30Z to 50Z, and the capacity balance surpluses ranging from 9%
to 50Z over and above the reserve margin. The projections indicate that,
after the commissioning of Malka Wakana in FY88, no new capacity would be
required before 1995.  The planned commissioning in FY91 of the 150 MW
Gilgel Gibe scheme (para. 5.01) will involve annual available capacity and
generation surpluses, excluding boiler loads, at least until the year
2000.   The project seeks to promote means to utilize these surpluses
(para. 2.08).
Demand Forecast for Electricity in the EELPA SCS
4.04       The smAll diesel-fueled power systems in the EELPA SCS are all
costly and difficult to m=.ntain.  However, with impending surpluses of
hydropower on the EELPA SCS and regular expansion of transmission systems,
it is economic to advance the interconnection of many of these systems to
the main grid. As a result, the generation and sales forecast in the EELPA
SCS, (Annex 4.5), indicates a substantial reduction in generation and peak
demand through interconnection, despite a historical growth of about 5% per
annum.    Transfers  of  load  from  the  SCS  to  the  ICS  match  the
interconnections shown in the EELPA ICS load forecast.
Demand Forecast for Electricity in the Eritrea Region ICS
4.05      The ICS for the Eritrea region supplies the cities of Asmara and
Massawa. Historically, demand for electricity has been greatly influenced
by regional hostilities and by unreliable supply. While hostilities have
subsided to some extent in recent years, economic growth and hence demand
for  electricity  remains  constrained.    Ho:-ever,  the  installation  of



- 20 -
additional capacity as well as the rehabilitation of existing plants is
expected to lift constraints on supply. Demand has been forecast on the
basis of firm commitments to connect new major loads and taking into
account historical growth patterns and likely elasticity of demand due to
price increases. The average annual growth rates projected for sales and
peak demand for the period FY86-FY92 are 7.5% and 7.9% respectively.
Forecast for Electricity Demand in the Eritrea Region SCS
4.06       The Eritrea region SCS is comprised of a large number of small
diesel generation power stations (para. 2.04). Supply and demand are even
more constrained by social and political factors than on the Eritrea region
ICS, and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. After strong
decrease in FY85 due to drought-related problems and population movements,
demand for electricity is expected to recover slowly. Interconnection of
these small systems with the Eritrea Region ICS cannot be justified until
the cost of generation falls significantly either through its own
interconnection with the EELPA ICS, or through exploiting cheaper
indigenous sources of power, such as geothermal steam and natural gas.
However, it is unlikely that these options would become economically
justified within the next ten years.
Household Fuels Market
4.07        Household energy represents the largest share of both energy
supply and consumption in Ethiopia. In FY82, it amounted to some 94Z of
final energy consumption and in FY92, even under a scenario of steady
economic development, it would still exceed 90% of total final energy use.
The estimated composition of household energy consumption is indicated in
Table 4.2. At present, more than two-thirds of household cooking ie done
with dung and crop residue fuels (it is estimated that about half the total
production of cow dung in Ethiopla is collected and burnt as a cooking
fuel). IDA estimates that at least 30% of dung and cror residues, as well
as the majority of firewood and all of charcoal production are traded in
the cash economy and that the cash market for dung and crop residues is
expanding rapidly.

Supply/Demand Forecast for Household Fuels
4.08      Addis Ababa is the largest urban area and the biggest cash market
for biomass fuels. Firewood and charcoal reach Addis Ababa from forested
areas up to 650 km away.   Because the output of the household fuel
components included in the project will be consumed primarily in Addis
Ababa, the supply/demand projection has been prepared for the city (Annex
4.8).   The projection, which covers the period 1985-1992, is optimistic
regarding the supply of new biomass and additional fuelwood and the availa-
bility of modern fuels. In 1984, 87% of energy supply was in the form of
biomass fuel, of which about one quarter was charcoal, and 14% fuelwood
from peri-urban plantations.   Demand for cooking fuels is expected to
increase by 75Z during the decade 1983-1992, with the supply of modern
fuels assumed to almost treble during this period.
Household Fuels Marketing
4.09        The Government has been unable to control the marketing of
biomass fuels, which is mostly private; handled by tens of thousands of
small-to-medium-scale entrepreneurs who harvest, transport and wholesale or
retail their product from the hinterland virtually on a daily basis.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that fuels produced under the
proposed project vill be marketed wholesale to the highest bidder from the
point of production on State Farms, at sugar mills or coffee processing
centers in the case of crop residue briquettes or from bulk stores to be
established near major urban markets in the case of charcoal products.  In
this way, difficulties  that have  been  experienced  in  the past with
Government control and regulation  of household  fuel markets will be
avoided.  In all, about 15,000 tons of charcoal and about 15,000 tons of
crop-residue briquettes will be produced and marketed under the project.
Crop-residue briquettes are destined mostly for industrial end-use, in the
first instance. Trials will be conducted for their use in the household
sector under the project, and if they prove acceptable for household
cooking and are econmically and financially viable as anticipated, further
production will be promoted to meet demand in that market sector. Charcoal
is already a customary household fuel and demand remains strong, thus it
will be sold for whatever the market can bear for charcoal of the quality
to be produced and delivered to urban markets from the project's remote
production sites.
4.10         The project includes a detailed and comprehensive review of
biomass fuel supply and marketing arrangements to be completed in the first
year of the project. This review will establish the present operation of
markets under Government patronage and in the private sector for the major
urban centers, including the production and supply routes for the fuels and
markets concerned.  The review is to recommend optimal arrangements for
marketing the new biomass fuels to be produced from full scale commercial
production should the project-funded pilot projects prove commercially
viable.   Recommendations will also be made on means of improving the
efficiency of present biomass fuel marketing arrangements where both
Government and private sector agents compete in the same marketplace.
During negotiations agreements were reached that the Government will
establish appropriate marketing arrangements for biomass fuel products to
maximize the revenues to the projects concerned.

V. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Power Subsector Iuvestment Program (PSIP)
Background
5.01          The Association, EELPA and the Government have extensively
discussed the PSIP during the Energy Assessment for Ethiopia (para. 1.09)
and subsequently during project preparation and appraisal. In the view of
the Association the load forecast prepared by EELPA's consultants was
excessively optimistic and the resulting expansion program was too large,
particularly  the generation  aad  transmission  components.   During  the
discussions, the economic and technical viability of the subsector
expansion program was analyzed in detail, including the methodology for the
preparation of load forecasts, and the review of the technical and economic
feasibility of all major generation and transmission projects originally
included in the program. During negotiations, agreements were reached on a
reasonable load forecast for FY86-FY95 (paras. 4.02 through 4.06) and on a
PSIP (paras. 5.02, 5.03 and Annex 5.1). With respect to the construction
of the Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric plant (para. 5.03 i), the Association had
stated that the capacity and energy balances showed that no capacity
addition would be required until 1995 and that in consequence the
commissioning of Gilgel Gibe in FY91 would be a premature investment.  The
Government indicated that a postponement of the project would not be
possible because it had already entered into final arrangements for its
construction with financing from the DRK. At present all the PSIP ongoing
projects are being constructed by EELPA, except for the Malka Wakana and
Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric plants, which are being constructed by the
Government. The Government has indicated that it may transfer Malka Wakana
to EELPA as of FY87, in which case EELPA would complete the construction of
the plant and own and operate the facility upon its commissioning. With
respect to Gilgel Gibe, the Government may wish not to transfer the
facility to EELPA until it is completed, but in no event before it is
justified.   Because of the financial and institutional implications for
EELPA of these transfers, during negotiations agreement was reached that
EELPA may acquire these projects under execation by the Government,
provided the transfers do not adversely affect the financial viability and
the operations of EELPA or prevent the company from meeting any of its
obligations under the Project Agreement.   During negotiations, agreement
was also reached that the Association shall be given an opportunity to
comment on the proposed terms and conditions for the transfers before such
transfers take place.
The Program
5.02        The PSIP for the period FY86-FY92 (para. 2.07 and 2.08) is
described in detail in Annex 5.1 and summarized in Table 5.1.

Works in Progress
5.03        EELPA has several projects under construction in the Main ICS
area as follows:
Ci)  Generation
The largest ongoing projects are the Malka Wakana and Gilgel Gibe
hydroelectric plants of 150 MW each. The construction of Malka Wakana
started in 1983 with commissioning scheduled for end 1988. Financing
for the project is from the USSR and the Government. The construction
of Gilgel Gibe started in end 1984 and commissioning is scheduled for
1991.  Financing for the project is being provided by the DRK and by
the Government.
(ii) Transmission Lines and Substations
The 230 kV lines committed or under construction are associated to the
hydroelectric plants under construction and include the Malka Wakana -
Addis  Ababa  line  and  the  Gilbel-Gibe  Addis  Ababa  line.   Major
transmission lines under construction at 132 kV are the Kombolsha -
Desie line, financed by EEC, the Shashamana - Arbamintch line, financed
by the Government of Yugoslavia, the Alaba-Jima-Agaro line, financed by
the Government of Finland, and the Finchaa-Bahar Dar line financed by
the Government of Italy.   The feasibility of this line is being
reassessed as a 230 kV alternative, in view that the works to improve
the Lake Tana regulation a.d expansion of the Tis Abai hydroelectric
plant have been stopped.
(iii) Other Works
Other works under construction include the 66 kV lines Malka Wakana-
Robi, and Harar-Jijiga, a number of substation expansions in the ICS
area, and distribution.



- 24 -
(iv) Village Electrification
EELPA has a continuous though modest program to expand electricity
supply to villages in the rural area. However, because most of these
village schemes are not self-financing, EELPA has limited the program
to providing or improving the service in about 10 communities each
year.   Typical village installatious may cost about B 0.8 million
(US$0.4 million) of which about 50% is the foreign exchange cost.
Frequently, local villagers provide financing for part of the local
funds required. The criteria used to select the villages include: (a)
the economic/financial justification for the replacement of existing
diesel-driven generators by supply from the Main ICS; (b) the number of
potential consumers; and   (c) in some cases, social and political
reasons as in the case of towns close to international borders.
Future P.roects
5.04      In addition to the proposed project, other future investments in
the period FY86-FY90 include the construction of the Dera-Dire Dava 230 kV
transmission line and terminal substations, village electrification,
distribution, and the construction of several mini hydro plants. A detailed
list of investments is attached as Annex 5.1.
The Project
Project Objectives
5.05      The broad objectives of the project in the energy sector are to
improve investment planning and programing, to strengthen institutions, to
develop strategies to resolve supply problems in the household energy
subsector, and to arrest the declining biological productivity of key
agricultural ecosystems.   More specifically, the project objectives are:
Ci) to develop an in-house capability to establish and update least-cost
program for the power subsector and implement the highest priority projects
within this program; (ii) to attain greater efficiency in the power
subsector through the improvement of its organization and management, the
strengthening of its planning and design capabilities, the upgrading of its
operational practices, the rehabilitation of its facilities when econo-
mically justified, and the improvement of its financial performance;
(iii) to develop and implement least-cost plans to supply household energy
products with substantial private sector participation through free
marketing practices; (iv) to correct imbalances in the prices of energy
products; and (v) to stimulate to the extent possible, an increased and
coordinated aid flow from other donors towards the power and the household
fuels subsectors.
Project Preparation
5.06        The power components of the project were first formulated in
1977.   However, the project objectives and consequently project scope
underwent considerable change during project preparation and appraisal.
The present project scope arises substantially from the priorities for
energy sector development and management identified jointly and agreed with
the Government in the context of the Bank/UNDP energy sector assessment



- 25 -
for Ethiopia in 1983-1984 and follow-up activities (para. 1.09).  Part of
the project preparation was financed through PPF funds provided by IDA
amounting to about US$1 million (PPF 193 of February 4, 1982 and PPF of
June 15, 1983). These funds, to be repaid under the credit, were used to
prepare a Power Planning Study (November, 1982), the feasibility of the
Finchaa-Bahar Dar transmission line and the Awash III-Dire Dawa
transmission line (July 1983), and the feasibility study for the Finchaa
fourth unit (March 1983), reviewed in May 1983 by Lahmeyer. In addition,
EELPA, with the assistance of UNDP financed consultants, prepared
feasibility studies for the rehabilitation of the Aba Samuel hydroelectric
plant and for the construction of the Sor and Hoha mini hydro plants in
1983. Similarly, under a cooperation agreement between Ethiopia and Italy
the Cesen-Ansaldo/Finmecanica Group (Italy) completed in June, 1983, an
'Assessment and Optimisation of the Electric Distribution System in Addis
Ababa". Some of these projects proved to be unfeasible and others had to
be dropped because of financial constraints.   Subsequent to the energy
sector assessment, high priority power system rehabilitation, household
energy, institutional strengthening, and technical assistance components
were added to the project and the feasibility of the various alternatives
to supply electrlcity to the Bahar Dar-Gondar and the Dire Dawa areas was
reviewed in detail.  Most of the feasibility work for the new components
was undertaken with preinvestment resources of the Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP) and the IW.  In the context of this program,
the ILO completed a diagnostic study of the manpower and organizational
development as well as the technical assistance requirements for EELPA, and
a feasibility study for the recovery of forest residues by carbonization,
and consultants financed by ESMAP completed feasibility studies for
agricultural residue briquetting and improved bagasse utilization.    A
complete   assessment   of  power   system  efficiency  improvements   and
rehabilitation needs was carried out in 1984-85 under the ESMAP program.5/
The report, which was discussed with EELPA in detail during appraisal,
identified and established the estimated Costs, period of implementation
and priority of the efficiency improvements and rehabilitation work needed
in EELPA and the Eritrea region power systems. Most components identified
in the report have been included in :he project following recommpnded
priorities (Annex 5.5). Also with ESMAP financing, a comprehensive cooking
efficiency program was initiated in 1984, the second and larger phase of
which is to be executed under the project.

equivalent or 64% would be in foreign exchange. Base costs are at December
1985 price level. Physical contingencies range between 5% and 10% of base
costs for the various components, depending on the level of preparation of
the respective subprojects. Price contingencies were computed on the basis
of the best forecasts available at a post-appraisal review in March 1986
and assume an annual inflation rate of 8% for the period 1985-1992 for
local costs and an international inflation of 7.2% for 1986, 6.8% for 1987
and 1988, 7.0% for 198S, 7.1% for 1990 and 4% for 1991 and thereafter.
These inflation rates are considered appropriate for the kinds of works,
goods and services included in the project and reflect recent experience of
the Ethiopian authorities with similar components.
Project Implementation
5.09        Procurement activities will take place starting in the second
semester of 1986.  The physical execution of the project would start in
February,  1987,  and  would  be  completed  in  September  1991.           An
implementation schedule summary is attached as Annex 5.3.
Implementation of Power Components
5.10       The power components will be implemented partly by contractors
and partly by EELPA with the assistance of consultants.   In view of the
rather large number of components, EELPA will appoint a Project Manager
under the Planning and Programming Department to coordinate and supervise
the execution of the power components of the project.  The appointment of
the Project Manager will be a condition for effectiveness of the credit.
Some of the generation rehabilitation works will require assistance from
manufacturers of particular items of equipment. Force account would be the
most appropriate way of carrying out the distribution components,
particularly the rehabilitation, in view of the need to coordinate the
works with planned disconnections and minimize cuts of electricity supply,
a procedure which will require substantial supervision from EELPA in any
case. EELPA has enough crews and construction equipment to carry out this
task.   The rehabilitation of hydroelectric plants will be carried out by
contractors with participation of EELPA.   The rehabilitation  of  small
diesel engines would be carried out   initially for 4 to 6 plants by a
contractor with the participation of EELPA.   The remaining plants, after
satisfactory training of the EELPA staff, would be rehabilitated mostly by
EELPA under the general supervision of the contractor. Terms of reference
for the above works have been suggested to EELPA by IDA in the Power System
Efficiency Study (para. 5.06). EELPA would carry out the 66 kV and 132 kV
lines and substations in view that EELPA has available equipment and crews
from similar works completed recently. The technical assistance staff, to
be funded under the proposed project (para. 5.07 f), would provide EELPA
with required support during the execution of the project. The total cost
of force-account works is estimated at US$43 million equivalent, about 7%
of EELPA's expansion program for the period FY86-FY90. The organizational
and manpower development program for EELPA would be carried out by
consultants and, in view of its complexity, would be coordinated by EELPA
with the assistance of independent consultants.

Implementation of Energy Components
5.11       The energy components will be executed by various agencies under
five ministries.   Final responsibility for coordination and supervision
during implementation will rest on a Project Management Unit (PMU), to be
established under MME. The institutional framework for the implementation
of the energy components is explained in detail in Chapter 'II (paras 3.22
through 3.24).
5.12       The PMU will be the local counterpart for IDA and cofinancing
agencies, consultants and contractors involved in the implementatioa of the
energy components and would handle all correspondence, progress reports,
requests for disbursements and procurement activities (para. 3.22 and
Annex  3.3).   In the execution of the energy  components,  the various
ministries will be assisted by experienced consultants and contractors who
will work under terms of reference or technical specifications satisfactory
to IDA.
Consulting Services
5.13      The execution of the project will require consulting services for
review of final design and preparation of bidding documents, evaluation
of offers and selected supervision during construction of the power
physical components, for the execution of the Organization and Manpower
Development Program for EELPA, for preparation and supervision of implemen-
tation of the physical items of the energy components, and for both the
power and energy studies.
Procurement
5.14        The materials, equipment and vehicles to be financed by IDA
credit will be purchased through international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA guidelines for procurement, except for proprietary
items such as the spare parts for rehabilitation of existing equipment
Margins of preference to domestic manufacturers would not apply in this
case because equipment and materials required for the project are not
produced  locally.    All  contracts  for  amounts  equal  or  larger  than
US$ 300,000 equivalent would be subject to IDA's prior review. Consultancy
services to be financed under the proposed IDA credit would be selected or
the basis of quality of services, in accordance with IDA guidelines fox
selecting consultants.   Consultancy contracts would be satisfactory te
IDA.  Contracts for works, including construction of about 12 houses for
Technical Assistance personnel, construction of small industrial buildings
for some of the household energy components and construction of about 450
sq meters of classrooms, will be procured under competitive bidding
advertised locally (Table 5.3).

Financing Plan
5.15      The total foreign exchange cost of the project is USS68.1 million
(B 140.9 million) of which US$45.5 million CB 94.2 million) will be
expended by EELPA and US$22.6 million (B 46.2 million) will be expended by
the Government on the energy components of the proposed project.  Of the
total foreign exchange cost, IDA will finance US$62.0 million equivalent,
the DanJsh International Development Agency (DANIDA) will finance US$5.8
milion equivalent and the Government US$0.3 million.   Local currency
requirements for the power components will be provided by KELPA from funds
generated from its operatlons and for the energy components by the
Government.
5.16          During negotiations, agreemevt was reached that  (i) the
Government shall onlend to EELPA part of the proceeds of the proposed
credit at 9% interest rate and 20 years including 5 years of grace
(para. 3.02) and to EPC at 9% interest rate and 5 years including 2 years
of grace; the proposed onlending rate is in line with local inflation In
Ethiopia which is projected at a rate of 9Z per annum for the period
FY86-FY92.  The actual inflation rates in FY82 through FY85 were 7.3%,
3.8%, 0% and 8Z; and (ii) the execution of the onlending agreements between
EELPA and the Government and EPC and the Government shall be a condition of
effectiveness  of  the  IDA  credit.    The  local  and  foreign  currency
requirements for the other energy components of the project will be
provided by the Government and passed on to the various implementing
agencies as grants.
Advance Contracting; Retroactive Financing
5.17      The final stage of project preparation includes updating part of
the preliminary work which had been carried out for some of the project
components including drafting of bidding documents, terms of reference and
contracts for hiring consultants. The Government and EELPA have requested
IDA  to  retroactively  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  these
expenditures. It is likely that the contracts for some project components
may have to be awarded prior to signing the proposed IDA Credit, in order
to avoid unnecessary  delays in project implementation.   Such advance
contracting would require down payments for vbich 8ELPA and the Government
would like to be reimbursed.   The amount of retroactive financing is
expected not to exceed US$2.0 million equivalent or 3Z of the credit.



- 34 -
Disbursement
5.18       The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed over a period of
about 60 months from September 1986 through September 1991. Disbursements
from the credit account will be fully documented and made for 1001 of
foreign expenditures for all project components except for:   (a) works
under parts (e), (f), (h) and (1) of para. 5.C7, for which disbursements
will be made for 80Z of local expenditures; and (b) consulting services,
for which disbursements will be made for 80% of local expenditures for
services of consultants domiciled in Ethiopia and 1001 of foreign
expenditures for services of other consultants. The expected schedule of
disbursements (Annex 5.4) from the proposed IDA credit is based on standard
profiles for Bank loans and IDA credits for power projects in the Eastern
and Southern Africa region. The closing date for the proposed credit would
be March 31, 1992, six months after project completion.
Special Accounts
5.19       In order to expedite project execution and give the implementing
agencies rapid access to funds under the credit, the Government will open
two Special Accounts at the Bank of Ethiopia.  Account A for EELPA will
have an initial deposit of US$500,000 and Account B for the PMU an initial
amount of US$300,000.  Payments from the Special Accounts shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures.   The  Special Accounts will be
replenished by the Association as needed, in accordance with established
procedures.
Environmental Aspects
5.20       The power sub-sector components do not involve any significant
negative environmental impact. The short 132 kV transmission line sections
and the 66 kV transmission lines involve no issues of right of way for
the line routes and their access roads. Similarly, none of the proposed
distribution expansion is expected to present any risk to the environment.
The household energy production components of the proposed project are
expected to have positive environmental implications. The coffee husk and
parchment briquetting projects will alleviate a serious fire and water
pollution hazard through utilizing materials which tend to spontaneously
ignite or which, when expelled into waterways, form floating pa-trescent
mats. In the context of the crop residue briquetting project studies will
be conducted to determine whether removal of crop residues is deleterious
to sail fertility and structure or if the residue quantities planned to be
left in the field offer sufficient soil protection and enrichment.
Measures of such variables as soil carbon, soil structure and loss will be
made before and during the pilot projects at the proposed sites.  It is
unlikely, however, that the implementation of the residue recovery
components will produce more environmental deterioration than the present
practice of burning off all residues in the field prior to planting the
next crop and may even improve soil structure and fertility.



- 35 -
Project Risks
5.21        The implementation of the power sub-sector physical components
does not involve risk besides that normally associated with the construc-
tion of transmission and distribution works. In both the distribution and
the generation rehabilitation components construction will involve works on
already energized systems and uight require temporary cuts of electricity
supply. Consequently, activities will be scheduled so as to ensure that
outages are kept to a minimum.  EELPA has had a good safety record in
projects it has implemented directly or has supervised.   Construction
schedules for the various power subsector components of the project reflect
design and construction methods applicable and the experience of similar
previous projects constructed in Ethiopia. Hence, no significant delay in
project implementation is anticipated.   The hydroelectric plants to be
rehabilitated under the project are on the Awash, Finchaa and Blue Nile
Rivers.  The Awash joins a lake, which is partly in Djibouti territory.
The Finchaa is part of the Blue Nile System which flows through Sudan.
There will be no change in water quality or quantity as a result of the
project. No foreseeable future action by Djibouti or Sudan could adversely
affect the viability of the hydroelectric rehabilitation compocents.  The
Government of Ethiopia has confirmed that there are no treaties or
agreements ruling the use of international waters whereby Ethiopia has to
inform or seek agreements of other countries on rehabilitation or other
works of hydroplants to be included under the proposed project.
5.22       Some of the household energy components in the project include
fuel production techniques and technologies for which there is no previous
experience elsewhere on this scale. Although economic viability for these
components has been demonstrated at the feasibility study stage, there are
some risks of not meeting projected costs and benefits because of uncer-
tainties in start-up dates and level of production of the components
because of the marked seasonality of crop or forest residue production. In
the case of broadacre agricultural residues of stalks and stover, there is
only about a two month period for each crop in which to harvest residues
before replanting begins. Consequently, delays in equipment procurement of
two months may lead to a one year delay in project start-up. Similarly, if
new harvesting and processing techniques are not mastered quickly, residues
may have to be disposed of to permit cultivation. Charcoal production is
also influenced by heavy seasonal rains in the forests of the south-west
which hamper carbonization for two to three months, and by pressure from
the agricultural development agency to plant tea or coffee, which means
burning off the forest residues remaining if they have not been carbonized
in time. However, these are pilot projects where part of the objective is
to analyze the impact of delays on costs and the scale of production as a
way to learn the application of new basic logging and carbonization
technology, and work organization system.   In consequence, the benefits
arising from the early development of new sources of household cooking
fuels from wastes would far outweigh the higher risks faced.



- 36 -
5.23        The project includes sizeable institution-building components
which aim at improving the organization and management of the institutions
concerned, through organizational changes, training and technical assis-
tance to support their day to day operations.   Though it has  been
established that the main constraint for successful implementation of these
components would be the capability of the institutions to absorb these
large-scale improvement programs and though all measures are being taken to
design the assistance accordingly, it may prove necessary to spread the
institutional development over a longer period of time.
5.24       The rehabilitation components of the project in the EELPA ICS
were selected based on reliability improvements needed rather than on
increased  efficiency  objectives,  because  of  the  large  surpluses  of
available generation that are likely to prevail until the year 2000.  In
consequence their benefits are not likely to be affected by lower trends in
long-term oil prices.   The rehabilitation of small diesel plants  in
isolated systems was also selected basically for supply reliability
reasons.   Although for these small systems fuel costs are an important
component in the determination of their economic feasibility, the pay-off
periods encountered ranged between one and two years mainly because very
low investments in spares (as compared to new groups) are requied to bring
these plants to full operational conditions.   Accordingly, the resulting
benefits are unlikely to be affected by reductions in oil prices. In those
cases where interconnection of small systems to the grid was selected as
the least-cost alternatve, the return on investment of over 30% is unlikely
to be substantially affected by lower oil prices in view of the rather high
impact of transportation costs on delivered costs of fuels.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND COST RECOVERY
Introduction
6.01       EELPA is responsible for all public electricity operations in
Ethiopia. Its activities are divided into eight regions (paras. 2.01 and
3.04 and Annex 3.1).   EELPA keeps accounts for the activities in the
Eritrea region separate from the activities in the remaining seven regions.
In analyzing the past and future financial performance and position of the
power sector in Ethiopia, the accounts of the activities in the Eritrea
region have been consolidated with the accounts of the electricity
operations in the rest of the country.
Financial Position and Past Operating Results
6.02        The operating results for FY84 and FY85, based on available
accounting data which have not yet been audited (para. 3.12), are
sunmmarized in Table 6.1.
6.03      EELPA achieved annual rates of return on revalued assets during
FY84 and FY85 of -4.6% and -3.7%, respectively.   Excluding the Eritrea
region, the rates of return in FY84 and FY85 were -1.6% aud-0.6%, which are
well below the 7% required under Loan 596-ET of 1969. The negative rates
of return result from high operating costs and inadequate tariffs which
have hindered EELPA in financing from its internal sources construction of
new projects and improvement of existing facilities. Electricity tariffs



- 37 -
are particularly low in the Eritrea region, where customers continue to be
supplied under the same tariffs which were in force at the time of the
change of ownership twelve years ago. As a consequence, the Government has
financed most of that region's operational and capital requirements through
grants.   At July 7, 1985, total Government grants amounted to B 113.7
million for that region.   EELPA's net income over the past years has
further been decreased partly due to -capital charge," a levy established
by the Government in 1979 on income of public sector organizations. EELPA,
due to its low earnings, has in the past been allowed to defer payment of
th,e capital charge, which is levied at the rate of 5% on paid-in-capital,
retained earnings plus grants, regardless of profits.

6.04        Proclamation No. 163 of 1979, which governs the finances of
public enterprises, requires EELPA to pay 1OZ of its net income each year
into the Government's general reserve fund for EELPA until it equals 30% of
EELPA's paid-in capital.  This reduces EELPA's availability of funds for
financing its investment program.   During negotiations agreements were
reached that EELPA shall have at its disposal at the beginning of the
fourth quarter of each preceding fiscal year sufficient funds to meet the
local currency requirements of its investment program for the following
fiscal year.
6.05      The financial position of EELPA as of July 7, 1984 and 1985 is
summarized in Table 6.2.   Accounts receivable on July 7, 1984, after
providing for doubtful accounts were equivalent to about seven months sales
revenue which indicates an unsatisfactory situation in billing (paras. 3.10
and 3.11).   On July 7, 1985, EELPA's inventory level was 6.2% of gross
revalued assets, which is high and reflects tha storage of several diesel
generating groups which have since been installed. The debt/equity ratio
was 19/81, indicating that EELPA is conservatively capitalized. However,
due partly to insufficient tariff levels, EELPA's debt service coverage for
FY84 and FY85 was only 0.4 and 0.7, respectively.  During negotiations,
agreement was reached that EELPA shall not incur any debt without IDA's



- 38 -
agreement unless the twelve month net revenues prior to incurring the new
debt cover at least 1.5 times future maximum debt service, including that
related to the new debt.

Tariffs
6.06       Prior to the recent tariff increase approved by the Government
(para. 6.08), electricity tariffs, which were put into effect in October
1978 for EELPA and in April 1974 for the Eritrea region, were neither
adequate to provide sufficient funds to meet EELPA's requirements for
operating expenses, debt service and normal capital expenditures, nor to
meet the rate of return covenant of Loan 596-ET. In August 1983, Coopers &
Lybrand Associates completed for EELPA a tariff study based on long-run
marginal costs which proposed major changes in tariff structure from a
declining-block tariff to the use of time-of-day peak/off-peak rates (Annex
6.5).   However, the study was based on an excessively optimistic load
forecast and a correspondingly large capital investment program and its
conclusions and recommendations will have to be updated (para. 6.07).



- 39 -
6.07      EELPA needs to establish an in-house capability to prepare tariff
studies, including the analysis of economic costs of supplying electricity
to the various consumer categories in different regions.   The Technical
Assistance Program for EELPA (paras. 3.18 and 5.07(f)) includes the
appointment of an engineer/economist who would assist EELPA in analyzing
long-term power sector expansion planning and in the determination of
long-run marginal costs and the preparation of tariff studies.   In view
that the Coopers & Lybrand tariff study has become outdated, (para. 6.06)
EELPA will review the conclusions of the study with particular emphasis on
tariff structure.   Duriiig negotiations, agreement was reached that EELPA
shall review periodically the adequacy or appropriateness of its tariff
structure and furnish to IDA for its review and comment any plan of action
prior to its implementation.
6.08       On March 13, 1986, the Government approved a tariff increase of
75% which would raise the average tariff per kWh from B 0.122 to B 0.213
(from US$0.059 to US$0.103 per kWh).   This rather high tariff level is
required because of the high operating costs in the Eritrea region and in
the EELPA SCS, and because of the large capital investments in the period
FY87-FY92. The new electricity tariffs which will be implemented no later
than July 8, 1986 are adequate to provide sufficient funds to meet EELPA's
requirements for operating expenses aad debt service and contribute a
reasonable amount towards it capital expenditures.   An estimate of the
economic cost of power has been derived based on the PSIP (para. 5.01 and
para. 7.03), as an indication of dhe appropriateness of tariff level. Such
average economic cost is estimated at 0.22 B/kWh expressed in end-1984
price level (0.243/kWh in mid-1986 price level), which is slightly higher
than the average financial yield from tariffs after the recently approved
increase.
Future Financial Position and Oerations
6.09      The projected financial statements of EELPA for FY86 through FY92
together with notes and assumptions used in these statements are shown in
Annexes 6.1 through 6.4.   Projected balance sheets for the years ending
July 7, 1986 through 1992 show that the current ratio during thiese years
varies between 1.2 and 1.5. The debt/equity ratio is projected to increase
from 20/80 for FY86 to 36/64 for FY92. These ratios are within accepteble
limits.
6.10        After the rather large recent tariff increase of 75% (para.
6.08), it is estimated that EELPA would not require further tariff
increases until 1989 to meet all its financial requirements.  Such tariff
increases, based on projected costs and sales, are estimated at 19% in July
1989, 16% in July 1990 and 16% in July 1991. These increases are needed in
part to finance the substantial requirements of local expenditures of
EELPA's construction program and for the increasing fund requirements for
payment of capital charges to the Governme't.  If these tariff increases
are implemented, electricity tariffs in real terms at the beginning of
FY92, would be slightly higher than the level in mid 1986.



- 40 -
6.11       With these tariff revisions (para. 6.10), EELPA is expected to
generate internally sufficient funds to finance (after operating expenses,
debt service and working capital requirements have been met) about 15X of
its investment program during FY87-89 and at least 25% thereafter. EELPA's
financial performance would be satisfactory for years FY87-92 based on its
projected operations, tariff levels, sales and costs, with debt service
coverage varying between 1.6 and 2.3 times and the working ratio decreasing
from 0.63 to 0.55. Given the characteristics of EELPA's expansion program,
to link funds generation to a stable rate of return would lead to higher
tariff increases than needed which would produce considerable cash
accumulation when large assets are incorporated into the rate base. Under
the proposed credit, EELPA's future financial performance would be linked
to appropriate cash-generation levels which would provide a more realistic
indication  for  tariff  increases  needed and  to plan  investments.    In
consequence, the rate of return covenant established under Loan Agreement
No. 596-ET for the Finchaa Hydroelectric Project has been replaced by a
cash-generation covenant.   During negotiations agreement was reached that
(i) EELPA shall produce funds from internal sources equivalent to not less
than 15% for FY88, 20Z for FY89 and 25% thereafter of EELPA's average
annual capital expenditures incurred or expected to be incurred fcr three
years, comprising the fiscal year in question, and the ones immediately
preceding and following such fiscal year; (1i) each fiscal year, before
March 31, EELPA and the Government shall review with IDA whether EELPA
would meet the requirements set out in (i) in respect of such fiscal year
and the next following fiscal year; and (iii) in the event such review
shows that the requirement set out in (i) will not be met, EELPA and the
Government  shall  promptly  take  all  necessary  measures,  including
adjustments to tariffs, in order to meet such requirements.
Proposed Financing Plan
6.12      A detailed funds flow statement for EELPA is shown in Annex 6.2.
A summary financing plan for FY87-FY90 is included in Table 6.3.
6.13      During the project period FY87-FY90, EELPA's construction program
is expected to cost US$507.4 million equivalent (B 1,050.3 million),
including interest during construction of US$22.1 million (B 45.7 million)
and duties and taxes of US$24.4 million (B 50.4 million).   The proposed
project   would   represent   about   13%,   US$72.5   million   equivalent
(B 150.1 million), of EELPA's total requirements during FY87-FY90.
6.14       Of the total funds required by EELPA for the period FY87-FY90,
about 55% will be financed from borrowings, 20% will be financed from
internal cash generation after covering debt service and capital charges,
19% 6/ would be financed by grants from the Government, about 1% would be
financed by consumers' deposits, and the remaining 5% by deferment of
capital charges to the Government (Annex 6.4, para. 7).
6/ Foreign-exchange cost expenditures by the Government on Malka Wakana
prior to FY87 are assumed to be transferred to EELPA that year as
Government grants. The local-cost expenditures on Malka Wakana prior
to  FY87  are shown in EELPA's  accounts under work-in-progress and
government grants for FY83-FY86, respectively.

VII.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Electric Power
Average Incremental Costs (AIC)
7.01       At present it is not possible to estimate the long-run marginal
costs for electricity in Ethiopia because a long-term least-cost power
development program has not been prepared.   Therefore, the AIC of the
ongoing and projected total investment program between FY85 and FY92 were
estimated instead. These include all incremental generation, transmission,
distribution and customer-related costs. Separate AIC estimates were made
for the EELPA system as a whole, including all isolated load centers and
for the main EELPA ICS by itself.
7.02       To provide an approximate measure of the cost penalty of over-
investment, the potential AIC of the current expansion program was also
estimated.   The assumption underlying this estimate is that all surplus
energy produced by the present program could be sold. This also provides a
measure of the potential benefits from selling such surpluses elsewhere
(e.g. exports).
7.03           Details of the underlying analyses of AIC are shown in
Annex 7.1. The results are as follows:
Average Incremental Cost
Birr/kWh (US$/kWh) at llZ Discount Rate
Projected         Poteutial
EELPA Total System                     0.22 (0.11)        0.16 (0.08)
EELPA ICS                              0.19 (0.09)        0.14 (0.07)
Return on Power Investment
7.04      The calculation of the Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of
the project was based on the overall power investment program between FY85
and FY92. Two rates were calculated: one for the EELPA system as a whole,
including all isolated load centers, and the other for the main EELPA ICS
only.
7.05        The measure of benefits used was projected total revenues in
constant terms,  based on projected tariffs (para 6.10).   This under-
estimates actual benefits, because it excludes the evaluation of any
cons'mer surplus.  Costs were based on the projected costs of the FY85 to
FY92 system  expansion  program  in  constant  end-1984  prices,  including
physical contingencies, with foreign costs shadow-priced at a rate of 1.33
times the present exchange rate.  No allowance was made for shadow-pricing
local labor, because most of the work has to be carried out by skilled
labor which is in short supply.
7.06       The IERR for the EELPA system as a whole is 7%, while for the
EELPA ICS alone it is 9%. These rates which are on the low side, but still
are acceptable, reflect the result of overinvestment in capacity.   The
lower rate for the EELPA system as a whole reflects in addition the high
costs of operating the approximately 60 small isolated systems, including
the Eritrea Region Systems.



- 43 -
7.07       For illustrative purposes, the potential IERR's for both systems
were also calculated. These are based on the assumption that all surplus
energy could bo sold at average tariff levels. For the total EELPA System
this potential IERR is 12% while for the EELPA ICS It is 13%.  Details of
the underlying analyses have been shown in Annex 7.2.
Economic Analysis of the 66 kV Transmission Line Extensions
7.08       The proposed 66 kV transmission line from Sabatta to Wolliso has
been chosen to provide an indication of the likely economic benefits of a
typical 66 kV line extension. These are low-voltage, wooden-pole transmis-
sion links of which three are to be financed under the project.  They all
are designed to connect existing high-cost, diesel-powered load centers
with the low-cost EELPA interconnected system.   All of  them would be
locally designed and installed by EELPA.
7.09        The alternatives selected for the least cost analysis are the
immediate construction of a transmission link, or the continued operation
and expansion of diesel generation until such time when a transmission line
becomes more economical.  The problem therefore is one of optimal timing
for the commissioning of the transmission line.  A year by year approach
for replacing diesel generation by a transmission line was used for the
analysis, covering the years from FY88 to FY2000.
7.10       The results clearly show that installing the line by 1988 is the
least-cost solution for supplying electricity to the Wolliso region.
Details of the analysis are shown in Annex 7.3.
Present Value of Total Costs
Transmission Line             Discount Rate 11Z
Commissioning Year        Birr million (USS million)
1988                           7.6 (3.7)
1991                           9.2 (4.4)
1995                          11.3 (5.5)
2000                          13.3 (6.4)
Diesel only                   19.3 (9.3)
Internal Economic Rate of Return
7.11      The IERR for the Sabatto-Wolliso line was estimated by measuring
the cost differential between the alternatives of completing the trans-
mission line in 1988 or in later years (Annex 7.4).   The years 1991 and
1995 were chosen as representative years for switching from diesel genera-
tion to a transmission interconnection. This methodology is appropriate to
use in this case because the Government and EELPA are committed to the
continuing supply of electricity in and around Wolliso at average, country-
wide tariff levels. The resulting IERs are 32% for a line completion by
1988 instead of 1991, and 33% if line completion were delayed until 1995.



- 44 -
Criteria for Distribution Rehabilitation
7.12      The criteria for distribution rehabilitation would be based on:
(i)  the  need  to  replace damaged  physical components,  as needed,
including insulators, poles, conductors and hardware, trans-
formers, and other equipment and materials to bring existing
installation to safe and reliable condition; and
(ii) the least-cost alternatives to ensure quality and relia-
bility of service.   Alternatives to be analyzed would include
reconductoring, adding capacitors, increasing voltage levels,
and, where appropriate, loss reduction taking into account AIC of
capacity and energy.
Initially, for most urgent cases, the criteria would be based on coordi-
nated recommendations from the technical assistance staff and the
consultants for the Distribution Planning Study. As the study progresses,
the criteria and priorities wouid be based on the conclusions of the study
and the recommendations for each case would be obtained utilizing the new
planning methods.
Household Energy Production Projects
Introduction
7.13          The various household energy production projects are pilot
projects. They are designed to prove the technical, financial and economic
feasibility of using readily available,  but presently was;ed or under-
utilized biomass resources, by converting them into useful fuels and moving
them to markets.   Although pilot projects, they are designed on a large
enough scale to capture most available economies of scale in production,
transport and distribution.
7.14       While the technologies to be utilized are well proven elsewhere,
they are new to Ethiopia.   This means that they have to face the usual
start-up costs of introducing new technologies in production and marketing,
and the added costs of close supervision, monitoring, training, marketing,
etc. For this reason, the economic analysis can only be indicative at this
time. Nevertheless, the promise of very substantial rates of return is
high, if the feasibility of the technical packages can be proven in the
Ethiopian context.



- 45 -
Charcoal Projects
7.15       The charcoal pilot projects are designed to produce charcoal at
rates of 15,000 tons per year, utilizing waste wood from land clearing
operations.  The potential economic benefits can be measured by comparing
the estimated costs of supplying lump charcoal from the projects with the
costs  of alternative  fuel  available  in the Addis Ababa market.   The
breakeven retail price for charcoal measured in terms of the economic costs
of kerosene used for household cooking is B 4541t.  In terms of prevailing
free market prices for charcoal,  it is B 625/t.   The results of  the
indicative economic analysis are as follows:
Alternative       Economic Market
Project Costs                      Fuel          Value of Charcoal       IERR
(Birr/ton)
1.  Excluding T.A. costs         kerosene             454                 252
2.  Including T.A. costs         kerosene             454                 16%
3. As under #2, but
capital costs up 20%         kerosene             454                 11%
4.  As unde- #3                  charcoal at          625                 30%
current market prices
These indicative rates are very attractive and fully support the under-
taking of the charcoal pilot projects.   More detailed data have  been
provided in Annex 7.5.
Crop Residue Briquettes
7.16         Briquetting crop residues from large farm operations is not
common and it has never been done at the scale envisaged for Ethiopia.
Nevertheless, the components of the technical packages to be used are all
commercially available and proven.   The economic justification of  the
proposed crop residue briquetting pilot projects is provided in Annex 7.6.
It is analyzed in terms of the current economic costs of alternative fuels
in the Addis Ababa market. The results are as follows:
Economic Cost of Energy                                  As a Percent of:
Useful Eneru     Kerosene       Firewood
Fuel                             !Birr OMW)         Costs          Costs
Cfee Residue Briquettes               2.80          -6-              22
Bagasse Briquettes                    2.47           69              27
Cotton Residue Briquettes             3.47           69              27
Cereal Stover Briquettes              3.53           70              27
Comparative Fuel Costs                        Bt/MJ
Kerosene                                   5.02
Propane                                    7.72
Firewood (market price)                   13.00
Used as industrial fuels, the various crop residue briquettes promise to be
as competitive as they are as household fuels (Annex 7.6).  Overall, the
analysis shows that developing these new sources of fuel could be highly
advantageous.   Therefore, pilot projects proposed under the project are
fully justified.

ANNEX 4.1
ETHIOPIA
ENERGY PROJECT
EELPA ICS
Assumptions for Load Forecast
The main assumptions for the load forecast discussed with EELPA
and the Government are that:
1)   beyond 1986 only one half of the presently planned increment of
new industrial loads will materialize;
2)   the historic demand for existing large industry will grow through
expansion and higher capacity utilization at no greater than 1.0%
per annum;
3)   electrification of cooking will be limited by the capacity of the
distribution system to about 7% until 1987 and will grow beyond
that date at 10% per annum;
4)   system losses will decline from the present 15.2% to 10.4% of
generation over the 1985-89 period due to the program of
transmission and distribution rehabilitation being implemented,
partly through the Power III project;
5)   interconnection of the diesel-fueled self-contained power system
to the EELPA ICS is in accordance with the agreed 66 kV
transmission extension program;
6)   commercial sector consumption of electricity will grow no more
than 7% per annum; and
7)   residential general consumption will grow at 5% p.a.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Sales and Revenues
1.        Sales for the period FY86-FY92 are calculated on the basis of the
demand forecast agreed with EELPA and the Government of Ethiopia (Annex 4.1
through 4.7).   The resulting average annual growth is 92 from FY86 to
FY92.
2.          EELPA's revenues are based on average tariff increases of 75Z
effective July 8, 1986 (approved in March 1986) and further increases of
19% effective July 8, 1989, 16Z effective July 8, 1990 and 17% effective
July 8, 1991.
3.        From FY87, service charge which is presently included in EELPA's
other revenues, will be included in EELPA's new tariff structure. Hence,
other revenues from FY87 onwards represent connection charges, only.
Operating Costs
4.         Fuel costs have been estimated at Birr 0.20/kWh in the Eritrea
area and Birr 0.29/kWh for the rest of EELPA's system.   These costs are
based on end-1985 c.i.f. petroleum costs and transportation charges.
No adjustment to these costs has been made for the future. Increases in
EELPA's personnel cost have been related to increase in installed capacity
and adjusted at 9Z annually (e.g. 52 for salary increases and the remaining
for upgrading positions). In the Eritrea region, personnel cost has been
adjusted at 5% only. Materials have been calculated at 1.2% on previous
year's gross revalued assets.  Insurance has been estimated at 0.17Z of
current gross revalued plant in operation. Other costs have been adjusted
only for inflation.
Depreciation
5.         Depreciation is charged at 3.3% and 62 of revalued gross fixed
assets at the beginning of each year for EELPA and the Eritrea region
respectively. These rates are consistent with past experience.
Taxes
6.        SELPA's income is subject to 50% income tax.
Capital Charge
7.         Capital charge is levied at the rate of 5% on paid-in capital,
retained earnings plus Government contribution at the end of each financial
year.  it has been assumed that capital charges prior to FY90 will be
deferred and that EELPA will start paying these charges from FY90 onwards.
Capital charge is deductible for the purpose of calculating income tax.



- 82 -                 ANNEX 6.4
Page 2 of 2
Fixed Assets
8.         Fixed assets and accumulated depreciation have been adjusted to
reflect estimated replacement values based on estimated international and
local inflation and average foreign component of 70X and local component of
30% for fixed assets.
Accounts Receivable
9.          EELPA's accounts receivables are expected to be reduced to 90
days by end FY87 and thereafter, as a result of improvement in billing.
Inventories
10.       These are assumed to be gradually reduced to 3% of gross revalued
plant in operation by end FY87 and kept at that level thereafter.
Accounts Payable and Consumers' Deposits
I1.       EELPA's liquidity position would improve as a result of declining
accounts receivable position.   Hence, accounts payable would gradually
decrease to two months inventory level by FY88. Consumers' deposits would
increase by 5% annually.
Long-Term Debt
12.         The future foreign exchange debt would arise from grants and
credits to the Government and onlent to EELPA. Part of the proceeds of the
IDA credit will be onlent to EELPA at 9Z annual interest to reflect a
positive real interest rate and will be repayable in 20 years including 5
years of grace. Grants to the Government have been assumed to be onlent to
EELPA at 2Z interest charge while loans have been assumed to be onlent at
2% above actual rates, when such rates are 4% or less, and its actual rates
for lcaus with interest charges at 6Z and above.  Government onlending
term3 to EELPA assume repayment in 20 years including 3 to 5 years of
grace, depending on the construction period of the works financed.

Electricity Tariff Structure
Electricity tariffs, prior to the recently approved 75Z increase,
have been in force since October 1978 for the EELPA ICS and SCS and since
April 1974 for the Eritrea systems.   Tariff structure for all the power
systems does not incorporate time-of-day factors and is based on a
declining block rate.   The tariff  structure comprises six categories.
Details of the existing tariffs, prior to the recent increase, as well as
those proposed in Coopers & Lybrand's study of August, 1983 (para. 6.07)
are presented in the table on page 2 of this Annex.

ECONOMIC COST OF ELECTRICITY
Introduction
1.           Electricity tariffs should be set at levels that adequately
reflect the economic costs of supplying electricity to consumers as
measured by the Long-Run Marginal Costs (LRMC) of supply. However, LRMC
cannot be computed at this time because a long-term expansion program for
power has not been established for Ethiopia v               However, in order
to establish a yardstick to assess the overall appropriateness of tariffs,
the Average Incremental Costs (AIC), have been computed based on the
investments in the Reference Expansion Program (REP), and the respective
incremental operatings costs and projected sales over a 45 year time
horizon.
Definitions and Methodology
2.         The AIC for the entire EELPA system represents an average value
of the AICs for the various subsystems that make up the total power utility
complex.  These consist of the hydro-based EELPA ICS, the petroleum-fuel
based ICS in the Eritrea Region and some 60, predominantly diesel-powered
small isolated load centers.  This system-wide AIC does not represent the
specific AIC of any one of the system's components but can serve as a
global indication of the economic costs of producing electricity in the
short-term.
3.          It should be noted that the AICs as calculated do not strictly
represent AIC in their conventional definition because they include the
full costs of all ongoing and comiutted projects.   All other costs and
expenditures  reflect those projected  for the project and the overall
EELPA  reference  investment  program  between  FY85  and  FY92.    Initital
investments for projects which are not commissioned in the period were
excluded from the analysis.
4.          The AICs have been calculated as the ratio of Present Value of
Incremental Costs (Capital+0.&1M.+Customer+Fuel) to Present Value of
Incremental  Sales.    To  estimate  *iue  economic  penalty  incurred  from
constructing surplus generation capacity over the forecast period,
estimates were also made of the potential minimum average incremental costs
that would result if all excess power supplies could be sold as they become
available. Indirectly, this difference between the AICs based on projected
loads and on potential sales represent a measure of the potentially
beneficially effects of finding additional markets (e.g. exports) for these
surplus supplies.
Data and Assumptions
5.          The main data used for the estimates have been summarized in
tables  7.1.1 and  7.1.2.    Details  of  ,he underlying  assumptions  and



- 86 -               ANNEX 7.1

calculations can be found in the project files. The main assumptions used
are as follows:
(i) Price level: December 1984;
(1i) Shadow price of foreign exchange: 1.33;
(iii) Discount rates 10%, 11Z, 12%;
(iv) Period of analysis: 45 years;
(v) Life expectancy of hydro components: 50 years;
(-.i) Life expectancy of diesel components: 15 years;
(vii) O.&M. costs as a X of capital costs:
a) generation:             2% p.a.
b) transmission:           1* p.a.
c) distribution:           5% p.a
d) general plants:         2% pa.a
(viii) Marginal customer administrative costs: 50Z of current average
cuEtofer costs;
(ix) Demand growth: As per demand projections contained in Annexes,
4.2 through 4.5, until full capacity utilization is reached by
1997 or 1999 respectively; constant thereafter.
Average lucremenal Costs (AIC)
The estimated AICs for the overall EELPA system and for the main
EELPA ICS are as follows:
Birr/kWh (US$/kWh)
Discount Rate
10%            L1%             12%
Projected Actual AIC:
Total RELPA System            0.21 (0.10)    0.22 (0.11)    0.24 (0.12)
Main BELPA ICS                0.18 (0.08)    0.19 (0.09)    0.21 (0.10)
Projected Potential AIC:
Total EEiPA System            0.15 (0.07)    0.16 (0.08)    0.17 (0.08)
Main EELPA ICS                0.14 (0.07)    0.14 (0.07)    0.15 (0.07)
6.         The difference in costs between the overall LELPA system and the
main EELPA ICS by itself reflects the high costs of operating the diesel
based isolated load centers including the Eritrea Region ICS, which account
for only 23% of total sales. The difference between projected actual costs
and projected potential costs is a measure of the overinvestment in
generating capacity for the EELPA ICS systenm

ETHIOPIA
ENERGY PROJECT
ECONoMIC RATE OF RETURN OF ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR EXPANSION PROGRAM
Definition and Methodology
1.        The calculation of the Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of
the electric power components of the Power III/Energy I project has been
based on an analysis of the overall power sector investment program for the
period FY85 - FY92. The many power sub-components represent an integral
part of the overall sector investment program. A separate rate of return
for the sun of the project components by themselves has not been computed
because they cannot be linked to specific increments in output or sales.
Instead, two IEERRs have been computed for the overall expansion program,
estimated as the discount rate which equalizes the present value of the
total  incremental  capital,   operating   and  maintenance,  fuel   and
customer-administrative costs.   The first is for the EELPA system as a
whole (including all isolated load centers) the other for the main EELPA
Interconnected System (EELPA ICS) by itself.   Also, hypothetical IERR's
have been calculated for both systems, based on potential, rather than
projected sales.
2.         Projected tariffs, properly deflated to convert them into their
constant-cost equivalents, were used as a proxy for economic benefits.
Clearly, this understates the total economic benefits of the expansion
program since tariffs represent only the lower bound of users' willingness
to pay.   It was not possible to make reliable estimates of consumer
surplus.
3.        During the early years of the analysis a significant portion of
total electric energy sales will be made for use in industrial boilers.
Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was carried out which limited the value
of the electric energy projected to be consumed by boilers to the value of
the fuel oil displaced. The resulting change in the IERR was less than
O.2%. Details of this analysis can be found in the project files.
4.            The following methodology and assumptions were used in the
analysis:
(i) costs: based on December 1984 prices, excluding duties, taxes
and price escalation, but including physical contingencies;
(ii) foreign costs: converted to Ethiopian Birr at the official rate
of exchange of US$1.OO-Birr2.07 and then shadow-priced with a
coefficient  of 1.33 times the official rate of exchange;
(iii) tariffs: based on projected tariffs in current prices, deflated
by the estimated average annual rate of inflation of 9Z until
1991, constant thereafter;

(iv) a81 other assumptions and data are those used in the calculation
of AIC costs contained in Annex 7.1;
Cv) the basic data underLying the analyses have been shown in
Tables 7.2.1 and 7.2.2.
5. Results
Based on Projected Sales
EELPA
Total System         7%
EELPA ICS only        9%
Based on Potential Sales:
EELPA
Total System        12%
EELPA ICS only       13%
The results show that inspite of the projected tariffs increases the
minimum  internal Economic Rate of Return for the whole system  (which
includes the Eritrea Region and all isolated load centers) is relatively
modest at 7%; for the main EELPA Interconected System, the rate is 9%. The
difference to potential rates of return (which assume sales of all
available energy at average tariff levels) is substantial; for the total
EELPA system this potential rate is 12%, while for the EELPA ICS it is 13%.

66 kV Transmission Line Sabatta to Wolliso; Least-Cost Analysis
Methodology
1.       The proposed transmission line from Sabatta to Wolliso is one of
several 66 kV transmission lines that are designed to connect existing,
isolated load centers currently supplied from high-cost, low-reliability
diesel stations to the hydro-based main ICS. All are similar in length,
costs and load characteristics. Therefore, the analyais below is broadly
representative for all of them.   The alternatives to be evaluated are
continued diesel operation versus the installation of a transmission line.
However, because of the possibility of changing the timing of the
transmission line installation, a whole series of possible alternatives
exist.   The analysis, therefore, has been based on a comparison of a pure
transmission line alternative with a mixed diesel/transmission program
which would initially depend on diesel generation, but ultimately switch
over to a transmission line.  An exclusive, disel-only solution over the
planning horizon would cost over three times more than the other
alternatives.
Data and Basic Assumptions
2.        The basic data and assumptions have been shown in Table 7.3.1.
The load forecast assumes that the initial slow growth of 4Z p.a., which
reflects historical patterns, would be followed by a period of four years
of rapid expansion at a rate of 10%, as soon as more reliable power
supply becomes available.  Load growth is projected to fall later to a
long-term annual rate of 7%.
3.        The local cost share of the line would be relatively high because
it would be designed and installed by EELPA's own personnel.  Also, the
towers would consist of wooden poles, resulting in relatively low, overall
costs.
4.        The load forecast, as well as the capacity expansion program and
the cost estimates for the all-diesel alternatives are shown in Table
7.5.1. The cost data for the transmission-only alternatives are shown in
Table 7.5.2. Summary of present-value data for the transmission line only,
and the mixed diesel/transmission line sequences for the years 1991 to 2000
are shown in Table 7.5.3.
Results
5.        The results of the analysis, with discount rates of 10, 11 and 12
percent are shown in Table 7.5.3. In all cases, the tranamission line-only
alternative, with completiLon of the line by 1988, is the least-cost
solution by a significant margin. The present value of costs increase the
longer the completion of the line is postponed.

6.         Clearly, constructing the traasmission line, with completion by
1988, is the least-cost solution of supplying electricity to the Wollisso
Region.

66 kV Transmission Line Sabatta to Wolliso: Economic Analysis
The analysis of the IERR of completing the transmission line by
1988, compared to its various higher cost alternatives, is based on an
evaluation of the net savings resulting from choosing the lowest-cost
alternative. This methodology is justified because both the Government and
EELPA are commimtted to supply electricity to the region at country-wlde
uniform tariff levels.   Alternative costs, therefore, represent a valid
measure of economic benefits.  Two alternatives were analysed:   the firsc
delays completion of the line until 1991, while the second would do so
until 1995. In the former case, the resulting IERR, based on completion of
the line by 1988, is 32%, while in the second it amounts to 33%.  These
economic benefits are so large that even substantial variations in terms of
lower sales or increased costs are unlikely to change the favorable
outcome.    Economically,  completion  of  the  line  by  1988  is  clearly
justified. Summary data of the analysis are shown in in the table below.
