WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Republic of Honduras
Beneficiaries:       San Pedro Sula Municipal Corporation (MC)
National Autonomous Water and Sewerage Service (SANAA)
Amount:              US$19.6 million equivalent, including the capitalized
front-end fee
Terms:               Repayable in 20 years with 5 years of grace at standard
variable rate
Relending
Terms:             Same as to Borrower.  The foreign exchange risk would
be borne by the MC and SANAA
Cofinanciers:        Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) and the
Directorate of External Economic Relations (DREE) of
the French Ministry of Finance
Project
Description:       The proposed project consists of two main components,
the larger of which would provide improvements to the
water supply and drainage systems in San Pedro Sula and
technical assistance for institutional improvements for
DIMA, the autonomous operational division of the MC
responsible for providing water, sewerage and drainage
services.   This component would benefit approximately
521,000 persons by 1994.   The second component would
provide technical assistance to SANAA for support in
formulating sound financial policies at the national
level in the water supply sector, for developing an
action plan to improve its operational and financial
performance and to improve planning at the national
level
Risks:               The  San Pedro  Sula  component  of  the project  would
involve risk stemming from DIMA's planned assumption of
expanded responsibilities and the consequent pressure
on its financial resources; however, this risk has been



-v -
lessened by the advanced stage of project preparation,
the willingness of DIMA to use qualified consultants to
assist with project implementation and the redefinition
of DIMA's legal status, which will allow it to operate
on an independent basis and obtain needed tariff
increases on a timely basis.  The main risk associated
with  the  SANAA  component  involves  the  continued
commitment to providing a suitable environment at the
national level, in which the various water supply and
sewerage  companies  can  operate.        Achievement  of
ultimate objectives will also depend on application of
consultants' recommendations, where appropriate. These
would be addressed through close supervision and
dialogue with Government.

WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE SECTOR
Background
1.01       During 1970-1980 the population of urban areas in Honduras grew
rapidly, at rates averaging 5.5 percent per annum, compared with an overall
population growth rate of 3.3 percent per annum.   Assuming these rates
continue, total population would be nearly 7 million by the year 2000 with
the proportion of urban population increasing from 36 to over 50 percent.
During the same decade, San Pedro Sula experienced a particularly high
growth rate--7.0 percent per annum.   This rapid urbanization has placed
ever increasing strains on urban infrastructure and the ability of major
cities and towns to provide adequate services, including water supply and
sewerage.   This trend, combined with existing low service levels, which
place Honduras sixteenth out of 21 countries in the region in terms of
water supply services and fourteenth in terms of sewerage, underscores the
importance of a continued and intensified government effort to improve
access to modern, safe water and sewerage facilities.
1.02       Inadequate water supply and sanitation also play a major role in
low life expectancy (currently estimated at 59 years), and high infant
mortality (86 per thousand live births in 1980). These indicators contrast
with the average figures for middle-income Latin American and Caribbean
countries:   life expectancy, 63 years, and infant mortality rate, 67 per
thousand live births.   Although statistics  on causes of mortality and
morbidity are limited, available data suggest that diarrheal diseases,
caused by poor water supply and sanitation, are the most important causes
of death (20 percent of certified deaths).
Water Resources and Existing Sector Service Levels
1.03       Honduras has a relative abundance of good surface water sources,
and groundwater has therefore been tapped only rarely.   Few exploitable
sources of surface water remain, however, and greater use of groundwater
will be required in the future.  General studies of water quality carried
out by SANAA indicate that both disinfection and standard treatment for
turbidity during heavy rains would be required to produce acceptable pot-
able water from most sources. Spreading deforestation has been identified
as a contributing factor to deterioration in water quality and, unless
arrested, could become a serious problem.



-2-
1.04       Total population served with water supply through house connec-
tions in 1982 was 51 percent in urban areas and 13 percent in rural areas.
Quality of service is generally deficient owing to inadequate supplies,
poor system maintenance and frequent equipment breakdowns.   Sewerage ser-
vice in 1982 for the total population reached 15 percent by waterborne
systems and 19 percent by other systems. In urban areas, 49 percent of the
population was served, and in rural areas 26 percent was served, principal-
ly by latrines.
Institutional Framework
1.05       Water resources are developed under a 1927 National Water Law
which requires Government approval for all water development activities and
identifies priorities for different uses of water. New investments in the
sector are planned by the National Superior Council for Economic Planning
(CONSUPLANE) under the Ministry of the Presidency.
1.06       The National Autonomous Water and Sewerage Service (SANAA), the
most important institution in the sector, was established in 1961.  SANAA
has jurisdiction (subject to municipal consent) over water supply in all
communities with more than 500 inhabitants and over sanitary sewerage in
all towns with populations of over 20,000.   By 1982, SANAA was operating
the water, sewerage, and drainage systems in Tegucigalpa and 101 other
urban and eligible rural communities, serving about 700,000 persons with
piped water.  But SANAA's institutional constraints have limited the ful-
fillment of its legal mandate, as well as its effectiveness in providing
service. In practice, therefore, many communities have preferred to operate
their own systems.
1.07       San Pedro Sula and about 600 other towns and villages operate
their own water systems. Of these, 33 (including San Pedro Sula) also have
sewerage systems.   About 650,000 persons received piped water under such
systems in 1982.   In San Pedro Sula, water supply, sewerage and drainage
services are provided by the Municipal Water Division (DIMA) (paras 2.02-
2. It0}.
1.08         Responsibility for constructing water supply and sanitation
facilities in communities with fewer than 500 inhabitants and in "marginal
areas"-slums at the periphery of urban centers--rests with the Ministry of
Health (MH), through its Directorate of Environmental Sanitation (DSA).
Though some progress has been made in providing small communities with
lowr-cost systems (partly with assistance from USAID), DSA has been able to
help very few marginal areas.
1.C9      Most institutions in the sector, including SANAA, have low salary
scales and are unable to attract sufficient numbers of qualified profes-
sional staff, especially at top and middle management levels. This results



- 3 -
in inefficiencies of all kinds, including poor operation and maintenance of
systems and inadequate financial, physical and operational records.
Information systems in most cases fail to provide management with suf-
ficient information to assess performance or promptly identify and solve
problems.  Generally low tariffs and inadequate collection procedures have
necessitated dependence on subsidies from the Central Government (in the
case of SANAA) or from municipalities.
Government Policy Framework and Objectives
1.10      Government policy in the sector consists largely of setting goals
for levels of service, translated into investments necessary to achieve
them.   The Honduran authorities, with technical assistance from the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) and the German Society for Technical
Cooperation, began work in 1982 on a national water supply and sanitation
plan.  A sector analysis completed under this plan in May 1982  recommended
goals for piped water and sewerage coverage of 90 percent and 40 percent
respectively by 1990.  Total investment to meet these goals was estimated
at US$326 million (an average of US$47 million per year) in constant
January 1984 prices. To achieve this goal, annual expenditures would have
to triple, an unrealistic target given current budget constraints. Never-
theless, the results of the study underscore the need for investment in the
sector to provide ar adequate level of safe water to the population.
1.11      No cost recovery policies (and therefore no tariff policies) have
been established for the sector.  Although water authorities are expected
to cover operating costs, they are rarely expected to contribute to their
investments or to service their debts.   Shortfalls are made up by Central
or Municipal Government transfers.
1.12       Although SANAA's legal mandate gives it the authority to set its
tariffs as necessary, in practice, tariffs are changed only with approval
of the President of the Republic. Tariffs charged by independent municipal
water authorities must be approved by the Ministry of Government and Just-
ice as part of the municipal budget approval process. Tariffs for use of
rural water systems constructed by the MH are set by community boards.
Efforts  to develop a consistent  tariff policy have begun.   The policy
would take into account the need to reflect through tariff levels the econ-
omic cost of water use, while providing some subsidy to the poorest seg-
ments of the population.
Sector Financing
1.13       In the past, about 45 percent of total investment in the sector
has been financed with external assistance, principally from IDB and
USAID.  The remaining 55 percent has been financed mainly by the Central
Government and, in some cases, by municipalities.   Continued substantial
external support can be expected in the future, but the Central Govern-
ment's increasing financial constraints are forcing a reduction in Govern-
ment subsidies and support for most sectors, including water supply.  Such



decreases in Government transfers are now requiring both SANAA and muni-
cipal governments to confront the necessity of establishing and implement-
ing adequate cost recovery policies in order to generate internally more of
the funds necessary to carry out investments planned to improve--or even
sustain--the level of service provided.
Bank Strategy
1>14      These changing circumstances have made apparent the need not only
for additional external funding, but also for technical assistance to help
sector agencies to achieve financial self-sufficiency.  This is an area on
which other aid agencies with active programs in the sector have not and do
not plan to concentrate significant effort.   The Bank's strategy,  there-
fore, is to assist institutions in the sector to achieve the goal of finan-
cial viability, while they continue to improve the level of service which
they provide.  Although the Bank has not previously lent for water supply
in Honduras, such lending has been discussed periodically since 1978, and
extensive dialogue has been conducted in the course of sector work and
project preparation.   The proposed loan would represent the first step in
implementing Bank strategy by providing both financial and technical
assistance for expansion of the water supply system of San Pedro Sula,
while also providing technical assistance to strengthen DIMA's financial
and operational performance and to determine the specific actions necessary
to achieve similar goals in SANAA.   This work with SANAA would lay the
foundation, through formulation of a national policy framework, for
possible future operations at the national level.   Such operations would
provide a vehicle for assistance to SANAA in implementing measures recom-
mended as a result of the work to be carried out under the proposed
project.   The measures  could include  revision of tariff  structures  and
overall cost recovery policies, as well as improvements in operational
efficiency.
II. THE BORROWER AND IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
General
2.01       The Borrower will be the Republic of Honduras which in turn will
pass the loan proceeds on to the implementing agencies, the San Pedro Sula
Municipal Corporation (MC) and SANAA, as subsidiary loans. The MC, through
DIMA, will carry out the San Pedro Sula component of the project and, to
this effect, will enter into a project agreement with the Bank. A separate
project agreement will be drawn up with SANAA.   The following paragraphs
highlight the institutional capabilities of DIMA and SANAA.
Institutional Arrangement and Organization of DIMA1/
2.02        During project identification, DIMA's legal framework was found
to be inadequate for a utility serving a rapidly growing city of over
300,000 inhabitants.   As a division of the MC, DIMA lacked the operating

autonomy  it needed  to carry  out  its functions  efficiently.   Extensive
discussions with DIMA's management and the MC during project preparation
focused on the appropriate degree of autonomy for DIMA within the municipal
government and the sector.  The agreed-upon solution was to redefine DIMA
as  an  autonomous  operating  division  of  the  MC.    To  accomplish  this
redefinition, a law was approved by the National Congress allowing
municipalities  to  establish  autonomous  operating  divisions  for  the
provision of municipal services. Within this framework, the MC has issued
an act (Acuerdo Municipal) approved by the Departmental Council, which
defines  the  authority  and  guidelines  for  DIMA's  operation  as  such  a
division.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the MC would
reorganize DIMA in accordance with the provisions of the Acuerdo Municipal
and submit to the Bank the starting balance sheet for DIMA prepared by
external auditors by not later than September 30, 1984.  Assurances were
also obtained that DIMA would continue to appoint external auditors
acceptable to the Bank to make subsequent annual external audits.  A copy
of the reports on these external audits is to be furnished to the Bank,
along with comments on compliance with Bank loan covenants, by not later
than April 30 of each year.
2.03       DIMA will have a seven-member board of directors chaired by the
Mayor of San Pedro Sula and comprising representatives of the MC, the
Ministry of Finance,  the Ministry of Health and the consumers.   Its new
status will give DIMA sufficient operational autonomy to carry out all mea-
sures required under the project; it will allow DIMA to hire and fire, set
its own personnel policies, establish its own investment plans and implem-
ent necessary tariff increases.  DIMA will have separate bank accounts, as
well as separate accounting and control systems.  DIMA's new legal status
will not, however, provide it with its own legal personality.  Thus, DIMA
would not be able to borrow on its own behalf. To achieve such full finan-
cial autonomy would have required the creation of a separate corporation --
an alternative which was not acceptable to the Honduran Government and
which would have been contrary to the Bank's objective of supporting the
Government by avoiding the formation of new autonomous entities with access
to the Central Government's guarantee for their debts.
2.04       DIMA's current organizational structure is presented in Annex 1.
Although it is adequate to permit DIMA to begin project implementation, the
structure needs strengthening to implement improved planning, management
and operating systems.  The project will support introduction of organiza-
tional changes recommended by Norplan (Norway), which prepared the proj-
ect.  These are reflected in the modified organization chart presented in
Annex 2.
2.05      DIMA's present general manager is a qualified civil engineer with
extensive experience.  Most of DIMA's key managerial personnel demonstrate
potential,  but lack technical expertise and experience.   DIMA's present
personnel unit and its policies and practices need to be strengthened. Low
salaries have led to high staff turnover, particularly among senior level



- 6 -
employees,  and difficulties in recruiting qualified replacements.   Under
its new institutional setup, DIMA will have the authority to pay competi-
tive wages to attract and retain capable personnel.
2.06       In May 1983, DIMA's permanent and contracted staff totalled 268
employees, or 10.6 employees per thousand water connections. This ratio is
high compared with other water companies in Latin America.  Unskilled and
semi-skilled job positions are overstaffed, but those requiring highly
skilled personnel are understaffed.   By concentrating its hiring in the
latter category, DIMA should be able to operate with 9.0 employees per
thousand water connections by 1988 as shown in the targets included in the
proDject monitoring indicators (Annex 3 and para. 4.21).
2.07      DIMA's meter reading and computerized billing system for its reg-
ular water customers is functioning adequately; however, billing procedures
for other services and for customers served by water systems DIMA acquired
from private developers are inadequate to ensure full collection.   DIMA
also lacks a written policy for adjusting meter readings brought to its at-
tention by dissatisfied customers.   DIMA's current collection arrangement
is inefficient.   Customer bills may be paid only at DIMA headquarters.
DIiA is exploring the possibility of using commercial banks as collection
agents. Late payments are automatically postponed to the next billing per-
iod without financial penalty. DIMA is currently attempting to improve its
collection performance by implementing a number of measures, including sys-
temiatiac water shut-off and financial penalties for delays in two consecu-
tive payments, and reductions of the meter-reading and billing cycles to
one month.
2.08       With the assistance of consultants, DINA has implemented an ac-
counting system which is performing satisfactorily.   Nevertheless, addit-
ional technical assistance, particularly in the areas of cost accounting,
budgeting, financial planning and control is needed.  At appraisal, DIMA's
computer hardware, software and support services were furnished by the MC.
Arrangements have since been made for DIMA to acquire from the MC, for
prompt installation, a computer to handle DIMA's billing and accounting re-
sponsibilities.   DIMA needs to recruit its own supervisory and technical
staff to operate the computer.   To strengthen DIMA's analytical and eng-
ineering capabilities, the proposed loan would include funding for the pur-
chase of microcomputer, related accessories and software.
2.09      In the past, internal auditing was weak, mainly because of a lack
of accounting and control procedures. These deficiencies were addressed by
local consultants implementing the new accounting system, but additional
assistance is needed to further upgrade the internal auditing function.
Currently, DIMA carries no insurance and an evaluation of its insurance
needs and a program for addressing them is lacking.   DIMA's fixed assets
were revalued as part of project preparation, but procedures need to be
established to upgrade this revaluation annually (para. 4.18).



- 7 -
2.10       An action plan has been prepared to address the above institu-
tional deficiencies.  The plan includes the following:   reorganization of
DIMA; hiring of a consultant to serve as manager for finance, accounting
and commercial operations; hiring of a consultant to serve as manager for
engineering and operations; hiring of a human resource manager; carrying
out of a personnel study; preparation of a training program; establishment
of a training unit; employment of qualified data processing staff; and an
evaluation of DIMA's insurance needs and implementation of a program to
address these needs.   A more detailed description of this action plan,
along with an implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4. During negotia-
tions, it was agreed that DIMA would implement the proposed action plan in
accordance with the schedule in Annex 4.   Technical assistance will be
provided under the project to help implement the action plan (para. 3.07).
Institutional Arrangement and Organization of SANAA
2.11        SANAA is an autonomous public entity headed by a General Man-
ager. Its Board of Directors is chaired by the Minister of Health and in-
cludes four other government, private sector and municipal represent-
atives. SANAA lacks qualified, trained staff particularly at the upper and
middle management levels.   Staff turnover is high and salaries are low.
With a total of 1,220 employees, SANAA's ratio of employees per thousand
water connections is 14, which is high compared to similar institutions in
the  Region.    SANAA's  information  system  fails  to  provide  adequate
managerial  information  to  assess  performance.    While  some  priiority
investments have been identified, a realistic investment program has not
been prepared.    Low  tariffs and inadequate  collection procedures have
necessitated dependence on subsidies from the Central Government.  Tariffs
in Tegucilgalpa were raised substantailly in 1983; however, failure to
improve meter coverage and collection procedures may result in an
unsatisfactory  increase  in  revenues  despite  the  higher  tariffs.    An
assessment of SANAA and the development of an action plan for institutional
strengthening similar to the plan for DIMA is included in the project
(para. 3.10).
III. THE PROJECT
General
3.01      The project consists of two components, the larger providing for
enhancements of the San Pedro Sula water supply and drainage systems and
technical assistance for institutional improvement.  The smaller component
consists of technical assistance to strengthen SANAA and develop a sector
strategy.   The San Pedro Sula component will be implemented by the MC
through DIMA. SANAA will implement the SANAA component.
Project Origin
3.02      In February 1981, the Government requested a Bank project mission
to investigate lending opportunities in the water sector and specifically
mentioned the San Pedro Sula project as a possibility.   The Bank sent a



- 8 -
World Bank/PAHO Cooperative Program reconnaissance mission to Honduras in
May 1981. During this mission, San Pedro Sula was identified as the area
that would benefit most from a Bank-assisted project in the sector, as it
provided an opportunity to support the institutional development of DIMA,
which was essential to the efficient growth of the country's main comr
mercial and industrial center.
3.03      With  funding from the Norwegian Government, project preparation
was undertaken by Norplan (Norway), who reviewed the work of earlier con-
sultants and recommended revisions. DIMA has signed an agreement with the
same consultants to make the revisions and is negotiating a contract with
them for other consulting services (para. 3.19). Throughout project prep-
aration and appraisal, there was intensive discussion of DIMA's institu-
tional development and financial policies, resulting in the measures sum-
marized in Chapters 2 and 4.
3.04         During its sector and project identification work, the Bank
investigated the possibility of providing assistance for projects to be
carried  out  by  SANAA.   Investment  possibilities  had not  been  clearly
defined, however, and there was insufficient interest on SANAA's part in
addressing its organizational and operational weaknesses. During appraisal
of the San Pedro Sula component, the Government requested Bank assistance
in strengthening SANAA, with the objective of increasing its financial
self-sufficiency, and with a view toward possible future assistance for
investments through SANAA. The Bank, in consultation with SANAA officials,
prepared terms of reference for technical assistance to overcome SANAA's
weaknesses.
Project Objectives
3.05      At the municipal level, the project aims at (a) making DIMA tech-
nically sound and financially independent by strengthening its management,
operations and finances; (b) eliminating water shortages affecting a major-
ity of the population (especially the urban poor) of San Pedro Sula through
expansion of the water supply system; (c) providing water service to the
growing population of the SPSUA, estimated to reach 625,000 by 1994
through expansion of the distribution system; (d) providing water supply
and sewerage service to poor residents through installation of service
connections in low-income neighborhoods; and (e) reducing flooding (which
mainly affects poor neighborhoods) through expansion of the stormwater
drainage system.   At  the national level,  the project includes a small
technical assistance component to help SANAA to develop an action plan to
meet its statutory and operational objectives, while reducing its reliance
on Central Government subsidies.
San Pedro Sula Component Description
3.06       Setting.  San Pedro Sula is the second largest city in Honduras
(mid-1982 population of 293,000) and its industrial center.   In 1982, the
MC--owned water system served an estimated 74% of the population, with pri-
vate systems bringing the total population served to 91%.   The sewage



- 9 -
system served an estimated 72% of the population in 1982.   The drainage
system serves the central commercial district and some of the higher-valued
residential areas.   Although the percentage of people with access to the
water system is high, water supplies are inadequate resulting in periodic
severe shortages  and shutoffs.   Maintenance has been so poor that the
capacities of all the systems have actually decreased in recent years.
Although all three systems require reinforcement and rehabilitation, the
water supply and drainage systems have priority.   Population projections,
which are the basis for project design,  are included in Annex 5.   The
existing water and drainage systems are described in Annex 6.
3.07      Content.  The San Pedro Sula component, (Parts A through G of the
project) includes the construction of works to improve the MC-owned water
supply and drainage systems serving the San Pedro Sula Urban Area (SPSUA)
and technical assistance for the institutional improvement of DIMA.   The
San Pedro Sula component is described in detail in Annex 7 and summarized
below:
Part A:   Water Supply Improvements
1.        Provision of technical assistance to evaluate aquifer capacity
and design deep wells.
2.        Construction of about 18 wells and about 3 chlorination stations
and rehabilitation of about 7 wells.
Part B:   Water Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvements
1.        Rehabilitation of 2 raw water intakes and their respective trans-
mission mains.
2.        Construction of about 46 km of primary distribution mains, and 2
booster pump stations.
3.        Construction of 2 distribution storage reservoirs with a combined
capacity of about 30,000 m3.
Part C:   Secondary Water and Sewerage Networks and Service Connections
1.        Construction of about 15 km of secondary water distribution mains
and about 10 km of secondary sewerage collectors in low-income
neighborhoods of the SPSUA.
2.        Repair or replacement of defective secondary water distribution
mains.
3.        Installation of about 25 standpipes,  about 5,000 water service
connections and about 4,000 sewerage service connections in low-
income neighborhoods of the SPSUA.



- 10 -
4.        Installation of 24,000 meters and 6 master meters.
Part D:   Stormwater Drainage Improvements
Construction of about 3 km of stormwater drainage interceptors.
Part E:   Leak Detection and Mapping of the Water Distribution System
1.        Acquisition and utilization of equipment for leak detection.
2,,       Provision of technical assistance to prepare water distribution
system maps, set up a systematic leak detection program and
train local staff.
Part F:   Institutional and Operational Improvement of DIMA
1,,       Provision of technical assistance  to carry out an action plan
(para. 2.10) for the institutional improvement of DIMA.
2.        Acquisition and utilization of operation and maintenance equip-
ment, vehicles, spare parts, materials and a microcomputer.
Part G:   Sugarcane Irrigation Study
Provision of technical assistance to evaluate health hazards
associated with the continued use of polluted Rio Sauce water and
to prepare a plan of action to alleviate these health hazards.
3.08      The primary distribution supply and storage improvements included
in the project are sufficient to meet the 1994 projected maximum day demand
within the existing SPSUA boundaries.  The majority of new secondary water
and sewerage networks will be constructed by developers.   DIMA will con-
struct secondary water and sewerage networks and install service connec-
tiDns only in established low-income neighborhoods without services.
3.09       The meters financed under Part C of the project will be used to
achieve 100% metering of existing connections by December 1985 (para. 4.08)
and provide meters for new service connections to be added to the system
during project implementation. The installation of operating meters on all
service connections will help DIMA meet its target of 30% unaccounted-for
water (Annex 3 and para. 4.21) and increase its revenues.
SANAA Component Description
3.]0        The SANAA component (Part H of the project) includes technical
assistance to strengthen SANAA's financial and operational management and
improve its operations, principally in Tegucigalpa. The SANAA component is
described in detail in Annex 8 and summarized below:



- 11 -
Part H:   Strengthening of SANAA
1.        Development of a plan of action to improve its management,
operating, accounting and commercial procedures.
2.        Formulation of financial policies for the water supply and
sewerage sector.
3.        Assessment of national water supply and sewerage sector
investment needs and priorities.
4.        Evaluation and implementation of SANAA's training program.
5.        Preparation and implementation of a program to reduce water
losses in Tegucigalpa.
6.        Preparation of a specific project designed to address the needs
and priorities identified in the assessment of investment needs.
Project Cost
3.11        The project cost, excluding interest during construction,  is
estimated at US$33.35 million.   No allowance is included for duties and
taxes since purchases by the MC and SANAA are tax exempt. Foreign exchange
costs would amount to about US$21.50 million. Interest on the Bank and CDC
loans during project implementation, estimated at US$8.89 million, would be
capitalized.    Foreign cost,  including  interest  during  construction,  is
expected to equal 72% of total financial cost.  The project cost estimate
is summarized in Table 3.1 on the following page.  Detailed cost estimates
of each component are included in Annex 9.

3.12       Consultant services are estimated at US$5.86 million for a total
of 815 man-months, of which 765 are professional and technical staff and
150 are  support  staff.    The  consulting  costs  for the San Pedro Sula
component are US$5.10 million (734 man-months of technical and support
staff).  Consultants for the SANAA Component will cost US$0.75 million (81
man-months  of  technical  and  support  staff).    The  largest  consulting
contract  would  be  for  construction  supervision  of  the  San Pedro Sula
component (US$2.00 million)  (para. 3.19).   Detailed consultant costs and
man-month estimates for the project are presented in Annex 9.
3.13      Baseline construction costs for the San Pedro Sula component were
prepared by consultants (para. 3.03) in November 1982 and were updated to
January 1984 price levels.  The SANAA component cost estimate was prepared
by the appraisal mission and reflects January 1984 price levels. An allow-
ance of 10% was added to base costs for physical contingencies.   Local
price contingencies are about 33% and foreign price contingencies are about
27% of respective base costs. A discussion of the basis for the cost esti-
mates is included in Annex 9.
Project Financing
3.14        Total financing required for the project,  including interest
during construction and the front-end fee on the proposed Bank loan, is
US$42.24 million.  Of this amount, US$41.06 million is for the San Pedro
Sula component and US$1.18 million is for the SANAA component.  The Bank
loan of US$19.6 million will provide 48% of the total financing
requirements of the San Pedro Sula component and 51% of the financing
requirement  of  the  SANAA  component.    The  remainder  will  be  financed
according to the plan shown in Table 3.2.

3.15        For the San Pedro Sula component, CDC will provide a loan of
US$11.0 million to finance the foreign and some of the local costs of the
water distribution and storage construction (Part B of the project).  The
Bank Loan will finance the foreign cost of the water supply and stormwater
drainage construction and equipment acquisition for Parts A, C, D, E, F and
G of the project and consulting services for all parts including Part B.
DIMA's internal cash generation will contribute US$10.78 million for local
costs.  The NTorwegian Government has contributed US$300,000 to update the
bidding documents. The CDC loan will be provided on terms similar to those
of the Bank Loan, but with a fixed interest rate of 11.0% and no front-end
fee. For the SANAA component, the Bank Loan will finance the foreign cost
of consultants for Parts Hi., H2. and H3. of the Project with SANAA
providing funds for the local cost. The French Government through its
Directorate of External Economic Relations (DREE) has provided a grant of
US$500,000 which will cover 100% of the cost of consultants for Parts
H4.,H5. and H6.   Execution and delivery of the CDC loan contract and
satisfaction of the conditions of effectiveness of the contract are
conditions of effectiveness for the Bank Loan.  A detailed financing plan
is presented in Annex 10.
3.16       The Bank and CDC will finance interest during construction and
other charges on their respective loans.   The financing of interest is
designed to help alleviate the heavy impact the project will have on DIMA's
finances prior to the expected realization of increased revenues.
3.17       The proceeds of the Bank and CDC loans will be loaned to the MC
and SANAA on the same terms and conditions as those given to the Govern-
ment. The exchange risk will be borne by the MC and SANAA. The terms of
the loans will be spelled out in the subsidiary loan agreements between the
Government and the two implementing agencies.   The subsidiary agreements
will also specify, inter alia, the specific mechanisms to be established
for repayment. Execution of the subsidiary loan agreements is a condition
of effectiveness.
San Pedro Sula Component Implementation
3.18      DIMA will be responsible for implementing the San Pedro Sula com-
ponent. Under its present organization, DIMA is capable of starting pro-
ject implementation as scheduled in 1984.  To improve its efficiency and
achieve its goals of financial self-sufficiency, DIMA will be restructured
along the lines indicated in paras. 2.02-2.04. DIMA's Chief Engineer will
serve as project manager with the support of consultants.
3.19      The MC has selected Norplan to carry out the groundwater investi-
gations and supervise all construction work.  Norplan has had a long and
satisfactory relationship with the MC.   The leak detection and mapping
program (Part E of the project) will be implemented by a consulting firm to
be selected competitively.   The consultant will manage this program, and
DIMA will provide most of the manpower for the detection and mapping work.
Technical assistance for the institutional improvement action plan in Part



- 16 -
schedule is included in Annex 11.  Annex 12 includes a list of key dates
for the bidding and award of the major contracts.   All works are to be
completed by December 31, 1990.
3.20        All steps necessary to permit immediate initiation of project
execution have been taken.  Land required for the reservoirs and booster
pumping stations has already been purchased. Most of the well sites will
be located on land already owned by the MC.  Purchase of privately owned
land for wells is not expected to be a problem.
3t21       The Bank will supervise all parts of the San Pedro Sula project
component, including those parts to be financed by disbursements from the
CDC loan (paras. 3.15 and 3.28).  A Memorandum of Understanding with the
CDC will include arrangements for the exchange of information and reports.
SANAA Component Implementation
3.22       A project manager, appointed from SANAA's planning department,
will carry out all the component's administrative functions.  The proposed
technical assistance program will be carried out by consultants acceptable
to the Bank.   A steering committee under the coordination of SANAA's
General Manager and comprising representatives of the Ministries of Health,
of Government and Justice, of Natural Resources (Division of Water Re-
sources) and of Finance, and CONSUPLANE will be responsible for reviewing
the work of the consultants and making policy decisions.   SANAA agreed
during negotiations that it would appoint a project manager whose
experience, qualifications and terms and conditions of employment are
satisfactory to the Bank and the steering committee not later than
September 30, 1984.
3.23      The Bank will supervise all parts of the SANAA project component,
including the part to be financed by the French DREE grant (paras. 3.15 and
3.29).    A  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  the  DREE  will  include
arrangements for the exchange of information and reports.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.24       Since the early 1920s, San Pedro Sula has discharged sewage at
many points into the Rio Sauce, which forms the eastern boundary of the
city. At present, Rio Sauce water downstream of the city is about 90 per-
cent raw sewage during the dry season, when it is extracted for irrigation
of sugarcane fields.  So far, no health problems have been linked to this
practice, but the threat to public health which it represents is recognized
by the MC and DIMA.  By increasing the water supply of the SPSUA, the proj-
ect will increase sewage flows discharged into the river.   Without the
project, however, an increasing number of poor immigrants to the city might
resort to drawing water for home use from the river.   Consultants will
carry out a study to identify the health hazards associated with the use of
river water for irrigation, and to look for alternative solutions to this
problem under Part G of the project (para. 3.07). DIMA will be responsible
for managing the study and implementing the recommendations.   Assurances



- 17 -
were obtained during negotiations that the MC, through DIMA, would complete
the study by December 31, 1987, and would agree with the Bank on a plan of
action based on the study's recommendations and a timetable for implement-
ing it.
Procurement
3.25       Civil works contracts larger than US$500,000 (totalling US$5.5
million) and materials and equipment in packages larger than US$50,000
(totalling US$1.3 million) will be procured through international competi-
tive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines.   Procurement of
civil works and goods financed by CDC (US$8.7 million) will be in accord-
ance with  their  guidelines  for  procurement  which  are  similar  to  the
Bank's. Other goods and civil works totalling US$0.5 million and US$1.0
million,  respectively, will be procured under local competitive bidding
procedures satisfactory to the Bank.  Consulting services financed all or
in part by proceeds from the Bank Loan will be procured in accordance with
Bank  guidelines  for  consultant  selection.    Consulting  services  to  be
financed with French grant funds are to be provided by a French firm
selected  by  the  French  Government.        No  force  account  works  are
anticipated. Procurement documentation for all bidding packages for civil
works estimated to cost over US$1.0 million and bidding packages for
materials  and equipment over US$100,000 will be subject  to prior Bank
review.  This will result in a coverage of about 90% of the total estimated
value of civil works contracts and about 70% of materials and equipment
contracts.  The balance of contracts will be subject to random review by
the Bank after contract award.
3.26         All equipment supply contracts are expected to be awarded to
foreign manufacturers. The three largest civil works contracts are expect-
ed to be awarded to foreign contractors.  The other four civil works con-
tracts are within the capacity of the local construction industry, and
could go to either local or foreign contractors.  All the consulting con-
tracts are expected to be awarded to foreign firms in joint venture with
local firms. Domestic or regional preference will not be given to local or
regional suppliers. A list of major contracts expected to be awarded and
the value of each is included in Annex 12.
Disbursements
3.27      The Bank will disburse as follows:
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures
for materials and equipment under Parts A, C, D, E, F and G
of the project.
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures and 25% of local expenditures
for civil works for Parts A, C and D of the project.



- 18 -
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures and 70% of local expenditures
for consultants' services under Parts A through H of the
project.
(d) Amounts due for the front-end and commitment fees and inter-
est during the construction period.
3.28          Disbursements  will  be supported  by standard  documentation.
Reimbursement  through  statement  of  expenditure  will  be  allowed  for
contracts in the amount of US$20,000 equivalent  or less.   The proposed
allocation of Loan proceeds is shown in Annex 13.  Proceeds allocated to
the San Pedro Sula component will not  be transferable  to the national
component and vice versa.  The Loan closing date will be June 30, 1991, six
months following project completion.         The disbursement  period will be
seven years. Although shorter than the average disbursement period for the
sector in the region (about eight years), this disbursement period is
reasonable considering the simplicity of the project and the advanced stage
of project preparation.   In addition, the average disbursement period for
all  Bank  loans  to Honduras  is  seven years.   A  schedule  of  expected
disbursements by quarter is presented in Annex 14.
3.29        The CDC will disburse for materials, equipment and civil works
under  Part  B of  the  project.    The DREE will  disburse  for consulting
services under Parts H4., H5. and H6. of the project.  There would, be no
joint  financing of contracts  or project components with the CDC or the
DREE.
Retroactive Financing
3.30       Following appraisal, DIMA contracted the construction of three
project wells and consulting services for updating bidding documents and
accounting  improvements.    The wells  will  permit  DIMA  to  increase  the
Municipality's water supply which in turn should facilitate the implementa-
tion of proposed tariff increases.   Therefore,  retroactive  financing of
contracts valued at up to  US$0.4 million to cover expenditures for wells
and consulting services contracted after May 16, 1983, is provided.
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
General
4.01       The financial analysis is limited to DIMA, the executing agency
for the San Pedro Sula component.  Since the MC will have ultimate respon-
sibility for repaying the Bank Loan (para 2.01), a brief discussion of the
MC's financial obligations under the Loan Agreement is provided.
DIMA's Past and Current Financial Performance
4.02        Summary income and cash flow data, extracted from DIMA's finan-
cial statements for 1981-83 (Annex 15), are shown in Table 4.1.

4.03       DIMA's financial performance in 1981 and 1982 was unsatisfactory
with operating losses in both years.  This was largely the result of low
sales due to production constraints, and to inadequate tariffs.  DIMA was
able to cover debt service requirements from internal cash generation in
1982, but cash reserves had to be drawn down to meet half of its investment
costs, thus reducing these reserves to L 0.35 million at year end.
Although DIMA's financial position in 1983 was tight, the outlook for 1984
and beyond is more promising (para. 4.15).
DIMA's Revenues
4.04      DIMA's revenues derive mainly from collections for water and sew-
erage  services  from  customers  in the  SPSUA.   Other  sources  of income
include connection fees and collections from customers served by rural
water schemes.
4.05       With the assistance of consultants for project preparation, DIMA
implemented a new tariff structure in May 1983.  The new structure raised
the  average  water  tariff  from  L  0.20/m3  to  L  0.24/m3  (US$0.12/m3),
increased sewerage charges to 30% of water billed and boosted substantially
connection fees and other related charges.
4.06         Under the new tariff structure, customers in the SPSUA are
divided into three categories: (a) residential, commercial and government;
(b) industrial; and (c) low-income residential.  Rural customers are sub-
ject to a separate tariff schedule, based on a flat monthly fee that varies



- 20 -
depending  on  type  of water  use,  connection  size  and  location.    This
schedule makes water and sewerage services affordable by the poor. Monthly
charges are designed to enable DIMA to generate sufficient revenues to meet
all its operating costs, including depreciation and debt service, satisfy
its working capital needs and contribute necessary counterpart funds to its
investment program.
4.07        All metered customers, regardless of their category, must pay
progressive consumption tariffs which encourage water conservation.  There
is no minimum consumption block; charges are based on actual consumption.
All customers, except those in low-income dwellings, are required to pay
monthly fixed fees which vary from L 3.25 to L 15.50, depending on con-
nection size.
4.08       At present, unmetered connections and connections with non-work-
ing meters (40% of total) are subject to flat monthly fees which average
40% below the average water tariff for metered connections.  To eliminate
this distortion, reduce unaccounted-for water and improve DIMA's revenues,
the loan will provide funds to assist DIMA in achieving full metering by
1985 (para. 3.09).  The completion of a program to install 9,000 meters,
which resulted in 60% meter coverage (15,000 working meters in total), was
a condition of negotiations.  During negotiations, it was agreed that, by
September 30, 1984, DIMA would: (a) prepare and furnish to the Bank a
revised tariff policy for consumers with non-working meters based on a
method which takes into account consumption during previous months; and (b)
implement this policy no later than December 31, 1984.
4.09      DIMA has the authority to approve and register private wells, but
its registration records are incomplete, and its procedures for collecting
registration fees are inadequate.   DIMA agreed at negotiations  that it
would update its records for private wells and strengthen its registration
fee collection procedures by no later than June 30, 1985.
4.10       Other sources of revenue for DIMA will be developed under the
project.  To recover the cost of secondary networks and service connections
(Part C of the project), during negotiations DIMA agreed that they would
complete development of a cost recovery program for the installation of
secondary networks and service connections through a deferred payment plan
not later than December 31, 1985 and implement the program not later than
June 30, 1986.  DIMA has no special method of collecting for the drainage
services  it provides.   During negotiations,  DIMA agreed  that it would
complete by September 30, 1984, a mechanism to recover its operating,
maintenance and investment  costs for providing drainage services.   DIMA
also agreed that they would implement this mechanism by not later than
March 31, 1985.
DIMA's Financing Plan and Investment Program
4.11       During the project execution period (1983-90), DIMA plans total
investments of US$50.4 million (Table 4.2 and Annex 15).   About US$41.1
million will be invested under the Bank-assisted project, while the remain-
ing funds (US$9.3 million) will be used to complete an ongoing project to
improve water systems in villages under the MC's jurisdiction  (Annex 6),
to install new connections within the SPSUA and expand secondary water dis-
tribution networks and sewerage and drainage collection systems (para.

3.08). External financing under the project (US$30.3 million) will provide
60 percent of total requirements, and another US$1.6 million of external
financing for ongoing projects will provide an additional 3 percent.
Customer contributions (US$6.5 million) are estimated to cover 13 percent
of total requirements during the period. The remaining US$12.0 million (24
percent) will have to be provided by DIMA from its internal cash
generation.
4.12       The investment program described above represents a substantial
increase over the level of investments made by DIMA in the past and will
require a significant increase in DIMA's contribution from internal cash
generation.   Both DIMA and the MC appreciate this and have already taken
measures to increase DIMA's internal cash generation.   These measures in-
clude the May 1983 tariff increase and a substantial expansion during 1983
of DIMA's meter coverage.   These  two measures are expected to increase
DIMA's revenues by 19 percent in 1983 and 38 percent in 1984.  Under the
loan, financial and operational covenants have been established to help
ensure that DIMA will generate sufficient funds internally to carry out its
planned investment program.
DIMA's Financial Prospects
4.13       Financial projections for DIMA for 1983-90 are predicated on the
basis of DIMA generating internally sufficient cash to cover its operating
costs, debt service obligations, working capital needs and a US$12.0 mil-
lion contribution to its investment plan (para 4.10). In order to do this,
DIMA must complete its metering program and raise its average water tariff
in real terms from US$0.12/m3 in 1983 to US$0.20/m3 in 1990.   The 1990
average water tariff would be 91% of the long-run average incremental cost
of water for DIMA (para 5.06).
4.14      In general, operating expenses have been projected to increase in
proportion with inflation and certain variable operational factors (Annex
15).   Projected operating costs after 1983 include provisions for power
costs which were previously paid for by the MC.  Unaccounted-for water is
expected to be reduced gradually from 57% in 1983 to 30% in 1990, as a
result of the metering and leak detection programs under the project.
4.15      Selected data on DIMA's projected income statement and key finan-
cial indicators for 1984-90 are shown in Table 4.3.  Financial statements
for 1983-90, along with the assumptions on which they are based, are pre-
sented in Annex 15. DIMA's financial performance is projected to show con-
siderable improvement during the project implementation period.   At the
proposed tariff levels, DIMA's revenues are expected to climb from L 4.6
million in 1984 to L 17.5 million in 1990. The operating ratio should drop
from a 1984 projected level of 91% in 1984 to 66% in 1990.  The debt-ser-
vice ratio should increase from an estimated 3.9 in 1984 to a high of 9.6
in 1988 and drop to 1.8 in 1990. The drop in 1990 reflects the first semi-
annual amortization payments on both the IBRD and CDC loans in 1989.

Accounts of MC and DIMA
4.16      During negotiations, the MC agreed that it would: (a) furnish to
the Bank by September 30, 1984 a plan to pay DIMA for its outstanding bills
for water supply, sewerage and drainage services; (b) carry out the program
not later than March 31, 1985; (c) pay its current bills to DIMA promptly;
and (d) ensure that DIMA completes installation of meters to measure the
Municipality's water consumption by December 31, 1984.
Financial Covenants
4.17         DIMA will repay the Bank Loan through the MC, which will be
responsible for servicing the debt should DIMA be unable to do so.   In
order to assure that DIMA and the MC comply with these responsibilities,
the subsidiary loan agreement between the MC and the Government will des-
cribe the terms and conditions of repayment.  During negotiations, the MC
agreed that: (a) it would submit to the Bank annual financial statements;
and (b) beginning with its fiscal year ending December 31, 1984, to earn
total revenues at least equal to the sum of its total expenses, debt ser-
vice requirements and capital expenditures not financed by medium and long-
term borrowing, other than those expenses incurred for the DIMA subpro-
ject. The MC also agreed to submit to the Bank before June 30 and December
31 of each year five-year financial forecasts.  If the forecasts show that
its revenues are not adequate, the MC will take all necessary actions, in-
cluding, if necessary, increasing its taxes and fees, to ensure that the



- 24 -
covenant  will  be met.    As  a condition  of Board Presentation,  the MC
presented a Tax Reform Plan to the National Congress for approval.   The
plan  was  approved  and  is  being  implemented.          As  a  condition  of
effectiveness, MC will submit its first five-year financial plan to the
Bank.
4.18          During negotiations,  agreement was  reached  that DIMA would
achieve a rate of return on net revalued fixed assets2/ not lower than
1.6% in 1984, 4.0% in 1985 and 1986, and 7.0% thereafter, and that DIMA
would furnish to the Bank by September 30 of each year a review of its
tariffs based on financial forecasts satisfactory to the Bank for the next
fiscal year. Assurances were also obtained that DIMA would annually adjust
its level of revalued fixed assets to reflect additions to its asset base
and inflation as measured by the Government's official consumer price
index.
4.19        The realization of DIMA's projected cash generation depends in
large part on its ability to collect future billings.   At appraisal,  ac-
counts receivable were high (over 4.0 months of sales).   Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the level of sales in accounts receiv-
able, including arrears for all services and fees, would be reduced to 4.0
months in 1984, 3.3 months in 1985 and 3.0 months by the end of 1986.
4.20       To further protect DIMA's financing plan, agreement was reached
during negotiations that the MC would not incur for DIMA without the Bank's
consent any long term debt (exclusive of borrowings related to the proposed
project), that would cause DIMA's debt service during any subsequent
twelve-month period to be covered less than 1.5 times by its net revenues
in  the  twelve  months  preceding  such  incurrence.    A  second  agreement
reached was that DIMA would not undertake or permit to be undertaken on its
behalf, during project execution, any major investment projects (defined as
those with aggregate expenditures in excess of US$1.0 million annually)
without the prior concurrence of the Bank. Such concurrence would be given
based on evidence that (a) such investments are economically justified; and
(b) adequate financial and technical management resources are available to
carry out such investments.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.21       During negotiations, it was confirmed that the proposed monitor-
ing indicators (Annex 3) reflect the expected improvement in DIMA's opera-
tions and financial performance and that the construction and disbursement
schedules represent conservative forecasts of implementation progress.
DIMA will submit to the Bank semiannual reports (due February 28 and August
31) on the progress of project implementation and its operating and finan-
cial performance during the preceding semesters ending on December 31 and
June 30. The reports will measure performance against the monitoring indi-
cators and adherence to construction and disbursement schedules.
2/ Revalued fixed assets are defined as all fixed assets in operation
including contributed assets but excluding work in progress.

V. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
5.01      The direct benefits of the project will accrue to 521,000 persons
by 1994.  This number includes 190,000 persons currently served but who,
without the project, would continue to suffer water shortages; 20,000
persons who will have additional protection from the periodic flooding of
their homes and 9,000 persons presently without piped water supply who
will receive service as a result of the placement of standpipes in marginal
areas. Over the long run, technical assistance to DIMA will benefit both
the urban and rural populations of San Pedro Sula by enabling DIMA to
provide improved water service.
5.02        The SANAA component, by strengthening SANAA, will benefit large
present and future segments of the country's population, who will continue
to experience poor service or who may not have piped water if existing
constraints to SANAA's capacity to undertake works are not overcome.   By
preparing a realistic investment program and determining financial options
to reduce Government subsidies, the SANAA component will move the sector
towards financial self-sufficiency.
Least Cost Solution
5.03         Compared to other technically feasible alternatives, the San
Pedro Sula water supply component represents the least cost solution for
reaching project objectives at a discount rate of 11%.  The water supply
solution provides for continued use of existing surface water supplies when
water quality is acceptable with only chlorination.3/ It would use wells
to meet the marginal demand.  Since there are times when the surface water
supplies can not be used because of high turbidity, well capacity must
equal 100% of the demand.  A more costly alternative was to make the sur-
face water supplies dependable 100% of the time by providing full treatment
(chemical flocculation and sedimentation followed by filtration) and reduc-
ing the required well capacity.
Return on Investment and Average Long-Run Incremental Cost
5.04         Using expected revenues as a proxy for economic benefits, an
economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated for the San Pedro Sula water
improvements (supply, distribution, storage and rehabilitation).  In order
to better reflect the costs and benefits of the project to the economy, a
shadow-exchange factor (1.02) and a shadow wage rate (0.83) for unskilled
labor were used.   The resulting rate of return is 14%.   This is satis-
factory, given that revenues for water service do not reflect economic and
social benefits in full.4/  A summary of costs, benefits and underlying
assumptions is included in Annex 16.
3/ Turbidity less than 5 units (World Health Organization Standard, 1963).
4/ A rate of return was not estimated for the Institutional technical
assistance and drainage components included in the project because
their costs cannot be reliably assigned to any specific group of
beneficiaries.      The  cost  of  these  two  components   Is  small,
equalling 8% of total project cost.



- 26 -
5.05       The sensitivity of the ERR to changes in costs, benefits and im-
plementation period was tested (see Annex 16).  The results indicated that
the ERR was most sensitive to a delay in project execution and a corres-
ponding delay in realizing project benefits (revenues).   Even with a 10%
increase in costs and a two-year delay in benefits, the ERR was 8.% . This
is an acceptable value for water projects considering that neither health
benefits nor consumers' surplus is included in the calculations.
5.06         The average long-run incremental cost of water supply in the
SPSUA based on the proposed project at an 11% discount rate is L 0.43/m3
(January 1984 prices). Summary marginal cost calculations are presented in
Annex 16.  Present tariffs are L 0.24/m3 or 53% of marginal cost.  During
project implementation, tariffs will be gradually raised so that by project
completion, they would be 91% of marginal cost.
Impact on the Urban Poor
5.07        The beneficiaries of the San Pedro Sula component include an
estimated 108,000 urban poor5J (21%) who, without the project, by 1994
would receive either intermittent water service at low pressure or no water
service.   The 20,000 persons expected to benefit from the storm drainage
improvements and the 9,000 persons to benefit from the installation of
standpipes are classified as urban poor and are included in the 108,000
beneficiaries of the water supply improvements.
Affordability of Service to the Urban Poor
5.08      DIMA's tariff structure provides a subsidy to the poor by waiving
a fixed fee in addition to the consumption charge for those below a certain
income level.  Using a normally admissible limit for water charges (3% of
family income).   The tariff for a minimum consumption of 10 ml/month at
project completion is L 5.0 per month including the sewage surcharge of 30%
versus the affordability limit of L 9.0 per month at the relative poverty
family income threshold6!.   Thus the cost of service is well within the
affordability limits of the poor.
Risks
5.09       San Pedro Sula Component.  The San Pedro Sula component is sub-
ject to moderate  risk due to DIMA's assumption of expanded responsibil-
ities; however, the risk is partially offset by the action plan for the
5/ Defined as population in the relative poverty level (income less than
US$300 p.a./person.
6/ Per capita relative poverty level taken as US$300 p.a. Average family
size 6.0 (Estudio de la Preparacion del Proyecto, Norplan A/S, December
1982). Tariffs are expressed in January 1984 price levels.



- 27 -
institutional strengthening of DIMA and the MC's intention to hire quali-
fied consultants to supervise the construction. Minimal difficulties of a
technical nature are expected during the execution of the project since all
the works are simple and straightforward. The likelihood of cost overruns
is small since all cost estimates were prepared by experienced estimators
from construction drawings.  Delays in project execution are not expected,
considering the advanced stage of project preparation and the ample cons-
truction period allowed (seven years).
5.10       Because of the recent tariff increase and substantial progress
made in achieving full metering, DIMA's financial position is expected to
be satisfactory in 1984.  Changes in DIMA's legal status required by the
Bank as a condition of the Loan are designed to ensure DIMA's ability to
implement additional tariff increases beginning in 1985.   These changes,
together with the expected improvement in DIMA's collection performance,
should ensure that DIMA is able to generate internally the funds required
to finance its share of the project cost.
5.11        SANAA Component.   The SANAA component will involve the normal
risks associated with the quality of technical assistance.  Bank supervi-
sion will monitor closely the consultants' work with SANAA and will follow
up to ensure that appropriate recommendations are taken into account by
SANAA and the Government.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from:
(a) the MC that it would cause DIMA to:
(i) implement the action program shown in Annex 4 for the
strengthening  of  DIMA's   institutional   performance
(para. 2.10);
(ii) not later than December 31, 1987, complete a study of
health hazards associated with the continued use of
polluted Rio Sauce water for sugarcane irrigation and
agree with the Bank on a plan of action based on the
study's recommendations and a timetable for implement-
ing it (para. 3.24);
(iii) prepare and furnish to the Bank for review and comment
not later than December 31, 1984 a revised tariff
policy toward consumers temporarily without working
meters and implement such policy not later than Decem-
ber 31, 1984 (para. 4.08);



- 28 -
(iv) update its records for private wells and strengthen
its registration fee collection procedures by not
later than June 30, 1985 (para. 4.09);
(v) develop a cost recovery program for the installation
of secondary networks and service connections through
a deferred payment plan by not later than December 31,
1985 and implement the program by not later than June
30, 1986 (para. 4.10);
(vi) complete the development of a cost recovery mechanism
for drainage services by no later than September 30,
1984 and implement this mechanism by no later than
March 31, 1985 (para. 4.10);
(vii) install meters on all its water services by not later
than December 31, 1984 (para. 4.16);
(viii) review annually tariffs for all services, and as a
result of this review, take measures as required to
achieve a rate of return on their fixed assets of not
lower than 1.6% in 1984, 4.0% in 1985 and 1986, and
7.0% thereafter (para. 4.18);
(ix) adjust annually its level of revalued fixed assets to
reflect additions to its asset base and inflation as
measured by the Government's official consumer price
index (para. 4.18);
(x) reduce the level of sales in accounts receivable to
4.0 months in 1984, 3.3 months in 1985 and 3.0 months
by the end of 1986 and not exceed this level there-
after (para. 4.19);
(xi) seek Bank concurrence to incur any debt in addition to
debt for the project, if after the incurrence of such
debt DIMA's debt service coverage ratio would drop
below 1.5; similarly, not undertake or permit to be
undertaken on its behalf, during project implementa-
tion, any capital expenditure in excess of US$1.0
million annually, except as the Bank shall agree
(para. 4.20); and
(b) the MC that it would:
(i)   reorganize DIMA in accordance with the provisions of
the Acuerdo Municipal and submit to the Bank the
starting balance sheet for DIMA by not later than
September 30, 1984 (para. 2.02);
(ii) submit to the Bank by not later than September 30,
1984 a timetable for the payment of the bills the MC
owes to DIMA, specifying that the last payment would



- 29 -
be made by not later than March 31, 1985; pay such
bill in accordance with the timetable and continue to
pay for DIMA's services on a current basis (para.
4.16); and
(iii)  submit to the Bank semi-annually forecasts of its own
revenues and and expenses and, based on the forecasts,
take measures as required to produce sufficient
revenues to cover the sum of its total expenses,
debt-service requirements and capital expenditures not
financed by medium and long-term borrowing (para.
4.17); and
(c)  SANAA that by not later than September 30, 1984, it would
appoint a project manager whose experience, qualifications,
and terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory to
the Bank, and would establish a steering committee to direct
its project component (para. 3.22).
6.02      The following would be conditions of effectiveness:
(a) execution and delivery to the Bank of the subsidiary loan
agreements between the Government and the MC and the Govern-
ment and SANAA (para. 3.17);
(b) execution and delivery to the Bank of the CDC Loan contract
and satisfaction of the conditions of effectiveness of the
CDC Loan contract (para. 3.15); and
(c) delivery to the Bank of a five-year financial plan for the
MC (para. 4.17).
6.03       The proposed Bank Loan will allow retroactive financing for well
construction and for consulting services to update bidding documents and
improve DINA's accounting with a total contract value of not more than
US$0.4 million (para. 3.30).
6.04          With the above assurances,  agreements and  conditions,  the
proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$19.6 million for a term
of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the standard variable
interest rate.

Institutional Assessment of DIMA
AREA                                         ASSESSMENT
Institutional Arrangement       Autonomous operating division of the MC.   Its Board of
Directors  under  a  proposed  reorganization  will  have
authority to hire and fire, set personnel policies,
establish investment plans, maintain accounts and propose
necessary tariffs. Tariffs must be approved by the MC and
the Departamental Council.
Organization                    Reorganization  recommended  by  consultants  for  project
preparation (see Attachments 1 and 2).
Planning and Budgeting          Weak.   No formal planning done.   Previous  revenue and
expenditure budgets prepared by MC; budgets have no prac-
tical  function  as  management  tool.    Consultants  who
assisted with implementation of new accounting system in
1983  have  improved  budgeting  and  planning  process.
Design                          Most design work is done by outside consultants.
Construction Supervision        Done by outside consultants.
Operation and Maintenance       Has suffered from lack of qualified supervisory staff,
absence of systematic preventive maintenance procedures
and insufficient vehicles and equipment.

AREA                                            ASSESSMENT
Metering                         Meters read by DIMA staff once a month.  60% of urban con-
nections metered as of November 1983.  Meter installation
program now in place with goal of achieving full metering
by 1985. Systematic procedures need to be established to
identify and repair defective meters and faulty connec-
tions.
Billing                          Computerized.   System is functioning reasonably well for
regular water and sewerage customers.  Billings for other
services and for customers served by private water systems
acquired by DIMA from private developers are insufficient-
ly complete  to  ensure  full  collection.    There  is  no
written policy for adjusting erroneous meter readings
brought to DIMA's attention by dissatisfied customers.
Collection                       Current collection arrangements are inefficient.  Customer
bills must be paid at DIMA headquarters.   Possibility of
using banks as collection agents is being explored. Bill-
ing cycle covers two month period.  Delayed payments are
automatically postponed to the next billing cycle without
financial  penalty.    Delay  in two  consecutive  payments
should result in water shut-off and subsequent reconnec-
tion charge. Because of small size of shut-off squads and
lack of systematic follow-up, only limited number of
delinquent customers are actually shut-off.
Customer File                    Current, except for MC accounts.  Municipal buildings and
facilities are not charged for DIMA's services.

AREA                                          ASSESSMENT
Accounting System                Accounting consultants implemented an accrual accounting
system satisfactory to Bank in 1983. Additional technical
assistance will be needed, particularly in areas of cost
accounting, staff training and reconciliation of com-
mercial records with accounting records.
Fixed Assets                    Fixed assets were recently revalued, but procedures need
to be established to update the revaluation annually.
Management                       General Manager is an experienced civil engineer.  Middle
management with responsibility for financial and account-
ing matters and for engineering and operations needs
strengthening.
Salaries                        Low salary levels have led to difficulties in recruiting
and retaining qualified high-level staff.   As an auto-
nomous operating division of the MC, DIMA will have
authority to pay competitive salaries to attract capable
personnel.   Studies are needed to determine the salary
structure needed to recruit and retain staff.
Personnel Function              Under DIMA's  old organization,  all important  personnel
actions were initiated by MC.   The reorganization will
result in these responsibilities being carried out by
DIMA's  Board of Directors  and  management.    Steps  are
needed to strengthen the personnel function including the
appointment of a qualified human resources manager as well
as the development of new policies for recruitment, clas-
sifification, salary levels, performance evaluation and
career development.

AREA                                          ASSESSMENT
Procurement and Inventory        Present  manual  procedures  are  complicated  and  ineffi-
Control                        cient.   Records of physical inventories are unreliable.
New systems and procedures are needed.
Transportation                   Improvements needed.   Maintenance procedures need to be
enhanced and new vehicles and equipment are needed.
Staff                            Employees  per 1,000 connections is high (10.6) compared
with other water companies in Latin America.
Trainirng                        Inadequate.    Limited  training  provided  on  an  ad  hoc
basis.   A study  is needed  to analyze  DIMA's  staffing
levels and  training needs  and to recommend  a suitable
training program.
Auditirng                        Weak because of the lack of accounting and control proce-
dures. These shortcomings have been addressed by consult-
ants implementing the new accounting system.   Additional
technical assistance is required.  External auditors will
be appointed to prepare DIMA's starting balance sheet.
Computer System                  Hardware,  software and support services currently being
provided by MC.   Arrangements have been made for MC to
transfer a used computer (IBM 32) to DIMA's offices. Ins-
tallation is expected  soon.   DIMA has begun recruiting
supervisory and technical personnel to program and operate
this equipment.   A microcomputer and related accessories
are also needed to strengthen DIMA's analytical capabi-
lities.

San Pedro Sula Population and Demand Projections
Population Projections
1.         San Pedro Sula is located 180 km north of Tegucigalpa and 50 km
from the Atlantic coast. It is the second largest city in Honduras and its
industrial center.  The Municipality of San Pedro Sula encompasses an area
of approximately 900 km2, mostly rural.   The present limits of the SPSUA
occupy only about 8% of the total land area administered by the MC. These
limits were established by an agreement between the MC and the National
Agrarian Institute (INA) in the 1960s. According to this agreement the INA
controls the ultimate planning authority over the rural part of the Muni-
cipality.   The MC has the responsibility for planning development within
the urban boundaries agreed upon with the INA. Water supply for rural com-
munities is the responsibility of the MC.
2.         The total area within the present boundaries of the SPSUA is not
yet completely urbanized.   At the same time, there are certain tendencies
towards development of urban areas beyond the present SPSUA boundaries
which has resulted in several smaller suburban centers 3 to 10 km from the
urban center area. In projecting population growth, this tendency has been
taken into account by defining four urban population categories:  (a) inner
urban -- population living in the area served by existing water sewerage
and drainage systems; (b) outer urban -- population living in partially
developed areas currently served by private or separate systems, but
included within the SPSUA (the area to be benefitted by the project); (c)
unspecified urban -- population living in areas close to the current bound-
aries of the SPSUA where future urban growth could take place; and (d)
rural .
3.         The population of the SPSUA was 293,000 in mid-1982.  During the
1970-1980 decade, the average population increase was 7.0% in contrast to
the national estimated growth rate of 3.3%. This implies that a major res-
tructuring of the population distribution is taking place.   Annual popu-
lation growth rates are expected to remain at about 6.6% per annum through
1995 and then level off to 5.8% until the year 2000.  The highest growth
rate is expected to take place in the unspecified urban areas so that by
the year 2000, 40% of the total SPSUA population will be located outside
its current boundaries.   The rural areas of the Municipality are expected
to grow at a much lower rate (2% per annum).  By the year 2000 the rural

population of the Municipality will represent only 7% of the total, whereas
in  1982,  14% of  the Municipality's  population was  rural.    Population
projections of the Municipality to the year 2000 by category are included
in Attachment 1.
Demand Projections
4.         Population in the SPSUA served by the MC-owned water system in
1982 was 74%.  Private systems served about 17%.  Almost 100% of the popu-
lation living within the inner urban area are served by the MC-owned water
supply system.   The population either not served by the MC or served by
private systems is located in the outer urban area. Demand projections for
the SPSUA (Attachment 2) assume that the MC will extend its service to the
total SPSUA population including those persons that will locate outside the
current boundaries (unspecified urban area) and that by the year 1995, ser-
vice coverage will reach 95% of the urban population.   The projections
assume a constant per capita consumption of about 145 liters per day and 10
persons per connection. This translates into a consumption of 44m3/connec-
tion per month.   Use of this figure for projecting future consumption is
based on an evaluation of the consumption by 10,000 existing customers with
metered connections.  In projecting future production requirements, it was
assumed that unaccounted-for water would be brought under control by 1990
and remain at 30% from 1990 to the year 2000. Based on the past connection
growth rate of 5% under the existing conditions of poor service and lack of
a primary network from which the system could be expanded, the projected
growth of 7.5% between 1983 and 1990 is reasonable, considering the large
investment in new facilities proposed.
5.          Current service levels in the rural area are estimated at 27%.
Service levels are expected to increase to 70% by the year 1985 as a result
of the USAID project now being implemented. Further improvement in service
levels is not expected and new connections are expected to keep pace with
population growth until the year 2000.   Demand projections for the rural
areas administered by the MC are included in Attachment 3.
6.         The 1982 population served by water borne sewerage in the SPSUA
is estimated at 72%. Although no provisions for major investment in sewer-
age facilities is included in the project or in DIMA's investment program,
the construction of sewer networks by private developers is expected to
keep pace with future population growth so that the service level coverage
will remain at about 70% through the project implementation period. A pro-
jection of future sewer connections is included in Attachment 4.

1.          At mid-year 1982, the MC owned water system supplied water to
21,700 connections.   Privately owned and operated systems  supplied an
additional 5,000 connections. Water supplied by the MC is obtained from 13
deep wells and two surface water sources, the Rio Santa Ana and the Rio
Piedras.   The two surface water sources supply the system by gravity.
Surface water is treated only by chlorination.  Well water is untreated.
Severe shortages occur during heavy rainfalls when surface water cannot be
used due to high turbidity and the system must depend on the 13 operating
wells with a combined capacity of 21,000 m3/day. Shortages also occur dur-
ing the dry season when surface water production averages only 20,000
m3/day. Maximum surface water production is limited by transmission main
capacity to 88,000 m3/day. Lack of distribution storage capacity restricts
supply to about 70% of available production capacity.
2.         Production from the surface water sources is adequately measured
and recorded. Well production, however, is only estimated based on nominal
pump capacity and hours of operation. There are 17,000 service connections
with functioning meters. Twelve thousand meters were installed in 1983 as
a result of a metering improvement program recommended by the Bank.
Sewerage System
3.         The MC-owned sanitary sewerage system consists of a gravity col-
lection network and an interceptor system with 21,100 connections at mid-
year 1982.   Untreated sewage is discharged at many points into the Rio
Sauce which at present forms the eastern boundary of the city. River water
downstream of the existing discharge points is 90% raw sewage during the
dry season.   Although it is not used for water supply, the river is a
source of irrigation and poses a threat to public health.   DIMA has a
long-term plan to treat all sewerage discharges.  An interim solution is
required until treatment is provided.

Stormwater Drainage System
4.         The stormwater drainage system serves about one-half the area of
the city.  In the unserved areas, enormous quantities of water flow through
the city after periods of heavy rains.   In the steeper areas, the high
velocity of the water has caused substantial erosion and serious damage to
both public and private facilities.  In flat areas, thousands of dwellings
are periodically flooded.   Also, the reduced velocity in the flat areas
causes the deposit of waste products and debris.
Recent System Additions
5..           In 1975, the MC received a US$1.5 million loan from TDB to
finance the construction of a distribution storage reservoir, three wells
and an interconnecting trunk main to improve water pressures in the area
most affected by water shortages.   Unfortunately, only one of the three
wells was successful. This well, the reservoir and the connecting main can
be incorporated in the proposed project.
6.          During the same period, the municipality constructed (with its
own funds) an interceptor to collect sewage from new developments located
north of the city, and discharge it into the Sauce River. The extension of
this interceptor will be required to treat the city's sewage.
7.        More recently, USAID arranged for the MC to borrow US$2.0 million
from  a  consortium  of  U.S.  commercial  banks  to  finance  water  system
improvements in three villages within the SPSUA and construct nine rural
water systems for villages under the administrative control of the MC. At
appraisal, the MC had drawn down approximately US$0.5 million of this
loan.   This project is scheduled for completion in 1984, but could take
longer.
Population Served and Standards of Service
8.         The mid-1982 population of the SPSUA is estimated at 293,000, of
whom about 74% were served by the municipally-owned water system.   Another
17% are serviced by privately owned and operated systems.   The sewerage
system served an estimated 72% of the population.   The majority of the
population served receives water and sewerage service through individual
house or yard connections. Approximately 50,000 persons, mostly poor, live
in multifamily dwellings called "cuarterias." These dwellings are served by
a single yard connection with a sink and shower and a toilet.   Another
2,000 persons are served by standpipe.  Low pressures and shortages occur
frequently in all areas.

Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Services for the Urban Poor
9.          In 1982, consultants for project preparation estimated that 18%
or 53,000 persons in the SPSUA lived in relative poverty.1/ This number
includes the estimated 12,000 persons living in squatter areas with limited
or no services. Of the remaining 41,000, most live in the eastern area of
the city where water is least available and flooding is most frequent.
Only in the Chamelecon area (see map), where a recently completed USAID
project upgraded the water system, is water service adequate for a high
proportion of the urban poor.   Approximately  50% of the  18,000 persons
living in this area belong in the poverty group.
1/ Per capita income less than US$300 per annum.

WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
San Pedro Sula Component Project Description
General
1.         The San Pedro Sula component (Parts A through G of the project)
includes the construction of works to improve the MC-owned and operated
water supply and drainage systems serving the SPSUA, a water distribution
system, mapping and leak detection program, technical and material assis-
tance for the institutional improvement of DIMA, and a sugarcane irrigation
study.
Water Supply Improvements (Part A)
2.           This part of the project includes the construction of 18 new
wells and the rehabilitation of 7 wells. The construction and improvements
will increase DIMA's well production capacity from its 21,000 m3/day to
110,000 m3/daY.    Surface water production capacity will remain unchanged
at 57,000 m3/day (average yield).   Except for two recently constructed
wells in the Chamelecon area, about six existing low production wells and
the three emergency wells, both new and existing wells will be intercon-
nected in groups of four to eight.   Water from each well group will be
pumped to a centrally located chlorination station. The water will then be
chlorinated before being delivered to the distribution system.   At the
present time, only the surface water receives chlorination. Rehabilitation
of existing wells will include the drilling of a new well on the same site
as the existing well and utilizing the existing piping and electrical con-
nections.   Pumps and motors will be either reconditioned or replaced,
depending on their condition. DIMA will employ consultants to assist with
the construction supervision of this component.
3.         Tentative locations of the wells to be constructed are based on
preliminary groundwater investigations by Hazen and Sawyer in 1978.
Additional groundwater investigations will be made before actual construc-
tion begins.  These investigations will include the drilling of test wells
in all proposed new locations, an evaluation of the capacity of the
aquifers currently being utilized and the identification of new areas for
groundwater development to meet demands to the year 2000.  Terms of refer-
ence are in the project file.

Water Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvements (Part B)
4.         The transmission improvements include rehabilitation of the Rio
Santa Ana and Rio Piedras surface water intakes and the transmission mains
which connect these sources with the system. Work at the intakes will in-
clude masonry repairs, replacement of chlorination equipment and replace-
ment of screens.
5.         The distribution improvements consist of 46 km of primary water
distribution main, ranging in size from 150 mm to 500 mm and two booster
pump stations.   About 14 km of well collectors will be constructed under
this part of the project also.  The new primary mains will reinforce an
already extensive secondary network, extend service to existing subdivi-
sions which are currently inadequately served by private systems, and make
possible the development of new areas.   The new network will divide the
distribution system into a medium level pressure zone serving 50% of the
demand and three smaller pressure zones.  The existing and proposed wells
will pump directly to the medium-level pressure zone.  The hydraulic gra-
dient in this pressure zone will be established by the proposed Mesetas
reservoir to be constructed under this part of the project to the southwest
of the city's center.   A low-level pressure zone located in the eastern
half of the city will be supplied through pressure reducing valves from the
medium-level pressure zone.   The two high-level pressure zones will be
supplied through the two booster pumping stations to be constructed under
this part of the project and the existing surface water sources.
6.           The low-level pressure zone will be created to minimize the
stress on the older pipes in the eastern half of the city.  Without pres-
sure reduction, pressures would reach 75 psi in some areas.   This could
cause problems with the secondary network and plumbing, considering that
for a number of years pressures in this area rarely exceeded 20 psi.
7.         At present, the MC water supply system has no properly function-
ing distribution storage.   As a result, production is restricted since
water cannot be stored during low demand periods for use during peak demand
periods.   Two 15,000 m3 reinforced concrete distribution reservoirs are
proposed on an elevated site to the west of the city. The water level of
these reservoirs will establish the hydraulic gradient in the medium-pres-
sure zone of the system. The higher gradient will also make effective the
existing 5,000 m3 Suncery reservoir which was constructed in 1978.   Low
system pressures have made it impossible for this reservoir to function
effectively since its construction.
8.         DIMA will employ consultants to assist with the supervision of
construction of the transmission main repairs, the installation of new
mains, the construction of pump stations and the construction of storage
reservoirs.

Secondary Networks and Connections (Part C)
9.         Approximately 16,000 water connections and 13,000 sewage connec-
tions are expected to be added to the system between 1984 and 1990.  Half
the water connections and two-thirds of the sewer connections are expected
to be made to secondary networks already in place.  The remaining connec-
tions will require the construction of approximately 70 km of secondary
water main and 40 km of secondary sewer collectors.   It is estimated that
DIMA will construct only 20% of these new secondary networks and that the
remaining 80% will be constructed by private developers or other Government
or MC agencies. Most new service connections will be installed by develop-
ers or property owners with DIMA providing only the meter. The poorer seg-
ments of the population, however, may not be able to afford the cost of a
water and sewerage connection.   To ensure that the poor benefit from the
proposed project, DIMA will initiate a program to finance the installation
of water and sewerage connections for qualifying individuals who want to
connect to the system.   It is estimated that 5,000 water connections and
4,000 sewer connections will be installed under the proposed program.
Construction of 15 km of secondary water mains and 10 km of secondary
sewage collectors in poor neighborhoods, the installation of 5,000 water
connections and the installation of 4,000 sewer connections are included in
the project.   This work will be accomplished  by local contractors  and
supervised by DIMA.
10.       Also included in this part of the project are the installation of
24,000 meters, the construction of 25 standpipes in marginal areas, and the
repair and/or replacement of existing mains found to be defective in the
leak detection program. The construction of the standpipes and the repair
and/or replacement of mains will be carried out by local contractors.  The
meters will be installed  initially under  the metering program by con-
tractors. Meters for new customers will be installed by DIMA.
Storm Drainage (Part D)
11.       Approximately 15 km of drainage interceptors have been identified
and designed to solve San Pedro Sula's drainage problem.   Most of the
proposed interceptors will divert flows from the higher areas of the city
to natural drainage courses running from west to east. Two of the proposed
interceptors will drain lower areas of the city to natural drainage chan-
nels to the east of the city.   Because of lack of project funds, the size
of the drainage component has been reduced to include approximately three
km of drainage interceptors.   DIMA will employ consultants to assist with
the supervision of construction of the drainage interceptors.

Leak Detection and Mapping of the Distribution System (Part E)
12.        Distribution system maps have not been kept up to date, nor are
the maps at an adequate scale to provide sufficient detail for successful
system operation and maintenance.   Under this part of the project, a new
set of large scale distribution system maps will be prepared as a first
step in the leak detection program.  The proposed maps will be prepared at
the scale of 1:1,000. The mapping will be carried out by consultants with
maximum use of local draftsmen and technicians.
13.          At present DIMA is making little effort to control leakage.
DIMA's present staff lacks the experience and the equipment to detect
leaks. Under this part of the project, a systematic leak detection program
of the entire system will be carried out by a consulting firm in coopera-
tion with DIMA. The program will also include on-the-job training of local
staff so that the effort can continue once the consultant's contract
expires.
14.        An important part of the program will be the preparation of work
orders for the repair of leaks or the rehabilitation of components of the
system identified as requiring attention.   Materials for the repair work
will be purchased by DIMA and paid for with loan funds from CDC.  The re-
quired materials for each repair will be turned over to local contractors
hired under a work order system to undertake the repair work on a
job-by-job basis. Contractors participating in the program will be prequa-
lified by DIMA and paid on the basis of unit prices established for
specific types of work.  Terms of reference for consultants to manage and
implement the mapping and leak detection program are in the project file.
Institutional and Operational Improvement of DIMA (Part F)
15.         DIMA's operations are deficient because of inadequate training
and lack of proper equipment to operate and maintain the systems in its
care.  Technical assistance and the acquisition of new equipment will be
provided under this part of the project.   The technical assistance will
support an action program to strengthen DIMA's institutional performance.
16.       Technical assistance will provide for improvements to DIMA's fin-
ancial management, accounting, procurement and inventory control proced-
ures, billing and collection, training, internal auditing, engineering,
maintenance and operations.   More specifically,  the technical assistance
(estimated at 58 man-months) will consist of the following:

Annex 7
Page 5
(a)  The appointment  of consultant managers.   Two consultants
will be appointed to serve as senior line managers with res-
ponsibility for the day-to-day operations of DIMA as well as
for planning and implementing necessary improvements.   One
will be appointed deputy manager for administration and will
be responsible for finance, accounting, budgeting and com-
mercial operations.  The other consultant will be appointed
deputy manager for engineering and operations and will be
responsible for engineering, maintenance and operations.
Individuals with previous water utility experience will be
appointed.    Each consultant will report  directly to the
general manager.  The administrative and commercial depart-
ment heads will report to the consultant manager for admin-
istration. The engineering and operations department heads
will report to the consultant manager for engineering and
operations.  The appointments will be for a mimimum of two
years.
(b)  Study of DIMA's personnel management and training.    Con-
sultants will be hired to develop new policies for DIMA in
the area of recruitment, personnel classification, salary
level, performance evaluation and career development; to
analyze DIMA's existing and future manpower requirements,
training and budgeting needs; and to recommend an appropri-
ate training program. A new manager of human resources, who
will be appointed by DIMA, will be responsible for imple-
menting the recommendations of the study.
17.        Terms of reference for the hiring of the consultant administra-
tive and engineering managers and consultants for the personnel and train-
ing study are in the project file.
18.            During  project  preparation,  Norplan identified materials,
equipment and vehicles required by DIMA.   DIMA will acquire the needed
equipment under this part of the project.  Included among these items is a
microcomputer to assist DIMA in its engineering design work, the analysis
of statistical data and the preparation of financial projections. The Bank
will make its software available to DIMA for use on this computer.
Sugarcane Irrigation Study (Part G)
19.       The San Pedro Sula sewerage system discharges at many points into
the Rio Sauce which currently forms the eastern boundry of the city's
development. To the west of the Rio Sauce and downstream of the sewerage



- 53 -
Annex 7
Page 6
discharges is a sugar plantation and refining plant owned by the Compania
Azucarera Hondurena, S.A. (CAHSA). This company diverts water from the Rio
Sauce for irrigation of sugarcane during the dry season when about 90% of
the total flow is sewage.   About 1,100 ha are irrigated in this manner.
There is concern that the continued use of polluted water for irrigation
may constitute a health hazard to the field workers. Raw sugarcane may be
eaten without washing by unsuspecting persons.   It is also possible that
toxins in the sewage may be absorbed by the sugarcane, and that the ground-
water aquifer may be polluted by the irrigation water.   The study will
determine the present status of the situation, create a statistical basis
for a monitoring program to be carried out during a two-year period by
DIMA, and identify alternatives to the continued use of polluted Rio Sauce
water for irrigation. Terms of reference for the study are in the project
file.

Project Cost Estimates
1.         Detailed cost estimates of the San Pedro Sula and SANAA compon-
ents are included as Attachments  1 and 2 respectively.   Consulting cost
estimates for both components are included as Attachment 3. The estimated
cost of secondary water and sewerage networks and service connections to be
added to the system by individuals, DIMA and private developers between
1983 and 1994 are in the project file.
2.         For converting local costs to foreign costs, an exchange rate of
US$1 = L 2 was assumed for the project implementation period.
3.            All base cost estimates  reflect projected price levels for
January 1984.
4.         Base cost estimates for construction costs were prepared by con-
sultants using quantity take-offs from final design drawings. Pipe, equip-
ment and material cost estimates were based on supplier quotations. Unit
prices for civil works were based on recent bids for similar work performed
in Honduras. The original cost estimates were prepared in mid-1980. These
costs were updated to January 1984 prices, based on an evaluation of con-
struction cost trends in Honduras from mid-1980 to mid-1982.  The foreign
cost component includes the cost of imported materials and an estimate of
the depreciation cost of heavy equipment most likely to be used in the
project.
5.        Land acquisition costs are based on preliminary surveys and land
value estimates made by DIMA in August 1982 updated to January 1984
prices. Local inflation estimates for 1983 were used for the updating.
6.        The cost of consultants for investigations, studies, construction
supervision, technical assistance and leak detection are based on man-month
estimates for various tasks and prevailing rates charged by consultants in
Honduras.
7.          The cost of equipment and meters to be purchased by DIMA is an
allowance based on availability of loan funds.  DIMA's needs for the pur-
chase of additional equipment and meters is about double the amount of
funds available for this purpose. The amount budgeted will allow the pur-
chase of the most essential items.

8.           Physical contingencies of 10% of base cost for civil works,
materials, equipment and consulting services have been allowed.
9.          Price contingencies of 27% for foreign base costs and 33% for
local base costs have been allowed.   Calculations assume the following
inflation rates:

HONDURAS
WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Financial Statements and Projections
1.         Financial statements and projections are included on Attachments
1 through 3. The assumptions used in their preparation are as follows.
Inflation and Exchange Rates
2.         Estimated rates of inflation used for financial projections are
9.0% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7.0% in 1985 and 6.0% from 1986 to 1990.  The
exchange rate is assumed to remain constant at its present level of L 0.50
= US$1.00 from 1983 to 1990.
Revenues
3.          Water sales for the project area are based on projections for
production, connections, monthly consumption per connection and reductions
of unaccounted-for water as shown in Annex 5. Projections of the number of
new sewerage connections are presented in Annex 5 also.  Aggregate connec-
tion fees for water and sewerage services are based on the forecasted
number of new connections and the present connection fees adjusted annually
for inflation. Water sales for the rural areas are related to the projec-
ted number of rural connections (Annex 5) and the average rural tariff
charge adjusted annually for inflation.  Drainage charges are expected to
cover the operating and investment costs of providing such services.  The
projections have assumed that beginning in mid-1985, when the cost recovery
mechanism for the drainage component is to be implemented, drainage charges
will be based on the estimated annual depreciation expense for the drainage
assets plus 10% of DIMA's total operating expenses.
4.        Average water and sewerage tariffs for 1983 are based on previous
tariffs for the first four months of the year and implementation on May 1,
1983 of the new tariff. Average water tariffs for 1984-90 are projected on
the basis that DIMA will achieve full metering by year-end 1985, and that
the following rates of return will be obtained: 1.6% in 1984; 4% in 1985
and 1986; and 7% thereafter.  Sewerage revenues during 1984-90 are assumed
to remain at 30% of water billed.

ANNEX 15
Page 2
Operating Costs and Depreciation
5.        Operating costs are projected by applying the general inflation
rate and the following assumptions:
(a) personnel - real Increases of 10% annually from 1984-87 to com-
pensate for historically low salaries and wages; gradual reduc-
tions in the the number of employees per one thousand water con-
nections from 11.5 in 1982 to a targeted level of 9.0 in 1987 and
thereafter;
(b) chemicals - chlorination of all sources;
(c) power - volume of energy consumed varies in direct proportion
to the projected volume of pumped water production. Annual
electricity unit costs are assumed to increase at a real rate of
10% from 1984-90 as current tariffs are unrealistically low.
(d) materials - increases in proportion to increases in the
number of new connections;
(e) administrative - increases in proportlon to increases in
the number of new connections; and
(f) general - remains at the same percentage of personnel cost as
in 1982.
6.        Depreciation charges are based on an average rate (3%) applied to
fixed assets on a straight line basis.
Debt Service
7.        Projected debt service requirements reflect interest and prin-
cipal payments on existing obligations and future borrowings as described
below:
Interest  Committment  Front-End       Grace       Amortization              Loan Amount
Lender  Rate (%)  Charge (%)    Fee (%)   Period (yrs)         Period      Currency   (millions)

Investments
8.         Investments include the expenditures under the project; expendi-
tures for the completion of a USAID project (1983-84); other works and
customer contributions relating to the installation of new connections, and
expansion of secondary water distribution networks and sewerage and
drainage collection systems, and capitalized interest.   Expenditures for
other works and customer contributions are based on the assumption that
contributions will cover 85% of the new service connections and network ex-
pansion costs. The remaining costs are assumed to be covered by DIMA from
internal sources.
Working Capital
9.           Working capital assumptions include: (a) gradual reduction in
accounts receivable to 3.0 months of sales by year-end 1986 and maintenance
at this level thereafter; (b) increases in inventory in line with purchases
of chemicals and materials; (c) increases in accounts payable in direct
proportion to increases in operating costs; and (d) maintenance of other
current liabilities at the 1982 level adjusted annually for inflation.
Fixed Assets
10.       The value of DIMA's fixed assets was revalued as of year-end 1981
and adjusted thereafter to reflect actual and expected additions and infla-
tion.

Assumptions
(a)  Incremental consumption estimaoed according to difference between con-
sumption with the proiect and consumption without the project.  All
*ncreased consumption over 1983 consumption is attributed to the
proj ect.
(b)  Benefits estimated from tariff and connection fee revenues and users'
contribution to investment. Expected revenues at January 1984 prices.
(c) Operating costs for administration, personnel, general and materials
are assumed equal to 60% of DDMA's total projected operating expenses
with the remaining 40% chargeable to DDMA's other services.
(d) Investments include 100% of all water-related project expenditures and
60% of equipment purchases. Well rehabilitation is assumed every
10 years at 40% of original cost and equipment is assumed replaced every
10 years at 100% of original cost. Consulting costs for leak detection
and construction supervision have been included as an investment cost.
Consultants for institutional technical assistance have not been included.
All investment costs include 10% contingencies.
(e) The cost of secondary networks and connections built by private de-
velopers and charged to the householder was not included, since it was
assumed that associated benefits (reflected in the increased price of
the house) would at least be equal to the cost.
(f)  Shadow Exchange Factor =   1/Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
Estimated SCF   = 0.98
(g)  Shadow Wage Rate.  The efficiency wage rate was derived on the assump-
tion that, without the project, only an average of about 85% of the
available unskilled labor is engaged in productive activities.l/ The
market wage rate was assumed to represent the marginal productivity of
labor and the efficiency wage rate (EWR) was estimated as:
EWR = R x P = 0.98 x 0.85 = 0.83
Where R is the consumption conversion factor used to convert the op-
portunity cost of labor into border prices and P is the probability of
hiring a previously employed worker.
(h)  Foreign exchange component of construction costs:    51%
Foreign exchange component of operating cost:           50%
Portion of unskilled labor in construction costs:    15%
1/   As no precise figures on employment in SPSUA are available, this assump-
tion might underestimate the available unskilled labor that is engaged
in productive activities. However, this figure appears to be consist-
ent with figures for the economy as a whole as reported in other Bank
documents.
