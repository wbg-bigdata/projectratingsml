MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A COMMUNITY CHILD CARE AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Colombia for US$24 million is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would be repayable over a period of 17 years, including five years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  Over the past 25 years, Colombia has recorded significant
economic gains, with recent growth on the order of 4 percent to 5 percent
annually. Social progress has also been impressive over the last decades.
Between 1964 and 1985, the population growth rate dropped from 3.7 percent to
1.8 percent; infant and maternal mortality declined appreciably (from 81 to 61
deaths per 1,000 live births, and from 254 to 107 deaths per 100,000 births,
respectively); over 80 percent of the relevant age-group, equally divided
betwpen boys and girls, now attends primary school. Despite these advances, as
captured in average country indicators, the distribution of economic and social
benefits remains highly skewed. Incomes of the top 20 percent of households are
six to seven times that of the bottom 20 percent, and severe poverty continues
to affect some 20 percent of the population. The worst poverty is a3sociated
with urban slums. In these areas, services are typically inadequate and living
conditions unhygienic; and child mortality is 50 percent higher than elsewhere.
A particularly heavy burden is placed on poor women and children: an estimated
25 percent of poor urban households is headed by women, and in this group
children suffer disproportionately from illness, poor nutrition, neglect, and
violence.
3.       A major objective of the Government is to reduce poverty by means of
policies and programs designed to raise the income-earning capacity of the poor.
This anti-poverty orientation is based largely on a long-term strategy of human
resource development through increased investment in health, nutrition and
education services directed at the most vulnerable groups. Programs underway
center on expanding and upgrading basic health services, including services for
maternal, pre-natal and infant care; and universalizing primary education.
Another cornerstone of the initiative is a community-based program: Child Care
Homes (HBIs), managed by the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF). The
HBIs provide day care, including feeding, early childhood education, and health
monitoring for poor urban children, aged two to six. The HBI program is based
on experience accumulated over ten years by different Colombian institutions,
both public and private, with the assistance of UNICEF and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), and on broader evidence on the importance of appropriate
nutrition, health services and early childhood development as determinants of
future productivity and well-being. A central feature of the program, which
helps maintain HBI unit costs around a third the cost of an older, center-based
program of the ICBF, is its provision in individual homes in the neighborhood
operated by "community mothers". These women, chosen by the community, receive
a modest stipend, a home improvement loan (to ensure minimum safety and sanitary
conditions) and orientation in day care and nutrition. Communities participate
through volunteer (including NGO) support, and through parents' associations and
aominal contributions. Organized supervision of the home is also provided by
the ICBF. Using this model of direct community participation, the ICBF mounted
the HBI program on a broad scale in 1987.  By mid-1989 it served some 500,000



- 2 -
children, and by 1995 the Governient plans to extend the HBI program to all
urban children identified as being at risk--estimated at over 1,000,000--with
annual targets set on the basis of performance reviews.
4.       As reviewed in a 1988 Bank report (Social Programs and Poverty
Alleviation:  An Assessment of Government Initiatives, IBRD Report 7271-CO of
December 2, 1988), the HBI program successfully reaches very poor urban children
and mothers with day ca-e, nutrition and pre-school development services. A
1989 evaluation, carried out by consultants to the ICBF, confirmed that the HBI
program is a viable mechanism to reach this group. It also concluded that to
ensure the continued effectiveness of the HBIs during expansion, ICBF must not
only sustain strong community involvement, but also seek to guide the expansion
with improved policies for finance and management. ICBF must ensure, for
example, that all its child-care subsidies are targeted on the least well-off
children and mothers. This will require a reduction in its support for its
center-based day care program, which serves largely a middle income clientele.
Foodstuffs procured for the HBI program, in particular a local food supplement,
Bienestarina, currently produced by the ICBF, will also need to be more
economically provided; and the supply of Bienestarina, which has lagged behind
demand, will need to be expanded. The scaling up of the program will further
require institutional strengthening of ICBF for providirg technical support for
local program implementation, for planning and monitoring, and for conducting an
impact evaluation with support from the National Department of Statistics. In
addition, selected improvements are required to enhance service delivery,
notably in training, and in access to home upgrading credit for community
mothers and basic health services for children attending HBIs. Management
arrangements for the home upgrading also need to be further developed. The
Government is refining the HBI program to address these issues.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   Bank assistance strategy for Colombia
focuses on continued economic growth, combined with poverty alleviation, through
policy adjustment and selective investments in key economic and social sectors.
The proposed project supports this strategy through a focus on ICBF policy
analysis, institutional development and enhancement of HBI service delivery
effectiveness. The Bank has previously extended support for one nutrition and
one health project in Colombia. An integrated nutrition project (Loan 1487-CO,
1977) met or exceeded physical targets, but was judged on completion as overly
complex in design and weak in impact evaluation. A health project (Loan
2611-CO, 1986), designed to support decentralization of the public health
system, encountered inefficiencies in coordination and execution among numerous
participating agencies and was recently reprogrammed. These experiences have
been taken into account in the proposed project. In addition to complementing
the earlier operations in nutrition and health, the proposed project reinforces
the objectives of a recent Bank loan which supports the Government's development
program for primary education (Loan 3010-CO, 1989).
6.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project forms a key part of the
Government's program to raise incomes among the poor and improve their well-
being through cost-effective, targeted interventions. The project would
contribute to this effort by strengthening the ongoing HBI program. The
project is part of the Government's six-year expansion program for the HBIs
(1990-95) and will: (i) improve the cost-effectiveness of ICBF operations;
(ii) increase the technical support, planning, monitoring and evaluation
capabilities of ICBF; and (iii) raise HBI quality as services double. It
includes three corresponding components.

The proposed project supports this strategy through a focus on ICBF policy

includes three corresponding components.

7.       Project Description.   The policy component (US$0.4 million) comprises
a study to determine future management and financing responsibilities, whether
private, community, or other, for ICBF's center-based program of child care,
which is insufficiently targeted on the poor. It also includes a measure to
reduce ICBF budget support for this program by 30 percent by 1995. with tha
reduction compensated by income-based user fees. It further incorporates a
study to assess potential for the private production and marketing of
Bienestarina. The management development component (US$2.7 million) includes
equipment, materials and technical assistance to: develop and introduce an
improved management information system (MIS) for planning and monitoring of the
HBI program and other institutional improvements in the ICBF; conduct an HBI
impact evaluation on a national scale using household survey techniques and
National Department of Statistics' support; and strengthen HBI program
coordination. The service support component (US$37.1 million) will provide
systematic training for about 75,000 community mothers and other HEI
participants; and HBI home upgrading for about 50,000 community mothers. The
home-upgrading credits amount to less than US$750 per home, average about
US$500, and are repaid in five years. A subsidized interest rate, amounting to
about 45 percent of the commercial rate, is charged on the credits. Repayment
is financed through direct deductions from the community mothers' monthly
stipends. An alternative approach, based on grants, has not been adopted by the
ICBF, which believes that the experience gained from borrowing and repaying the
credit is valuable for the community mothers. The subsidy is efficiently
targeted on the poor (urban women and children mainly in the two lowest income
deciles) and is affordable in fiscal terms (peaking at a level of about
US$1.0 million annually during 1990-93).
8.       Overall HBI program coordination and implementation responsibility is
assigned to the ICBF Office of Planning, under the guidance of the Director
General, ICBF. This office has sufficient capacity to oversee the HBI
expansion, demonstrated by successful and rapid growth of the HBIs since 1987.
Though community participation would continue to be the cornerstone of program
management, additional technical advisors are being appointed to ensure adequate
coordination, and an experienced financial entity would be contracted to manage
the home-upgrading credits. The HBI expansion program has an estimated cost of
US$675 million equivalent during 1990-95 (April 1990 prices). The bulk of this
represents the direct costs of HBI service delivery, to be financed by the ICBF.
The project would finance key investment inputs of the program to ensure
continued effectiveness. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$40.2 million net of taxes and duties, of which US$9.4 million is expected to
be in foreign exchange. Retroactive financing, not to exceed 10 percent of loan
proceeds, would be used for project start-up activities from June 30, 1989.
Cost estimates and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
The timetable of key events of project processing is summarized in Schedule C.
The status of Bank Group operations in Colombia is shown in Schedule D. A map
of Colombia is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8028-CO, dated May 2,
1990, is also attached.
9.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to conduct
a joint, annual progress review centered on an agreed program of policy,
institutional and HBI serv_ce support and delivery activities. This review
would form the basis for joint Bank and Government agreement on succeeding
annual plans and budgets for the program, including the project. The Government
also agreed to submit, each year by November 30, the proposed HBI expenditure
program for the following year for Bank review. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that it would effect a real reduction of
30 percent in ICBF budget support for its center-based child-care program by



- 4 -
1995, and complete a study and time-bound action plan satisfactory to the Bank
for effecting further changes in future financing and management for this
program by June 30, 1991; complete studies anu time-bound action plans
satisfactory to the Bank on ICBF structure and staffing, by June 30, 1991, and
on the management, financing and marketing of Bienestarina, by December 31,
1991; and introduce the HBI impact evaluation and a new MIS for the ICBF by
June 30, 1991. The Government further agreed that each child would be fully
vaccinated prior to entering the HBI program and that criteria and arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank for identifying and meeting additional basic health
requirements of HBI children would be established by October 30, 1990. Finally,
the Government agreed to ensure efficient execution and appropriate financing
for the HBI program. Conditions for effectiveness would be the appointment of
technical advisors for HBI program coordination; the formal adoption of a
procedural manual satisfactory to the Bank for technical and financial
management of the home upgrading component; and the formal authorization of a
contract between ICBF and a financial entity with adequate experienre to manage
home-upgrading credits.
10.      Benefits and Risks.  Through the investment program for the HBIs, over
one million of the country's poorest pre-school children will benefit from
improved nutrition and health status and exposure to pre-school learning. The
economic and social benefits cf the approach are multiple. Investment in
nutrition and early education for disadvantaged chil(dren will have direct impact
on their capacity to take advantage of subsequent opportunities for schooling
and employment. For the community mothers, the program will provide modest
income and home improvement. For the mothers of the children enrolled in Lhie
program, the option is available to seek additional remunerative employment.
Finally, the program will serve as a catalyst for community participation and
mobilization in support of other self-help strategies for health, education and
slum improvement.
11.      The major project risk is that the HBI program may outstrip the mana-
gerial and financial capacities of ICBF, under the pressures of rapid expansion.
The managerial risk will be minimized by ICBF's implementation of well-conceive'
staffing plans and management procedures, by the designation of additional
program coordinating staff, and by measures to strengthen community-level
support and managerial capacity for the program. The financial risk will be
reduced by the implementation of measures to improve ICBF efficiency and to
target ICBF subsidies in favor of the poor and the HBIs, and away from higher-
cost care. Moreover, any necessary adjustments in the rate of program expansion
would be effected through the annual joint program reviews.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
