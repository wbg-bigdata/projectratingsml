PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
KENYA PROGRAM LOAN (LOAN 1117-KE)
PREFACE
This is an audit of performance under Program Loan 1117-KE
approved to the Government of Kenya in May 1975. The loan was fully
disbursed by the end of March 1976.
The audit Memorandum is based on the attached Project Comple-
tion Report (PCR) prepared by the Eastern Africa Regional Office and
research of relevant files and discussions with Bank staff. The Memo-
randum examines in detail the justification for the loan and supplements
the PCR as regards the implementation of agreed policies and economic
development in Kenya subsequent to the approval of the loan. Comments
were received from the Eastern Africa Regional Office and Policy Planning
and Program Review Department of the Bank.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
KENYA PROGRAM LOAN (LOAN 1117-KE)
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1117-KE to Kenya was approved in May 1975 to support a
re-orientation of its development program necessitated by adverse
changes in its balance of payments arising out of the sharp rise in
oil prices in 1974.
The audit report finds that the Government took measures, in
the fields of wage restraint, adjustment of agricultural prices and a
restructuring of development priorities in favor of agriculture and
local transport, on the lines indicated by it at the time of loan
approval. The improvement in the balance of payments, particularly in
1976, was due to exogenous factors, mainly a rise in the export prices
and volumes of coffee and tea. The impact of the policy measures is
likely to be felt only in the long run.
Other noteworthy points are:
- Improvement in agricultural project preparation capability
(para. II.5 of PPAM and paras. 19-20 of the PCR); and
- channelling counterpart funds for seasonal financing of
agriculture (para. 6 of the PCR).






PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
KENYA PROGRAM LOAN (LOAN 1117-KE)
Kenya was one of the countries which was "most seriously
affected" by the oil crisis in 1974. Its balance of payments on current
account deteriorated sharply and, in July 1974, the Government approached
the Bank for a program loan. The loan proposal was appraised in January
1975 and in May 1975, the Bank approved a loan of US$30 million. The
loan became effective on August 26, 1975 and was fully disbursed by the
end of March 1976.
I. Justification of the Loan
I.1       At the time the loan was appraised, there was little doubt that
Kenya faced an acute balance of payments problem; in 1974 expenditure on
imports rose by over 60%, largely as a result of a 50% rise in prices.
The deficit on current account was estimated at that time to be about
US$320 million and it was expected to rise to about US$360 million for
1975 and 1976 and to decline somewhat thereafter. In these circumstances,
the Government requested a program loan of US$100 million; the Bank, how-
ever, decided to make a smaller loan of US$30 million but agreed to
consider a further loan later in 1975.
I.2       Although Kenya's current account deficits in 1974 and 1975 were
substantially greater than they had been in the immediately preceding years,
the 1975 deficit, and particularly the 1976 deficit, were much less than
had been expected. In fact, economic events after 1974 turned out to be
quite different from what had been expected at the time the loan was made.
It had been thought that Kenya would have to cope with a serious balance
of payments problem probably until the end of the decade but, in fact, by
1976, partly due to a sharp increase in the price of coffee and, to a
smaller extent, tea, the current deficit had diminished to US$100 million,
a figure comparable to those of the years before 1974. By the end of 1975,
the changed situation had become apparent and it was decided that further
program assistance was not required.
I.3       The reasons for this changed situation are discussed in paragraph
4, 22 and 23 of the PCR. The major reasons were the world recession and
unfavorable weather which hit Kenya's exports and led to a period of
stagnation in Kenya which in turn produced substantially lower imports than
had been foreseen. The average real per capita income dropped in 1975,
leading to lower imports; an additional factor contributing to lower
imports was that the high imports of 1974 had increased inventories which
were gradually drawn down in 1975 and 1976. The PCR concludes that, despite
the recovery in the balance of payments in 1976, Kenya still has an under-
lying resource gap which is likely to reappear with increasing economic
activity.



- 2-
I.4       This analysis is in line with the general conclusinn of the
Bank's Basic Economic Report which was prepared in 1973 and issued early
in 1974. This report concluded that a shortage of foreign exchange would
be likely to be an effective brake on development and consequently Kenya
would have to orient its production more towards exports and to the
utilization of more domestic and fewer foreign inputs in the production
process.
I.5       The analysis of the Basic Report, which was generally accepted
by the Kenya Government, formed the background against which it announced,
in a Sessional Paper (Sessional Paper No. 4 of 1975 on Economic Prospects
and Policies) its intention to implement various policy measures. At the
same time, in order to contain the immediate loss of foreign exchange,
Kenya had taken a number of measures which had been agreed with the IMF
in connection with its use of IMF resources.
II. Policy Package
II.1      The policy package which formed the basis for the program loan
included both short-term and long-term measures intended to strengthen
the development process in the country. These measures related to wages
and prices, investment priorities, and strengthening of project prepara-
tion capability within the Agriculture Ministry. The action taken by the
Government in these areas has to be interpreted in the context of overall
economic trends in the country in 1975 and 1976 (particularly near-stagna-
tion in 1975 and, consequent upon a good monsoon, a 6% rise in GDP in
1976) and it is necessary to recognize that the impact of these measures
would take a longer time to work itself out.
II.2      (a) Short-term Measures:   As a short-term measure to safeguard
the development process in Kenya, the Government had proposed that the
rise in wage/salary income would be kept below the rise in prices. The
rise allowed in wages was graduated, being the highest for the lowest
paid wage earners, with the overall wage rise being kept below the rise
in the cost of living. The long-term aim is to correct urban-rural income
inequalities and to keep domestic price increases below international
price increases and, therefore, the Government is continuing to compensate
wage earners partially for cost of living increases.
II.3      (b) Long-term Strategy:   As long-term strategies, it was
expected that Kenya would raise producer prices of agricultural products
and rearrange its investment priorities in favor of agriculture and, in
the transport sector, towards feeder roads.
II.4      During 1975 and 1976, the Government announced increases in
producer prices which cumulated to 70% for wheat, 33% for maize and 65%
for sugarcane (see Annex II). The timing of the rise in producer prices
(January 1975 for maize and wheat, September 1976 for maize and wheat,
and March 1977 for cotton and sugarcane) was not such as to influence
effectively farmers' planting decisions.



- 3 -
11.5      The Government of Kenya took various steps to strengthen the
capabilities in the Ministry of Agriculture. It recruited through the
Harvard Institute for International Development a group of economists
to carry on work like annual price reviews, trends in relative prices
and management reviews and also long-term work, particularly relating
to the strategy of agricultural development. In addition, it set up,
within the Ministry of Agriculture, a project preparation unit with
three expatriate staff, with a view to increasing the number of projects
prepared for foreign financing. The Bank approved in fiscal 1977 four
projects in the agricultural sector in Kenya. It is estimated that at
least 11 projects will be prepared for foreign financing, some of them
by the Bank, during the next two years.
11.6      Development expenditure of the Government of Kenya continued to
rise during the period (Annex I.5). Within this outlay, however, the
Government brought about a shift in the allocation of the expenditure,
the share of agriculture rising to 29% in 1975-76 and 38% in 1976-77.
The proportionate share of highways in road investment, after showing a
fall in 1975, rose in 1976; however, it is likely to be brought down in
years (Annex I.6).
III. Conclusions
III.1     The program loan provided Kenya with much-needed foreign
exchange at a time of acute difficulty. Although the extent and duration
of Kenya's balance of payments problem eventually turned out to be markedly
less serious than was described in the appraisal report, the additional
exchange provided by the loan was clearly justified.
III.2     The loan also provided an opportunity for the Bank to continue
its dialogue with Kenya concerning future development strategy, which had
started with the Basic Economic Report. A number of measures were agreed
upon which together represented a shift in development policy. The Govern-
ment did in fact carry through the agreed measures and in this sense the
program loan can be said to have achieved its immediate objectives. How-
ever, assessing the eventual impact of the measures is difficult largely
for two reasons. First, the effect of the policies will only emerge in
the longer run and will depend upon whether the policies themselves
continue to be steadily pursued and, secondly, simultaneously with the
introduction of the measures the economy was seriously affected by a number
of exogenous factors which determined the course of economic events during
the years immediately following signature of-the loan.

PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA PROGRAM LOAN
(LOAN 1117-KE)
Introduction
1.         In July 1974, the Kenya Government submitted an initial request
for $100 million of program loan assistance because it expected major
balance of payments difficulties in 1975 and subsequent years. After pre-
appraisal in August 1974 of the need for help and the Government's Action
Program, the Bank indicated it would first consider a request for a smaller
amount for 1975 and would review the need for further program lending
later in the year. A $30 million Program Loan was appraised in January
1975, and negotiated in the field in March 1975. The loan was approved by
the Board on May 27, 1975, and became effective on August 26, 1975. 1/
Supervision took place through general economic discussions in October/
November 1975 and March/April 1976; the latter coincided with the preappraisal
of a second Program Loan for which the Government had reiterated its request
in March 1976. No need for 1976 balance of payments support was established
and it was decided to review the need for 1977 at a later stage. During the
Kenya CPP management review in December 1976 management decided that the
need for such a loan was no longer evident and the Second Program Loan was
therefore dropped from the lending program.

The Need for a Program Loan in 1975 and Actual Developments
3.         In order for Kenya to qualify for a Program Loan, the Bank had
to be satisfied that special circumstances had brought about a need for
balance of paymentn stupport in the form of quick-disbursing funds and that
the Government was undertaking a program of economic policies to redress the
underlying economic problems. There could be no doubt about the special
circumstances which Kenya faced starting in 1974 as a result of drought and
accelerating world inflation, including rapidly rising oil prices. Although
not one of the 25 least-developed countries in the world, Kenya had become
one of about 40 developing countries "most seriously affected" by oil price
increases, in view of its high dependence on imported sources of energy. The
need for balance of payments support was very evident at the time of negotiation
of the Program Loan in March 1975. The Bank's projections for 1975 and 1976
indicated overall balance of payments deficits of about $200 million and $180
million, respectively, following a deficit of $93 million in 1974. It was
expected that the IMF, which had already provided $39 million in 1974, plus
other donors would assist Kenya with about $120 million in 1975. The IBRD loan
of $30 million would bring the anticipated total of balance of payments support
up to approximately $150 million, leaving a residual gap which would have to be
financed by other means, principally commercial borrowing, or eliminated
through additional import restrictions.
4.         Actual developments during 1975 differed substantially from the
Bank's earlier forecast. The overall balance of payments deficit was only
some $75 million, principally because imports were more than $250 million below
the projected level. This low level of imports resulted in part from large
inventories of imported goods carried over from 1974 but primarily from stagnation
of the domestic economy 1/ - real GDP grew at only 0.7% instead of the anticipated
rate of 6.1%. Unfavorable weather which led to a disappointing performance in
agriculture was probably the major cause behind the economic stagnation; other
contributing factors were the continuation of slack demand in Kenya's overseas
markets and the Government's restrictive credit policies. The disappointing
outcome in agriculture was not offset by other sectors; although manufacturing
performed reasonably well with a real growth rate of 4%, the slow-down also
affected construction, trade and services (except Government and tourism). The
overall balance of payments deficit was fully covered through IMF assistance
($59 million), the Bank's Plrogram Loan ($17 million disbursed during 1975) and
balance of payments support from other donors ($15 million); the net result
was a slight buildup in Kenya's foreign exchange reserves, sufficient to
recover only one half of the loss in the previous year, Details of the 1975
balance of payments are given in the Table on page 3.
1/ A 14% devaluation of the Kenya shilling in October 1975 had only a slight
impact on imports during 1975.

Use of Program Loan Resources
5.        Wlile Kenya's actual need for balance of payments support during
1975 was less than originally anticipated, the assistance which was received
from the World Bank, IMF and other donors did permit a higher level of
certain essential imports than might otherwise have been possible. This
was particularly true for raw materials and intermediate goods for manufacturing
which t1te Program Loan financed. Only imports under SITC categories 2, 5, 6
and 7 were eligible for financing: consumer goods and luxury items were
excluded under a negative list. The anticipated disbursement period was six
months, July-December 1975, but this slipped to October 1975-March 1976 because
of a slight delay in effectiveness. However, the disbursement period remained
six months. Difficulties in processing reimbursement applications were
minimal due to assistance from the Controller's Division of RMFA to the Central
Banlk of Kenya.

6.         The Program Loan counterpart funds were to be used to help
provide support to the agricultural sector. They were therefore channelled
to the Cereals and Sugar Finance Corporation (CSFC), a legal entity within
the Ministry of Finance and Planning serving as the main channel for
seasonal financing to agriculture. The counterpart funds were to be allocated
only for those CSFC activities specified in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Government of Kenya and CSFC - specifically to finance purchases
of Kenya produce by the Maize and Produce Board and the Wheat Board and
their agents, which purchases were not financed from other external resources.
Upon repayment by the marketing boards to the CSFC, this entity did not have
to repay the counterpart funds to the Government, but could continue to
utilize them as part of its working capital. According to a CSFC statement
submitted to the Bank, CSFC received the counterpart funds from the Treasury
with some delays, but all before June 30, 1976. The delays did not cause
liquidity problems to CSFC and did not result in deficit financing in the
budget.
Program Loan Impact On Economic Policies
7.         One aspect of the economic impact of a Program Loan is its effective-
ness in sustaining imports and general economic activity on a higher level
than would otherwise have been possible in a situation of unanticipated
reductions in export earnings or of increases in import prices by providing
additional immediately disbursable foreign exchange and counterpart funds.
However, the wider impact which a Program Loan can have on economic policies
can be far more important. The Bank Group makes Program Loans in order
to support economic policy measures which address the underlying problems
which are aggravating the balance of payments situation. A Program Loan
therefore offers a unique opportunity for the Bank to stress, in an operational
context, the need for wider-ranging policy measures than can be raised in
project or sector lending. While the desirability and need for such policy
initiatives can be and is raised in our regular economic dialogue, it is
through program lending that we obtain the Government's commitment to under-
take specific actions.
8.         In the case of Kenya, overall economic performance during the previous
decade had been very good, although it had already become clear before the 1974
economic crisis that a change in development strategy would be necessary,
because continuation of the past import substitution strategy with heavy medium-
term import dependence would lead to a serious balance of payments constraint.
Also, the social impact of Government policies would benefit from changes in
sector emphasis. These were the major themes of the Government's 1974-78
Development Plan which was broadly consistent with the Bank's 1974 Basic Economic
Report. The international economic crisis in 1974 precipitated the balance of
payments constraint but the policy prescriptions remained essentially the same:
a restructuring of the economy through reallocation of investment towards
directly productive sectors, especially agriculture; more efficient use of all
resources; and a move away from capital and import intensive production in
favor of more labor intensive and domestic resource-based production. In
addition, short term measures to contain the outflow of foreign exchange were
now needed. Our continuous economic policy dialogue and large Bank Group
lending program placed the Bank in a strong position to advise the Government
on the needed restructuring and demand management policies.

N,.ny;1'. 6'olicY Objectives and Acli evements
I).       In July 1974, wheni the C.cvcrrment submitted its request for
program lendinig, a restrictive credit policy. higher interest rates, sales
tax Increases (especiallv on gasoline), increases in gasoline prices, and
Roine 1utcnsificatioio of import restrictions 1/ had already been introduced.
These measures aime(I at immediately lowering domestic demand and import
demand, especially for oil products.  The Government was aiming at
re-establishing a manageable balance of payments situation in the medium
term through these and other measures still under preparation, but foresaw
that balance of payments dcficits could not he prevented in the next few
years. Ilowever, the Government deliberatelv abstained from general import
controls as long as other solutions were still open. After preappraisal in
July/August 1974 of the tentative program submitted with the application,
thc Bank wrote to the Government 2/ describing in some detail the broader
program on whichi Bank and Government would have to reach an understanding as
a basie for the Program Loan. The most important part of the program would
be the structural measuresi proposed to move towards renewed growth in future,
ausuming that mensurps for short term balance of payments and demand manage-
mcnt would be adequiate.
in.       In late 1974 and early 1975 the Government formulated a comprehensive
Action Program to restructure the economy which was officially adopted by the
National ARsembly in April 1975.  This Program superseded the FY74-78 Develop-
ment Plan. M4eanwlhile, several additional measures had already been implemented,
in particular a 10% export compensation In October 1974 and substantial increases
in farmgate prices for major agricultural products in January 1975. The Bank 3/
accepted the Action Program as the basis for its Program Loan, after having
examined hoth the measures with short term impact taken earlier and the proposed
measures with longer-term impact. In addition, the Bank negotiated and
obtained three specific Government assurances relating to increased agricultural
prodtuction whlich were expressed in side letters- to the Loan Agreement.
13.       TIn' economic strategy underlying the Program was to restructure the
t1ero.omy as rapidly as possible in order to return to higlh rates of growth
with A permanently smaller foreign exchange availability than before. Therefore,
Kenya's 8 ;igh import dependence had to be reduced and a larger share of its
production had to be exported. The strategy implied that private and public
consumption be compressed in favor of maintaining investments which must be
channelled into the most directly-productive uses. Further, domestic inflation
had to be heldl down to encourage the substitution of domestic for imported
resnnUrces and to maintain Kenya's competitiveness in export markets.  In terms
of econolultc sectors this meant that agriculture would have to improve on its

previous good performance while industry would have to become more
efficient and outward looking. The social implications of this restructuring
were important.  With a slowdown of growth   in the medium term, average
income would drop in real terms and unemployment would rise. The Govern-
meult therefore stated that it would strive to protect the lower income groups
from the effects of these tncome losses.
12.       In order to Implement the Program, the Government intended to
employ global monetary and fiscal policies reinforced by credit allocation
measuires, agricultural pricing and wage policies.  General price control was
rejected as too inflexible to permit necessary adjustments in the economy.
Reallocation of public resources, both between recurrent and development and
witlhin development expenditure, played an important role in adjustment of
the public sector.
Monetary Policies
13.       The Government intended to control money and credit expansion in
order to permit economic recovery without causing excessive imports or
inflationary pressures. lUnder unchanged import licensing conditions, imports
1A(I shown a strong correlation to domestic credit movements.  Monetary policy
measures were therefore considered of direct importance for import levels.
A target for domestic credit expansion of 19% in FY76 was agreed upon with
the IMF. 1/ The allocation of credit to priority uses was also covered by
Government policies. Wfhile prevailing interest rates (which had been raised
by a few percentage points in 1974) were to act as the major instrument for
allocating credit, the banks were in addition directed to avoid speculative use
of credit (for instance for inventory buildup) and to give preference to
agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, export trade and to small businessmen
in these branches in particular.  Foreign-controlled firms in these branches
would retain limited access to domestic credit; other foreign-controlled firms
would have to find credit abroad.
1.4.      The actunl FY76 credit expansion of 25% was slightly above the
target of 19%. While the Central Bank was able to control the expansion of
net domestic assets of the banking system within the limits agreed with the
11fF, the liquidity of the system expanded by more than had been planned because
of a buildup of foreign exchange reserves. The Central Bank did not wish to
entirely neutralize the expansionary effect of this reserve increase because
economic activity was already depressed and this course of action carried
the risk of further depression. In fact, the Central Bank was forced to allow
a higher than planned expansion in bank credit to accommodate the unexpectedly
large need for budgetary deficit financing (see below). In doing so it
exceeded the ceilinpg for credit to the public sector agreed with the IIF, but
this expansion wnes somewhat offset by the fact that credit to the private sector
expanded by only l1% instead of the projected 13%. Real interest rates remained



- A.7 -
negative because of high linflation and could therefore not be a very
effective allocative instrument. The allocation of credit to priority
uses showed small improvements as a result of the Central Bank directives,
but for agricultural lending the target of 17% of commercial banks' net
assets was not reached. Existing bank practices (including requirement
of collateral plus regular wage income for instance) militated against
rapid expansion into risk-bearing ventures; new ways to promote the
banks' participation in expanding finance to agriculture have to be
developed, including indirect financing through public intermediaries.
The use of domestic credit by foreign-owned companies did decrease as
intended.
Budgetary Policies
15.       A realignment of budgetary policies was a key element of the
Government'a restructuring program. The Action Program incorporated a
three-year forward budget exercise (FY76-78) which greatly strengthened
medium-term policy formulation. The budgets beyond FY76 were brought into
line with the anticipated lower growth target for the economy as a whole
by reducing the target growth (in real terms) of recurrent expenditure
from 12% to 8% and of development expenditure from 11% to 6%. Within
recurrent expenditure, rapid growth of education expenditure had threatened
to cut into more directly production-related expenditure. Hence, the
Government set a ceiling to future education expenditure by allowing it to
grow only in step with average growth of recurrent expenditure; concrete
steps were adopted to reach that target, which ended the nearly automatic
promotion and the relatively rapid (as compared with other government workers')
salary increases of primary school teachers. Within development expenditure,
the emphasis was shifted from larger scale, longer gestation types of infras-
tructure investments to more quickly-yielding directly productive investments,
for example in agriculture (sugar). Moreover, within a decreased road
construction budget less trunk roads and more secondary and rural access
roads were to be built, with more labor intensive methods. In order to
finance the revised forward budget the average revenue growth target for
FY76-78 was set at 12% in real terms. A series of new tax measures was
introduced to achieve this target. These included higher sales taxes on
non-essential goods, making the tariff structure more uniform by increasing
import duties on capital goods and reducing protective duties on consumer
goods. After boosting domestic long-term financing as much as possible, foreign
financing would have to be increased, but was expected to cover a slightly
smaller proportion of development expenditures in FY76-78 than forecast in
the FY74-76 Development Plan (40% as against 42%).
16.       During FY76, the first year of the Action Program, the Government
experienced some successes and some shortfalls in budgetary policy. The
revenue growth target of 15% (in nominal terms) was exceeded by an actual
growth of 18%. Several, although not all, of the announced tax measures were



- A.8 -
implemented. The sales tax on luxury goods was increased from 10%
to 20% and import duties on luxuries and petroleum were increased (with
the largest cars now paying 150% duty). Import duties on a range of
formerly duty-free raw materials and capital goods were introduced, but
the Government felt itself unable to reduce tariffs on final products.
Wlile revenue performance was encouraging, recurrent expenditures increased
even more rapidly (19% growth in nominal terms vs. a target of 13%). Some
excess expenditure arose from imported inflation, but most of the expansion
resulted from factors which were under Government's control. Under the
threat of a costly general strike a wage increase was granted which caused the
Government payroll to exceed the originally budgeted amount. 1/ In addition
some expenditures occurred which had not been authorized by Parliament; to
offset this tendency measures which tightened budget procedures were introduced
in April 1976. Within the development budget the performance fell below
expectations; only 23% growth in nominal terms vs. a target of 38%. Moreover,
because inflation was much higher than anticipated the growth in development
spending in real terms was only about 3%. However, a pronounced shift in
composition of the development budget brought the share of the directly
productive sectors from 29% in FY74 to 45% in FY76. Simultaneously, a shift
away from heavy infrastructure and towards rural access roads and rural water
supply did take place. The overall budgetary outcome was a large deficit
which obliged the Government to borrow domestically, to some extent on long-
term, but mostly short-term, with inevitable inflationary impact.
Wage and Price Policies
17.       New wage guidelines were promulgated which limited the weighted
average wage increase to somewhat less than cost of living increases in
order to avoid an inflationary wage-price spiral. Increases were to be tapered
with the lowest wage earners receiving full compensation and the higher wage
earners progressively less or no compensation at all. As further protection
for the lowest paid workers, the Action Program set increases in minimum wages
for rural and urban areas. Meanwhile, increased agricultural prices were to
be passed on to consumers. In general, domestic price inflation was to be
held well below the increase in import prices, so as to facilitate replacement
of imported by domestic resources and keep Kenya's exports competitive.
18.       The Government's wage and price policies did not accomplish their
intended objective. While the actual increases in minimum wages were some-
what larger than foreseen, they did not prevent a fall in real incomes for
urban workers in the modern sector. The cost of living index for lower
income urban wage earners increased by 20% in 1975 and at least 10% in 1976.
Imported inflation, the October 1975 devaluation, and the increases in
1/ However, the Government did allow its workers less than full compensation
for cost of living increases since 1973, in accordance with its general
wage guidelines. Moreover, school teachers were now subject to the general
wage guidelines as well.



- A.9 -
agricultural prices all contributed to this rapid price increase. In
comparison, import prices (measured in foreign currency) went up by 18%
in 1975 and an estimated 4% in 1976. Hence, the Government was not
successful in moderating domestic vis-a-vis international inflation by
controlling domestic prices. Instead, Kenya corrected the relationship
between domestic and foreign prices to some extent by devaluing the Kenya
shilling, at the cost, however, of introducing the upward push of higher
import prices into the price equation. However, the Government's price
policies did benefit the rural sector. The national accounts indicate that
while average real per capita incomes fell in 1975 and increased only
marginally in 1976 farmers' real incomes increased substantially over the
period.
Agricultural Prices and Other Measures
to Boost Production
19.       In order to increase agricultural production, reduce imports of
agricultural products and increase exports, the Action Program stressed
measures to boost agriculture. The Program Loan focussed on this sector in
particular because of its overriding importance in the restructuring process. 1/
The Bank obtained three specific assurances relating to agricultural policies
and programs in side letters from the Government:
1. accelerated agricultural project preparation;
2. strengthening the planning and implementation capacity
of the Ministry of Agriculture; and
3. review of agricultural prices.
20.       On the first point progress in project preparation has been achieved
by strengthening the staff of the Economic Planning Division of the Ministry
of Agriculture, including a Bank Seconded Advisor. The Bank can now expect
proposals for    three agricultural projects per year including a new style
"Integrated Agricultural Development" effort as against two agricultural projects
in FY74 and FY75. Second, the strengthening of the planning and implementation
capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture is in fact a long term program in
which Kenyan agricultural economists will gradually staff this function, as
they become available from the small number of graduates; meanwhile, as an
interim solution, the Government agreed under the Program Loan to recruit up
to 13 expatriate advisers in the next five years. Some delay occurred in
making arrangements for these advisory posts but an agreement was signed in
mid-1976 with the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID) to
act as the recruiting agency and provide administrative support for the
incoming individual experts, who were not to work as a separate team within
the Ministry. At the Government's request, a number of donor agencies
contributed to a financial pool managed by the Government for this program.
The World Bank did not contribute to this pool, but indicated that the Bank's

seconded adviser already working in the Ministry of Agriculture would
cooperate closely with the new advisers. Between July 1976 and
January 1977 most of the selected individuals took up their duties in
the Ministry, so that this assurance with regard to planning was (belatedly)
honored. The management capability of the Ministry will be analyzed by a
Management Systems Evaluation Unit also recently created and staffed but
this is clearly a long term task. Another part of this assurance which
remains to be followed up is strengthening planning and implementation in
other agencies active in the agricultural sector.
21.       The third assurance concerned providing "adequate incentives
through the pricing system to maintain or increase agricultural production".
Adequate price incentives form the single most important tool in agricultural
policies. Their level should be guided by import or export parities at the
shadow rate of exchange rather than the actual rate. Review of agricultural
producer prices over the past years had been generally regular and timely,
but occasionally prices had been set under the influence of sudden changes
in market outlook or non-economic considerations. The price announcements
in January 1975, just before the Program Loan was negotiated, covered a
range of crops and took import and export parities into account. This was
the type of pricing policy measures that the Bank wanted to encourage. The
Government confirmed its existing legal obligations to keep the level of
producer prices "under review in the light of the cost of inputs and changes
in incomes earned in other sectors" and also to announce prices well before
planting time. Subsequent price decisions in January 1976 were less general
in nature because only a few crop prices needed adjustment at that time,
but the Government has continued to adhere to the pricing principles agreed
during the Program Loan discussions.
Actual Economic Development in 1975-76
22.       Summarizing paragraphs 13-21, we can say that Kenya's policy
implementation was generally in line with its Action Program, with the noted
exception of inflation control. Actual developments in the Kenyan economy
were however quite different from the projected scenario. This was because
unforeseen and strong exogenous factors, unfavorable weather, continued
world inflation and recession abroad offset to a considerable extent the
Government's policy actions. As a result, 1975 was probably the most difficult
year in Kenya's economic history so far. Instead of a somewhat slower but
continued growth of about 5-6% accompanied by expanding employment, economic
activity stagnated in 1975. This was mainly due to a decline in agricultural
production. Although farmgate price increases elicited a favorable response
in the case of maize, to the extent that substantial exports became possible,
for other crops such as wheat, bad weather conditions prevented a similar
result. It was not possible in the short term to offset this disappointing
performance of the major economic sector by boosting other production sectors.

23.       The expenditure pattern showed a general adjustment in the
required direction. Overall consumption was compressed by combined
price, tax and wage policies. Private consumption bore the brunt of this
reduction, with a drop in per capita consumption of 2% in 1975; public
consumption, on the contrary, increased as a result of imperfect budgetary
control and public sector wage increases. Investment in fixed assets
increased slightly in real terms thanks to the Government's determination
to maintain momentum in the development budget; private investment also
held up fairly well because of continued confidence in Kenya's economic
management. Inventories which had soared in 1974 were slowly drawn down
until well into 1976. Within the public investment category there was a
definite shift at the margin toward more directly productive sectors.
Imports fell drastically in real terms for a variety of reasons. Exports
fell as well but to a lesser degree due to adverse weather and recession
overseas; these factors offset the export compensation and devaluation-
related incentives to exporters. Overall these changes in expenditure
pattern reflected a mixture of business cycle and structural effects.
Although it is difficult to quantify, we think that most of the decline
in imports was due to economic recession and only a small proportion
represents a structural decline in import-propensity. In the absence so
far of major growth spurt of exports, we take the cautious attitude that
Kenya's underlying resource gap is still large and will reappear with the
resumption of a higher level of economic activity.
24.       Bringing inflation under control within one year proved to be a
task which exceeded the Government's capabilities. It was complicated by
exogenous factors (decelerating but continuing high inflation abroad) and
the decision to pass on the necessary increase in agricultural prices and
costs of social services to the consumer for budgetary reasons; the
unexpectedly large budget deficit also added fuel to domestic inflation.
General price controls were deliberately not used so as to permit the economy
to adapt itself with the necessary flexibility to the new situation. Wage
increases which were somewhat higher than intended added some demand pull
(and also wage push, although entrepreneurs were formally not allowed to pass
these costs on to customers).
25.       The social implications of the restructuring policy were generally
as projected although the stagnation of the economy resulted in an erosion
of average per capita incomes and a drop in modern sector employment. The
Government generally managed to make the higher income groups bear a larger
share of the burden than the lower income groups through higher duties and
sales taxes on luxury goods than on essential goods and by tapering of wage
increases. The urban-rural terms of trade finally moved in favor of the
rural areas after many years of an opposite movement, mainly thanks to important
increases in farmgate prices.

Impact of the Bank's Program Loan on
Government Policies
26.       There is a difficult timing problem involved in assessing
the impact of a program loan within less than one year of the conclusion
of disbursements. In the first place exogenous factors have interfered
with the Government's ability to control aggregate supply and demand in
the short run. In the second place, it would clearly be unrealistic to
expect fundamental structural changes within one year, or perhaps even
within five years, as is implicit in the IMF's balance of payments
projections. The important question is whether movements in the right
direction have been initiated - whether the Government has adopted
the right package of policy actions and whether it gives evidence of
continuing to implement these measures. In the case of this Program Loan
for Kenya it must also be borne in mind that the operation was initially
seen as the first in a series which would contribute to strengthening
the Government's hand to carry out a comprehensive medium term restructuring
program over a number of years. Nevertheless, in our opinion the actual
changes in policies already implemented under the Government's Action
Program, the Government's seriousness of purpose in adhering to these
policies, and its declared intention to introduce further restructuring
measures in the near future (in industrial policy in particular) represent
a strong response to the economic problems, both short and longer-term,
which Kenya confronted. Furthermore, we believe that the program loan
operation assisted the Government in formulating and articulating a more
comprehensive and consistent policy program and in more rapid and timely
implementation than would otherwise have been true. This is particularly
the case for the assurances which were obtained on agricultural policy,
strengthening the planning and implementation capacity of the Ministry
of Agriculture, reorienting the Ministry of Works away from trunk road
construction in favor of more rural access roads, and introducing a ceiling
on education expenditures in the face of strong teacher trade unions. The
traditionally sound economic management of the Kenya Government leads us
to believe that these policies would eventually have been introduced in
any case, but the program loan operation enabled us to focus greater
attention on policy issues which we had already been discussing with
the Government in our continuing economic dialogue and to obtain concrete
actions when they were most needed.

Attachment I
Commitments to IMF
The IMF also accepted the Action Program as a basis for its
lending to Kenya. While conditions attached to several IMF facilities
such as the oil facilities were rather light, the situation was different
in the case of the new Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Kenya was the first
country to reach an agreement with the IMF on a three-year financing
atnd policy program under the EFF. Under the EFF, the IMF made available
SDR67.2 million (about $79 million) to Kenya for use over the period July
1975 through June 1978, under the condition that the IMF would determine
the phasing of the amounts, by setting six-months ceilings for the cumulative
drawings under EFF, and the Government would generally implement its Action
Program and in particular observe the performance criteria established from
year to year with the IMF. Two performance criteria were defined for the
period July 1975 through June 1976: (1) Government borrowing from the banking
system would be limited to KSh 350 million (with a seasonal maximum of KSh 450
million); and (2) net domestic assets 1/ of the Central Bank would not exceed
KSh 490 million by June 30, 1976 which would imply a total domestic credit
expansion of 19%. As mentioned in paragraph 14, Government borrowing from
the banking system exceeded the target by December 1975, which blocked Kenya's
access to EFF for the remainder of the first year of EFF. Since foreign
exchange requirements were lower than projected, this did not depress imports
and growth. The second target, increase in net domestic assets of the Central
Bank, was adhered to.
I/ Defined as the sum of currency issued and non-bank
private deposit liabilities, minus net foreign assets.
