STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
16                                         I.  SECTORAL CONTEXT
Country Background
1.01     The total population of Turkey in 1980 was about 45 million with
24 million (56%) and 21 million (44%) living in urban and rural areas res-
pectively. The population growth rate, which during the period 1970-1979
averaged about 2.5% (4.1% for urban and 0.3% for rural areas), is projected to
gradually decrease and the population is estimated to reach about 58 million
by 1990. Istanbul /l and Ankara are the two largest cities in the country
with about 3.2 million and 1.9 million people respectively, or 21% of the
total urban population.
1.02     The country's total area is about 780,600 km2 with 97% in Asia and
3% in Europe. In physical terms it may be broadly divided into three
regions: (i) the 7,200 km long coastal region, with precipitation exceeding
600 mm per annum, is the most industrialized and developed area; (ii) Central
Anatolia, an arid plateau with precipitations between 250-300 mm, is sparsely
settled and less developed than the first region; and (iii) Eastern Anatolia,
a mountainous region with a harsh climate, is the least developed.
1.03     Water resources are abundant with only minor areas of scarcity.
Underground water is generally available in large quantities.
Sector Organization and Development
1.04     Traditionally, the provision of water supply and sewerage services
has been the responsibility of municipalities and village councils. How-
ever, the local bodies have lacked the financial resources and, except for a
few major cities, the technical capabilities for discharging this function.
Thus, planning, design and construction of new systems have been gradually
absorbed by three central government organizations, which were originally
established as advisory and financing agencies. These organizations are:
(a) The State Hydraulic Works (DSI) in the Ministry of Power and Natural
Resources which is the agency responsible for national water
resources and is concerned with water supply development
/1 Refer to previous Istanbul Municipality (para. 2.04).



-2-
for towns with a population exceeding 100,000, presently 27. DSI
has its headquarters in Ankara and operates 21 regional offices.
(b) Iller Bankasi (Bank of the  Provinces (IB)) which is the autonomous
corporation responsible for water supply development for towns
with a population of less than 100,000 and for sewage disposal in
all urban areas except Istanbul. IB has its headquarters in Ankara             &
and operates 16 regional offices. Its shareholders are the muni-
cipalities.
(c)  The Directorate for Roads, Water and Electricity (YSE) in the
Ministry of Rural Affairs and Cooperatives which is responsible
for rural programs including the provision of community water
supply, but excluding rural sanitation for which no agency has
been specifically assigned.
1.05     As could be expected under the existing sector organization,
scarce experienced staff had been dispersed sometimes creating serious gaps
or unnecessary overlapping. Alternative sector arrangements had been con-
sidered, in particular at the 1978 Conference on Planning and Development
of Community Water Supply and Sanitation in Turkey. Major changes, how-
ever, were not to be made until, by Executive Order of February 1981
sanctioned by law of December 1981, the new Government created greater
municipal areas. This is expected to improve planning and implementation
of municipal services.
1.06     With the creation of greater municipal areas in 1981, the water
supply and sewerage services of the small municipalities were merged with
those of the nearest large urban centers, such as Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir,
etc.  In the case of Istanbul, the water supply services of 24 surrounding
municipalities were merged with those of ISI, the semi-autonomous Water
Supply Authority established in 1933, while all sewerage services were
vested into a municipal Sewerage Department. ISI was responsible for works
operation and maintenance as well aLs for bulk supply for a score of small
municipalities, while DSI has undertaken project preparation and
implementation.
1.07     The most important institutional reform, however, and one which
may set the pattern for other urban areas, was initiated with the creation
by Law 2560 of Novexnber 20, 1981, of the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage
General Directorate (ISKI), as an autonomous entity responsible for the
planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of all water
supply and sewerage facilities in Greater Istanbul. Of particular signi-
ficance, the new law gives ISKI's General Council the right to set water
tariffs and sewerage charges without, as in the past, having to seek prior
approval of the Municipality or the Central Government. The new arrange-
ments should enable ISKI to meet its financial obligations and to finance a
gradually increasing share of its investments with internally generated
funds (para. 1.18).

Water Supply and Sewerage Service Levels
1.08      Estimated water supply service levels (1979) are as follows /i:
Urban Population Rural Population Total Population
millions      %    millions        %    millions       %
Adequate supply              14.4       63       12.9       63       27.3       63
Inadequate supply             3.2       14        4.5       23        7.7       18
No public supply              5.3       23        2.8       14        8.1       19
22.9      100       20.2      100       43.1      100
Population with adequate supply are those served by public piped systems
(either house connections or standpipes) and receiving a satisfactory
service from quantity and convenience viewpoints. Inadequate supply means
insufficiency and intermittence in water availability and distribution.
1.09      Sewer systems exist only in the major cities serving about
4.4 million people or 18% of total urban population. None of these systems
include treatment, and only a few have adequate disposal facilities.
Precarious sanitary conditions prevail, particularly in high density, low
income, urban areas.
1.10     The insufficiency of sewage systems and the indiscriminate dis-
posal of domestic and industrial liquid and sol-d wastes have caused
serious deterioration of rivers and coastal sea waters increasing consider-
ably the dangers of contaminating drinking water supplies. According to
public health statistics, 38% of water samples tested (during 1977) were
unsatisfactory from a bacteriological viewpoint. Water related diseases
are endemic with outbreaks occurring annually. In 1977 the total recorded
number of such cases exceeded 15,000 with 143 deaths. In 1970, a cholera
epidemic in Istanbul caused 52 deaths, and was attributed to unsatisfactory
sanitary conditions.
Service Levels Objectives
1.11     The water supply and sewerage service level objectives as formu-
lated during the 1978 Conference (para. 1.05) would be: (i) by 1990 the
total urban and rural populations would be covered with adequate water
supplies; (ii) by 1990 the total rural population would be covered with
satisfactory excreta disposal facilities; and (iii) by 2000 total urban
population would be provided with satisfactory sewerage and sewage disposal
facilities.
1.12      The above objectives (para. 1.11) are ambitious and unlikely to be
met in the time frame originally envisaged. The National Action Committee
set up in connection with the U.N. Water Decade has established a number of
/I    Source:  Community Water Supply and Sanitation, Rapid Assessment of
Current and Prospective Sector Development, WHO, 1979.

priorities. Their realization, however, will depend in large part on
available financial and human resources. These matters will be addressed
further in a sector study and during project supervisions.
Sector Investment Program
1.13     The water supply and sewerage sector investments during the third
Five Year Plan (1973-1977), which represented about 5.5% of total public
investments, were divided between urban water supply, rural water supply
and urban sewerage in the proportions 50%, 39% and 11% respectively.
1.14     The investment program for the fourth Five Year Plan (1978-1982),
which represents about 3.5% of total public investments, shows that.
(i) sector investments would be divided between urban water supply, rural
water supply and urban sewerage in the proportions of 37%, 46% and 17%
(actual for 1978-80, 45%, 35% and 20%) respectively; and (ii) the amounts
allocated during the first three years represent about 80% of the funds
requested.
1.15     A comparison between the 1973-1977 and the 1978-1982 investment
plans indicates that rural water suipply and sewerage are getting increased
priority over urban water supply, and that the sector's share of total
public investments is decreasing.  During 1973-81, sector investments for
water supply and sewerage in the Istanbul Municipality represented about 8%
and 1% respectively of total country sector investments. The budget
allocations are inadequate compared to the needs of the sector and their
proportional reduction would be caused by the competing demands from other
sectors considered more important for the country's economic recovery.
1.16     The sector investments have been planned in five year increments
rather independently by the different sector agencies (para. 1.04) and
although budgets have been prepared, the utilization of the funds could be
improved by better inter-agency coordination. Capital investments have
been financed by Government grants or low interest rate loans, which in the
past have seldom been repaid.
1.17     Except in the major cities, water tariffs have been insufficient
to even cover operating expenses. Sewer connection charges have been
levied but sewage disposal service has so far been free. Thus operational
and maintenance costs for sewerage and sewage disposal systems and to a
certain extent also for water supply systems have been covered by municipal
budget allocations.
1.18     It is the Government's intention to enable the sector entities to
become financially viable through appropriate tariff levels for water
supply and the introduction of sewerage charges. Water Supply and Sewerage
entities are also expected to finance a gradually increasing proportion of
their investment requirements through internal cash generation.

Previous Bank Involvement
Prior Bank involvement in the sector consists of.
(a) Loan 844-TU of June 30, 1972 for US$37.0 million to the Government
and passed on to the former Istanbul Water Administration (ISI)
for the expansion of the Istanbul water supply system. The loan
was fully disbursed as of March 1982 and the Project Completion
Report is under preparation. The project implemented by ISI was
substantially delayed due to institutional and financial
constraints,and ISI's difficulties in attracting and retaining
competent staff. The additional water supply provided under the
project helped to maintain a relatively good level of service
which is expected to improve considerably as leak detection and
other improvements under way start yielding results. More
importantly, the project contributed to institutional development
in the establishment of ISKI as an autonomous entity responsible
for the Greater Istanbul Municipality area (para. 1.07). This
will facilitate the rational planning, execution and financing of
water supply and sewerage services. The experience gained from
the implementation of the Water Supply Project has been
incorporated in the proposed project to ensure timely execution
and financing arrangements.
(b) IDA Credit 324-TU of June 30, 1972 for US$2.3 million for the
preparation of master plans and studies for urban development
programs in Istanbul. This Credit partly helped to prepare the
Camp-Tek-Ser report on sewerage and sewage disposal (para. 3.01)
and review the master plan for sewage disposal in the Istanbul
area.
(c) Loan S-15TU of December 12, 1979 for US$6.0 million to the
Government and passed on to TKI (National Turkish Coal Board) to
develop methods of manufacturing smokeless fuel from lignite, and
to investigate other possible technologies which may provide a
cleaner fuel in order to reduce air pollution in Ankara. This
project is still in the early implementation stage.
II. POPULATION, SECTOR SERVICES AND
DEMAND IN PROJECT AREA
Project Area
2.01     Istanbul, the capital of the former Byzantine and Ottoman Empires
and one of the oldest historical cities of the world, is the foremost
cultural, industrial and economic center of Turkey.



- 6 -
2.02      Industrial growth started on the European side around the Golden
Horn and later spread to the Bakirkoy area in the direction of the airport
along the northe'rn shore of the Sea of Marmara. On the Asian side of
Istanbul, industrial growth has concentrated mainly in the Kartal area,
away from the densely populated areas. Greater Istanbul's industrial
growth has been accompanied by heavy migration and accelerated
proliferation of large squatter settlements (Gecekondus). Map IBRD 16225
shows an outline of the Greater Istanbul area.
2.03     The physical component of the project will mainly be located in
the area of the medieval walled city, the most densely populated area of
Istanbul. This area is bounded by the old city wall to the West, the
Golden Horn to the North, the Bosplhorus to the East, and the Sea of Marmara
to the South.
Population Projections
2.04     Population projections as prepared by the Istanbul Master Plan
Bureau through the year 2000 have been shown separately for previous
Istanbul Municipality, 24 surrounding municipalities and Greater Istanbul
Municipality (para. 1.06).

These projections take into account existing master plans for urban devel-
opment, and other factors such as growth potential, land availability and
industrial development.
Population Served and Standard of Water and
Sewerage Services in Project Area

2.06     Pertinent comments on the existing water supply systems may be
summarized as follows: (i) the water supply is obtained from 4 major and
about 10 minor surface water sources with a maximum production capacity of
900,000 m3/day; (ii) the proportions of domestic and industrial/commercial
consumption and unaccounted-for water, are about 42%, 18% and 40% /1,
respectively; (iii) the water availability at domestic connections averages
about 100 1/cd; and (iv) the water supply is intermittent in about 15% of the
supply area and operation and maintenance standards can generally be described
as inadequate. The production capacity could be considered as sufficient for
the time being while the water distribution facilities need to be improved and
extended.

lack of proper maintenance equipment, combine to make the operation of the
systems expensive and difficult. The Istanbul Municipality has so far not
been able to operate its system satisfactorily.
2.09     Accurate data on sewerage coverage of different population groups
are not available, but the lack of satisfactory sanitation is particularly
prevalent in high density and in squjatter areas (para. 2.02).
Existing Sewage Disposal Systems and Receiving Water Bodies
2.10     The Greater Istanbul area is divided into 14 major drainage zones
with sewage flowing by gravity to the nearest receiving water body. The
outfall mains end close to the shorelines, which (except in the Bosphorus)
provide limited dispersion and causes extensive shore pollution. The
problem is aggravated by indiscriminate solid waste disposal.
2.11     About 90% of the effluents goes into the Golden Horn and the Sea
of Marmara and 10% into the Bospihorus. About 80% of industrial waste is
discharged into the Golden Horn and along Bakirkoy into the Sea of Marmara,
the remaining 20% is discharged in the Bosphorus and the Asian side of the
Sea of Marmara.
2.12     The water flows from the Aegean Sea through the Dardanelles, the
Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus to the Black Sea as a bottom current.
Conversely a surface current witlh lower water salinity flows from the Black
Sea to the Aegean Sea.
2.13     The Golden Horn receives a significant domestic and industrial
pollution load, which in its inner portion far exceeds the dispersion and
assimilative capacity of the water body and results in anaerobic condi-
tions. Because of comparatively strong currents, the effluents discharged
into the Bosphorus are better dispersed. Surface currents bring polluted
water from the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus into the Sea of Marmara.
2.14     The Sea of Marmara with its attractive shorelines constitutes the
best recreational area for the Istanbul population, but the water quality
is gradually deteriorating with increasing population and effluent dis-
charge. Water samples taken at public beaches frequently show unacceptable
levels of coliform bacteria content.
Demand for Services
2.15     Although the production and distribution capacities of the water
supply system have recently been extended (para. 1.19), the population
increase has been such that they are still inadequate to meet medium-term
requirements. Extension of the sewage networks has not kept pace with the
increased water supply; neither has any provision been made for appropriate
waste disposal facilities. The decision to concentrate at present on the
extension of sewerage services and on pollution reduction accurately
reflects current priority. Subsequently, investments will be made for the
augmentation of water production and distribution facilities.

III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01     Two comprehensive sewerage and sewage disposal master plan studies
have been carried out for the Greater Istanbul area, i.e., the Damoc report
and the Camp-Tek-Ser report completed in 1971 and 1975 respectively.  In
1978 it was decided to up-date the Camp-Tek-Ser study, to further evaluate
some alternative technical proposals and to include detailed engineering
for three major drainage areas - Yenikapi, Kabatas and Uskudar (Map
IBRD 16625). Consultant, Nedeco (Holland), was appointed at the end of
1979 and the work was mainly completed by end-1980. Concurrently detailed
engineering was prepared for the Kadikoy-Kartal drainage area by a local
consultant (Tek-Ser) engaged by Iller Bankasi (para. 1.04).
3.02     The Nedeco study was financed in part by a US$ 0.5 million advance
from the Bank Project Preparation Facility approved August 18, 1978.
Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Master Plan
3.03     Map IBRD 16225 shows drainage areas and major sewerage and sewage
disposal works as proposed to be executed during the master plan period
(through 2020).  Data on population and cost estimates (including engi-
neering and contingencies) for those drainage areas (referred to as the
four drainage areas) that have been subject to detailed engineering
(para. 3.01) are as follows;

4,671         5,105            500
3.04     The implementation of proposed works in the four drainage areas,
because of financial and project implementation constraints, have been
phased out taking into account considerations such as: (i) the extension
of secondary sewage networks has precedence because of significant
associated health benefits; and (ii) since the Sea of Marmara is
extensively used for recreational purposes, the reduction of pollution in
this area has higher priority than in the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn,
which establishes priority of Yenikapi and Kadikoy-Kartal over Kabatas and
/1 Refers to pre-treatment works and outfall main only.

Uskudar. However, alternative technical solutions still remain to be
elaborated for the Kadikoy-Kartal pretreatment works and pumping station
(para. 3.01).
3.05     The Project, to be executed as a first stage extension of the
master plan during the period 1982-1987, would basically cover the Yenikapi
drainage area and would be composed of:
(i)  extension of secondary sewage networks mainly to be concentrated
to the Yenikapi drainage area to achieve optimum population
coverage (para. 6.07) ind utilize proposed sewage intercepting and
disposal facilities; and
(ii)  sewage intercepting and disposal facilities including interceptors
along the Golden Horn (Alibeykoy) and the Sea of Marmara
(Sarayburnu-Bakirkoy), a t:unnel (Fatih) connecting the Alibeykoy
interceptor to the pre-treatment works, pre-treatment works and
pumping stations at Yenikapi, pumping mains and a submarine out-
fall main at Ahirkapi.
The project would cover about 60% of projected water supply and sewerage
sector investments in Greater Istanbul Municipality during the project
implementation period 1982-1987.
Project Objectives
3.06     The major project objectives would be:
(i) to extend and improve ithe coverage of sewerage services, by reha-
bilitation and extension of the secondary sewage systems to about
60% of the total population in the Greater Istanbul Municipality
covering about 70% of the low income group;
(ii) to improve the environmental conditions by the reduction of the
amount of sewage being discharged along the shorelines of the
Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara by the construction of a sewage
intercepting system;
(iii) to provide satisfactory sewage disposal by the construction of
pre-treatment facilitiess and a deep submarine outfall main;
(iv) to improve the institutional capacity in project preparation and
implementation, operation and maintenance, and financial manage-
ment by the developmenit of a suitable organization; and
(v) to assure financial self-sufficiency by the introduction of
adequate water supply and sewerage charges.
3.07     The project would also aim at developing for the Istanbul area,
and for the country as a whole, procedures for pollution control. For this
purpose, industrial wastewater and oceanographic surveys would be carried
out (para. 3.30).
3.08     The project would provide a pattern for sewerage and waste dis-
posal system operation which would be adaptable to other urban areas and
would thus have an impact on overaLl sectoral development.

Technological Aspects
3.09     The sub-division of the Greater Istanbul area into drainage zones
follows the topography, which is also a determinant in the possible loca-
tion of sewage outfall points.  The design of outfall mains and preceeding
sewage treatment works is interrelated. A high degree of sewage treatment
would enable use of a short and shallow outfall main while the opposite
would apply to a low degree of sewage treatment.  The latter solution has
been found the most economical. After pre-treatment, the sewage effluent
would be dispersed at the mouth of the Bosphorus in the bottom current
(para. 2.13) through a submarine outfall main equipped with diffusers to be
laid at a maximum water depth of about 50 m. Through this arrangement, an
initial dilution of about I to 100 will be achieved, which, because of the
significant flow will increase rapidly enabling a natural treatment process
to take place without causing environmental problems.  The Bosphorus pro-
vides significantly better conditions for effluent discharge than the Sea
of Marmara and any discharge into the Golden Horn should ultimately be
avoided.
3.10     Comparative studies have been carried out between combined and
separate outfalls for the Kabatas and Yenikapi drainage areas with the
latter solution evaluated as the most economical. Interceptors to be laid
in open cut trenches have also been evaluated as less expensive and more
suited to the local conditions than the alternative construction of tun-
nels. A short tunnel (Fatih) to be constructed in rock material will,
however, be required to connect the Alibeykoy interceptor to the pre-
treatment works. The Archeological Commission, when reviewing the proposed
works, concurred that the construction of a short tunnel would minimize
archeological implications and would be preferable to an open cut trench.
The pre-treatment plant in Yenikapi has been sited in the industrial zone
next to a solid waste landfill in order to minimize nuisance to adjoining
neighborhood.
3.11     The design basis for interceptors, pre-treatment works and outfall
main is shown in Annex 1, Table 2. The interceptors, with overflow cham-
bers along the shorelines of the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara, are
designed for four and two times the average dry weather flow respectively,
which takes into account the assimilative capacities of the receiving water
bodies.  The Yenikapi drainage area is expected to reach its saturation
capacity regarding population density by early next century and the project
components have been designed for the ultimate requirements.
3.12     The various project components recommended for implementation
represent least cost solutions at a discount rate of 10%. The design cri-
teria used are appropriate.
Project Composition and Description of Project Components
3.13     The project would include the following major components-.
(i) laterals and collectors, about 285 km; (ii) interceptors, 26 km;
(iii) tunnel, 2.4 km; (iv) pre-treatment works with in and outlet pumping
stations (eight pumps); (v) pumping mains, 2.3 km; and (vi) submarine
outfall main, 2.0 km. Sewer connections are not included in the project
since related costs are borne directly by the customers, which is standard
practice.



- 12 -
3.14     The project would also cover:  (i) consulting services and/or
technical assistance for project martagement and construction supervision;
identification and preparation of future projects for development and
extension of water supply and sewage disposal facilities; initial
supervision of the concrete pipe manufacturing; financial, accounting,
tariff and training matters; (ii) industrial wastewater and oceanographic
surveys for pollution control; (iii), laboratory facilities and operational
and maintenance equipment for water supply and sewage systems including
water leak detection equipment and meters; and (iv) the establishment of a
regional training center.
3.15     The following works are also planned to be executed in the Greater
Istanbul Municipality during the project implementation period outside the
scope of the project; (i) water production facilities, transmission and
distribution mains; and (ii) laterals and collectors, about 300 km. The
water distribution and sewage networks will be executed mainly in areas to
be developed and the costs will basically be covered by developers and con-
sumers.
3.16     Population projected to be served by sewer connections during the
project period (Annex 1, Table 1) are:

3.17     The interceptors along the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara are
designed for maximum carrying capacities of about 5.5 m3/s and
6.5 m3/s, respectively.  Pre-treatment works, pumping stations and sub-
marine outfall main have consequently been designed for a maximum discharge
of about 12 m3/sec.
3.18     Interceptors will consist of concrete pipes up to a size of
2000 mm and culverts where larger capacities are required. The proposed
outfall main is expected to be of steel pipes but alternative proposals
will be considered at tendering.
3.19     The major functions of the pre-treatment works will be to elimi-
nate coarse material from the influent through screening and to reduce sand
content, floatables and grease material through settling and aeration.
/I This population refers mainly to new areas to be developed.

This will reduce the amount of deposits that would otherwise occur in the
outfall main and immediately downstream of the diffuser openings as well as
the possibility of surface water pollution by rising floating materials.

3.21     The cost estimates are mainly based on detailed engineering
design except for the secondary sewage systems for which only preliminary
engineering has been prepared (para. 3.27). The basic costs are end-1981
price levels. Physical contingencies have been assumed at 15% for the
interceptors, the tunnel and the submarine outfall main, and 10% for other
works. The price contingencies for both civil works and material and
equipment have been estimated at 8.5% for 1982, 7.5% for 1983-85 and 6% for
1986-87.
3.22     The project management and construction supervision costs are
estimated at about US$4.2 million equivalent (3% of total basic construction
costs) and correspond to 400 and 230 man-months for local and foreign
consultants respectively. This estimate is based on an average total cost per
man-month of US$2,000 equivalent for local, and US$10,000 equivalent for
foreign consultants (1981 price level), including costs for international
travel and subsistence allowances.
3.23     The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$88.1 million/2
equivalent. This reflects assumptions made regarding goods to be imported,
civil works contracts to be awarded to foreign and local contractors and the
average foreign cost component of locally manufactured material and
equipment. ISKI is exempt from import cluties, excise and sales taxes.

Project Financing
3.24      The project would be financed by (i) the proposed Bank Loan of
US$88.1 million /1 equivalent, or 40% of total financing required, to cover
the entire estimated foreign exchange expenditures; (ii) net internal cash
generation and customers' contribution amounting to US$2.8 million, or 1% of
total; (iii) Government equity contributions of US$82.7 million, or 37% of
total; and (iv) the portion of the municipal fund amounting to US$48.5 mil-
lion, or 22% of total. The Bank loan would be made to ISKI with Government
guarantee at the applicable Bank terms. Exchange risks, if any, will be borne
by ISKI.
Project Implementation
3.25      The Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage General Directorate, ISKCI,
will be responsible for project implementation and for operation and main-
tenance of the water supply and sewerage systems for the Greater Istanbul
Municipality. ISKI's organization and management are discussed in Chapter V.
3.26      The present status of project preparation can be summarized as
follows: (i) design and tender documents have been prepared for the extension
of secondary sewage networks (laterals) to be executed during 1982; (ii) de-
sign with tender documents have been prepared for the pre-treatment works with
pumping stations and pumping mains (both civil works and equipment supply) and
the submarine outfall main; and (iii) design only has been prepared for inter-
ceptors and tunnel.  The design for the extension of laterals will be a conti-
nuous process and would be reviewed annually by the Bank during the course of
project implementation. Final drawings for secondary sewage systems are at
present prepared by the contractors executing the works. This is not satis-
factory and the Bank was assured by ISKI at negotiations that for contracts to
be entered into after June 1, 1983 final drawings would be carried out by ISKI
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.06). For pre-treatment works and pumping stations
separate contracts would be awarded for civil works and equipment supplies,
and the design for the civil works would be finalized after decision has been
made on the equipment supplies contract.
3.27      In order to reach the stage of procurement the following actions
should be completed: (i) revisions to be made to tender documents with draw-
ings for pre-treatment works and pumping stations and outfall main; (ii) pre-
paration of tender documents for interceptors and tunnel; (iii) execution of
detailed soil survey;- and (iv) selection of tenderers to be subject to pre-
qualification procedures (para. 3.34). Nedeco (para. 3.01) has been appointed
to carry out actions (i), (ii) and (iv), and local contractor to carry out
action (iii) to be completed by July 1982. The foreign cost of this prepara-
tion work will be covered by the remainder of the advance from the Bank Pro-
ject Preparation Facility (para. 3.02).
/1   Including a US$0.5 million advance from the Project Preparation
Facility (Para. 3.02) and US$1.3 million front-end fee.



- 16 -
3.28     During project implementation ISKI will be assisted by engineering
consultants for:  (-L) project management; (ii) tender evaluation and prepa-
ration of contract documents; (iii) finalization of detailed design
(para. 3.26) and review of contractors' drawings; and (iv) supervision of
construction works and material and equipment supply and installation.
These consulting services will be provided by a foreign consultant in
association with a local one. ISKI has invited consultants' proposals
according to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and to the
Guidelines for the use of Consultants by World Bank borrowers. The
finalization of the selection and terms and conditions of employment of
these consultants should be a conditions of loan effectiveness (Loan
Agreement, Section 7.01), and the Bank was assured by ISKI at negotiations
that highly competent construction supervision teams will be maintained
throughout the execution of the project (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01 (b)(i)). In addition, the Bank was assured at negotiations that ISKI
will retain a project manager with terms of reference and qualifications
satisfactory to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 (b)(ii)).
3.29     The Greater Istanbul Municipality operates a concrete pipe factory
which makes pipes of sizes up to 2000 mm, using Danish equipment and
processing methods.  Orders are likely to be placed by the contractors for
the interceptors (para. 3.33 (iv)) for the delivery of pipes from this
factory because of its location and competitiveness. In order to ensure
proper quality control the Bank was assured by ISKI at negotiations that
initial pipe manufacturing supervision for a period of three months will be
provided by the equipment supplier (Loan Agreement, Section 3.07) in
association with ISKI's engineering consultants (para. 3.28) who would en-
sure continued supervision throughout project implementation. The equip-
ment supplier would also provide some additionally required equipment, at a
cost estimated at less than US$50,0oo, to be financed under the project.
3.30     Regulations should be formulated for the control and the pre-
treatment requirements of industrial effluents before being discharged into
the sewage systems. Pollution monitoring programs should also be esta-
blished for the Golden Horn, Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus, and facilities
should be provided for water sampling and analysis. This would provide
useful data for environmental control and for future extensions of the
master plan (para. 3.03). A consultant report has already made
recommendations on the further processing of the above matters and ISKI has
prepared an acceptable action program. The Bank was assured by ISKI at
negotiations that the implementation of the pollution control program, as
basically agreed upon at the time of appraisal, would commence not later
than June 30, 1983 (Loan Agreement, Section 4.05).
3.31     A master bar chart for project implementation has been completed
and detailed CPM networks for individual contracts will be prepared by res-
pective contractors. An outline project implementation schedule is shown
on Chart 23569. Project monitoring reports were discussed and agreed upon
during project appraisal. The Bank was assured by ISKI at negotiations
that these reports will be implemented (Loan Agreement, Section
3.04(b) (iii)).

3.32     Consulting services would also be provided for the preparation of
future projects for development and extension of water supply and sewage
disposal facilities. For this purpose, consultants would be employed in a
manner and according to terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
During negotiations assurances to this effect were given by ISKI (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02 (ii)).
Procurement
3.33     Project procurement would entail several contracts.  The proposed
contracts, and their respective cost estimates are shown in Annex 1,
Table 4. These contracts would consist of: (i) one contract for the sub-
marine outfall main including the provision of pipes; (ii) one contract for
civil works for pre-treatment plant and pumping stations; (iii) one con-
tract for supply and installation of pre-treatment equipment and pumping
plants; (iv) two contracts for interceptors and pumping mains including
procurement of pipes; (v) one contract for tunnel; (vi) about 15 contracts
(3 per year) for secondary sewage systems (laterals) including the provi-
sion of pipes; and (vii) about 10 contracts for items such as sewer clean-
ing equipment, laboratory facilities, maintenance vehicles, and water
meters.
3.34     The contracts described in para. 3.33(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and
(v) would be subject to prequalification (para. 3.27) and would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
the Bank "Guidelines for Procurement". These amount to an estimated
US4164.0 million equivalent or 75% of total project costs.  The contracts
mentioned in para. 3.33 (vi) represent about US$36.0 million equivalent or
16% of total project costs and no bank funds will be disbursed for these
contracts. These would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bid-
ding (LCB), for which existing procurement procedures are satisfactory.
The contracts listed in para. 3.33 (vii), which represent about
US$11.0 million equivalent or 5% of total project costs, would be subject
to ICB except for contracts values below US$ 150,000 equivalent but not
more than US$ 800,000 equivalent in the aggregate for which LCB or
international shopping on the basis of three price quotations would be
acceptable (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4 C(1). For material and equipment
procured under ICB, a domestic preference of 15% or the import duty,
whichever is lower would be applied for purposes of bid evaluation.
3.35     The Bank would review all documents and awards for all contracts
subject to ICB. These amount to about US$170.0 million equivalent or 77%
of total project costs.
Disbursements
3.36      Statistical evidence in the Bank shows that disbursements for the
Water Supply Sector in the EMENA region extend over an eight year period,
while country-wide disbursements for Turkey extend over seven and a half
years. The proposed project is scheduled to be completed by
December 31, 1987 and taking into account the status of project preparation



- 18 -
and the relative efficiency of the new implementing agency, it is
reasonable to assume that the loan will be fully disbursed, at the latest,
one year after completion of the project, i.e., by December 31, 1988. A
forecast of disbursements is shown in Annex 1, Table 5.  The proposed Bank
loan would be disbursed as follows:

IV. FINANCE
Past and Present Performance
4.01     Upon its formation, ISKI took over the activities carried out by the
former sector entities (para. 5.01). An opening balance sheet was established
as of the end of 1981 (Annex 1, Table 6). However, it has not been possible
to prepare consolidated income and cash flow statements of past operations
because the 24 municipalities which joined the Istanbul Municipality to form
Greater Istanbul did not keep separate accounts for their water and sewerage
operations. At the end of 1981, these municipalities served about 40% of
Greater Istanbul's population.
4.02     ISKI's opening balance sheet includes all sector fixed assets and
appropriate depreciation reserves.  There is no arrears in the servicing of
the existing long-term debt, the Central Government having for the most part
provided funds for this purpose. However, the bulk of the receivables and
other payables which are claims on and from municipalities and Government
entities is over one year old. As of the end of 1981, these amounted to
US$36.0 million and US$38.0 million equivalent respectively. During negotia-
tions, agreement was given by the Government and ISKI that old receivables and
payables would be separated from ISKI's current accounts and that a plan of
action would be initiated to clear up these accounts in a manner which will at
least ensure that there will be no negative impact on ISKI's cash flow in any
fiscal year (Loan Agreement, Section 4.06) unless this has been appropriately
covered by that year's budget and corresponding tariffs.
Tariffs
4.03     Prior to ISKI's formation, water tariffs were set by the municipal
councils and had to be approved by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resour-
ces. The tariffs were not adequate to properly maintain existini plant and to
service debt.  For instance, in 1981, average tariff was TL 21/m  (US$0.16)
for water, or only about 56% of the level required to cover its operating
costs and the excess, if any, of debt service over depreciation.
4.04     For 1982, ISKI's General Council approved on March 19, 1982, an
increase in the average water tariff to TL 28/m3, effective January 1,
1982. At the same time, the Council decided to dlefer for one year the
implementation of a sewage charge pending start of construction of sewerage
works. 14oreover, for 1982 the Government has committed funds sufficient to
offset the delay in implementing the sewerage surcharge. The approved tariff
schedule appears in Annex 1, Table 11. As in the past, for each class of
consumers, there is only one rate per m3 regardless of quantity of water
used.  In order to encourage water conservation and to ensure affordlability by
all potential users, block tariffs would be introduced, and to this effect a
tariff study would be carried out. However, in view of the current dearth of



- 20 -
existing data, implementation of the study must await the result of the
information system which ISKI is introducing. During negotiations, assurances
were given that ISKI would complete not later than December 31, 1983 a tariff
study according to mutually acceptablie terms of reference, review the results
of such study with the Bank and, after taking the Bank's comments into
account, implement the recommendations of such study according to a timetable
to be agreed with the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 4.07).
4.05      ISKI's law gives it broad autonomy including the right to set
tariffs. This law enables ISKI to be financially viable. ISKI is committed
to take any actions including increasing its tariffs to recover its operating
costs and the excess, if any, of debt service over depreciation (Loan
Agreement, Section 5.04 (a)). This financial discipline would be ensured by
annual reviews of ISKI's requirements which would be reflected in its budget
and the tariff schedules which would be presented for consideration by its
General Council once a year. During negotiations, assurances were given by
ISKI that such budget review and necessary tariff action would be carried out
each year (Loan Agreement, Section 5.05). Furthermore, as part of ISKI's
annual budget exercise, the amount to be contributed by the Central Government
towards ISKI's capital investment requirements would be determined in time for
inclusion in the budget of the Central Government. During negotiations,
assurances were given by the Central Government that the necessary amounts
would be budgeted each year and made available for the timely execution and
completion of the project (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02 (b)).
Future Financial Performance
4.06      Projected income, sources and applications of funds and balance
sheets statements for the period 1982-89 appear in Annex 1, Tables 7, 8, and 9
and related assumptions in Annex 2.
4.07     The volume of water sold is expected to increase by about 42% in the
project implementation period (1982-1987) which is based on the assumption
that water production facilities are extended as planned; this coupled with
the forecast tariff increases from 28 to 70 TL/m3 for water and from nil to
15 TL/m3 for sewerage would produce r,evenues which would grow about three-
fold. In real terms, the projected tariff increases are insignificant. In
the same period, operating expenses, including depreciation, would also in-
crease about three times, leaving combined gross income of about US$74.0 mil-
lion sufficient to enable ISKI to meet its obligations. On this basis ISKI's
operating ratio would improve from 94% in 1982 to 88% in 1987, while its rate
of return would vary between 4% and 16%.
4.08      ISKI's estimated funds requirements and sources in the project
implementation period may be summarized as follows (in millions of US Dollars)!

4.09      In addition to the funds required for the proposed project, an
estimated US$153.1 million equivalent will be needed for ongoing and plan-
ned water supply projects and some US$97.8 million for debt service. Funds
will come mainly from internal cash generation which is projected at
US$99.3 million equivalent and would therefore be sufficient to cover the
entire debt service; Government contributions of US$201.6 million equiva-
lent made up oft (i) US$48.5 million from the income taxes transferred to
the municipalities by the Central Government, 10% of which is to be credi-
ted directly to ISKI for the proposed project; and (ii) US$82.7 million as
direct equity contribution for the proposed project and US$70.4 million for
water supply projects. The proposed Bank loan would amount to US$88.1 mil-
lion equivalent, and local and foreign financing of remaining US$73.5 mil-
lion equivalent for future water supply projects has yet to be identified.
4.10      During the project implementation period, the debt to equity ratio
is not expected to increase above 41:59 which is acceptable.
Monitoring System
4.11       Annex 1, table 10, shows operating and financial indicators which
were discussed with the Borrower during Appraisal. These will be included
in the reporting requirements outlined in para. 3.31.



- 22 -
4.12     During negotiations, assurances were given by ISKI that within six
months following the closing date of the loan it will prepare and submit to
the Bank a project completion report covering the planned objectives and
achievements of the project including the costs and benefits and perform-
ance of all entities associated with project execution and the operation of
the systems (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(e)).
V.  THE IMPLEM_NTING AND OPERATING AGENCY
ISKI's Creation
5.01     ISKI was created by Law number 2560 of November 20, 1981, to
assume responsibility for planning, design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of all water supply ancd sewerage and sewage disposal facilities
in the newly created Greater Istanbul Municipality. Upon its creation ISKI
acquired the relevant personnel, assets and liabilities of the former ISI,
as well as those of the Municipal D)epartment for Sewerage, both of whom had
already assumed responsibility f-or the greater Istanbul area in their res-
pective segment of sector activity in February 1981. Consolidation under
ISKI was substantially and successfully completed in December 1981.
Organizational Structure
5.02     ISKI's authority is vested in its General Council, its Board of
Directors and its General Director. The General Council is composed of
31 members, 14 of which are from the Municipality and the remainder from
the Central Government, and is chaired by the Istanbul Governor. It meets
twice a year to consider and eventually approve major policies, the budget
and proposed tariff increases. The Board of Directors has six members and
is chaired by the General Director.  It meets frequently to decide on
matters such as approval of technical reports, contract awards, and staff
appointment. The General Director is the Chief Executive Officer. He is
nominated by the Chairman of the General Council and appointed by the
Minister's Council. Under him, work is split between three Assistant
General Directors who are responsible respectively for; (i) planning,
design and construction; (ii) operation and maintenance; and (iii) adminis-
tration and finance.  Chart 23570 shows ISKI's current organization.
ISKI's enabling legislation is general and there is a need for detailed
rules and regulations as well as for operating and maintenance manuals.
These should be completed by June 1, 1984. The Bank was given assurances
by ISKI at negotiations to this effect (Loan Agreement, Section 4.04).
Staffing
5.03     Since its formation, ISKI has been run by a competent and forceful
General Director, an ex-army Colonel and experienced civil engineer.
ISKI's personnel total 4,770 or about 4.0 per 1000 water connections. They
were acquired from the entities whose responsibilities were taken over by
ISKI, namely: the former ISI, the Istanbul Sewerage Department and the



- 23 -
24 surrounding municipalities. These organizations were weak and ISKI
Management has rightly been giving a lot of attention to staffing, training
and technical support.
5.04     A staff establishment has been prepared.  However, at present,
only about 75% of the positions are filled. For the most part, this stems
from the fact that: (i) ISKI is responsible inter-alia for planning, design
and construction of major water works, a function which was formerly
carried out by DSI; and (ii) many of the personnel who were employed by the
surrounding municipalities had functions which covered more than just water
supply and sewerage and have been retained by the municipalities.
5.05     The salaries of ISKI personnel are tied to the public service
scale. Similar conditions had in the past made it difficult for ISI or the
Sewerage Directorate to retain, let alone attract qualified staff. ISKI
Management is conscious of this difficulty and intends to supplement the
salary of key personnel by offering other benefits such as housing, as well
as to take measures to improve working conditions, not least of which would
be the construction of a new administrative building.
5.06     ISKI's shortage of qualified experienced staff is particularly
acute in the financial and accounting areas. The present staff is in-
experienced and needs guidance.  ISKI's management recognizes this and the
consequent necessity for hiring a financial advisor to assist in the day-
to-day financial and accounting operations. At negotiations, assurances
were given that ISKI will employ, not later than October 1, 1982, a quali-
fied financial advisor, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank,
for a period of at least a year (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02 (iii)).
Training
5.07     At the national level, Iller Bankasi (para. 1.04) had taken the
initiative of having the French Cooperation Agency "La Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique" finance a study of the training requirements of the
Water Supply and Sewerage sector. The study recommended inter-alia the
creation of regional training centers and made proposals on training prog-
rams and their implementation.
5.08     ISKI's training needs are identical to those of the rest of the
sector.  For this reason, ISKI would establish and operate one of the
regional training centers proposed in the above study (para. 5.07). It has
recently created a training unit which will form the nucleus for this
training center. In devising its training program, ISKI will be assisted
by a specialist with experience in an operating company which has responsi-
bility for planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of
water supply and sewerage and sewage disposal facilities. This specialist
will be hired for a period of about one year to advise ISKI on training
matters, including manpower development, the establishment of a training
program, the preparation of course curriculea and material, and the
training of trainers. During negotiations the Bank was given ISKI's
assurances that such specialist will be hired no later than October 1, 1982
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.02 (iii)).



- 24 -
5.09     In addition to the formal training program, on-the-job training
will be provided in various areas by systematically associating local per-
sonnel with outside consultants and advisors. These include mainly the
consultants who have already assisted in the preparation of tender docu-
ments (para. 3.27) and will assist in: (i) the tender evaluation, finali-
zation of detailed designs, the review of contractor's drawings, and
construction supervision (para. 3.28); (ii) the initial supervision of the
concrete pipe manufacturing (para. 3.29); (iii) the establishment of water
pollution control monitoring (para. 3.30); (iv) the detailed engineering
for the next phase of development of the water supply and sewerage systems
(para. 3.32); (v) the preparation of a tariff study (para. 4.05);
(vi) accounting and financial matters (para. 5.06); and, (vii) the develop-
ment of training programs (para. 5.08).
Accounting, Billing and Collection
5.10     ISKI uses the standard Turkish chart of accounts and financial
statements.  Although some differences exist, these financial statements
may be readily converted into the format normally used by IBRD for public
utilities. As ISKI is responsible! for both water and sewerage activities,
however, assurances were given at negotiations that ISKI will maintain its
accounts in sufficient detail to enable the financial results of water
supply and sewerage services to be presented separately (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.02 (iii)).
5.11     All water connections, including public hydrants, are metered.
Existing billing and collection arrangements are generally satisfactory and
ISKI is expected to take appropriate measures to avoid the situation incur-
red into by the former sector entities (para. 4.02). The percentage of
unaccounted-for water has been too high, mainly because of inadequate ope-
rating practices, illegal connections and poor billing and collection
practices. While a number of measures are already underway to improve
billing and collection, assurances were given at negotiations that ISKI
should not later than January 1, 1983, set up a comprehensive program to
reduce unaccounted-for water, including inter-alia leak detection, improved
billing procedures, identification and gradual reduction of the number of
illegal connections and more systematic collection procedures (Loan
Agreement, Section 4.08).
Audit
5.12     In line with Turkish practice for Bank loans, ISKI's accounts will
be audited by the Auditors' Council of the Ministry of Finance. In the
past in the water sector, audit reports have not commented on the scope and
details of the audit, the methods used to value assets and liabilities had
not been spelled out, and no mention had been made that receivables and
payables had been confirmed. At negotiations, assurances were given that,
beginning with the financial year 1982, ISKI will prepare annual statements
and have these statements audited by the independent auditors who are
expected to be the auditors of the Ministry of Finance; in addition, the
audited statements would be submitted to the Bank within seven months of
each fiscal year (Loan Agreement, Section 5.02).



- 25 -
Insurance
5.13     ISKI will insure buildings, equipment and vehicles against the
normal risks of fire, damages and theft. Assurances were given by ISKI at
negotiations that the insurance requiremnents will be reviewed and that
appropriate insurance coverage in accordance with generally accepted public
utility practice will be maintained (Loan Agreement, Sections 3.03 (a) and
4.03).
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Economic Analysis
6.01     The benefits accruing from a modern sewage collection and disposal
system are difficult to quantify.  In assessing these benefits, the reduc-
tion of the incidence of waterborne infectious diseases and of the pollu-
tion of waters used for recreational purposes, improvements in the general
aesthetic conditions and in the quality of life, and the enhancement of
potential economic development are all important factors.
6.02     A limited socio-economic analysis was carried out in the project
area.  It covered the following subjects:  (i) health statistics on the
occurrence of waterborne diseases; (ii) possible effects on property values
as a result of the provision of sewer connections; (iii) costs related to
eventual closing of existing public beaches and development of new ones
because of unacceptable pollution levels; and (iv) potential impact of
environmental pollution on the fishing and tourist industries.
6.03     The benefits described in paragraphs 6.02(i) and 6.02(iv) are not
meaningfully quantifiable. The data collected show:
(i)   that the occurrence of typhoid and infectious hepatitis is
significantly higher in the Istanbul area than the national
average;
(ii)   the fishing industry in the Sea of Marmara is at present
comparatively insignificant and does not appear to be
affected by the existing water pollution level; but this
might change if its full fishing potential were developed
and no action had been taken to improve sewage disposal; and
(iii)   Istanbul has a large tourist industry which still has a
considerable potential for further development. Any
disregard of the environment would eventually have
detrimental effects on tourism.
6.04     Regarding the public beaches which are located on the European
side of the Sea of Marmara, i.e., close to the project area, information
was collected on: (i) the frequency of unacceptable pollution levels



26 -
(public beaches are already occasionally being closed); (ii) the estimated
number of people who use the public lbeaches per season; and (iii) the
location of alternative sites in case existing beaches would have to be
closed because of health hazards. If no actions are taken on sewage
disposal, new public beaches would in the near future have to be developed
further away from populated areas.  This would require major capital
investments in infrastructural works, and additional recurrent
transportation costs. These costs are not quantifiable at present but
would be significant.
Average Long-Term Incremental Costs
6.05     The average long-term incremental costs (AIC) have been calculated
for projected extension of sewerage and sewage disposal systems through the
period 2010 at the discount rates of 8% and 10%.  If benefits are
distributed over the volume of water consumed by the total population of
the Greater Istanbul Municipality, the AIC equals TL 9.4/m3 at a discount
rate of 8% and TL 10.3/m3 at 10%. Alternatively, if collection and
disposal are analyzed separately at a discount rate of 10% to distinguish
the different number of persons benefitting from these two activities, the
AIC for collection is about TL 10.6/m3 and the AIC for disposal is about
TL 380 per person per year.  The latter figure represents about TL 7/m3
of projected water consumption.  These costs will be taken into account
when considering future tariff adjustments and the introduction of a block
tariff structure, which would not impose an unreasonable tariff burden.
Project Impact on Poverty Group and Affordability Analysis
6.06     Data have been collected and projections made for the four drain-
age areas (para. 3.03) for the years 1980 and 1987 on population, lower
income group /1, and service levels. Data relating to the Yenikapi drain-
age area, where sewage collection and disposal facilities will be cons-
tructed and the major part of the extension of the secondary sewage system
will take place, may be summarized as follows; (i) its population repre-
sents about 33% of that of the Greater Istanbul Municipality; (ii) it har-
bours about 50% of the lower income population ; and (iii) about 73% of its
population is currently provided with service; this is expected to increase
to about 95% by 1987. The project covers an area with the highest popula-
tion density and percentage of low income people.
/1 Statistics on income distribution for Istanbul were prepared in 1973
taking into account 5 income brackets i.e., 0-999 TL/month, 1000-1999,
2000-2999, 3000-4999 and above 5000. Lower income group was defined as
that portion of the population earning 0-999 TL/month representing
about 25% of total population.



- 27 -
6.07     The service levels (provision of sewer connections) for the lower
income population of the Greater Istanbul Municipality would increase from
about 50% in 1980 to about 70% by 1987. This represents about 300,000
additional people to be served or about 27% of the present lower income
population.
6.08     The portion of the project costs which may be attributed to the
lower income population would be; (i) about 55% for the secondary sewage
systems; and (ii) about 25% for sewage interception and disposal (the bene-
fits are assumed to be distributed equally among the total population).
This is the equivalent of about 30% of total project costs.
6.09     As a result of the project the water supply and sewerage charges
will increase significantly and the beneficiaries will have to pay for
connection costs and for 1/3 of the extension costs for the secondary
sewage system. For the latter item, short-term local bank loans are being
provided. An affordability analysis for the lower income population shows
that-. (i) an average monthly household income (a family of four) would
amount to about TL 10,000 (US$77 equivalent); (ii) an average water con-
sumption would be about 10 m3/month, which implies a combined water supply
and sewerage charge of TL 370 or 3.7% of monthly income; however, this
amount is expected to be less after the introduction of a block tariff
structure; (iii) the cost for the secondary sewage system per household
would be about TL 125 as a monthly annuity payment; and (iv) the average
cost for a sewer connection is TL 6,000 per household. A total monthly
cost would thus not exceed 4 to 5% of a monthly household income. Through
discussions with Turkish authorities and based on experiences from similar
situations, it may be concluded that the increased costs would not impose
undue hardship and would be within the paying capacity of a low income
family.
Project Merits and Justification
6.10     The merits and justification of the project may be summarized as
follows:
(i)   the project will increase the population served by sewer
connections from 52% (1981) to about 61% (1987), and that of
the lower income group from 50% to about 70%;
(ii)   the project will reduce waterborne diseases as well as the
health hazard at public beaches, commence the restoration of
the Golden Horn, and improve the environmental conditions;
(iii)   the project represents a feasible first phase of the
Istanbul sewerage master plan, and is technically and econo-
mically the least cost solution;
(iv)   the investment costs per capita calculated for the 1987
population in the Yenikapi drainage area would be about
US$126 equivalent, which is reasonable;



- 28 -
(v)   the portion of project costs attributable to the lower
income group would be about 30% of total costs;
(vi)   project preparation has led to the creation of ISKI as an
autonomous entity fully responsible for all sector functions
for Greater Istanbul Municipality;
(vii)   the project will contribute to strengthening ISKI and its
cost recovery procedures, with improvements expected in
project implementation, works operation and accounting
systems; and
(viii)   the project will during the construction period, provide
about 5,000 man years of local employment.
Project Risks
6.11     Major project risks include; (i) the possibilities for delays in
project implementation and for cost overruns which are normally associated
with large and complex civil works undertakings; and (ii) the difficul-
ties inherent in the merging of the former sector entities.
6.12     Major actions taken or to be taken which would reduce project
risks include: (i) the completeness of the project preparation including
soils surveys; (ii) the provision of experienced consultants to assist ISKI
in project management and construction supervision; (iii) the establishment
of ISKI as an autonomous entity; (iv) the implementation of comprehensive
training programs; (v) the provision of equipment for the proper operation
and maintenance of the water supply and sewerage systems; and (vi) the pro-
vision of technical assistance to assist ISKI in the financial and adminis-
trative area including the improvement of accounting systems and procedures.
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Agreement having been reached on the issues referred to in
Chapters III through VI of this report, and subject to the conditions of
effectiveness set forth in para. 3.29, the proposed project is suitable for
an IBRD Loan of US$88.1 million to ISKI for a term of 17 years including
4 years of grace.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ISTANBUL SEWERAGE PROJECT
Major Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
A. Income Statements
1. Revenues. It has been assumed that water and sewerage tariffs will
be adjusted annually so that revenues cover operating expenses less
miscellaneous revenues, and the excess if any of debt service over
depreciation.
2. Unaccounted-for water is to be reduced from about 38% of water
produced in 1982 to about 32% in 1989.
3. Operating expenses reflect the planned establishment as well as
annual price adjustments of between 20% and 30% for position up-
grading and inflation. ISKI's total staff is expected to grow from
about 4,770 in 1982 to about 5,270 in 1989. The quantity of energy
and fuel used has been established on the basis of operating
requirements. Energy and fuel prices have been adjusted each year
by between 20% and 22% for inflation. Materials and chemicals cover
the material used to make connections as well as that needed for
operation. Annual price increases of between 25% and 39% have been
used. General and administrative expenses reflect the cost inherent
in the planned establishment and volume of operations, and include
price escalation varying from 11% to 31%. Bad debts have been
assumed at about 0.005% of water revenues. Depreciation has been
calculated at an average of 2.7% of gross fixed assets in service
for water works and 2.5% for sewerage works.
B. Balance Sheets
4. Fixed Assets. Fixed assets and depreciation as of December 31, 1981
were established by ISKI on the basis of information available from
the records of the former sector organizations. Those for the pro-
jected period 1982-89, result from annual transfers of work-in prog-
ress to fixed assets in service.  Investment costs were calculated
in US dollars using international inflation factors. As it is not
customary to revalue fixed assets in Turkey, historical values have
been used in the projections.
5. Current Assets. Cash has been projected at a level at least equal
to one month of cash operating expenses. As explained in the body
of the SAR (para. 4.02), arrangements have been made for the



- 44 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 2
settlement of old accounts receivable acquired from former sector
entities. The remainder of accounts receivable is expected to be
equivalent to 4 months of billing in 1982 and 1983, 3 months in 1984
and 1985, and 2 months thereafter.  The level of inventories has
been projected at the equivalent of 4% of gross fixed assets in
service. They are verified once a year by means of a physical
count. Their value is determined by using average unit purchase
prices.
6. Current Liabilities.   As explained in the body of the SAR
(para. 4.02), arrangements have been made for the settlement of old
accounts acquired from former sector entities. The remainder of the
payables are projected at the equivalent of 4 months of planned
investments and 6 months of inventories.  Retentions have been
calculated at 7% of planned investments. Current maturities of
long-term debts are those of the proposed Bank loan for the sewerage
project and other loans. Short-term borrowings represent temporary
advances for working capital requirements.
7. Customers' Deposits are based on connections. They are expected to
increase by TL 2.0 million in 1983 through 1985, TL 3.0 million in
1986 and 1987 and TL 4.0 million 1988 and 1989.
8. Long-Term Debt; include the IBRD proposed loan with repayments
commencing in 1986, at 12% interest for a period of 17 year;
including 4 years of grace for priac [pal repaymetirs.  Th ,y al;o
include the unpaid portion of IBRD Loan 844-TU, Kuwait Fund loan,
other Eo       (1- i d unidentiFied loans and other Turkish loains is  tllae!i
in para. 4.09 of the body of SAR.
9. The Equity is composed of ISKI's capital, contributions Erom the
municipal fund and the Central Government as outlined in para. 4.09
of the body of the SAR, and ciustomers' contributions to cover the
secondary sewage system cost which is billed to interested
customers over four years beginning from the completion of the
investment.
