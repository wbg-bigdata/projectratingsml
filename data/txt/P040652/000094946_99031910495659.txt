A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The overall development objective is to improve the health outcome of the population, with a focus on
meeting the health needs of the underserved segments of the population, as well as accelerating the country's
demographic transition toward slower population growth. This will be achieved through a program of sector-
wide activities aimed at:
*   expanding access to sustainable quality health care, including reproductive health and nutrition services;
*   strengthening the institutional capacity for health system management; and
*   developing sustainable financing schemes for health sector development with safety nets for the poor.
Key indicators for development outcome/impact (see Annex I) by 2003:
*   increased health facilities utilization rates, from 0.3 to 0.5 visit per year per inhabitant and per facility;
*  reduced infant mortality rate, from 123 to 90 per 1000 live births;
*   reduced under-five mortality rate, from 131 to 86 per 100000 live births; and
*   reduced total fertility rate from 6.7 to 5.8 per women of reproductive age
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
Document number: 17775 MLI      Date of latest CAS discussion: May 21, 1998.
The CAS supports the Government's objectives of reducing poverty through sustained, rapid, and broad
based economic growth. The main areas of the Government's medium term strategy are consolidate
macroeconomic stability; develop human resources; implement institutional reforms; and reduce and refocus
the State's role.
The CAS is structured around the two major thrusts of human resources development (education and health)
and sustainable economic growth. In the health sector, the CAS objectives are to improve access to quality
health care and reduce the population growth rate to a level commensurate with GDP growth. The proposed
project will complement as well as benefit from other CAS areas of interventions which contribute to health
outcomes, such as basic education, rural infrastructures, community based rural development and grassroots
initiatives to reduce hunger and poverty.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector Issues. The MHES has identified four critical sets of issues which hinder the health care system
performance: (i) low coverage and poor quality of services; (ii) low efficiency and effectiveness in the
management of resources; (iii) lack of financial sustainability of healtlh care facilities and (iv) rapidly growing
population.
Low coverage and poor quality of services. In Mali, as in most Sub-Saharan countries, the health situation
is characterized by a heavy burden of disease and inadequate health delivery systems.. The epidemiological
pattern whereby the cause of death shifts significantly from preventable infectious to chronic diseases has yet
to happen and the main cause of morbidity and mortality are communicable and diarrheal diseases, maternal
and perinatal complications and acute respiratory infections. Although the past two decades have seen a
noticeable progress in the health status of the population as supported by a decrease in the crude death rate (
from 21.6 in 1988 to 16.5 in 1996) and improvements in life expectancy (from an average of 42 years in 1980
to 50 in 1996), Mali's health indicators remain among the worst in Afi-ica. Child mortality rates have fallen,
from 190 per thousand live births in the 1980s to 123 in 1997, however, the number of children receiving full
immunization is still at a low 23 percent and the risk of childhood death, which is almost 20 %, compared to
1% in developed countries are indicative of the weaknesses and limited capacity of health programs to
address the basic health care need of the population. Births that are attended by trained personnel is above the
regional average (40%), but poor nutrition, unattended complications of pregnancy, childbirth and post-



Project Appraisal Document                                  Project Title: Health Sector Development Program
Country: Mali                                                                                   Page 2
partum keep maternal mortality rate among the highest in sub-saharan Africa (570 per 100,000 live births).
Less than one fourth of Malians (23%) have access to a health facility within a five mile radius and at every
level of the health system, many facilities are still poorly equipped, poorly managed and usually under-
utilized. The Government has encouraged the development of a community health program to stimulate
demand and increase physical access to primary health care. Results so far are promising, but community-
based health care provision must be further consolidated in terms of both utilization and equity in order to
achieve a significant impact on health outcomes. In addition, wide disparities remain between regions ana
between rural and urban settings within regions. Data from the 1995 Demographic and Health Survey has
shown that the infant mortality rate in Segou is almost double that in Bamako and the difference in the
percent of children vaccinated between Kayes and Bamako is six-fold. The same survey has also shown a
decline in nutrition status largely the result of poor nutrition education and practices. The situation is further
compounded by the limited capacity of the country's reproductive health program to create the necessary
conditions for significant fertility reduction and contraceptive prevalence rates have remained deceptively
low, particularly in rural settings where the rate is 3% compared to 16% in Bamako.
Low efficiency and effectiveness in health system management. To some extent, the current
epidemiological pattern stems from the limited capacities to organize, integrate and deliver priority preventive
and curative care packages. Despite recent efforts by Government to achieve more efficient allocation of
public resources and devote a larger share of public funds to prevention and PHC, the system still utilizes
substantial resources for secondary and tertiary care. This often leads to significant concentration of human
and financial capital in hospitals. Government's efforts to strengthen first level district referral system and
improve the management and organization of secondary and tertiary-care facilities has met with some success
but a number of constraints still hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of services offered in these facilities.
Major difficulties include the distribution gaps of general practitioners and nursing personnel between regions
and between urban and rural centers; shortages in critical categories of personnel such as laboratory
technicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists; inadequate recurrent budgets that do not match up to the initial
capital investment, and the absence of a good legal framework for private and community health workers. In
addition, many single purpose disease control programs are administered through separate vertical
administrative structures, but delivered at the most peripheral level by the same providers with little attention
paid to workload and skill development needs. Because of the poor working and living conditions outside the
larger urban centers, and the lack of sufficient attraction of health providers to private or community
practices, public health services still retain an increasing number of health professionals, to the expense of the
private and community health sub-sectors. Furthermore, public service is itself adversely affected by the lack
of a comprehensive action plan for human resource development with the resulting mismatch between health
schools student enrollment and staffing need. This and other health workforce related issues such as
recruitment and career development remain a major challenge which the Government is attemipting to address
more systematically under its new health strategy.
At central level, the shift in the role of the MHES administrative units from direct control to more normative,
regulatory and evaluative functions is still at the inception stage and needs further consolidation. Health
management staff is not adequately trained to meet the challenge of administrative reform and the process of
decentralization of the budgeting and management functions, which has been gradually implemented over
the past five years is still an unfinished agenda largely because of managerial weaknesses and the lack of
operational monitoring and evaluation systems. As a result, decision making authority and accountability over
staffing, budget allocations and fund raising for investments have yet to be fully delegated to the regions and
health districts. The health system is also constrained by inefficiencies in the management and organization
of secondary and tertiary-care facilities which in turn negatively affect change at lower levels in the health
structures.
Lack of financial sustainability. There is ample evidence of overall insufficient funding of the health
sector. Public spending on health per capita, estimated at US$ 5.00 in 1997, is among the lowest in Africa,
when compared to the minimum of US$ 9.00-12.00 per capita recommended in the 1993 World Development

Country: Mali                                                                                Page 3
Report. In 1996, public health spending was about 1.7% of GDP (SSA. average is 2.5%1/o). Due to the FCFA
devaluation in January 1994. the economic outlook has consistently improved; Mali is expected to achieve an
annual GDP growth rate of 5 % over 1996-98. This has translated in a growth of per capita income of at least
1.5% per annum, and a modest increase in public and household expenditures on health. Public sector
expenditures increased by 33% in 1994 and 7% in 1995. As a share olftotal consolidated government
recurrent expenditures, public health spending increased from 7.82% in 1994 to 8% in 1996, which is in
accord with the Government's commitment to reach a share of 10% by 1997. Such increase in domestic
resources and their improved management should result in better operations of the sector, resources are
however still insufficient to address the unmet need of the vast majority of the population and to support a
significant expansion of health service provision. In the medium term, it is expected that internal financial
resource mobilization would gradually increase as pre-payment and other health insurance mechanisms are
established. Nevertheless, given the circumstances of the country and the required investment needs, Mali
will continue to rely on external funding to achieve its health developrnent objectives..
High population growth rate. The high population growth rate estimated at 3% in 1997, absorbs a major
share of GDP growth and puts further pressure on a fragile and burgeoning system of basic health and social
services. Total fertility rates (TFR) have slightly decreased over the past ten years from 6.9 to 6.7 and
demand for contraceptive services is on the increase. However, more vigorous efforts are essential to
accelerate the country's demographic transition toward lower fertility and to cover the growing unmet needs
for reproductive health services (an estimated 25 % of women who wish to limit their family size do not have
access to contraceptive services). Because of its young population age structure, Mali also faces the challenge
of meeting the needs of a record number of adolescent and young adults entering their childbearing age.
Increasing access to quality maternity care, contraceptive methods and family planning information services
will contribute to reducing the health risks associated with early and unwanted pregnancies and to achieving
population growth rates more commensurate with the resources available for sustainable economic
development. Stronger commitment from the country's political and religious leaderships and more open
support from the civil society is also sought to address fertility determinants outside the health sector realm,
such as girl education and women employment, as well as the cultural and traditional resistance linked to
gender equity, harmful practices, and child labor.
Government's Strategy: The current health and population strategy aims at improving the health outcomes
of the population in Mali and achieving lower fertility. Designed to maximize efficiency in the use of
available resources while ensuring equity in access to health services, the strategy emphasizes the provision
of community-based PHC and referral services at district level health centers, more efficient management of
public health facilities and better curative care at secondary and tertiaiy hospitals. The strategy promotes
public/private partnerships and further development of the community health sector. The policy initiated in
1991, has succeeded in enabling district health teams to design, program and manage medium-term health
development plans in a highly participatory approach involving beneficiaries in such activities as the mapping
of health facilities and the choice of operation and cost recovery modalities. Community health has given the
policy its distinctive character. Community health centers (CSCOMs) provide a minimum package of PHC
services. They are fully managed and financed by the communities with a one-time state subsidy to cover the
initial investment costs. Monitoring and evaluation of the system is provided by district health teams. Mali
has now 285 of such facilities in operation. Over the past five years, about 200 CSCOM were created and 35
out of the total of 55 health districts in the country have begun implementation of their development plans
including the organization and delivery of first level referral package of services.
The Government's population policy explicitly seeks to slow down the high population growth rate through
fertility decline. A Priority Investment Program for Population (PIP) was prepared in 1996 with the objective
of accelerating the onset of demographic transition and reducing the time span for the country to achieve
stable population. In accordance with the principles spelled out at the ICPD Conference and the Platform of
Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women, the PIP sets forth a medium-term strategy aimed at
achieving fertility reduction through improvements in both the demand and supply sides of reproductive

health and child survival services and the expansion of women's access to education and economic
opportunities. The strategy aims at increasing access to reproductive health services as well as raising the
awareness of women's reproductive rights. It focuses on the delivery of a range of client-oriented and
financially sustainable services including the treatment of reproductive tract infections (RTIs); prevention and
management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS; pre-natal and maternity care; and
family planning. Similarly to the health sector, the population policy is built on the promotion of
public/private partnership in the provision of contraceptive information and services, using a variety of
channels including public/private suppliers, Community-Based Distribution (CBD), Social Marketing and
multi-media communication campaigns targeted to respond to the information needs of specific population
groups.
In February 1996, the Govemment launched a strategic planning process towards the elaboration of a new
framework aimed at consolidating the program of reform and health system development initiated in the early
1 990s and expanding its scope nationwide. The Government has taken a lead role in the discussion of key
health issues and ensured broad consultation and consensus-building among decision makers, stakeholders
and the civil society. The most noticeable achievements include better understanding of health priorities by
all concerned parties; shared vision of the necessity for further reform; and fuller support for sector-wide
adjustments. Building on lessons learned from the positive experience of the past five years and the results of
beneficiary assessments and economic and sector studies conducted as part of the planning process, the
service delivery strategy encompasses (i) greater community participation in the organization and
management of pre-payment schemes to cover referral services; (ii)further improvements in health system
management and quality of care at all levels of the health system and (iii) expansion of PHC services nation-
wide. Other key features of the sector-wide approach include: a) health promotion and behavior change IEC
to move household spending from non basic services to prevention and PHC; b) measures to better regulate
tertiary-care facilities and improve their management and accountability; and c) more efficient procurement,
pricing and distribution of essential drugs, including vaccines and contraceptives. The Government has
prepared a 1 0-year national health and social development strategy (NHSDP) for the period 1998-2007 and a
medium term sector development program (HSDP) to implement the first five-year phase of the strategy. The
program was elaborated in collaboration with the Bank and other bilateral and multilateral organizations. It
includes both investment and recurrent expenditures to cover the program of health reforms, as well as
activities aimed to strengthen health care provision.
The strategy and program adopted by the Government were formally reviewed at a donor roundtable held in
Mali June 24 to 27,1998. Both documents will serve as references for donors' contributions and private sector
participation. A Bank appraisal mission was conducted following on the roundtable. As a lender of last
resort, IDA's Credit will cover the gaps in the HSDP financing plan and complement resources pledged by
other donors.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the Sector Investment Program and strategic choices:
Low coverage and poor quality of service delivery:
The IDA credit, will support the Government's stronger emphasis on the consolidation and expansion of
quality primary health care (PHC) and first level referral services, together with managerial improvements
and upgrading of secondary and tertiary-care facilities. The thrust of the program will be on: i) the provision
of a core group of services (maternity care, IMCI, family planning, and nutrition) at primary and district
levels; ii) enhancement of health providers skills and their capacity to monitor and evaluate health system
deliveries; and iii) increased participation of stakeholders in the management of health facilities. A drug
pricing policy and a new regulatory framework for the pharmaceutical sub-sector will be implemented to
maintain the availability, affordability and quality of essential drugs. Hospitals will be required to prepare
sustainable development plans against specific criteria for management and operation practices, transparency
and accountability. Improvements in the quality and quantity of encounters between health providers and

clients at all levels of the health system, along with more efficient allocation of public resources and more
participatory management practices are expected to have a positive impact on demand, help increase the
utilization ratio for PHC facilities, and contribute to strengthening the health system sustainability overall.
Poor integration of priority programs
One of the main challenge of health services is to organize and expand lprovision of a range of maternal care
and family planning services in cost effective and culturally acceptable ways. Expansion of reproductive
health services will be made through diversified channels. It is projected that 200 additional sites of
community based distribution (CBD) and 512 additional retailers of Social Marketing will be established
during the five year span of the program. Furthermore, CBD would utilize as an entry jpoint any existing
community mobilization around water supply and "CS COMs". The program will also promote and support
NGO activities in the area of advocacy and community mobilization for women right to reproductive health
services, delayed childbirth, male responsibility, attention to and screening of high risk pregnancies
The National Program of Action Against STD/HIV/AIDS ("PNLS") will be reinforced with financial and
technical support provided for preparation and implementation of its thiird medium tenn plan of action. This
includes procurement of initial stock s of STD drugs for 48 health districts and support to decentralized and
integrated operations.
Secondary and tertiary care facilities will be equipped for the treatment of opportunistic diseases, such as
treatment of tuberculosis, diarrhea, wasting syndrome and malnutrition, among persons living with AIDS
A better understanding and knowledge of the context of FGM will be sought through collaboration and
assistance to indigenous NGOs to help them deal with the problem and propose alternative solutions adapted
to community needs. Local NGOs will also be supported in their advocacy efforts to support legislation and
build stronger constituencies to protect the rights of children and women in Mali
The provision of integrated package of services at the periphery of the health system and at first level
referrals will be strengthened and gradually expanded to include the prevention and control of endemic
diseases such as schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis and trachoma and the introduction at the village level of
preventive and curative drug treatments covering a wider range of endemic diseases. The integration of single
disease programmes will also be introduced at managerial levels, in health management information and
epidemiological surveillance systems (MIS) and in community based information surveillance (CBIS).
In order to coordinate the multi-sectoral nutrition activities, an Applied Nutrition Unit ("USNA") will be
installed and operated under the program. The nutrition surveillance system will be revamped accordingly.
District health facilities will have the resources to treat severe cases of malnutrition and to promote adequate
infant feeding and weaning practices in a clinical setting. NGOs and Private sector will be solicited in the
local production of weaning food, according to formulas designed at the Institute for Training and Research.
Expected outcomes will be a noticeable improvement of nutrition practices through better nutrition education
and a more effective distribution of micro-nutrients.
The World Health Organization (WHO) generic curricula on Integrated management of Childhood Illnesses
(IMCI) will be adapted to each category of health providers, for both primary care and first referral levels.
Low efficiency and effectiveness in health system management
Government has prepared a plan of action to help build staff capacity in the areas of health administration and
health system management. The plan includes activities such as management training; the development of
management procedures and a recruitment plan for middle and higher level managerial staff. Managerial
arrangements in relation to support services and administrative guidelines will be standardized for each level

of the health system. They will include decentralized human resources management, financial management
and accounting, and technical and financial auditing.
The HSDP will provide initial subsidies to establish cost recovery mechanisms in newly built facilities and
strengthening of drug distribution and monitoring at regional and district levels, and support to activities
aimed at improving the management and financing of secondary and tertiary hospitals, based on hospitals
development plans and eligibility criteria for access to program funds. This will include the development of
well defined operational, financial and management organization. Transparency and accountability,
incentives and staff commitment will be the guiding principles in the management of health services by
communities or private non-profit entities. Locally elected bodies will have oversight responsibility on the
management of health facilities whereas district medical officers will be accountable for monitoring provision
and quality of services in PHC facilities and the daily operations of the district referral centers. The National
Federation of Health Associations (FENASCOM) and its regional chapters will ensure the renewal of at least
50% of the ASACO's committees and a higher representation of women and young adults in them. Local
Governments would retain budgetary oversight on the District health offices.
Human resources development
Support will be provided to decentralize human resources management and to ensure that qualified and
motivated personnel is able to serve at all levels of the health system. A plan for academic and continuing
training of medical, nursing and management personnel will be implemented. The plan will include the
recruitment and deployment of public health personnel, activities aimed at upgrading the capacity of public
and private nursing schools, and operations research activities to explore career development opportunities
and incentives to attract and retain nurses, general practitioners and other health technicians in the community
health sector.
Lack of financial sustainability
Measures will be taken for greater autonomy of secondary and tertiary-care facilities in terms of resources
mobilization and management and control over their personnel. Support will be provided to help implement
new regulatory and legal frameworks for health services; the accreditation of public and private facilities;
licensing of providers; quality assurance; and the promotion of private provision of curative services. These
measures will be complemented through a) appropriate users charges; b) affordable, equitable and efficient
risk-pooling schemes based on community initiatives; and c) effective expenditure controls in both the public
and private sector. the Government's reform program also seeks to improve efficiency in the use of public
fund allocations to preserve the access of the poor and vulnerable groups to basic packages of emergency,
preventive and curative care. Consensus with Government and other donors on approaches and
implementation arrangements has been reached. More specifically, Government has agreed to secure social
and political commitment for results-oriented activities, based on regular critical reviews of public/private
health expenditures, composition, and growth prospects. External financial support will gradually decline but
is not expected to be eliminated in the foreseeable future.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported bv the program
The health sector reform agenda is summarized in three documents recently prepared by Government. The
1997 Document d 'Orientation politique ", the 1998 Plan Decennal de Developpement Socio-Sanitaire and the
Programme de Developpement Socio-Sanitaire.
The policy reform agenda covers health system management at all levels and comprises the following:
* Reorganization of the ministry's central and regional administration units,
* Hospital organization and management to grant more autonomy to secondary and tertiary-care
facilities and creation of a regulatory body;
* Revision of the regulatory framework and organization of the pharmaceutical sub-sector;
* Organization of health financing and safety nets for the poor with a focus on statutory and
regulatory framework for health insurance promotion;
* Development of a regulatory and statutory framework for Community Health Workers; and
* Updating the status of health associations and health committees.
While the Bank and other donors and partners will continue their critical contribution in policy dialogue and
in monitoring the implementation of the reform agenda, the MHSE will take the lead in program execution.
The HSDP components will be implemented in a phased approach. At inception, priority will be given to the
training of staff to upgrade their administrative and technical skills, and activities to improve efficiency of
existing facilities. Donors' support will aim at strengthening the MHES planning, programming and
administrative capacities with a focus on financial analysis and budgeting, program monitoring and
evaluation, procurement and contracting, technical audit and quality assurance. The success of the reforms
would likely be determined by:
(a) the deliberate attempt among donors to utilize joint monitoring and reporting system and promote resource
sharing; (b) the financing of interrelated and cost effective interventions, thereby avoiding duplication; (c) an
efficient donors' coordination by Government through more effective mobilization of external funds; jointly
established priorities; regular consultations and annual joint reviews of program performance; and (d)
sustained commitments of the Government and the community of donors to implement the key features of the
sector investment program.
3. Benefits and target population
Overall, more efficient and effective management and provision of health care along with more participatory
approaches to health care delivery and better health education will help build demand and utilization of public
health service and contribute to their sustainability. They will also allow the health system to better respond
to the health care needs of the vast majority of the poor and underserved segments of the population and
thereby contribute to the alleviation of poverty. Women and children, who are often the main users of PHC
and first level referral facilities, will benefit most from improved availability and quality of services. Benefits
include: improved women and child health status, reduced reproductive health risks for adolescents, reduced
incidence of endemic disease and related disabilities, and reduced fertility. As healthier mothers are more
likely to participate in income generation activities and have more financial autonomy, their children will
have a better chance to be educated and to realize their full potential through better school performances and
increased productivity as they become adults. Reduced fertility will in turn, stimulate economic growth
through lower dependency rate, higher savings and increased role of women in the economy.
The HSDP will enable the country to reduce the disease burden from infections such as malaria and
tuberculosis; slow down and control the spread of HIV-AIDS epidemic, and anticipate the shifts in burden of
disease as population get older and change lifestyles. Other major benefits include savings and cost
stabilization from more efficient and professionally managed tertiary-care facilities. These benefits combined
with improvements and extension of cost-recovery, along with the development of pre-payment mechanisms
and cooperative health insurance schemes, should contribute to providing a broader financial base for health

sector development, help reduce donor dependence and free up public resources for social protection program
that will benefit the poorest and most vulnerable groups. It would also ensure more equitable access to
secondary and tertiary levels of care. Reforms of the pharmaceutical sab-sector will encourage a more
systematic use of essential generic drugs (EGD) and will lead to substantial savings in household
expenditures for medication.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
Implementation period: 5 years
Executing Agency : The Ministry of Health, the Elderly and Solidarity' (MHES)
Program Coordination: The MHES Directorates of Public Health (DNSP) and Administration and Finance
(DAF)
The General Secretariat of the MHES and its planning and statistics Unit (CPS) will provide policy guidance
and overall program oversight. The CPS unit will assist with donors coordination and in monitoring the
program implementation. DGH will be responsible for technical support and specific program monitoring and
evaluation. Financial and human resources management will be carried out by DAF whose responsibility will
also include budget consolidation, procurement, financial reporting and auditing arrangements and the
establishment of decentralized management and accounting procedures. The decentralized system should be
completed and fully operational as a condition of credit effectiveness. At the regional level, Regional Health
Directors will be accountable for the execution of critical support services and priority programmes and
District Health Management teams will be responsible for the implementation of program activities at district
level and below.
Based on a capacity assessment, DAF and CPS will be strengthened through the transfer of personnel from
the on-going project, the recruitment of additional staff, and training as required. DA]F will receive technical
support, during the first two program years, from a specialized private firm - hired as a condition of credit
effectiveness. DAF will also benefit from annual technical audits, and the support of Contract Management
Agencies -- AGETIPE, private engineering firms and NGOs -- for the management of civil works programs.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements
DAF will be responsible for preparing and producing the program annual financial statements, in accordance
with internationally accepted accounting principles, and making arrangements for theiir certification. It will
also ensure that all disbursements under the program are made in conformity with IDA requirements. The
financial management information system will be computerized and will allow the monitoring of expenditures
per category, per technical program, per set of managerial activities and for each levell of implementation
(central, regional and district levels). Government will establish a central program account, using
counterparts funds, to make initial deposits to regional accounts for recurrent expenses covering the first six
months of activities. Donor contributions to these accounts will be made either as an advance or on a
reimbursement basis -- as would be the case for IDA's contribution. Records will be kept for all program
related expenditures and financing. A special account for the IDA credit will be opened and maintained with
a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. An independent auditor acceptable to IDA and to other donors will
audit the program accounts, including IDA's special account. Reports on the construction program and
technical audits by an independent engineering firm will be submitted annually. The contracting of auditors
(financial and technical), and certification by the financial auditor that DAF's accounting system is
operational, is a condition of credit effectiveness.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
Overall monitoring of the HSDP will be conducted against consolidated annual work programs and budgets
(AWPB) using benchmarks and yearly perforrnance indicators agreed upon by all concerned parties.
Monitoring activities include: (i) beneficiaries' assessment and qualitative surveys which will be repeated at

regular two year intervals during credit effectiveness; (ii) joint Government/Donor reviews to be conducted
semi-annually, at mid-term during the fiscal year (April/May) and at least three months before the beginning
of the next fiscal year; (iii) a comprehensive mid-termn review of program performance; (iv) an external end-
of-program evaluation, and (v) an updating of the procurement plan to compare target times and actual
completion with an assessment of the effectiveness of bidding procedures and performance: and (vi) an
external end-of-program evaluation. The annual Government/Donor review will examine results made
against the annual performance indicators and approve the work program and budget (WPB) for the next
fiscal year. The reviews will be based on management records, health districts quarterly progress reports,
semi-annual consolidated progress reports at central level, and annual financial and technical audits at
regional and national levels. Field visits in randomly sampled sites will also be carried out at least twice a
year during Bank/donors supervision missions. Within six months of the closing date of the IDA credit, an
Implementation Completion report (ICR) will be prepared by IDA, with MHSE contribution. The ICR will
document both the success and lessons learned from the sector-wide program and assess the results of IDA
contribution to the sector's development.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
As an alternative to a SIP, a classic investment project, based on the design of the previous Health, Population
and Rural Water Supply Project was considered. That project was mostly focused on provision of primary
care and limited support to referral services. Lessons learned from such operations indicate that they tend to
be less conducive to broader health sector reforms. Their scope prevent the resolution of systemic issues
such as health finance, human and institutional development. A free-standing population project was also
considered but both the Government and donors agreed that such a multi-sectoral project was beyond the
existing implementation capabilities of various ministries. Even if a broad-based sector investment program
is believed the best response to implementing the national health policy, specific pilot initiatives might be
considered to complement the SIP, as long as these initiatives do not divert limited human resources or create
competition among priorities.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
The Bank has financed two health sector operations in Mali since 1984. The first project (IDA Cr.1422-MLI)
was to extend primary health care services to the village level and to improve the supply and reduce the cost
of drugs. Limited in scope to only three districts, the project was characterized by weak management and
supervision and very limited success in carrying out policy initiatives to address human resources issues and
pharmaceutical sub-sector reformn. As a result, the IDA Credit was partially suspended and as the project
drew to a close, three pilot initiatives were set up in 1987 to test the concept of community-managed health
services and cost recovery mechanisms within a district approach to the provision of PHC and first level
referrals. Failure of the first project together with promising results-from the pilot initiatives led the Bank to
participate in the development of Mali's new health policy and the decision to contribute to its
implementation.
The second and ongoing operation ( IDA Cr.22 1 7-MLI), a broader operation covering four regions and the
district of Bamako was launched in 1991 and is scheduled to close December 31,1998. The operation was
financed by IDA (43%), Government and local communities (7%) and four other donors (USAID, EU, KfW,
and FAC) for a total of 50% of project costs. It was also fully supported by UNICEF, but under parallel
financing. The project was designed to expand the community health strategy, strengthen the process of
decentralization to district health teams and ensure reliable supply of low-cost essential drugs. The project
enhanced donor complementarity in health, population, and in many of its aspects was a precursor to a SIP.
Building on the success of the first IDA financed Rural Water Supply project (Cr. 1432-MLI and SF7-MLI),
the project also made a substantial contribution in linking the provision of safe water supply and sanitation to
the health program (485 wells were drilled and equipped with hand pumps and over 600 existing water points
were renovated and also equipped with hand pumps). The project has successfully tested the acceptability of
essential generic drugs, demonstrated the willingness of communities to pay for basic health care and
confirmed their capacity to organize and manage community owned PHC facilities and water supply. On the
population issue, policy dialogue on the disappointing slow increase in contraceptive prevalence rate using
clinic based-service led to the Government's decision to launch community-based distribution and social
marketing activities to increase contraceptive prevalence particularly in rural areas. The project also
established a demand driven social fund to promote NGOs participation in the delivery of health and FP
information and services which confirmed the feasibility of public/private partnership and the willingness of
Government to use borrowed resources to promote NGO activities.
Other key lessons include the need for:
*   quality improvements in service delivery and stronger users' involvement (particularly women)
in community health associations to increase service utilization;
*   sustained dialogue between Government and donors on strategic issues, priority choices, and
more coherence among donors in implementation procedures;
*   stronger political commitment to address the broader issues of sector restructuring, capacity
building and human resources development required by the shift from previously-centralized
health system management to one based on district planning and community participation; and
*   further reform and strengthening of community health program to attract and retain staff.
Lessons were also drawn from the design and implementation of similar operations in Zambia, Ghana,
Senegal and Mauritania, which documented the need to: a) link public and private initiatives to achieve
further advances in the delivery of sustainable and well integrated packages of services at PHC facilities and
first level referral centers; b) strengthen the institutional capacity to plan organize and manage effectively the
health care system; and, c} be flexible in the design of co-financing and co-management guidelines while
reinforcing the concept of a single implementation framework for all donors.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
As expected, the Government has assumed full leadership in the strategic planning process with only limited
advisory support from external sources, appropriation of the SIP implementation framework by MHES staff
at all levels was achieved through a highly participatory development process. and donor coordination has
been strengthened. Throughout the entire process, the Government consistently encouraged the active
participation of all key stakeholders (communities, NGOs, the private-for-profit sector and professional
associations). The beneficiary assessment and the NGO forum organized as part of the consultation process
reflect the Government's stronger commitment to associate all concerned parties in the design and
implementation of the Program. A National Commission, comprised of representatives of sectoral ministries
and the civil society, was established to validate health development priorities and strategic approaches and to
enhance the multisectoriality of some of the health interventions. Nine thematic teams regrouping a wide
representation of national health professionals were established to develop strategies and discuss
implementation methods. Health sector development has been presentedl as a key Government priority at
countless forums and there is commitment at the highest levels of Government for the reorganization of the
MHES central administration units.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project
IDA participation in the Sector Investment Program is a central part of a multi-donor effort to effectively
promote a sustainable health system in the country. As a key partner of Government in strategic planning and
in the establishment of a macro-economic policy, IDA has acted as a catalyst of the sector-wide approach and
its continued presence in the HNP sector is sought by Government as well as by many other donors to ensure
full support to the new program. The proposed IDA Credit would consolidate achievements made so far and
step up efforts in confronting a range of critical issues not addressed in the Bank's past two operations (cf
OED country sector report No.1 8112). The Government's objectives for the next decade are broader, more
ambitious and based on a long-term vision for the sector development. This would allow the Bank as well as
other donors to respond more efficiently to health priorities and institutional capacity building. In addition to
ensuring full funding for high priority program areas, the proposed IDA Credit would help to put the
Government in a leadership role in the sector, consolidate its capacity for donor coordination, and improve
the overall sector performance.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 4)
1. Economic (supported by annex 4)
NPV= NA    ERR= NA
[x ] Other ( Economic analysis):
Cost-effectiveness Analysis: The program's thrust for strengthening and expanding access to basic health
care is based on the WDR 1993 and Better Health in Africa, (the World ]3ank, 1994.) which demonstrate that
the approach to the provision of a minimum package of health services by community-supported and
managed PHC facilities and first-level referral district centers is the least-cost method to achieve universal
coverage and sustainable health gains. In addition, the program will contribute to expansion in the use of low
cost quality essential drugs and improvements in both the efficiency and effectiveness of the health system
leading to shifts in public health spending in favor of prevention and prirnary health care, better targeting of
public subsidies to the poor and substantial savings to households on the volume of funds spent on drug
purchase (current household spending on health care are estimated at 31 billion FCFA of which 90 percent is
for drugs).
Economic Analysis: The total cost of the HSDP is estimated at US$ 227 million equivalent. A medium-term
expenditure framework was developed for the program integrating investment and operating expenditures at



Project Appraisal Document                               Project Title: Health Sector Development Program
Country: Mali                                                                              Page 16
the regional and national levels for the period 1999-2003. It is based on the macro-economic conditions
forecast for Mali from the CAS and the related public finance expenditures. The Government of Mali and
external donors are the primary source of investment finance for the HSDP, covering 96 percent of all
investment costs. The Government and donors are also the primary financiers of recurrent costs, covering 63
percent of the total recurrent costs. The share of the population's contribution which represent 37 percent of
the program will be captured mainly through users fees at the primary health care level. Sensitivity analysis
where performed increasing the annual recurrent health expenditures from 0.2 to 1 percent. The figure of 0.5
percent increase was chosen as the basis for extrapolating the health expenditures of the Government over the
next ten years. The evolution of current expenditures and investment was calculated as a function of the
evolution of fiscal receipts. As a percentage of Government recurrent expenditure, health recurrent
expenditure will increase from 6.6 percent in 1998 to 9.1 percent in 2002. Total public health expenditures
per capita, which includes recurrent and investment costs funded by the Government and donors will increase
in nominal terms from US$ 4.16 in 1998 to US$ 5.70 by 2002. When private health expenditures are
included, total health expenditures per capita increase from US$ 6.9 in 1998 to US$ 8.24 in 2002. this amount
approaches the values recommended by international organizations of US$ 9 for low income countries
2. Financial (see Annex 4)  NPVA= NA     FRR=NA
Investment expenditures in terms of levels are concentrated in the primary and secondary levels and
decentralized administration (59 percent) which comprises the community health centers, the first level
reference facilities, the regional hospitals, and regional administration, which is in conformity with the
Government's and donors' priority for PHC. Financing for the tertiary-care level represents 21 percent of
investment and health promotion and social protection programs comprise 4 percent of investment
expenditures. Recurrent expenditures for the primary and secondary levels represent 57 percent of the total
recurrent expenditures, compared to 23 percent for the tertiary sector, with a positive evolution in the balance
of expenditures between human resources and other components of the recurrent budget such as logistic
support and maintenance.
In terms of private expenditures, the financial contributions of households is projected to increase by 15
percent per year. This has been shown to be reasonable in various economic and financial studies as well as a
beneficiary assessment commissioned by MHES. Evidence from the financial studies showed that despite the
devaluation of the FCFA in 1994, the price of a prescription for consumers at the community health centers
has remained stable around an affordable 600 FCFA. This is also supported by evidence from the beneficiary
assessment study and time series data on health centers utilization which reflect the willingness of the
population to pay and a rise in utilization over time when quality services are offered.
Fiscal impact: In view of the cost recovery assumptions and projection regarding donor investments, the
program will not lead to modifications of tax instruments. Grants represent 72 percent of external resource
and the cost and affordability of public health expenditures will be constantly monitored through out the five
year period covered by the program.
3. Technical
The new strategy framework and health development policies are technically sound and clearly endorse the
World Health Organization recommendations for Safe Motherhood, the WHO Global Work Program for
vaccines and immunization and the reproductive health principles adopted at ICPD. Issues of quality, access
and equity in health care are specifically addressed in key components of the national health development
plan and five-year investment program. There is a clear emphasis on prevention and primary and first level
referral care, with a particular focus on: a) obstetric care and the management of high risk pregnancies,; b) the
provision of family planning information and services; c) Child Survival and IMCI, including the alleviation

of malnutrition among under five years old children and their mothers and, and d) the fight against AIDS and
other communicable diseases. The HSDP is also designed to help the Government achieve efficiency and
effectiveness gains through better organization and management of secondary and tertiary care. Staffing
requirements are systematically addressed with actions aimed to increase the number of medical and
paramedical students and improve the technical and managerial competerkcies of health professionals. A
human resources development plan has been prepared to strengthen academic and continuing training. The
health sector policy also promotes cost recovery and beneficiaries led pre-payment mechanisms such as
cooperative health insurance schemes
4. Institutional
(a) Executing agencies: The Ministry of Health, the Elderly, and Solidarity (MHES) will be the executing
agency for the IDA credit and for funding from other bilateral and multilateral organizations. All MHES
directorates and services will be involved as appropriate.
(b) Program management: the HSDP management will rely primarily on the new organizational structure
of MHES which has divided the responsibility of program implementation of the nationatl health plan into
three key departments. The General Secretariat (SG) responsible for donor coordination and policy guidance
and monitoring; the National Directorate of Health (DNSP) which has responsibility for implementation of
public health care programs; and the Directorate of Administration and Fiinance (DAF) with responsibility
over investment and operation budgets, procurement and human resources management. The MHES has also
been mandated to coordinate the multisectoral nutrition program. In this regard, a small unit within the DNSP
will be established to coordinate and monitor implementation of the Nutrition Action Plan. A small
management team within the ministry's Health Planning Unit (CPS) will be created to assist the SG in its
donor coordination functions and the preparation and conduct of the joint annual review meetings. The
DNSP and DAF will manage program implementation with all other directorates of the Ministry. The main
instruments which will be used for program management are the Annual 'Work Program and Budget (AWPB)
and the Regional Operational Plans (ROP). The districts' action plans will be consolidated into the ROPs
which in turn will form the backbone of the AWPB. The AWPB will also include all costs related to logistics,
monitoring and evaluation activities by central level entities. Three months before the end of each fiscal year,
the Government will prepare and present at the annual review meeting of partners, the program's annual
report (against agreed upon bench marks and perfonnance indicators) and the next fiscal year work program
and budget. Donors will be expected to review and approve the AWPB during or shortly after the meeting,
thereby allowing Government to commit a share of the unallocated funds under the IDA Credit to finance the
gaps under each of the program's categories of expenditure. In order to qualify for IDA support, planned
activities will be examined on the basis of the following criteria: (i) consistency with the health sector policy;
(ii) consistency with the intermediary objectives of the PDDSS and medium-term program; and (iii) relevance
with regard to sustainability, cost effectiveness and measurability. IDA F'rocurement and Disbursement Plans
will be revised accordingly to reflect program implementation progress or lack thereof.
5. Social
The HSDP will help achieve the overall objective of improving the healtht status of the population. By
focusing on women's and child health and more equitable distribution of resources within the health system,
the program will respond more efficiently to meeting the basic health and social needs of the vast majority of
the population and will thus contribute to poverty alleviation. Furthermnore, the participatory approach
advocated under the program would allow for increased involvement of beneficiaries in decision making
about health choices and the design and management of activities through elected representatives.
6. Environmental assessment  Environmental Category [X] C
This is a category C project and no environmental risk is foreseen. The health facilities being considered

under the project are generally of small to medium scale and will include pollution control requirements for
the handling of medical waste and the disposal of hazardous material which can generally be met through the
application of readily available and simple low cost technologies.
7. Participatory approach
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Mali has a very supportive cultural, political and institutional environment for private-for-profit, NGO and
community participation in heath and social action. One of the central objectives of the Government policies
in health and population is to promote public/private partnership in the delivery of PHC, reproductive health
information and services, AIDS/STDs prevention. and the training of nurses. This objective will be pursued
through further delegation to NGOs and contracting out to the private sector a certain number of activities
such as the provision of family planning information and services, the training of nurses, the promotion and
delivery of community-based activities and social marketing, for which they have a comparative advantage.
Also, under the ongoing decentralization process, local administration and development committees will be
expected to play an increasing role in health decisions at communal and regional levels. This however implies
a stronger effort to build up the capacities of local government and support local associations and their
federations. The population and particularly women and young adults will be closely associated in health
planning decisions. Health committees will be renewed through elections and, at the district facilities and
higher up in the health system, users groups will be represented in the health committees which have
oversight responsibility for these facilities.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Elaboration of the strategic framework and HSDP was based on the findings of a beneficiary assessment
conducted in 1997. In addition, endorsement of the program at the highest levels in Government, and by the
civil society was obtained throughout the planning process (a Private Sector forum including NGOs, Unions
and Professional Associations was organized in 1997). Explicit acknowledgment by the community of donors
(regular monthly review meetings held under the chairmanship of the WHO representative) was also
ensured.
F: Sustainability and Risk
1. Sustainability (technical, managerial andfinancial)
A successful implementation of the HSDP will bring about the foundations of sustainability, in terms of more
efficient and cost-effective management of human, material and financial resources. The program will
contribute to the provision of reliable and quality public health services that should attract more users and
generate revenue that will be used to maintain the services. The promotion of more financially autonomous
secondary and tertiary hospitals is expected to improve the flow of public resources in favor of first level
referral centers and PHC facilities to help them achieve a higher level of sustainability. Sustainable financial
basis for tertiary and secondary care facilities is promoted through activities aimed at mobilizing internal
financing sources such as the use of cross-subsidies, user fees and community-based pre-payment and health
insurance schemes.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
None in the foreseeable future. There is a broad consensus on the priority to be granted to the health sector
and on all elements of the sector investment program design. The sector-wide approach would help address
both the reform and sector adjustment aspects as well as the concerns for adequate attention to health service
delivery and the prevention and control of infectious diseases, particularly water and/or vector born disease
(schistosomiasis, malaria and hepatitis). The program also includes a major component to fight HIV
infections and malnutrition. Regarding population, resistance to expanded family planning activities will be
overcome through constant dialogue with the civil society and Information, Education and Communication
activities targeted to religious and political leaders at regional and local level.

H: Readiness for Implementation
The PDDSS and HSDP have been widely disseminated and formally reviewed during a Donors' roundtable
organized in Bamako, June 25 - 27, 1998. Several bilateral and multilateral organizations have made financial
and technical contributions during the design phase of the program and following the roundtable and the
pledging of resources the financing plan for HSDP was finalized (see table below). As parl of the planning
process the following activities were successfully conducted:
a) A series of studies were undertaken to develop a sound knowledge and data base in a variety of fields (health
finance, human resources development, institutional development, nutrition), (see bibliography in Annex 8).
Some of this analytical work which is of a longitudinal type will be continued as part of the SIP implementation;
b) Nine sub-sectoral thematic working groups have been created, have met on numerous occasions, reported their
findings to Government and to the multi-donor group of partners, incorporated donor comments and then
presented their report and recommendations for debate and approval at regional workshops and at a national
seminar which was held in November 1997.
(c) The work program and budget for the first two years of the HSDP has been appraised and found satisfactory.
(d) A procurement plan for the first two years' activities has been prepared and is ready for the start of program
implementation.

IDA Program Contribution
Mali: Health Sector Development Program
The design of the program is based on the "Plan Decennal de Developpement Social et Sanitaire (PDDSS),
1998-2007 " whose overall goal is to improve the health outcomes of the populations, with an emphasis on
meeting the health care needs of underserved groups. The PDDSS provicles the strategic framework for
health sector development which will be implemented through two medium-term (five year) programs
Programme d'Investissement Sectoriel (PRODESS). The PRODESS for 1999-2003 will serve as common
reference documents for the Government, the donors' community as well as all other concerned parties such
as NGOs, Professional Associations, and the civil society. A plan of acti,on describing all activities which
will be undertaken at all level of the health system is provided in the program which also includes the budget
projections and financing levels by public, communal and external sources, as well as the detailed annual
operational plans for the first two years of implementation.
Strategic priorities defined for the first five years of the HSDP are the following:
1. Expanding access to affordable quality health services and promotion of community health;
2. Strengthening financial, material and human managerial functioms;
3. Integrating administrative functions, support services and delivery of reproductive health,
prevention and control of endemic diseases;
4. Strengthening secondary and tertiary hospitals, and specialized facilities; and
5. Improving and expanding basic social services, and access to affordable health care to the poor.
Each strategic priority is summarized below:
Priority 1. Expanding access to quality health services and promotion of community health: During the
first five years, the strategy is aiming to expand access to the minimum package of activities (MPA), within a
radius of 15 Km, with the objective of making services accessible to 65% of the population (from 24% in
1997) New health centers will be built and others renovated or rehabilitated. The concept of community
health will be further promoted and better regulated, with district health centers as focal points of activities.
Primary care services will be consolidated and standardized as to increase access to MPA. Quality of care
and services in health centers will be enhanced through a Quality Assurance program that comprises dynamic
standard setting, therapeutic protocols and guidelines; staff training and supervision; regular supply of
consumable and drugs; the creation of quality improvement teams and the involvement of beneficiaries and
particularly women in the planning and management of community health activities.
Priority 2. Strengthening financial, material and human managerialjfwnctions: The program's sector-wide
approach will ensure that the necessary inputs for improving utilization of resources are made available. It
will systematize coordination of donors' inputs, decentralize implementation and promote public/private
partnerships. The pharmaceutical sub-sector will be reorganized to strengthen or develop functions to ensure
more efficient procurement and distribution of drugs in both the public and private sector. This will include:
pricing and drug import regulation standard setting for drug control, needs assessment and planning, and
monitoring of sub-sector's performances. Mandates and authorities of central and local health
administrations will be redefined to promote sound financial management, coordination and decentralization.
Human resources management will be reorganized to ensure redeployment and adequate skill mix at all
levels, staff development and utilization of a system of rewards and sanctions. Regional health services will
be reorganized to allow mobilization of resources and provision of technical and administrative support
downstream of the health system.

Priority 3. Integrating administrative functions. support services and delivery ofreproductive health,
prevention and control of endemic diseases: Health districts will be strengthened in their capacity to plan and
implement integrated technical programs. During the first five years of the PDDSS. the Health Information
System will be updated, computerized and gradually connected with local and international networks.
Standards and procedures for reproductive health have been developed, program for Youth will be added and
access to family planning services will be increased. The installation and operations of the surveillance of
endemic diseases and nutritional status, as well as early warning system, will be completed. Specific
interventions in endemic areas have been defined for malaria, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, tuberculosis,
trachoma and dracunculosis. Standards, procedures and protocols will be developed to ensure delivery of
comprehensive care in facilities and at community level; managers and providers' skills will be upgraded
either through in-service training and supervision, or long term training.
Priority 4. Strengthening secondary and tertiary hospitals, and specializedfacilities: During the first five
years, the range and quality of care and services, at referral levels will be improved through more efficient
management and organization renovation of facilities and supply of biomedical equipment. A draft new
hospital legislation has been prepared and will be submitted to the national assembly along with a proposed
new statute for hospitals. The law will provide for a more efficient classification of these facilities to enhance
complementarity among them. Each hospital or specialized health institution would be required to prepare its
own development and financing plan to access funding under the program.
Priority 5. Improving and expanding basic social services, and access to affordable health care for the
poor: Community organization and community involvement at primary care level will ensure the
generalization of cost recovery and cost sharing mechanisms with safety nets for indigents and the promotion
and support of cooperative health insurance schemes (Mutuelles d'Assurarce Maladie) A core unit in the
central administration will be established and funded in order to promote universal mandatory health
insurance for private sector employees.
IDA Program contribution
Program Component 1 - Expanding access to affordable quality preventive and curative services
US$ 20.8 million (total cost of component)
Description
At the first levels of contacts and referrals, the program will build on past accomplishments in involving
beneficiaries and communities in the management and operations of health facilities. Community health
activities will use the health center as focal points. Community health Associations (ASACOs) and their
federation (FENASCOM) will receive public subsidies and technical assistance from NGOs and district
health teams to construct and operate new community health centers (CSCOM) so as to provide a minimum
package of activities (PMA). About 300 of these centers are expected to be constructed during the five year
of the life of the project.
On the supply side, public service delivery will be reinforced at first level referral and above. Hospitals at
the first level of referral will be assisted in the development of Quality Assurance. Activities will consist of
construction or renovation of health facilities, the construction and renovation of training facilities, the
provision of furniture, vehicles and medical equipment and supplies as well as support for health care
management including the application of internationally accepted technical standards for a range of
preventive and curative services; academic and continuing professional and management training of health
providers and the organization of monitoring research and evaluation systems.

On the demand side: a program of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities for behavior
change will receive support for targeted populations and activities such as awareness of harmful traditional
practices. Nurses and community health workers will be trained to inform and counsel clients and
beneficiaries on a variety of adequate health practices and basic sanitatioDn, prevention of major endemic
diseases, prevention of STI/HIV/AIDS, family planning and the prevention of high risk pregnancies and
risks related to child birth.
In order to provide a sound basis for a more concentrated effort to address the main nutritional status
concerns in Mali, a nutrition sub component will cover the following three key elements: a) public sector
institutional arrangements, and human resource capacity; b) nutrition related information and information
systems; and c) micronutrient deficiencies. Within the MSPAS there is no clear organizational locus for
nutrition. In the context of new SIP follow-on structures, a nutrition management unit will be set up to assist
the General Secretariat in the management of a multi-sectoral nutrition, and a Nutrition Services Unit (NSU)
will be established under the Directorate General of Health. The NSU initially will consist of a small core
group and develop in terms of activity and function, depending on performance during the first two years. As
the program demonstrates relevance and effect, nutrition specialist positions would be created at the Regional
and District (Cercle ) Health offices so as to form a core nutrition capacity at implementation levels. The
regional core-group would consist of a director/coordinator, small professional staff (1-2), and support staff.
The staff to be assigned and/or trained could include specialists in nutriition education, micronutrient
deficiencies (but specifically in mainstreaming solutions to deficiencies), and expertise in community-based
interventions.
Financing
The IDA credit will finance critical elements of service delivery, on both the supply and demand sides that
will not be funded through other mechanisms:.

Program Component 3 - Developing sustainable financing schemes for health sector development with
safety nets for the poor US$ 1.2 million (total cost of component)
Under the prevailing economic and financial forecasts, the projected population growth rate and trends of
health system operations, all scenario show that it would take 20 years to just provide uniiversal access to
basic health coverage. The total recurrent budget expenditures are expected to gradually increase by 0.5 %,
but the public resources can ensure only 25% of all health financing. Households, municipalities,
associations and communities would need to contribute, therefore, cost sharing and cost recovery
mechanisms such as, prepayment schemes as well as formal and informal (mutual) health insurance systems
need to be further developed along with external resources availability. This program component will
promote private/public partnership in the provision of services through the organization of public /private
forums on health insurance; support for the development of a regulatory and statutory framework for
mandatory and mutual health insurance schemes and technical and financial support to a core unit which will
be established to promote the concepts of cooperative health insurance sclhemes (Mutuelles dA'ssurance
Maladie) among diverse target groups.

This Annex presents the results from the economic analysis for the Mali Health Sector Development Program
(HSDP). The HSDP covers the first five-year phase of a ten-year national health and social development plan
developed by the Ministry of Health, the Elderly and Solidarity, endorsed by donors at a June 1998 Donor
Round Table. This analysis examines the following aspects of the program: (i) economic and sectoral context;
(ii) health sector expenditures and financing; (iii) expenditure framework and financing of the HSDP; and (iv)
sensitivity and risk. I
The overall development objective of the HSDP is to improve the health outcome of the population with a
focus on meeting the health needs of the underserved segments of the population and accelerate the country's
demographic transition toward slower population growth. The planned sector-wide activities are aimed at (i)
expanding access to sustainable quality health care, including reproductive health services; (ii) strengthening
the institutional capacity for health system management; and (iii) developing sustainable financing schemes
for health sector development with safety nets for the poor. Resources will be provided by the government,
beneficiaries, donors, and NGOs. IDA contribution to the program will be about 28 percent of the total
program cost.
II. Economic and Sectoral Context
Macroeconomic Linkages
After the 50 percent devaluation of the FCFA in 1994, economic activity expanded significantly due to the
close and effective management of the stabilization program by the Government, with significant support
from the Bank and the IMF, and a result of efforts in the early 1990s to affect efficiency gains in cotton and
rice production and to liberalize prices and trade. Favorable exogenous iFactors, such as relatively good
rainfall, high international cotton prices and the strength of the US dollar, also contributed to these positive
outcomes. Real GDP grew at an average of 4.8 percent during 1994-97, versus an average growth of 2.3
percent between 1990 and 1993. Inflation was dramatically reduced from 24.8 percent in 1994 to an
estimated -0.4 percent in 1997. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) increased from an average of US$-9.3
million during 1990-93 to an average of US$ 38.5 million in 1994-97. There have been strong increases in
exports volumes, especially cotton fiber which averaged 21 percent per year between 1994 and 1996. These
increases combined with low import volume growth, averaging 8 percent a year, have lied to a reduction in the
current account deficit from - 16.9 percent of GDP in 1994 to -I I percent of GDP in 1997. Fiscal performance
has improved with a tax revenues increasing by 3 percentage points though revenue collection remains low at
13 percent of GDP in 1997.

Links to the Country Assistance Strategy
The CAS supports the Government's objectives of reducing poverty through sustained, rapid, and broad
based economic growth. The main areas of the Government's medium-term strategy are consolidate
macroeconomic stability; develop human resources; implement institutional reforms; and reduce and refocus
the State's role. The Bank Group's Country CAS is structured around the two major thrusts of human
resources development (education and health) and sustainable economic growth. In the health sector, the CAS
Objectives are to improve access to quality health care and reduce the population growth rate to a level
commensurate with GDP growth.
Rationale for Public/Government Intervention
The rationale for public involvement in the health sector is based on public goods, market failure, and equity
concerns. Public goods include health services which benefit individuals beyond those receiving the service
(e.g. safe drinking water and sanitation) and services for which there is low consume; demand and high price
elasticity (e.g. disease prevention). In the absence of public financing, the effective demand and provision of
these services is likely in many cases to be below the socially effective level. In Mali, as in many other
developing countries, imperfect information, limited access and lack of knowledge by consumers in the
health field, and problems with affordability contribute to market failures. Inequitable distribution of health
services between regions and income levels is a powerful justification for public sector involvement on equity
grounds alone. For all the reasons given above, it is clear thiat the government will need to continue to play a
strong role in the health sector, which the Bank supports.
Link to Economic and Sector Work
The framework for the HSDP is provided by the ten year national health sector development plan and the
medium-term sector investment program developed by Government, both of which aie products of
collaborative studies, evaluations, and participatory discussions with stakeholders and donors. Economic and
sector work was undertaken by Bank in collaboration with other bilateral and multilateral donors including
the E.U., FAC, UNICEF, and USAID. Studies initiated by the Government as part of the strategic planning
process include (i) health finance; (ii) human resources development; (iii) institutional capacity assessment
and further reform of the health system; (iv) a beneficiary assessment; and (v) a nutrition study.
II1. Health Sector Expenditures and Financing
Health Financing
The health sector in Mali has all of the problems that are found in the typical very poor country. Its health
needs for both preventive and curative care are extremely large relative to its economic base. In 1997 total
expenditures in health represented 7.2 percent of total Government expenditures. In per capita terms total
public expenditure, including internal and external investment) in 1997 was equivalent to $ 4.12, well below
the minimum $9-$12 per person needed for the provision of a minimum package of primary health care as
determined in the Africa Region policy paper, Better Health in Africa.
Government Expenditures
Budget allocations almost doubled in the 1 990s, increasing from 4.2 percent of the national budget in 1990 to
8.2 percent in 1996, before dropping slightly to 7.2 percent in 1997. This strong commitment to the health
system both by Government and donors is reversing the steady downward trend in health finance which
began in the 1970s (see Figure 1). In real terms total expenditures in health increased from 17.4 to 20.1
billion FCFA between 1995-97.

Personnel expenditures have remained unchanged while recurrent expenditures have increased 50 percent
between 1995-97. As shown in Table 1, real per capita recurrent health expenditures increased over 20
percent between 1995-97, from 661 to 933 FCFA. Including external investment, real per capital total health
expenditures increased from 2055 to 2235 FCFA over the same period (8.8 percent). Public recurrent
expenditures per capita in 1997 were about US$ 1.50 which is below the rninimum estimated for operating
costs (US $12) by the United Nations, and is not sufficient to reach the Government's objectives as defined in
the National Health Policy. Recurrent expenditures account for just over one-third of total expenditures, a
situation which does not bode well for the full utilization of the investments, as it does not permit the
financing of recurrent costs generated by annual investments nor their maintenance.

Private Financing
Household expenditures for health are mainly on the purchase of modem drugs in the private sector and the
public sector (85 percent). Fees in the public sector and private sector combined amount to and estimated 6.5
percent of household expenditures, while only 3.4 percent was for traditional medicine. T he low income of
households translates into the extremely low consumption of health services. It is expecte d in the medium

term that the percentage of household expenditures on health care will increase from the national average of
2.3 percent to 4 percent. The underlying assumptions are an increase in geographic accessibility to health
care; improved quality of service offered; and a positive expenditure elasticity. (See Table 2/Figure 2)

Under the decentralization law there will be about 700 communes in the near future, with mayoral elections
taking place in 1998. These local governments have an explicit role to play in the financing of health services.
Their financing will come primarily from exterior aid in the short to medium-term, and in the long term from
local taxes and receipts from public services. The total amount of resources for the communes is estimated to
reach about 20 million FCFA per year, in real terms. Health expenditures could be about 20 percent of
resources, representing 4 million FCFA a year, of which a part is dependent on external aid. This projected
financial contribution is modest given the current situation of the decentralization and the new communal
administrations, and could be expected to increase as the transition to local government speeds up.
NGOs, "twinning" and donations which contribute to health financing are difficult to value. It is estimated
that several hundred NGOs exist in the health sector, but only about 30 of these are operational, including a
few international organizations. Part of these funds are used for health activities. It is estimated that the total
annual financial contribution of NGO and other diverse sources is about 2.5 million FCFA.
Health expenditures of private enterprises in the modern sector cover only about 100,000 persons, less than 1
percent of the population. Annual expenses of these enterprises for health consist of contribution for health
insurance, and financing their own health services. In total, the direct contribution of enterprises is estimated
to be 800,000,000 FCFA.
Sources of health financing in 1997 are summarized in Table 3 (Figure 3). Of the total amount of 56.7 billion
FCFA spent on health, 29.2 billion or 51.5 percent was from private households. External aid contributed 25
percent (14.2 billion), placing the government as the third largest contributor with 10 billion FCFA.

In order to have a more precise idea of health expenditures, it is necessary to keep in mind three points, and
correct for them to the extent possible: investment expenses that are included in recurrent costs; expenses
relating to project implementation, including related recurrent expenditures, studies, management, etc.; and
expenses on health that are not for public health. The corrected health expenditures for 1997 by source and
category are shown in Table 4. Total health expenditures, including the private sector, informal sector,
traditional medicine, and NGOs amounts to 56.7 billion FCFA. Recurrenil expenditures are funded mainly by
households, through cost recovery, and the state. Investment expenditures are provided by external aid (78
percent) and others (14 percent). The amount of transfer costs attributed to external aid and NGOs is 0.8 and
2.8 billion FCFA, respectively. Non-essential drugs purchased by households amount to 17.3 billion FCFA.
(See Figure 3.) It is estimated that the total recurrent costs of 24 billion FCFA could be reduced to 20 billion
FCFA if all drugs were generic.

As shown in Table 5, expenditures on primary health care were 16 percenl: of total health expenditure in 1997
versus 10 percent for secondary and 7 percent for tertiary. When examined by source, external aid
contributed all funds for primary and almost three-quarters of funds for secondary level health care, while the
state was responsible for 80 percent of funding to the tertiary sub-sector. Administration accounted for just
over 20 percent of health expenditures, all state-financed, while donors funded all of health and
environmental education and vertical programs. The government financed the bulk of traiining (95 percent) as
well as logistics (89 percent).

IV. Expenditure Framework and Financing of HSDP
Macroeconomic Environment for Mali, 1999-2003. The macro-economic hypotheses and the related
public finance framework for Mali are shown in Tables 6 and 7 below, which give the basis for the
Government financing of the health sector over the period of the HSDP, 1999-2003. The underlying
hypotheses for the macro-economic environment for the next decade are as follows: (i) population growth
will decline from 3.2 percent in 1999 to 3.0 percent in 2003; (ii) economic growth will remain at 5 percent per
year, (iii) inflation will remain at 2.5 percent per year; (iv) the current expenditures as a percent of GDP will
increase from 13.2 percent in 1999 to 15.6 percent in 2003; and (v) the Government will increase the health
operating budget by 0.5 percent per year. Sensitivity analysis were performed increasing the annual current
health expenditures from 0.2 to I percent. The figure of 0.5 percent was the most solid, thus was chosen as
the basis for extrapolating the health expenditures of the Government for the next ten years. The evolution of
current expenditures and investments on interior financing was calculated as a function of the evolution of
fiscal receipts.

Current expenditures will grow from 175 billion FCFA in 1999 to 251 billion in 2003. As a percentage of
GDP, current expenditures will increase from 9.9 percent in 1997 to 10.5 percent in 2003. Public savings will
increase from 53 billion to 109 billion FCFA over the same period, and the Special Investment Budget (SIB)
will increase from 38 billion to 60 billion FCFA. Table 8 summarizes the composition and distribution of
expenditures in the health sector for the period 1999-2003.

Expenditure Estimates. A medium-term expenditure framework was developed for the HSDP integrating
investment and operating expenditures at the regional and national levels for the period 1999-2003. The
program builds on progress under the on-going Population, Health, and Rural Water project (Cr. 2217-ML) to
(i) decentralize planning, management, and budgetary responsibilities for health services to the regions; (ii)
engage the population in a partnership for health whereby communities contribute to and are responsible for
PHC centers management, including financial management; (iii) strengthening partnerships with NGOs and
the non-profit sector in the delivery of health services; and (iv) playing a larger role in improving the
regulatory environment as a means to facilitate non-public service delivery. While the HSDP will maintain
the focus on expanding access to PHC, it will also concentrate on efficiency improvement interventions and
financial and human resource mobilization at the secondary and tertiary levels of health care in an attempt to
build up sustainability and more equitable sharing of resources throughout the health system.
The program components include (i) expansion of health insurance and cost-sharing mechanisms; (ii)
restructuring management of facilities with a focus on cost effective interventions and technical efficiency;
(iii) reform of the pharmaceutical sector toward import and distribution of generic drugs; (iv) management
and technical training of the health sector workforce; and (v) construction/renovation and equipping of PHC

As a percentage of Government recurrent expenditure, health recurrent expenditure will increase from 6.6
percent in 1999 to 9.1 percent in 2003 as shown in Table 9 below. This increase reflects the Government's
strong commitment to the health sector. Total public health expenditures per capita, which includes recurrent
and investment funded by the government and donors, will increase in nominal terms from US$ 4.16 in 1999
to US$ 5.70.

External Financing
Projections for external resources are an increase of 15 percent in 5 years, from 14.2 in 1999 to 15.7 billion
FCFA in 2003 (see Table 10). This conservative growth estimate is based on the current levels of financing.
Total public health financing, the sum of Government and donor, is shown in Table 11 below.

Private Expenditures
Total private expenditures are shown in Table 12 below, and consist of contributions from households.
communes, NGOs, and private enterprises. The financial contribution of households is projected to increase
15 percent per year, from 1.4 billion FCFA in 1997 to 2.8 in 2003 in terms of cost recovery and from 2.8
billion FCFA in 1997 to 4.9 billion in 2003 in terms of essential drugs in public health facilities. This 15
percent per year increase is reasonable, given that the utilization rates of health centers will increase over
time. The financial projections depend on three factors: (i) economic growth; (ii) impact of this growth on
household income; (iii) health budgets and expense profiles, notably reductions in "unproductive expenses"
estimated to be 10-12 billion FCFA in the informal sector, traditional medicine, and expensive specialty drugs
purchased from the private sector. Together these factors can drive a strong increase in the contributions of
households in financing health centers. The linchpin of this projection is the increase in utilization of
community health facilities and quality of the health centers. The utilization rate of health centers is projected
to increase from 25 percent in 1997 to 40 percent in 2003, an increase which is seen as reasonable in the light
of Government commitment to quality of services as well as information, education, and communication
(IEC) activities.

Role of Local Governments. Given the current situation of the decentralization program and the uncertainties
still surrounding the new communal administration, the financial contribution of communes is envisioned to
be modest. The projected contribution of 0.7 billion FCFA in 1999 will increase to 2.8 billion FCFA in 2003,
with the majority (70 percent) going toward investment and the remainder towards operating costs. However
should the transition to the new administrative set-up accelerate, investment figures for local government
should be revised upward.
The contribution of NGOs and enterprises is projected at 5 percent per year. Tables 13 and 14 summarize
total public and private health sector financing and the breakdown between investment and recurrent
expenses. When private health expenditures are included total health expenditures per capita, excluding drugs
purchased by the population, increase from US$ 6.19 in 1999 to US$ 8.24 in 2003. This amount approaches
the values recommended by international organizations, US$ 9 for low-income countries.

Investment Expenditures
The investment expenditures under the HSDP by category are shown in Table 15, while Table 16 gives
investments by level in the health pyramid. Civil works, equipment and specific activities each will account
for roughly one third of investments.
In terms of levels, the bulk of investment is concentrated in the primary and secondary levels and
decentralized administration (59 percent) which comprises the community health centers, the first level
reference facilities, the regional hospitals, and regional administration, which is in conformity with the
Government's and donors' priority for PHC. Financing of the tertiary level represents 21 percent of
investments, which will cover the rehabilitation costs of the hospitals as well as accompanying measures to
improve the quality of care. Social programs ("I 'action sociale ") which comprises 4 percent of investment
expenditure includes reinforcement of mutuelles as well as the creation of a solidarity fund and assistance to
the handicapped. Investments in the pharmaceutical sector are limited to 1.3 percent of the total and will
support rehabilitation of the retail outlets of the "Pharmacie Populaire ", the national pharnaceutical
distribution warehouse.

Recurrent Expenditures
Recurrent expenditures under the HSDP for the primary and secondary levels represent 57 percent of total
recurrent expeinditures for the program (see Table 17). These operating expenditures at the primary level
(community health centers) include personnel salaries, in-service training, the cold-chain for vaccines,
maintenance, management support, as well as specific drugs for tuberculosis, leprosy, etc. Expenditures at the
secondary level include those for the first level reference centers, social services of the district, and the
regional hospitals. Twenty three percent of recurrent expenditures are allocated to the tertiary sector. Table
18 provides a summary of the investment and recurrent expenditures by level under the HSDP. A breakout of
recurrent expenditure by category would reveal an increase in the maintenance budget, corresponding to the
objective of quality. While the maintenance budget is increasing, expenditures on human resources are
stabilizing. There has been a positive evolution in the balance of expenditures between human resources and

Sources of Finance
The Government of Mali and external donors are the primary source of investment finance for the HSDP,
covering 96 percent of all investment costs (see Table 19). Less than 20 percent of investments will occur in
the first year, with the bulk of investment taking place in years two and three (52 percent) and diminishing
gradually to 12 percent in the lasi year of the program. Recurrent expenditures are shown in Table 20 by
source. The Government and the donors are also the primary financiers of recurrent costs, covering 63
percent, while the population is responsible for 37 percent of recurrent costs. This figure has been shown to
be reasonable based on financial evidence from the PSPHR health facilities which operate under a cost
recovery system. The bulk of the household contribution to recurrent expenditures will come from user fees
at the primary level, the community health center.

Following appraisal, external financial pledges for the IHSDP amount to 86.04 billion FCFA as shown in
Table 21. The final amounts for financing on the part of donors cannot be estimated at this stage as not all
pledges have been confirmed. The Bank has committed to being the donor of last resort should external
pledges not fully materialize as foreseen. The pledged amounts of the African Development Bank and the
Islamic Development Bank have not yet been determined, as noted in the table.

Financial sustainability
Table 22 summarizes the investment and recurrent expenditures of the HSDP by sources of financing. The
Government and donors will finance 78 percent of the program, covering almost the entire investment budget
(96 percent) and the bulk of the operating expenses (63 percent). Households will finance the remaining 21
percent of the program including the remaining 37 percent of operating expenditures. This financial
contribution of the population has been shown to be reasonable in various financial studies supported by the
on-going Public Health and Rural Water Supply project, as well as a beneficiary assessment study
commissioned by the Group Ad Hoc. Evidence from the two financial studies showed that despite the
devaluation of the FCFA in 1994, the price of a prescription for consumers at the community health centers
has remained stable, around 600 FCFA. Evidence from a beneficiary assessment study as well as multiple
focus groups show that the population deems prices at health centers are reasonable. Time series data from
health centers show that utilization rises over time, thus the projection for the community's increasing
financial support is reasonable, given the increase in utilization rates forecast, due to increased quality
measures, pre-payment and mutuelle schemes, and IEC programs, in addition to the increased geographic
coverage from new health centers.'

The new local government structures will play a minor role in financing of the program (I percent) at present.
Local government financial contributions are projected to be modest given the current status of the
decentralization program and the uncertainties still surrounding the new communal administrations. As the
communal administrations become well established, these conservative estimates should be revised upwards.
Overall, the program will provide for an improved allocation of expenditures within the sector, leading to
improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of the health system. The improved allocation of expenditures
within the sector provided by the program will contribute to improvements in both efficiency and
effectiveness of the health system. These gains in turn will contribute to the financial sustainability of the
program through sound financial management Improvements in internal resources mobilization sought by the
program will contribute to its financial sustainability by ensuring that the existing resources are used most
effectively that efficiency gains will be realized.
Cost-effectiveness. The WDR 1993 and Better Health in African demonstrate that the Malian approach -
provision of a minimum package of health services by community-supported and managed health care, first
referral hospitals and health districts - is the least cost method to achieve universal coverage and substantial
and sustainable health gains.
The program's expansion of access to basic care and improvements in the quality of health services will also
contribute to financial sustainability by affording consumers savings realized through increased efficiency of
existing health care expenditures in the informal sector, traditional medicine, and specialty drugs obtained
through the private sector estimated to be between 10 and 12 billion FCFA per annum.'
Recent research in Mali has estimated that households already spend 31 billion FCFA on health care and
almost 90 percent is for drugs (3162 FCFA p.c. or US$ 5). Shifting expenses from informal, traditional and
private to public services would vastly improve the efficiency of existing health expenditures.2
IV. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
Potential risks as identified by the CAS include macroeconomic instability, delayed reforms, and unfavorable
external factors leading to an economy more vulnerable to external shocks and deteriorated terms of trade.

The possibility of an overvaluation of the real exchange rate would result in a decrease in exports, foreign
investment in Mali, and a further fiscal strain. The resulting lower than forecast economic growth and/or
lower than expected revenue mobilization could decrease the percentage of these resources allocated to the
health sector. Another possible reason for financial shortfalls would be a decrease in donor funding or donor
commitments that are realized more slowly than initially announced at the time of appraisal.
To test the sensitivity of the HSDP to a major shortfall in financing, the impact of government health
expenditures growing by 0.2 percent rather than the assumed 0.5 percent per year over the period was tested.
A high scenario was also given with government health expenditures growing by I percent. The results of
these two different macroeconomic scenarios indicate the confidence intervals for the resource envelope of
the program, and are shown in Table 23. Under the low case scenarios, the total resources available for the
program would amount to a total of 165 billion FCFA over five years. The expenditure per capita would
reach only US$ 5.60. The high scenario presents a rather more optimistic estimation on the level of resources
available for the program: about 193 billion would be available, US$ 7.1 0 per capita. The two scenarios
provide an estimated range of resources that would be available for the program as determined under
different macroeconomic hypotheses. The analysis indicates that the basic estimation of the resources
available for the health sector is reasonable. The current projections are based on the current macroeconomic
forecast from the CAS, which have taken into consideration the risks and envision modest GDP growth for
Mali for the period of the HSDP. The estimation of resources from the Government is reasonable if not
conservative, and expected donor support is slightly increasing from the current level.
Given lower than expected economic growth, to maintain the level of health expenditures forecast under the
HSDP the share of government recurrent expenditures allocated to health would need to increase to prevent a
shortfall. The main implication of such a shortfall would be operating expenditures. In the case of a
significant financing shortfall, risk management will center on agreeing on a core program of activities to be
maintained, and the core program would be spread over a longer time period. This risk will be further
alleviated through improved fiscal management.

The impact of a decline in donor financing or commitments realized slower than programmed would fall on
the investment program of civil works, resulting in a slower than desired expansion of health facilities in the
poorest regions. Risk management would consist of a reorientation of a part of this aid to the recurrent
expenditures and an increased effort for institutional reinforcement, namely human resources, and improving
the management and productivity of the system. The performance indicators which would. monitor risks,
detect problems and provide the basis for resolution are summarized below.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Mali: Health Sector Development Program
A. Procurement
1. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was carried out in April 1998. and found
procurement procedures in Mali do not conflict with Bank Guidelines. The Malian procurement code was
revised in 1995 in consultation with the Bank and is considered as a good example in the region. Mali's
procurement laws and regulations do not conflict with IDA Guidelines. In addition, no special exceptions,
permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit documents for International Competitive Bidding (ICB),
since Mali's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in
local regulations. Works and Goods financed, or contracts financed by other donors eventually administered
by IDA, will be procured in accordance with Bank's Guidelines under IBRD Loans and II)A Credits (January
1995 revised in January and August 1996, and September 1997). National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
advertised locally would be carried out in accordance with Mali's procurement laws and regulations,
acceptable to IDA provided that: (i) any bidder is given sufficient time to submit bids (four weeks); (ii) bid
evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iii) no preference margin is
granted to domestic manufacturers; (iv) eligible firms are not precluded fiom participation; (v) award will be
made to the lowest evaluated bidder; (vi) bid evaluation reports will clearly state the reasons to reject any
non-responsive bid; and (vii) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents are
submitted to IDA and found acceptable. Consultant Services contracts financed by IDA vvill be procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January
1997 revised in September 1997). The standard Request for Proposal, as cleveloped by the Bank, will be used
for appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be used for shorn.-term assignments, i.e. those not
exceeding six months, carried out by firms or individual consultants. The Government will be briefed during
appraisal and will receive any additional clarification during negotiations about the features of the new
Consultants Guidelines, in particular with regards to advertisement and bid opening. The program elements
by disbursement category, their estimated costs and procurement methods for the first two years are
summarized in Table A below. Consultant selection methods and thresholds for procurement methods and
prior review are summarized in Tables Al and B below. It is expected that the procurement arrangements
for the first two program years would remain valid for the rest of the remaining three years of the program,
but aggregate amounts cannot be determined at this stage, since it relies on the financing plan to be agreed
with other donors at the end of the second year.
Civil Works and Goods
2. A large volume of activities financed under the Credit during the first two years (US$ 4.05 million or 55%
of the first two-year of the program for civil works and goods), will be used to procure Ciivil Works, and
Goods under ICB procedures.

3. Civil Works contracts financed by IDA during the first two program years is estimated at US$ 2.5
million. It will cover the construction and rehabilitation of 45 health centers and boreholes. Large contracts
for hospitals, exceeding US$ 500,000 each, are expected to take place after the first two program years. In
this case, it would be procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, and
September 1997). Prequalification of contractors is not deemed necessary since there is no contract requiring
complex techniques and/or exceeding US$ 2.0 million equivalent. Therefore, all civil works contracts during
the first two program years, costing more than US$ 50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of
US$ 2.70 million would be procured through NCB in accordance with national procedures described in the
Manual of Procedures and acceptable to IDA. Civil works contracts will be managed by Contract
Management Agencies (CMA) -- namely AGETIPE, private consulting firm or an NGO. For NCB, the
CMAs will maintain and update a roster of contractors eligible for NCB, according to procedures acceptable
I Based on the financing plan for the first two program years.
2 Includes consultancies, and procurement methods other than ICB and NCB.

to IDA, spelled out in the Manual of Procedures.
4. Contracts for small works estimated to cost less than US$ 50.000 each, up to an aggregate amount of
US$ 1.97 million, during the first two program years, would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors
invited to bid by way of discounts either on the total price or on the unit prices. The invitation shall include
reference unit prices established by an engineer or an architect, a detailed description of the works, including
basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of agreement described in the Manual of
Procedures, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor with the
lowest price quotation for the required work, provided he demonstrates he has the experience and resources
to successfully execute the contract. These small contracts supervised by a CMA would be for works relating
to construction or repair of health posts (CSCOM) in rural and urban areas. For the construction /repair of
CSCOMs, the program would assist eligible communities in the form of grants payable in four tranches as
described in the Manual of procedures -- under contractual arrangements between the community and
MSPAS. In choosing this approach, the CMA would evaluate the organizational capacity of the
beneficiaries, and would assess the cases where the assistance by an NGO is required to handle the small
construction program on the behalf of communities.
3. Contracts for Goods financed or financed by IDA, during the first two program years (totaling US$ 4.35
million), relating to medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, furniture, office equipment, computers, vehicles
and spare parts, for hospitals, health centers and basic health services, would be procured through ICB
procedures in agreement with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
(published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, and revised in September 1997).
Contracts for office furniture, equipment and vehicles, locally available and costing less than US$ 200,000
each, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 0.46 million would be procured through NCB procedures
acceptable to IDA. The implementation of the program would also require the purchase of relatively small,
primarily consumable items, by MSPAS and regional authorities around the country -- which would be
difficult and impractical to package and procure following NCB procedures -- such items (mostly
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, vehicles, furniture and office equipmnent), which could not be grouped
into ICB packages and costing less than US$ 100,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
US$ 0.2 million over the first two program years, would be procured through the UNICEF Procurement and
Assembly Center (UNIPAC) and/or through the Inter- Agency Procurement Services of the UNDP (LAPSO);
this would be the most economical and efficient way of procuring small quantities, in particular in case of
emergency, if any. Exceptionally, procurement of small equipment, furniture and vehicles to be purchased
over the first two program years, costing less than US$ 20,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate of
US$ 0.1 million, might be procured through prudent local shopping, or up to US$ 0.1 million through
international shopping, on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three reputable suppliers. Spare
parts and pharmaceuticals obtainable only from one source, and other proprietary items, costing less than
US$ 5,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$ 20,000 equivalent, may be procured directly
from manufacturers or authorized local distributors.
6. Consultant Services. Consulting services financed by IDA during the first two program years would be
for: (i) studies -- architectural design, civil work supervision, contract management services, preparation of
bidding documents, data collection, accounting systems, financial management supports, and impact analysis;
(ii) consultancies on technical matters and training -- skills gap analysis, skills development; and (iii) training
of health personnel staff. Consultants financed by IDA, or financed by other donors eventually administered
by IDA, totaling US$ 1.18 million, would be hired in accordance with the .Bank's Guidelines for the Selection
and Employment of Consultants (January 1997 revised in September 1997). It would be addressed through
competition among qualified short-listed firms in which the selection would be based on Quality-and Cost-
Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the quality of the proposals before comparing the costs of the
services to be provided. Other methods would also apply. For audits and other services of a standard nature,
the Least-Cost Selection (LCS) would be the most appropriate method -- the firm with the lowest price



Project Appraisal Document                                                                    Annex 6
Country: Mali                                                                              Page 4 of 10
being selected provided its technical proposal received the minimum qLialifying mark. Consultants services
for hospital advisory services and health financing (estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 per contract and
up to an aggregate amount of US$ 200.000) would be based on Consultants' Qualificatior . (CQ), based on
the consultants' experience and competence relevant to the assignment. Services for lectures and small
studies, which can be delivered by individuals, would be selected through comparison of qualifications
among Individual Consultants (IC) expressing interest in the assignment or approached directly. Single
Source Selection (SSS) will be exceptionally used for the selection of the Construction Management Agency
(CMA) and training services for health sector management totaling USS 500.000. The Government of Mali
proposed to select AGETIPE on a single source basis, as CMA for the first two program years. AGETIPE is
a non-profit association with institutional set-up in line with other AGETIPE-type agencies created in West
Africa under Bank-financed operations. It offers, at competitive prices, services which have proven to be
economical and efficient. AGETIPE's activities would be regularly subject to annual technical audits carried
out by a highly qualified independent firm. After the end of the second year, selection of another CMA, in
case of need, would be handled in accordance with the Guidelines for the use of consulting services.
7. Short-lists of consultants for contracts estimated under US$ 100,000 may be comprised entirely of
national consultants, if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are locally available at
competitive costs. This would particularly apply to contracts for architectural and engineering services.
However, if foreign firms have expressed interest for those contracts, they will not be excluded from
consideration.
8. NGO activities (in the area of Community Health, Prevention of STD/AIDS, Reproductive Health, IEC
and construction and repair of CSCOMs). The selection of NGOs (estimated at US$ 0.1 million over the
first two years) would be based on their Qualifications (experience and competence relevant to the
assignment). The package of activities proposed by NGOs would be retained on the basis of eligibility
criteria established for that purpose in the Guide for NGOs agreed upon with IDA. NGOs would sign a
convention (costing more than US$ 50,000 but less than US$ 200,000 per convention) with MSPAS.
Standard unit prices based on on-going similar contracts would be used for the purpose of determining the
amount of the packages of activities. The convention would stipulate that: (i) NGOs would receive an
advance of 20% of the estimated amount corresponding to the package of activities, upon submission of
claim and a bank guarantee for equivalent amount -- valid until the delivery of services reaches the
corresponding amount; and (ii) eligible expenditures would be reimbursed at the percentage of 80% against
the provision of documentation justifying the expenses.
9. IDA Reviews. Contracts financed by IDA, or contracts financed by other donors eventually administered
by IDA, above the threshold value of US$ 200,000 equivalent for works and goods will be subject to IDA's
prior review procedures. The review process would cover about 80% of the total value of the amount
contracted for goods, and 60% of the amount contracted for civil works -- see Table B below. Selective post-
review of contracts awarded below the threshold level will apply to about one in three contracts and will be
carried out by Bank staff -- using audits, technical audits, and other consultants, as necessary. Bank staff will
also review the selection process for the hiring of consultants proposed by the Borrower. Prior IDA review
for the selection of consultants will include the review of budgets, short-lists, selection procedures, requests
for proposals, evaluation reports, contract awards, and negotiated contracts. Prior IDA review will not apply
to contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000
and US$ 50,000 equivalent, respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA review will not apply to the
Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of their value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a
critical nature as determined by IDA, or to amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the
above-mentioned prior review thresholds. For consultant contracts estimated above US$ 150,000, opening
the financial envelopes will not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical
evaluation. For contracts estimated to cost less than US$ 150,000 and more than US$ 100,000, the borrower
will notify IDA of the results of the technical evaluation prior to opening the financial proposals. Documents
related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the borrowers for ex-post

review by auditors and by IDA supervision missions. For training abroad and in-country, the program --
containing names of candidates, costs estimates, content of courses, periocls of training and selection of
training institutions -- will be reviewed by IDA annually.
10. Modification or waiver of the scope and conditions of contracts. Before agreeing to any material
extension, or any modification or waiver of the conditions of contracts that would increase in aggregate its
cost by more than 15 percent of the original price, the Borrower should specify the reasons thereof and seek
IDA's prior no-objection for the proposed modification.
I1. Procurement Status of Ongoing Projects and Proposed Arrangements. National bidding procedures
for public procurement in Mali have recently improved, but, as pointed out during the last CPAR which took
place in April 1998, practices are still slow and staff still need extensive training. A sound procurement code
was issued in 1995, and the implementation decree determines target times for each step of the procurement
process. The introduction of simplified procedures and training of staff which would be supported under
Etank financing (IDF Grant) would normally improve the current situation in Mali, in the near future. Under
the previous IDA-financed project, MSPAS already gained a substantial experience of Bank's procedures.
Instead of being administered by the previous project coordination unit, procurement would be managed by
the permanent Directorate in charge of Administrative and Financial Affairs (DAF), , as part of financial
management. The DAF includes, among other financial entities, a procurement unit and a technical unit in
charge of facilities and materials. An assessment of the current capacity of the DAF was carried out during
project preparation, and strengthening needs received a special attention during preparation and appraisal.
Basically, the DAF will be reinforced through: (i) the transfer of personnel who acquired experience by
working in the previous project coordination unit; (ii) the recruitment of qualified staff and ad hoc short-term
consultant services, as required; (iii) a permanent technical support and training program, during the first two
program years, delivered by a specialized private firm -- to be selected and hired before credit effectiveness.
The DAF will also benefit from the pernanent support of a CMAs -- AGErTIPE, private engineering firms
and NGOs -- for the management of civil works contracts, as well as support from annual technical audits.
12. A draft Manual of Procedures -- including a procurement section -- was submitted during appraisal.
Necessary revisions were discussed and agreed during a three-day workshop with key Malian authorities and
other donors and a final version is expected before negotiations.
13. During negotiations, the Government will submit and agree with IDA on: (a) a draft procurement plan
for the first two program years; (b) a final version of the Manual of Procedlures; (c) a proposal to select a
firm to provide training and guidance to the DAF in the area of financial management; (d) a proposal to
select two firms to conduct technical audits, and to assist in defining technical specifications for specialized
materials; (e) standard bidding documents to be used under NCB procedures for civil works and goods; and
(f) a detailed recruitment and training plan . The Government will also give assurance that it will: (a) use the
Manual of Procedures; (b) use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB, the Standard Request for
Proposals for the selection of consultants, and the Standard Bid Evaluation reports; (c) apply the procurement
procedures and arrangements outlined above; (d) update the procurement plan I on a regular basis during
annual reviews with IDA and other donors, to compare target times and actual completion, and transmit it to
IDA, during implementation, with all procurement-related documents; and (e) carry out, during annual
reviews, an assessment of the effectiveness of bidding procedures and performance, as they relate to the
program's procurement experience, and propose for IDA and other donors' consideration any modification to
the current procedures to the extent that would accelerate procurement -- while still maintaining compliance
with Procurement Bank's Guidelines and adequate control over contract awards and payments.
' /Indicating compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement, revised cost estiimates for
individual contracts and the total program -- including best estimates of allowances for contingencies, as well as revised
timing of estimated procurement actions.

B. Disbursement
1. The proposed IDA Credit will finance a five-year investment program of a ten-year investment plan. It
will be disbursed over five years according to the categories shown in Table C below. The Credit would not
follow the standard disbursement profile for Mali, as implementation arrangements are based on a five-year
program. Thus, the program would not exceed the five-year completion period, and the credit closing date
would be six month after the end of the fifth year, to allow payments of last invoices for contracts completed
before the completion date.
2. Disbursements of the credit would be fully documented at time of submission of withdrawal application,
except for expenditures valued at less than US$ 200,000 equivalent which would be made against Statements
of Expenditures (SOEs), and would be kept available for examination by auditors, technical audits, and by
IDA supervision missions. Applications for direct payments can be submitted for amounts exceeding
US$ 100,000 equivalent. This amount would be increased to US$ 200,000 following satisfactory assessment
of financial management at the end of the second year.

(b): Includes investment activities for the remaining two program years to be allocated in accordance
with financing plans agreed at the joint annual meeting between Government and donors.
Counterparts Funds, Program Account, and IDA support for Operating Costs
3. Government's counterpart funds needed for twelve (12) months to cover the share of investment not
financed by IDA and other donors -- including advances for operating costs to decentralized health centers --
will be deposited by the government in a Program Account (PA) -- using the Budget de Contre-Partie sur
Investissenients (BCI) -- not later than January 31 each year. Government has decided to use the BCI for the
provision of all counterpart funds. Payment by the Government of the first tranche of US$ 1,500,000 is a
condition of credit effectiveness. Mechanisms to improve allocation of operating costs at the field level is an
important feature of the program. As described in the Manual of Procedures, in addition to regular budget
allocation from the national budget, advances in the amount of up to CFAF 10 million -- corresponding to the
assessment of incremental operating costs for a six-month period -- would be made by the government using
funds from the national budget district health team. It would be used exclusively to make payments for
expenditures related to training, supervision and maintenance at the level of district health team -- with a
breakdown by district and by objectives. The IDA credit, and eventually other donors, would replenish the
PA by reimbursing 90% of eligible operating costs for training, supervision and maintenance disbursed by the

districts upon receipt of the necessary documentation -- certified at the regional level and subject to internal
and extemal financial controls -- supporting incurred expenditures, and a report on the level of expenditures
made against the regular national budget.
Special Account
4. To facilitate disbursements, the government would also open a Special Program Account (SPA) at a
commercial bank in Bamako for the IDA's share of eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation would be
the equivalent of US$ 2,000,000 equivalent -- representing about two months of disbursemrent. IDA would
make an initial deposit of US$ 1,000,000 equivalent upon credit effectiver-cs, and the rcmaining balance will
be made available as soon as cumulative disbursements reach US$ 4,000.000. IDA would replenish the SPA
upon receipt of appropriate documentation satisfactory to IDA for incurred eligible expenclitures. Each
replenishment request will be accompanied, as necessary, by an up-to-date bank statement and a
reconciliation statement. To strengthen the Program's accounting and finaincial management, IDA would
carry out, at the end of the first year of implementation, a comprehensive assessment of the Program's
financial management to determine its adequacy and readiness for a new enhanced disbursement method -- to
be discussed with IDA at that time. A second assessment would be carried out at the end of the third quarter
of the second year of implementation to evaluate the effectiveness of the transition to the new enhanced
disbursement mode (LACI).
Accounting/Auditing
5. Separate and consolidated accounting records will be maintained at the central, regional levels by
designated financial staff. In addition to maintaining the accounts at the central level, the IDAF will be
responsible for the consolidation of the program accounts and the production of the annual financial
statement. All procurement documents, contracts, and invoices would be maintained separately by the DAF
and be made accessible to supervision missions and auditors. During negotiations, the government would
provide assurance that: (a) program accounts and audit reports by independent auditors (following
International Audit Standards) will be submitted to IDA within six months after the end of the government
fiscal year; and (b) reports on the construction program and technical audil:s by an independent engineering
firm will be submitted within three months after the end of the governmen t fiscal year. Financial auditors will
also: (i) express separate opinions on SOEs and the special account; and (ii) perform interim audits (9
months into the fiscal year) to review the internal control system including management performance, and
issue reports to that effect within one month from the end of their work. The findings and recommendations
of the interim reports will be attended to by management right away before the return of the auditors for the
final audit (mostly 3-4 months after closing of the fiscal year of the program). The contracting of auditors
(financial and technical), on multi-year contract, acceptable to IDA, and certification by the financial auditors
that the DAF's accounting system is operational, is a condition of credit effectiveness.
Reporting
6. The [CPS] will submit the following reports prepared jointly by the DAF: (a) semi-annual progress
reports; (b) an annual report and a proposed financing plan, four weeks before the joint annual review, and
not later than September 30 each year; (c) a detailed progress report on technical and financial program
activities not later than four weeks before the date of mid-term review; and (d) relevant sections of the
implementation completion report (ICR) three months before the closing date.
Supervision
7. The program would require intensive supervision during the start-up phase when implementation
arrangements would be put to the test. The first full IDA/donors mission would take the form of a program
launch workshop, at least three months before the beginning of the Government fiscal Year on January 1,

1999, to establish the annual review cycle. In addition to the first annual review meeting. two supervision
missions will be scheduled during the fiscal year to monitor progress and coordinate with Government and
donors. The program will be supervised every four months for the first year, then everv six months thereafter.
Supervision missions will consist of field trips, including work sites, to review financial and management
practices, bidding, and payments procedures. A mid-term review, including a full technical and financial audit
of the program, as well as beneficiary assessment, will be conducted no later than two years after program
effectiveness, and a end-of-program evaluation will be performed during the second semester of the fifth
year.
