CAMEROON
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Republic of Cameroon
Beneficiary:           Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
Research
Amount:                US$17.8 million
Terms:                 Standard lBRD terms.
Co-financing:          Overseas Development Administration (ODA), United
Kingdom (US$1.6 million on grant terms) and
Gesellschaft Fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ),
Federal Republic of Germany (US$0.8 million on grant
terms).
Project Description:  The project aims at strengthening research to enhance
its effectiveness and relevance to farmers' needs.
The main objectives of the project would be to:
(a) improve the technical, operational and
managerial capabilities of the Institute of
Agronomic Research (IRA) and the Institute of Animal
Research (IRZ); (b) improve research programs by
introducing systematic procedures for the review and
programming of research; and (c) follow-up on the
above to prepare a National Agricultural Research
Program (NARP) in line with Government's agricultural
strategy and farmers' needs.
Project Benefits:      In the short-term, the project would aim at promoting
self-suff:Lciency in the scientific, technical and
administrative expertise of the research institutes
by increasing the skills of national staff engaged in
agricultural research. In the long-term, the project
would help to develop improved agricultural
techniques and new farming systems focused on food
crop and livestock production for local consumption.
It would adapt the new technology to the needs of
smallholders and herders by focusing on methods for
speeding the transfer of research findings to them.



- vii -
Project Risks:         The major risks are that (a) the NARP may not be
prepared in the required time frame and may fail to
meet Government's objectiLves of increased
agricultural production and incomes; and (b) the
project research findings may not be fully relevant
to farmers' needs. The project would minimize these
risl s by (i) making the recruitment of key technical
assistance in preparing the NARP either a condition
of loan effectiveness or a condition of
disbursements; (ii) strengthening the research
programming and administrative capacity of IRA and
IRZ; (iii) enhancing the ability of the regional
centers and stations to undertake relevant research
focused on the farming systems approach and an
effective interfacing of extension agencies; and (iv)
providing additional facilities, expertise and
training.

assistance from the Bank to finance the reinforcement of its agricultural
research, particularly to enhance its relevance to the agricultural
strategy of the country and to farmers' needs. The project would be
cofinanced with the Overseas Development Association (ODA), United Kingdom,
and the Gesellschaft fur Technischezusammenarbeit (GTZ), Federal Republic
of Germany. Furthermore, the project would be carried out in parallel with
a project financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
to strengthen cereal research and facilitate the transfer of research
results to farmers. In addition, the project would supplement the
extensive technical assistance provided by the French Agency for Aid and
Cooperation ("Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation" - FAC). This report
appraises a project that would increase the effectiveness of the research
institutes and assist them in addressing Government's priorities of
increasing food production and improving the non-plantation sector.
1.02      The project was designed by the Institute of Agronomic Research
("Institut de la Recherche Agronomique" - IRA) and the Institute of Animal
Research ("Institut de la Recherche Zootechnique" - IRZ) of the General
Delegation for Scientific and Technical Research ("Delegation Generale a la
Recherche Scientifique et Technique" - DGRST), now part of the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research ("Ministere de l'Enseignement
Superieur et de la Recherche Scientifique" - MESRES), under the name
"Direction de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique" (DRST) since 1983.
The project was prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization/
Cooperative Program (FAO/CP). It was appraised in April/May 1983,
post-appraised in November 1983, and pre-negotiated in June 1985.
Negotiations were held in Washing on from July 28 to August 1, 1986.
B.   Physical Characteristics and Climate
1.03      The Republic of Cameroon covers 475,000 km2 (Map No. 17515R), of
which one-third (156,000 km2) is classified as agricultural.  The 1984
population was estimated at 9.4 million, over 40% being under 15 years of
age and about 75% depending directly on the rural sector. With the current
3.2% per annum growth rate, by the year 2000 the population should reach
about 16 million, of which more, than 50% would be urban. Consequently, a
substantial increase in agricultural production is required if urban food
needs are to be met from domestic sources.



- 2 -
1.04      Differences in latitude (from 2° to 13° N.) and in relief (Map
No. 17515R) have created various eco-climatic zones in Cameroon. From
South to North, one finds a tropical rain forest: plateau at 500-800 m
altitude, then a savannah rising to the high plateau of Adamaoua at
1,200-1,800 m, and North of this plateau, the northern plains (under 200
m), which are bordered to the West by the Mandara mountains and extend to
the flood plains of Lake Chad. West of the Adamaoua range, running
southwest, rise the highlands of the Bamboutos and the Manengouba ranges;
the highlands slope down abruptly to the western and coastal lowlands
(under 300 m altitude).  Amid the lowlands, Mount Cameroon, Western
Africa's highest mountain (4,070 m), rises in isolation.
1.05     Total rainfall and length of the rainy season generally decline
from more than 2,500 mm over a single long rainy season in the coastal
lowlands to about 1,500 mm during two ra ny seasons in the central
savannah, and about 400 mm and a long dry season in the upper reaches of
the Lake Chad plains (Map No. 17515R).
1.06      The eco-climatic zones can be classified into five major physical
regions: the northern plains, the central savannah, the western highlands,
the western and coastal lowlands, and the southern rain forest. There are
pronounced differences in size and population density among these regions,
as shown below.

The Northern Plains
1.07        This region is characterized by a re[Latively low rainfall and
high temperatures during a long dry season. The staple crops are millet
and sorghum which cover more than half the cultivated area. Cotton and
groundnuts are other important crops, and the former has expanded in recent
years due to the efforts of the Cotton Development Company ("Societe de
Developpement du Coton" - SODECOTON), although since the dramatic fall of



- 3 -
the world market price for cotton in late 1985, SODECOTON is discouraging a
further expansion until the world market reestablishes itself. Maize,
cowpeas and cassava are secondary crops; so is rice, generally rainfed,
except in the irrigated perimeters such as those under the Agency for the
Promotion and Modernization of Rice Cultivation at Yagoua ("Societe
d'Expansion et de Modernisation de la Riziculture, Yagoua" - SEMRY).
1.08      In the northern part of these plains, the climate is Sudano-
Sahelian, with a rainfall of 400-800 mm over 4-5 months. There are some
fertile alluvial soils, but part of the area near Lake Chad is inundated
during the rainy season, and there are about 200,000 ha of low-lying,
surface-hardened alluvial soils on which little can be grown. Population
density ranges from about 25/km2 in the plains to over 100/km2 in the
western hills due to the more favorable environment.
1.09      The southern part of the plains (Benoue) has a Guineo-Sudanian
climate, with tree savannah vegetation. The annual precipitation is
1,000-1,400 mm over 6 to 7 months. The soils, partly alluvial, are red
earth and vertisols. Although this environment is favorable to
agriculture, population density is low (about 6/km2) because
trypanosomiasis and other diseases have hampered human settlement.
The Central Savannah
1.10      This region comprises two zones:  the Adamaoua plateau grasslands
in the North and the lower lying tree savannah extending South to the edge
of the rain forest. Elevation declines from 1,800-1,200 m on the plateau
to 900-600 m in the savannah. The climate is equatorial, with an average
precipitation of 1,100-1,500 mm during two rainy seasons. Soils are red
and partly volcanic on the plateau and mostly ferralitic of granitic origin
in the savannah. There is abundant grass vegetation, with riverine forests
in the southern part. In the past, the plateau was an important grazing
area, with a substantially larger cattle population than today. Tsetse
infestation, which started in the mid-1950s, severely restricts livestock
potential, although recent eradication campaigns have brought more than
one-third of the grazing lands back into production. The area is also
suitable for a variety of crops, especially cereals (millet, sorghum and
maize).
1.11      Population density iLs very low because of difficult access and
the extensive landuse of migratory cattle-raising and itinerant cropping.
Most human settlement is concentrated along the roads from Yaounde to
Ngaoundere and Garoua to the North, and the Central African Republic to the
East. The opening of the railroad link Belabo-Ngaoundere in early 1974 has
contributed to the development of the central part of this region.
The Western Highlands
1.12      This region covers the Western and Northwestern Provinces and
consists mostly of lands at over 1,000 m in elevation. It covers only 6%



- 4 -
of the country's area, but accounts for 30% of the population because the
fertile soils, elevation, and absence of trypanosomiasis have attracted
human settlement. Arabica coffee is grown on almost every farm and is
generally interplanted with a wide range of food crops, like maize,
grolndnuts, beans and taros.
1.13      Two main zones can be delimited within the region.  First, the
southern part, mostly hilly with steep slopes, at altitudes from 1,000 to
2,800 m, is mostly occupied by Cameroon's largest ethnic group, the
Bamileke.  Population density in some areas exceeds 250/km2, and
practically all arable land is under cultivation with arabica coffee and
food crops. Soils are ferralitic, red and brown earth on basalt. Annual
rainfall ranges from 1,500 to 2,000 mm. Continuous cultivation on fairly
steep slopes under these conditions raises sign:Lficant dangers of erosion.
Second, north of the Bamenda-Jakiri road are the Bamenda grasslands where
altitude ranges from 1,000 to 2,300 m, and annual precipitation is about
2,500 mm. Dark fertile soils of volcanic origin abound. The population
density is 100/km2.  Arabica coffee and food crops are extensively grown in
the valleys, but toward the high elevations, natural grasslands grazed by
Fulani-owned cattle become predominant. The potential for mixed farming is
good.
The Western and Coastal Lowlands
1.14      These lowlands comprise those parts of Southwest, Littoral and
Cent,er and South Provinces, with altitude under 300 m. Yellow and red
ferralitic soils predominate, but there are also young brown basaltic soils
derived from volcanic outflows near Mount Cameroon and along the Mungo
Valley, which runs northeast from Douala to Melong.
1.15      Average annual rainfall is over 2,500 mm. North of Douala there
is only one rainy season, with the highest precipitation from July (in
Victoria) to October (in Kumba). South of Douala there is a first rainy
season, March to June, followed by a drier month (July) and a second rainy
season from August to November. Commercial agriculture is predominant in
this region with oil palm and rubber being the main estate crops.
Plantain, maize and root crops are the main food crops produced by
traditional smallholders and robusta coffee is their most important
cash crop.
1.16      More than 50% of the population lives in urban centers, mostly in
Douala, Uimbe-Tiko-Buea, Nkongsamba and Edea. Outside these cities, the
population has heavily settled in the Mungo Valley and along the principal
roads, resulting in a very uneven distribution within the region. The
heavy urban concentration creates important and growing markets for food
crops from the region and the surrounding areas.
The Southern Rain Forest
1.17      Most of the South, Central and Eastern Provinces, and part of the
Littoral and Western Provinces, fall within this region. Altitude ranges



- 5 -
from 500 to 800 m, and yellow and red ferralitic soils predominate. The
average rainfall is between 1,400 and 1,900 mm, declining from West to East
and from South to North. The population density is relatively high
(90/km2) around Yaounde; it declines with distance from the city, and is
only slightly over 1/km2 in the primary forest areas of the southeast.
Cocoa is the principal cash crop; robusta coffee is grown particularly in
the eastern part, and vegetables are produced around Yaounde. The main
food crops are plantain, cassava and cocoyams.
1.18      The road network around Yaounde has been improved in recent
years, but transport remains difficult outside the main areas. Feeder
roads are inadequate, hindering crop marketing during the rainy season and
the phytosanitary treatment of cocoa. Few roads exist in the more distant
areas, and communications remain the major constraint to development.
C.   The Economy
Current Status and Future Prospects
1.19      In recent years Cameroon has registered a remarkable economic
performance. Growth averaged 6.9% in the second half of the 1970s and is
estimated at above 9.1% per annum for the first half of the 1980s.
Cameroon' s GNP per capita (US$800 in 1983) is one of the higher in
Sub-Saharan Africa.
1.20      The rapid structural transformation of the Cameroonian economy is
due to rising production and export of petroleum. Prior to the
exploitation of oil, Cameroon was dependent on agricultural products for
the bulk of its foreign exchange earnings. Even as late as 1980,
agricultural commodities accounted for over 70% of all export earnings,
with cocoa and coffee alone accounting for 53%. Oil exports, which
represented only 1% of total exports in 1977/78, rose to some 52% in
1980/81 and 63% in 1983. As a result, the relative share of agricultural
exports (whose value remained stable) fell to 37% in 1980/81 and to an
estimated 25% in 1983. Similar, although less dramatic, shifts have
occurred in the structure of domestic production. Between 1977/78 and
1984/85, the proportion of agricultural production (including forestry and
fisheries) fell from 32% to 21% of GDP, while oil production rose from
about 0.5% of GDP to 14.5% in 1985. These trends--raising the share of oil
in GDP and exports, and attendant reduction of agriculture share--have
continued during 1984/85. However, with the recent decline in oil prices
and the projected decline in oil production, agriculture will have to
become once again Cameroon's main source of growth.
Recent Trends in Budgetary Revenue
1.21      Government budgetary revenue has increased dramatically in recent
years, from CFAF 213 billion in 1979/80 to CFAF 899 billion in 1984/85,



- 6 -
partly because of the increased share of oil revenue used to finance the
regular budget and partly because of the increase in crude oil production
from 2.8 million tons in 1980 to 8.4 million tons in 1984/85 (from CFAF 243
billion to CFAF 721 billion in gross revenue respectively). Oil production
is now about to peak at approximately 8.5 million tons, to decrease to 6
million tons in the early 1990s and to dwindle thereafter.
The Agriculture Sector
1.22      Cameroon's diversified agriculture sector (including forestry and
fisheries) provides a livelihood for about 75% of the population. The
sector is divided into traditional agriculture and industrial plantations,
the latter covering approximately 2.5 million ha, or 16% of the country's
cultivable area. The traditional sub-sector, comprising nearly one million
smallholdings (about 2 ha average size each), accounts for over 93% of
total crop production, for both subsistence and the domestic market.
Cocoa, coffee and cotton are produced for export. Livestock production,
mainly by nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists in the North and
sma:Llholders in the Northwest, accounts for about 15% of the agricultural
production of the traditional sub-sector. The estate sub-sector comprises
several large predominantly Government-owned plantations and produces
mainly palm oil for domestic consumption and rubber for export.
1.23      The total forest area of Cameroon is estimated at 33 million ha,
or approximately two-thirds of the country's area, of which 18 million ha
are densely forested. The balance consists of savannah and riverine
woodlands. In 1981/82, about 8 million ha of forest were licensed for
exp:Loitation and produced about 1.9 million m3 logs, of which more than 50%
was transformed domestically.
1.24      The fishery sub-sector produces about 125,000 tons of fish
products annually, or about 84% of the national consumption. Fresh water
fisheries account for 47% of the production while artisanal and industrial
marine fisheries account respectively for 40% and 13%.
1.25      Cameroon is largely self-sufficient in food, but cereal imports
--mainly wheat and rice for the urban market--have risen since 1970 and,
due to the growing urban population, are expected to continue to grow. For
examnple, wheat is expected to account for 25% of all cereals consumed by
the year 2000, which, because of unfavorable climatic conditions for this
crop in Cameroon, will have to be imported. Although the potential for
increased rice production is good, gains are unlikely to meet consumer
demand. Thus, an overall increase in cereal imports can be expected,
which, if not carefully planned, may adversely affect local food
production.
1.26      The large regional variations in cropping patterns and population
densities lead to marked regional disparities in farm incomes. Comparable
data are only available for 1980 when per capita farm incomes in the cocoa
and coffee producing areas of the South were about US$220 (1980), but in
the Western Highlands (maize and coffee areas) and some parts of the



Northern Province (mainly sorghum and millet areas), where population
densities exceed 200/km2, they were only US$140. Moreover, average per
capita income in agriculture is low compared with the national average and
contributes to the steady migration to the cities.
1.27      Greater emphasis is being placed by Government on improving
social infrastructure in the rural areas and on projects aimed at raising
the productivity of smallholder farming. The main constraints to the
implementation of these projects are the lack of appropriate agricultural
technology resulting from inadequate research and extension services, weak
institutions, poor roads, and inefficient input supply and product
marketing arrangements. Government recognizes the essential role of the
agricultural sector for the long-term stability of the economy and in its
Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1981-1986) gave highest priority to
increasing agricultural productivity. This reflects Government's concern
about the growth in urban food demand and the declining and aging rural
population resulting from rural-urban migration. The Sixth Plan
(1986-1991), still under preparation, maintains this high priority on food
crops, but also raises the need to increase export crop production to
compensate for declining oil production. To set the stage for accelerated
growth, Government increased its investment in the agriculture sector to a
planned 24% under the Fifth Plan (with an actual 11% under the Fourth Plan)
and intends to maintain this level under the Sixth Plan.
D.   Sector Issues and Strategy
The Smallholder Sub-Sector
1.28      Crop production is almost entirely carried out on small family
farms which, depending on location, range from 1 to 4 ha and grow mixed
stands of cash crops (coffee, cocoa, cotton) and food crops. There are
about one million such farms with approximately 2.2 million ha under crops.
Small farmers plant food crops mostly for subsistence and sell only what
they cannot store or their surplus from consumption.
1.29      Livestock raising is also a traditional activity.  Transhumant
pastoralists in the North raise cattle in herds of a few dozen up to
several hundred, and range into neighboring countries in search of seasonal
grazing. Cattle are often kept as a means of investment, insurance and
productive resource. Most small farmers in the more humid areas have a few
fowl and pigs for their own consumption, supplemented in the highlands and
Northern Plains by goats and sheep. Intensive pig and poultry operations
have been strongly developed over the last few years, usually by
entrepreneurs who buy their breeding stock through commercial channels, buy
and blend their own feeds on an ad hoc basis, and supply local markets.
Commercial feed supply and poultry processing industries are developing in
parallel. Intensive cattle fattening has not developed, as there are no
price premia for quality meat, except in a narrow sector of urban markets
(Douala and Yaounde), and the marketing of most livestock products remains
traditional.



-8-
The Estate Sub-Sector
1.30      Commercial agriculture is concentrated in the Western and Coastal
Lowlands, and produces mainly oil palm and rubber and, to a lesser extent,
bananas, coffee and tea.  Approximately, one-fourth of the estimated
300,000 ha is found in three large Government-owned estates. These estates
have expanded dramatically under several Bank-financed projects to reach
39,000 ha of palm oil, rubber, banana, and tea (Cameroon Development
Corlporation - CAMDEV); 21,000 ha of rubber (Palm Development Company -
"Societe Camerounaise de Palmeraies" - SOCAPALM); and 15,000 ha of oil palm
(Cameroon Rubber Development Company - "Socifte Camerounaise de
Developpement de l'Hevea" - HEVECAM). Private plantations are next in
size: 10,000 ha of oil palm (Unilever Group - "Socifte Pamol Cameroon" -
PAKOL); 6,300 ha of rubber (African Forestry and Agriculture Company,
Cameroon - "Socifte Africaine Forestiere et Agricole" - SAFACAM); and 3
500 ha of rubber (Swiss Farms Investments Company - "Socifte
d'Investissements des Fermes Suisses" - SIFS).  The rest of the area is
covered by small tree crop plantations, varying in size from a few dozen to
several hundred hectares. Government's broad strategic objective for the
estate sub-sector is to encourage the creation of medium-size holdings in
association with the existing plantations, rather than to continue the
rap:Ld expansion of large Government estates witlh uneven management
performance.
AgriLcultural Production Priorities
1.3]L     Cameroon is determined to use its oil wealth to foster
development, particularly agricultural development, which remains the first
nati1 onal priority. However, despite increased :Lncentives, the average age
of perennial crops has continued to rise along with the average age of the
rural population; the distribution and use of fertilizers, improved
vari eties and other inputs are still inadequate; the performance of
Government's extension and training services continues to fluctuate and to
have little impact; crop yields and herd productivity have remained
relatively static; and the poor management of State agricultural
enterprises and cooperatives has hampered their effectiveness.
1.32'      To overcome these problems, both the Fifth and Sixth Plans give
priority to increased agricultural productivity through more emphasis on
agricultural research and a more effective delivery of extension advice,
improved inputs and social services. They aim at increasing confidence in,
and rationalizing, State agricultural institutions and cooperatives,
especially the parastatal companies whose mandate is being extended to
cover rural development activities over entire regions. They also
emphasize the need to formulate adequate incentive policies for the
producers.  Programs based on these objectives are intended to secure
national food supplies in the medium and long term, raise output and income
per hectare and per farm worker, improve the quality of rural life, reduce
rural migration to the cities, and generate surpluses for export.



-9-
Bank Group Involvement and Lending Strategy
1.33      Since 1967, the Bank Group involvement in agricultural projects
amounts to 22 loans and credits (US$362.9 million). The largest single
group of projects (11) has been in the tree crop sub-sector (oil palm,
cocoa and rubber); the other projects have concerned rural development (4
projects), livestock (2 projects), rice production (2 projects), forestry
(1 project) and Rural Development Funds (2 projects). Government's
performance in implementing these projects has been mixed. The
implementation of the Second Livestock, the ZAPI and the Oil Palm/Rubber
Rehabilitation Projects was hampered by serious organizational, managerial
and financial problems, but major improvements have been made since 1984.
Government's performance in implementing the other projects has been
generally good and achievements have been satisfactory. The lending
program includes two appraised projects (the proposed project and the Cocoa
Rehabilitation project) and two projects are under preparation: a National
Extension and Training Project and a Third Livestock project.
II. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
A.   Agronomic Research and Animal Research
Agronomic Research
2.01      Crop research is organized in four parts which largely cover the
major ecological zones. Each is, or is to be, provided with a hierarchical
network of a research center controlling research stations and their
antennas (Map No. 17514R). Nationally, there are 22 agronomic research
programs for commodities or subject matters. Within each commodity
program, the most common disciplinary activities are breeding and
selection, agronomy, and plant protection. Processing technology and seed
multiplication are sometimes also involved.
2.02      The relative importance of the various agronomic research
programs is indicated by the allocation of researchers and funds. The
situation for 1984/85 is given in the Table on page 11.
2.03      Over the past four years important progress has been made to
improve program preparation and to reorient research programs in order to
provide high quality applicable research on food crops and to facilitate
transmission of research results to farmers. A beginning has been made in
establishing a well defined research programming process for agronomic
programs such as cereals and root crops. In principle, researchers
participate in the process from the start and, once a year, prepare a data
sheet for each research operation, which is to be part of a theme, each
theme a part of a sub-program and each sub-program a part of a program.
After compilation and approval at center level, the combined program and
budget proposals are transmitted to the Director of IRA who submits them to



- 10 -
the Institute's program committee for examination; this committee is
composed of representatives of relevant ministries, large user organiza-
tions, development agencies and projects. The DRST reviews the programs
and budgets in the light of the program committee's comments. The document
is then submitted for approval in July (6-7 months after the program
committee's review) to IRA's Managing Board chaired by a representative of
the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.
2.04      These efforts are now starting to generate positive results.  No
longer do research programs only emphasize estate and cash crops or
constitute merely a compilation of the activities and interests of
individual workers; new research findings applicable to smallholdings are
becoming increasingly available: improved groundnut and sorghum varieties
are near release; a new variety of cowpea from the International Institute
of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has shown much higher yields than the local
varieties; new spacing and rotation with macabo (Xanthosoma
sagittifolium)--a variety of cocoyam--have resulted in lower disease
losses; and a maize production package has been developed and is being
dissemminated in the Northwest.
2.05      In spite of this positive trend, weaknesses still exist:  (a) the
organizational structure of IRA and IRZ is still rather bureaucratic and
centralized; (b) the efficiency of planning and programming is hampered by
lengthy procedures and by the lack of external review of each region's
research activities; and (c) the administrative capacity remains weak and
physical infrastructure and research-extension-farmer linkages are
inadequate for the present needs.
2.06      Forestry research covers the main ecological zones of Cameroon
(northern savannah woodlands, central semi-deciduous forest and southern
wet evergreen forests). Emphasis is on the introductory trials of exotic
species, enrichment planting trials with indigenous species in heavily
logged forests of the central and southern regions, plantation
establishment techniques, and volume table preparations including forest
inventory work. Overall results are encouraging, although the enrichment
planting trial areas require careful economic evaluation prior to extending
these techniques as practical means of regenerating these forests.
Research work at Maroua and Foumban, where improved tree seed production
units have been established under the Bank-financed Forestry Project
(1982), suffers from a lack of offices, laboratories and suitable
equipment, especially to carry out pre-planting soil cultivation and
mechanized weedings.

Animal Research
2.07      Livestock research is carried out mainly in the northern and
northwestern regions where livestock population is the highest. It started
in 1942 with the establishment of the Bambui Station in Western Cameroon,
followed by the Northern Station at Wakwa in 1956 (Map No. 17514R).



- 12 -
Enphasis is on beef and dairy cattle, although over the last decade more
attention has been paid to pigs, poultry and small ruminants in the Western
Province.
2.08      Most of the cattle production research has been on the
introduction and testing of exotic breeds.  Both meat breeds (Brahman,
Angus, Charolais) and dairy breeds (Montbeliard, Holstein-Friesian) have
been imported for this purpose. However, the high level of management
required to ensure the productivity, and even the survival of this
sophisticated and vulnerable stock causes senLor research staff to be
mostly occupied with routine husbandry operations to the detriment of
relevant research. Furthermore, the results of this work do not interest
the traditional producers since they need hardy, multipurpose animals and
not the specialized breeds (meat or milk) of the research stations.
2.09      Pasture research to support higher cattle productivity is still
in the agronomic phase, and although promising legumes and grass cultivars
have been identified, especially for the Western Province, they still must
be tested with grazing animals and under actual farm conditions. Animal
health work has concentrated mainly on parasitology, but, again, is almost
exclusively carried out under the atypical conditions of the research
stations.
2.10      Pig and poultry research concentrates on intensive raising under
enclosed conditions; geared toward the commercial sector, it mainly tests
agro-industrial by-products for improved feeding regimes. This focus is
pr,obably correct, in view of the growing importance of this type of
commercial production. However, no attention is being paid to the problems
of the smallholder who is still by far the main producer of pig and poultry
meat. Small ruminant research also focuses on the introduction of exotic
breeds, but is still too recent to have produced useful results. In
suummary, little of the present research is relevant either to the actual
situation in the field or to the needs of the livestock owners and,
consequently, there is virtually no useful information for dissemination by
the extension service.
2.1]1     Fishery Research.  Inland fishery, which provides about 40% of
the annual fish consumption, suffers from a dearth of basic data.  Thus,
the first thrust should be to conduct surveys and to collect baseline data
so that the problems and priorities identified could form the base of
inland fishery research. Artisanal coastal fishery research, also
important to the national economy, will be strengthened under the Cameroon
Fisheries Development Corporation ("Mission de Developpement de la Pe^che,
Camteroon" - MIDEPECAM) project financed jointly with Canada.

B.   External Assistance
Bilateral and Multilateral Assistance
2.12      The Institute for Agronomic Research and the Institute for Animal
Research receive substantial external support. This support, which is
expected to be maintained in the foreseeable future, consists mainly of
technical assistance (TA), training, fellowships, facilities, and
equipment. There are about 58 TA personnel of varying qualifications and
experience working in line positions down to self-contained project team
positions, under the general overall authority and coordination of the
institutes' directors. These staff are provided either directly by, or
through, executing agencies such as IITA. France is the most significant
donor and the U.S.A. makes the second largest contribution.
2.13      Of particular relevance to the project is the National Cereals
Research and Extension (NCRE) Project financed by USAID and implemented
since 1982 within IRA with the assistance of high-level researchers from
IITA. Its purpose is to develop within IRA high quality research on maize,
rice, sorghum and millet and to improve communication between researchers,
extensionists and farmers to make research more responsive to the farmers'
needs and to improve the dissemination of research findings. To address
these communication problems, four Testing and Liaison Units (TLUs), headed
by an agro-economist and an extension agronomist, have been established to
undertake (a) agro-socio-economic surveys; (b) on-farm trials; (c) on-farm
demonstrations of improved varieties and agronomic practices; (d) training
of extension workers; and (e) formulation of crop recommendations. The
Project was recently extended to December 31, 1994.
2.14      Many training opportunities are available under external
assistance, but not all courses are appropriate to the needs or abilities
of the Cameroonian research staff. Recently a survey of management
training needs in Cameroon, funded by USAID and ODA, was carried out
jointly by the International Service for National Agricultural Research
(ISNAR) and the Pan-African Institute for Development (PAID/CA). This
study identified some of the major management constraints (paras 2.27 and
2.31), which will be followed up by a more comprehensive Organization and
Management Study to be undertaken before project implementation (para
2.27). It was agreed at negotiations that Government will ask a specialized
institute like ISNAR to carry out this study according to terms of
reference agreed upon by the Bank, that the recommendations of the study
will be reviewed with the Bank, and that a time-bound implementation
program will be agreed upon by December 31, 1987 (para 7.01(a)). USAID is
also financing (with Belgian participation) a US$43 million project to
convert the existing National Agricultural College at Dschang ("Centre
Universitaire de Dschang" - CUD) into a major institution modeled on a U.S.
Land Grant College. The USAID Project should in the long term overcome the
shortage of qualified agriculturists and provide for the replacement of
expatriate researchers by national researchers.

PaLst and Current Research
2.15      Bank Involvement in Agricultural Research.  Most Bank-assisted
agricultural and rural development projects have included adaptive research
components. These components have been designed to carry out adaptive
research on one or several crops in specific areas with a view to
formulate, in close lia son with the project technical and/or extension
services, relevant crop recommendations for smallholdings or estate
plantations. For example, rice research was iincluded in the Plaine des
M'bos Project (1977) and the two SEMRY Projects (1972 and 1978); research
on food crops featured in the ZAPI-East Project (1978), the Western
Highlands Rural Development Project (1978) andl is still included in the
Northern Province Project (1981) and the Second Western Highland Project
(1984); the former project also included research on cotton. Research on
rubber has been, and is being supported under the three HEVECAM Projects
(1975, 1980, and 1985). In most cases, IRA has been directly involved in
these projects on a contractual basis; in the few cases where no formal
contracts were signed, IRA was closely associated with the design and
implementation of the research components.
2.16      Altbough the research efforts undertaken within the
Bank-supported projects have remained limited, they nevertheless have
contributed--admittedly on an ad hoc basis--to making research more
relevant and to giving researchers a sense of farmers' grassroots. Also,
in cases where contracts were signed, research efforts generated additional
finiancial resources that gave individual researchers freedom to depart from
the rigid budgetary procedures of research funded under the regular budget.
C.   The Institutions
The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research
2.17      Government assumed direct responsibility for agricultural
research in 1974 when the National Office for Scientific and Technical
Research ("Office National de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique" -
ONAREST), established in 1965, created its own specialized institutes.
Previously, Government had entrusted most agriculture and forestry research
to specialized French institutions which continue to make large
contributions to agricultural research through the provision of expatriate
researchers and training. In 1979, ONAREST was transformed into the
General Delegation for Scientific and Technical Research, attached to the
Office of the Prime Minister. At the same time, crop and forestry research
merged into one institute (IRA), and livestock and fisheries research into
another (IRZ).  In addition to administering the two agricultural research
institutes, DGRST administered three other research institutes: the
Institute of Human Services, the Institute for Medical Research and
Medicinal Plant Studies, and the Institute of Geology and Mining Research,
plus two national scientific committees concerrned with technology transfer
and the environment. In 1984, bigher education and scientific and



- 15 -
technical research merged into one Ministry (MESRES); its organization
chart is in Annex 2-1.
2.18      The MESRES is responsible for the policy direction of these five
research institutes and chairs the Managing Board of each institute. These
Managing Boards approve program and budget proposals, after which they
become part of the overall MESRES budget, which, in turn, is approved by
the Ministry of Finance (in consultation with the Ministry of Planning)
before being voted by the National Assembly. Program execution is
controlled by MESRES sub-department of programming, whereas budget
execution and personnel evaluation are handled by MESRES central
administration. The Ministry of Finance is also involved in financial
management and control. IRA and IRZ accountants are basically employees of
the Ministry of Finance and ensure compliance with public finance
regulations. Once the budgets are approved, the institute directors and
their center chiefs have some autonomy in authorizing the use of operating
funds. However, procurement procedures involve MESRES, the Ministry of
Computer Services, and Government (contracts).
The Institute of Agronomic Research
2.19      Prior to the establishment of IRA at Nkolbisson near Yaounde in
1974, agronomy and forestry research was largely carried out by the French
Office for Scientific and Technical Research Overseas ("Office de la
Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre Mer" - ORSTOM) and by the
specialized French research institutes that composed the defunct French
Group for Study and Research on Tropical Agronomy (GERDAT). In addition to
crop and forestry research, IRA is responsible for soil and land studies
and maintenance of the national herbarium. Crop research is undertaken by
four regional centers through a hierarchy of research stations and
antennas. There is also a Forestry Center and a newly created Soil Center,
which together with the Regional Center for the Forest Zone are located at
Nkolbisson. The network is still incomplete as the Regional Center for the
West and Northwest (at Foumbot) is not yet established. The IRA
organization chart is shown in Annex 2-2.
2.20      The IRA budget has increased rapidly in recent years, the 1984/85
allocation of CFAF 5.3 billion (US$14.7 million) being more than six times
that of 1978/79; these figures do not include the salaries of expatriate
researchers. IRA employs approximately 2,400 staff, including 139
scientists (48 expatriates) and 90 technicians.
The Institute of Animal Research
2.21      At Independence, livestock research was sub-contracted to the
French Institute for Livestock and Veterinary Medicine in Tropical
Countries ("Institut d'Elevage et de Medecine Veterinaire des Pays
Tropicaux" - IEMVT). In 1974, under the aegis of ONAREST, responsibility
was transferred to the Institute of Animal, Pastoral and Veterinary
Research ("Institut de Recherches Zootechniques, Pastorales et
Vfterinaires" - IRZPV) until a reorganization in 1976 created IRZ, which is



- 16 -
responsible for all livestock and fisheries research. The small IRZ
Headquarters are also located at Nkolbisson, whiere facilities are shared
with IRA. In addition to the centers at Wakwa and Bambui, there are three
stations and three antennas.  A fisheries research station is being built
at Limbe. The budget has also increased rapidly, the 1984/85 allocation of
CFAF 2.6 billion (US$7.2 million) being more than 13 times that of 1978/79.
The! IRZ organization chart is in Annex 2-3.
2.22      Although IRZ has experienced a particularly rapid growth over the
last three years, during which approximately one-third of the budget was
allocated to capital development, its facilities are not yet adequate for
the task ahead. Staffing has also increased rapidly: from a total of 13
researchers in 1979 (7 expatriates), total staff now counts 42 scientists
(10 expatriates) and 50 technicians. However, the scarcity of qualified
Cameroonian staff has led to the recruitment of young and inexperienced
researchers who, in several instances, do not have adequate disciplinary
training for the problems they should address. They also lack practical
knowledge of the traditional livestock systems used by most producers.
2.23      In summary, IRZ lacks infrastructure but has the necessary basic
human resources to contribute significantly to the development of the
liviestock sector. However, to achieve this goal, it needs to upgrade the
quality of its staff, critically review its activities, and orient its
research program more toward the needs of traditional producers. Such a
reorientation would be in line with the Government's emphasis on increased
food production from the smallholder sector. T]he project would assist IRZ
in implementing these changes.
The Extension Agencies
2.24      In its Fifth and Sixth Plans, Government gives responsibility for
agricultural extension to parastatal agricultural development entities.
These may be corporations, agencies or cooperatLves. Some, such as
SODECOTON and the Cocoa Development Company ("Societ6 de Developpement du
Cacao" - SODECAO), already have contact with many small farmers within
their respective regions, while others, such as HEVECAM and SOCAPALM, are
basically plantation companies in contact with few growers. However, all
entities must provide extension assistance--for all crops--to small farmers
in their regions. Some elements of the training and visit approach to
extension are being introduced in these regions.
2.25      The Ministry of Agriculture ("Ministere de l'Agriculture" -
MINAGRI) used to have nationwide responsibility for crop extension, but now
maintains a network of local representatives and field staff in all
provinces. This results in a duplication of effort in the regions covered
by development parastatals. In regions not covered by parastatals, MINAGRI
is establishing Technical Support Centers ("Centres d'Appui Technique" -
CAT) where on-farm trials, demonstrations, and training of extension
agents are carried out to remedy its previous lack of effectiveness.
Although the extension situation is in a state of transition, it is clear
that activities are fragmented and that the performance of parastatals is



- 17 -
likely to be uneven due to their primary purpose and past extension
experience.
2.26      Livestock extension is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industries ("Ministere de lVElevage, de la
Pgche et des Industries Animales" - MINEPIA), which maintains provincial
delegations and field staff throughout the country. However, MINEPIA is
mostly concerned with veterinary problems and has few staff knowledgeable
in animal production and husbandry. Although there has been little
effective contact between MINEPIA and IRZ, partly as a result of their
differing disciplinary outlooks; a recent agreement calls for regular joint
meetings at the regional level.
D.   Major Constraints
Organizational Structures
2.27      IRA and IRZ are only in part organizationally and financially
independent: their research programs, organization, funding, personnel and
information policies and management structures are determined by various
ministries. For the execution of work programs and budgets, these insti-
tutes must follow Government administrative procedures inappropriate for
efficient research management, which cause sub-optimal programs, consider-
able delays in execution and sometimes a waste of funds. These constraints
would be at the center of the Organization and Management Study to be
carried out by ISNAR (para 2.14).
Local Staff Availability
2.28      In recent years, the research institutes have had difficulty in
recruiting enough qualified scientists and technicians interested in a
career in research due to three factors: (a) most graduate
agriculturalists are civil servants listed in the rosters of MINAGRI and
MINEPIA, who assigned only a few to MESRES for posting to research
institutes; (b) there is no alternative for recruiting graduates; and (c)
there is no attractive career profile for technicians.
2.29      Recently, more graduates have been made available to research and
MESRES was also able to recruit directly about 25% of its new scientists;
although the overall situation is now considered adequate, there is a
shortage of technicians, especially for laboratory work. This shortage is
particularly severe in IRA, which employs about 90 technicians for 139
scientists (ratio of 0.65), compared with 50 technicians for 42 scientists
at IRZ (ratio of 1.20), where the situation is also acute. (The optimum
ratio is two technicians to one research worker). Consequently, since
researchers must perform technical work, research efficiency is hindered.
Moreover, all technicians are not fully competent. The insufficient number
of technicians can be explained by (a) better career opportunities in
MINAGRI, the parastatals, and the private sector; and (b) the absence of an
adequate statute for technical personnel and the lack of opportunities for



- 18 -
upward mobility to the level of researcher. However, a statute for
technicians is now under study in MESRES and is expected to improve
recruitment.
2.30      Because of the low priority given to support services by policy
makers and researchers, staff in administration especially are neglected.
A comparison of the remuneration, training and promotion opportunities of
administrative staff with those of researchers or even technicians with
similar qualifications shows considerable inequity which resulted in low
motivation and poor working relationships with researchers and technicians.
The project would seek to alleviate these constraints under the
Organization and Management Study (para 2.14).
Training
2.31       Apart from a course in organization and management of development
projects or a similar subject during their undergraduate studies, most
researchers have had no training in research management or administration,
or in the development of program contents. Since training programs in
research management are not yet available in Cameroon, the project would
provide for specialized training programs (paras 3.20 and 3.27).
FaciLlities
2.32      Adequate offices for IRZ Directorate and the joint facilities
planned under the project (para 3.32) are critically needed. Furthermore,
field stations lack sufficient housing for stafiE at all levels, thus
inhibiting recruitment for remote research statiLons and staff reassignment,
and hampering adequate on-site supervision by technicians. Accommodations
for visiting staff are also required in order to economize on
timet-consuming journeys.
2.33       Some existing scientific and field equipment is old or
dilapidated and there is insufficient transport to provide mobility for the
research staff. This latter problem is exacerbated by the lack of radio
communications between the centers and their stations and antennas, which
results in unnecessary travel.
Research Programming and Management
2.34      Although the quality of research planning has improved greatly
(especially at IRA), more work is necessary: research programs tend to
(a) be overly ambitious, given the financial, technical and human resources
available to the country and the farmers; (b) have marginal practical
relevance because of poor links with farmers' needs, Government policy, and
other research programs; and (c) have lax application methods, which result
in failure to reach program objectives. At IRZ, research programs are
isolated since the primary suggestions for individual research activities
come from the researchers themselves. Their background, training, and
experience make them concentrate on a specific type of problem or a
specific discipline and, in addition, their need to publish scientific



- 19 -
papers to furtbei their careers is most easily met by conducting
traditional statistically-designed experiments of international interest.
This results in an emphasis on high technology studies that are irrelevant
to traditional producers.
2.35      The recent growth of the two research institutes has been so
rapid that their management, administrative structures and staffing have
been unable to control and support research activities. Resource
allocation requires greater emphasis on priorities; procurement,
maintenance and logistic support are all bottlenecks. The project would
seek to alleviate these constraints by addressing the issue of how the
organizational structures of IRA and IRZ and their relationships to MESRES
and other ministries and Government institutions should evolve to
accommodate the eventual new initiatives proposed under the National
Agricultural Research Program (NARP) (para 3.02).
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives, Scope and Scale
Project Objectives
3.01      The project aims at reorienting and strengtbening agricultural
research to enhance its effectiLveness and relevance. It would emphasize
research on food crops and livestock production, as development of suitable
technologies for these sub-sectors has lagged and hampered the
implementation of Government's agricultural programs. It would pay
particular attention to adapting these technologies to the small farmers
and herders' circumstances and to accelerating the transfer of technology
to the producers to raise their productivity and income.
3.02      These objectives emphasize the improvement of research and
management methods and the planning and training activities that would
strengthen the effectiveness of staff and research facilities which are
supported by investments for specific needs. The development of a system
of agricultural research programming attuned to the Government's
agricultural strategy and to the needs of the agricultural community is a
major element of the above approach. Therefore, the introduction of
systematic procedures for the review of researcb activities, the prepara-
tion of a well articulated NARP, and the establishment of a review system,
including regular technical audits of regional centers and national
seminars, should have high priority. Consequently, it was agreed at
negociations that Government will prepare the NARP and submit a draft to
the Bank not later than December 31, 1988, for its comments and promptly
thereafter finalize it and put it into effect (para 7.01(b)), and that
Government will establish regular reviews (para 5.03) and annual seminars
(para 5.04). Although the proposed system of research programming would
not yet be fully developed, a complete review of all regional centers



- 20 -
activities (para 5.02) would be made to form the basis for the NARP.
During NARP preparation, the Centers' infrastructure, organization and
logistic services would be improved.
3.03      The project is in line with the Bank's strategy in Sub-Saharan
Africa, which gives priority to agricultural research. It would (a)
directly complement Bank-assisted ongoing agricultural projects by
developing improved techniques for crop and livestock production, and (b)
facilitate the implementation of their research components. Finally, the
project would help to strengthen the links between the Cameroonian
agricultural research institutes and the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) network of international
centers.
Project Scope
3.04      The project would cover both agronomic research (including tree
crolps and forestry) and animal research (including livestock and
fisheries). It would be nationwide but would focus on areas of maximum
need and potential. Due to the strong emphasis on adaptive,
producer-oriented food crop research, the priority locations selected for
investment are those with high concentrations of small farmers, high
potential for intensified production and/or expansion in cropped area, and
where responsive extension agencies exist or arie likely to be established
in the short- or medium-term. These locations are (a) for agronomic
research: the Western Highlands, the Extreme North and Centre-North, the
Centre-South and East areas, and the Coastal Lowlands; and (b) for
livestock research: the Western Highlands and the Adamaoua Plateau.
Project Scale
3.05      The project scale was determined by the nature and extent of the
actions needed to overcome critical constraints in research programming and
administration, systems research, and priority aspects of disciplinary
research; for each location selected, the project scale was based on the
critical mass of incremental factors required for effective research. Due
consideration was given to (a) expected developments under bilateral aid
(especially from USAID and FAC) to ensure coordination and avoid
duplication, and (b) the constraints imposed by the limited supply of
trained personnel and the implementation capacity of the institutions
concerned.
B.   Summary Description
3.06      The project would have three main components:  agronomic
research, executed by IRA; animal research, executed by IRZ; and joint
facilities managed by IRA (library/documentation center) and IRZ (computer
center).



- 21 -
1.   In agronomic research, the project would:
(i)  enhance the ability of the IRA regional research centers to
undertake relevant studies, with an emphasis on the farming
systems approach and on effective interfacing of the
extension agencies, in particular through the Testing and
Liaison Units of the USAID-financed NCRE project; essential
infrastructure, communications, and other facilities would
be included;
(ii) provide facilities and expertise for the critical aspects of
IRA's priority disciplinary research activities, notably in
nematology and forestry; and
(iii) extend training opportunities to IRA national staff, with
the ultimate goal of making the institute self-sufficient in
scientific, technical, and management expertise.
2.   In animal research, the project would:
(i)  strengthen the research planning and management capacity of
the IRZ Directorate by providing technical assistance and
the necessary additional infrastructure and facilities to
support reorientation toward traditional production systems;
(ii) provide facilities and expertise at the IRZ Bambui and Wakwa
research centers to improve the relevance of their research
programs and to assist in the development of techniques
relevant to most livestock producers in their respective
regions;
(iii) make available adequate analytical expertise and facilities
to support IRZ research on livestock systems; and
(iv) provide training opportunities to improve the academic
knowledge and relevant practical skills of IRZ national
scientists, technicians and administrators.
3.   Concerning the joint facilities, the project would provide the
installations needed by both institutes, but which do not justify
duplication as they can be easily shared, i.e., a library and
documentation center (IRA); a mini-computer facility (IRZ); and
the expertise, training and housing for both facilities.
C.   Detailed Features
3.07      Major buildings and infrastructures, vehicles and important
equipment that the project would provide for each of the three components
are indicated by location in Annex 3-1. Details, by location, of all
investments and operating costs required for project implementation are in



- 22 -
the Project File (Code 220.089(E)). Technical assistance and staffing
requirements are presented below by project component and summarized for
the project as a whole in paragraphs 3.35 to 3.38. Finally, the inputs
that the project would provide for all the research facilities needing them
are described in paras 3.39 and 3.40.
1.   Agronomic Research
_R, Headquarters
3.08      The IRA Directorate would be strengthened so that it could
effectively manage the proposed expansion of the institute.  New senior and
support positions would be established to address the technical,
administrative, and logistical requirements of the institute.
3.09      Of foremost importance would be the improvement of the
Directorate's capacity to develop and manage a problem-oriented research
program consistent with the national agricultural strategy. This would
involve the appointment of an internationally recruited research management
specialist (5 years) and the creation of a biometrical unit (para 3.10) and
the joint computer center (paras 3.31-3.33). Ihe research management
specialist would develop new programming methods based on a critical review
of present research activities against the needs of the target producers
and taking into account the Government's agricultural development policy.
This specialist would be responsible for the preparation of the IRA part of
the NARP. His task would be greatly facilitated by the establishment of
the Technical Audit Committee (TAC), which would periodically perform
in-depth reviews of the centers' activities (para 5.03).
3.10      The prime function of the biometrical unit, headed by an
internationally recruited biometrician (4 years) would be to provide
statistical assistance to researchers and to establish a data bank to store
all new experimental results. High priority would be given to the
improvement of the researchers' ability to analyze data on the spot; data
would be sent to Nkolbisson only for systematic aggregation nationwide and
further analysis by the biometrician and program coordinators.
3.11      Another high priority would be to improve IRA's administrative
and financial management, to reduce not only costs but also present
adm:inistrative and logistical constraints impairing the productivity of the
ind:Lvidual researcher. IRA's management capacity would be strengthened
prinarily through (a) short-term consultancies, training and strengthening
of administrative staff, and (b) a revision of administrative procedures.
The short-term consultant would develop new finiancial and inventory control
systems (e.g., advanced bookkeeping, cost accounting, stock control methods
(para 3.33) compatible with the improved accounting procedures and suited
for computerization. Management and the short-term consultants would also
reorganize the logistical services (e.g., operation and maintenance of the
vehicle fleet and buildings, and procurement of supplies and equipment,
particularly from overseas). A total of 20 months of short-term
consultancy would be provided by the project. As the joint computer



- 23 -
facilities become operational, IRA's accounts would be gradually
computerized (para 3.32).
3.12      Concurrently, IRA's capacity to prepare reports, technical
documents and extension material would be improved by the creation of an
editorial and reporting service. This service, headed by an
internationally recruited scientific editor (3 years), would collaborate
with the new biometrical service in compiling and analyzing data on
previous experimental work. In addition, IRA's documentation service would
be expanded into a joint IRA-IRZ library/documentation center under IRA's
management to help researchers keep abreast of the latest developments in
their fields and to facilitate review of reference material by both IRA/IRZ
and outside researchers.
3.13      The interaction between researchers, extension officers and the
small farmers would be improved mainly by strengthening the farming systems
research program supported by the TLUs (paras 2.13 and 5.10). The above
research program would benefit from the establishment of the diagnostic
review of all IRA and IRZ centers and the preparation of the NARP (para
5.03).
Civil Works and Equipment
3.14      Facilities would be improved and expanded at the IRA Directorate
and in the Region to support agronomic research. Nine senior staff and
four junior support staff houses would be constructed at Nkollisson and
furnished according to official standards. A total of eight station-wagons
and nine four-wheel-drive cars would be provided to ensure adequate
mobility during the project. Office equipment, including two
micro-computers, would be installed at headquarters.
Regional Research Facilities
3.15      A considerable effort would be made under the project to improve
the research centers and their stations and antennas, the key input being
the construction of a new center at Foumbot to serve the West and Northwest
regions. During the first two years of the project, 220 m2 of laboratories
and 300 m2 of offices would be constructed and equipped, as would 17
houses, 490 m2 of stores, garages and drying areas, and a dispensary; 10
kilometers of internal roads would be constructed; the vehicles provided
would include 5 station-wagons, 2 four-wheel drive pick-ups, 1 seven-ton
truck, 9 motorcycles, and 1 agricultural tractor trailer with field and
specialized equipment.
3.16      Two new field trial grounds would be established under the
project on 450 ha, made available to IRA by Government: one at Mouda (PYl)
for the Maroua Center and the other at Minkomayos (PY2) to serve the
Nkolbisson Center. A total of 20 km of fences, 12 km of internal roads,
8 houses for technicians and skilled support staff, 160 m2 of laboratories,



- 24 -
and 140 m2 of offices would be constructed. T'hese grounds would be
equipped with 3 four-wheel drive pick-ups and 2 agricultural tractors with
field equipment and implements.
3.17      The other regional research facilities, excluding forestry
research facilities (para 3.18), would be upgraded by building, furnishing,
and equipping 770 m2 of laboratories, 410 m2 of offices, and 48 houses (26
for senior staff). Fences and internal roads would be built on those
research stations and antennas that lack them, and utility lines would be
connected or wells and generators provided as appropriate. Provision would
be made for 21 station-wagons, 18 four-wheel drive pick-ups, 5 seven-ton
trucks, and 72 motorcycles to ensure staff mobility; 6 agricultural
tractois would be provided, together with implements. The schedule for
infrastructure construction is in Annex 3-2.
Disciplinary Research
3.18      Crop research would be strengthened by providing technical
assistance in nematology (5 man-years) at the Nyombe Center, specialized
equipment for a textile laboratory in Maroua and a plant pathology
laboratory at Ekona. Forestry research would be selectively strengthened
by building and equipping 240 m2 of laboratories, 60 m2 of office space and
7 houses at Maroua, where relevant research is being conducted on forestry
under Sudano-Sahelian conditions. At Foumban, provision would be made for
the construction and equipment of 200 m2 of laboratories, a cold chamber
foIr seed storage, 50 m of office space, and 6 houses. Funds would also be
earmarked to support the research activities of the seed unit (para 2.06).
Finally, the forestry centers would receive 6 station-wagons, 2 tractors
and field equipment, 2 four-wheel drive pick-ups, and 12 motorcycles to
increase staff mobility and the maintenance of access tracks.
Increase in National Staff
3.19      Provision would be made by IRA under the project for 24
additional positions for Cameroonian researchers and executives, 54 for
technicians and administrative assistants, 84 f'or skilled support staff,
and 74 for unskilled support staff. By PY5, 5,750 additional man-days per
year of casual labor would be engaged. Additicinal administrative
assistance would also be provided to the chiefs of centers so that they
could devote more time to their technical and programming functions (para
5.07).
Training for National Staff
3.20      Training of national staff will probably constitute in the long-
tern the major contribution of the project to Cameroonian agronomic
research (para 2.14). Tentative subject matters would include (a)
strategic planning; (b) evaluation, programming and budgeting; (c)
financial management and personnel management; (d) management of physical
resources; and (e) information management. Target groups would include:
directors, heads of centers and stations, researchers, heads of



- 25 -
administration, accountants, and technicians. The training seminars (para
3.27) results would be evaluated after one year and serve as the basis for
designing the second training cycle for each category of personnel. MESRES
intends to contract ISNAR and PAID/CA for conducting and/or supervising
these seminars and the project would provide 32 months of short-term
consultancy (16 months for IRA and 16 for IRZ).
3.21      Provision would also be made for the formal post-graduate
training overseas of selected research staff and technicians. Twenty
man-years of fellowships for M.Sc. or equivalent courses would be provided
for junior scientists and experienced technicians and 6 man-years of Ph.D.
fellowships for more experienced IRA scientists. To ensure that these
staff return to Cameroon, they would be required to sign contracts
committing themselves to resuming their work at IRA upon completion of
their studies. In addition to formal post-graduate training, 138 months of
study tours would be available mainly to assist the staff in keeping
abreast of new techniques in food crop research. Finally, 582 months of
local training would be provided mainly to upgrade the specific skills of
technicians, administrative staff and senior support staff.
3.22      Due to the time needed by overseas academic institutions to
formally enroll candidates in post-graduate programs and by international
research institutions to organize study tours or special courses, the
actual start of training activities under the project would lag. To save
time and lay the groundwork for an adequate training program, it was agreed
at negotiations that Government will establish by April 30, 1987, on the
basis of the Organization and Management Study's major conclusions (para
2.14), a five-year training plan (1987-91) together with a detailed program
for the period July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988, and that every year
thereafter, not later than April 30 of each year, a detailed program to be
carried out during the following July 1-June 30 period will be established,
finalized and put into effect promptly after receiving Bank's comments
(para 7.01(c)). These annual detailed programs would also include the
names of the candidates selected, the names of the recipient institutions,
the anticipated number of overseas training or study tours, as well as the
type, schedule and name of the organizing institution for local courses.
2. Animal Research
IRZ Headquarters
3.23      The IRZ's Directorate would be strengthened under the project in
its research management and technical capacity by providing TA in livestock
research management. The specialist (5 years) in this position would
coordinate the formulation of a long-term research strategy that meets the
needs of traditional producers. The efficiency of central management would
be further improved through short-term consultancy to assist the
Directorate in developing advanced financial and administrative management
procedures required under the project. The research specialist would be
assisted by a team of three locally recruited researchers: an agronomist



- 26 -
as direct counterpart, an agricultural economist to assist the field team
in the design and economic analysis of the surveys and to account for
social factors pertinent to farmers' circumstances, and a biometrician to
initiate the storage of IRZ research data and advise on the statistical
aspects of livestock systems research and trials. The locally recruited
biometrician would be assisted for three years by TA provided under the
project. A micro-computer would be provided as well as eight
sitation-wagons and four pick-up trucks. Finally, to alleviate IRZ's
critical office space need, provisions would be made under the project to
construct a new IRZ building of 52,000 m 2 to house its Directorate and the
Joint Facilities.
Bambui and Wakwa Centers
3.24      A livestock systems research team would be established at each
center to define the key constraints faced by traditional producers and,
together with the scientists at the stations, develop improved livestock
management systems these producers can readily adopt. The research teams
would first conduct surveys to establish the traditional husbandry patterns
and production parameters by the settled Fulanis.  The Bambui center team
would also undertake the study of pigs and poultry on arable smallholdings.
The data collected would form the basis for the design of the experimental
programs. Overtime, the surveys would be ext(ended to cover ranching and
agro-pastoral activities. The TA team required in Bambui would therefore
consist of a cattle production specialist (4 years), and a small-stock
specialist (4 years); in Wakwa it would consist of a cattle production
specialist (4 years). They would head teams consisting each of a locally
recruited animal production specialist, a socio-economist and an
agrostologist. The veterinarians of the Centers would assist the
respective teams in disease surveys.
3.25      The laboratories at Bambui would be strengthened with additional
veterinary and animal nutrition equipment. The project would provide 12
station-wagons, 4 pick-ups and 2 seven-ton trucks. The Bambui center would
be equipped with 2 mobile laboratories (one for cattle and the other for
small-stock disease surveys) and 2 mobile scaLes, and the Wakwa center with
1 such vehicle and 1 mobile scale. The project would also provide for
livestock productivity studies, adequate forage seed storage facilities,
and an agricultural tractor and machinery. Fiinally, the Bambui center and
related Mankon station would be equipped with a micro-computer each for the
initial processing of survey and experimental data.
Fisheries Research
3.26      The project would provide some support to fisheries research.
Because of a dearth of basic information on fisheries, the project would
provide 10 man-months of consultancy, mainly to assist in conducting
surveys and collecting baseline data.



- 27 -
Increase in National Staff and Training
3.27      The project would provide for the creation by IRZ of 8 additional
positions for Cameroonian researchers and executives, 13 for technicians
and administrative assistants, 14 for skilled support staff, and 13 for
unskilled support staff. Additional administrative assistance would be
provided to the chiefs of centers so that they could devote more time to
their technical and programming functions. Training seminars would be
organized for both IRA and IRZ to upgrade agricultural research management
(para 3.20). Provision would also be made for formal post-graduate
training overseas for selected research staff and technicians: 30 man-years
of post-graduate course at the M.Sc. level and 15 man-years at the Ph.D.
level to allow most systems research staff and some other IRZ scientists
and managers to be highly trained by the end of the project. To ensure
that these staff return to Cameroon, they would be required to sign
contracts committing themselves to resuming their work at IRZ upon
completion of their studies. Twenty-four man-months of study tours would
be made available, mainly to familiarize IRZ with Livestock systems
research and 14 man-years of fellowships would be provided to select
technical support staff to improve their capabilities in laboratory and
field recording techniques. Finally, 201 man-months of local training
would be provided to upgrade administrative support staff. To ensure
adequate programming of staff training, agreements similar to those for IRA
were obtained at negotiations (para 7.01(c)).
3.   Joint Facilities
3.28      Both IRA and IRZ require access to certain facilities,
particularly documentation and computer services. Since these facilities
can be readily shared, the project would establish one joint library and
documentation center and one joint computer center. The two centers would
be located in the new IRZ building to be constructed under the project
(para 3.23), but the library and documentation center would come under IRA
and the computer center under IRZ. No disbursements would be made for
expenditures related to the construction and equipment of these joint
facilities until an agreement between IRA and IRZ governing their joint use
of the facilities would have been finalized and put into effect in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank. The effectiveness of this agreement would be a
condition of disbursement against construction and equipment expenditures
(para 7.04).
Library and Documentation Center
3.29      The project would provide for the expansion of the existing IRA
and IRZ documentation services into a central agricultural library and
documentation center at Nkolbisson. This center would be equipped to
access international data banks and to store appropriate reference
material. Five regional satelliLte documentation centers would also be set
up at Foumbot, Nyombe, Maroua, Bambui and Wakwa to assist research
scientists in obtaining quickly international information on research
activities to keep their work up to date and to avoid duplication. The



- 28 -
library would also reproduce and disseminate IRA and IRZ reports and would
therefore be provided with reproduction and word-processing equipment.
3.30      The project would recruit one chief librarian, two administrative
assistants, five regional librarians, and six skilled support staff.
Assistance in setting up and managing the facilities would be provided by a
TA librarian (3 years). The project would provide for 5 man-years of
overseas training courses for the chief librarian and the five regional
librarians, and 12 man-months of local training. In addition to the
library equipment, two station-wagons and twc 4-wheel-drive pick-ups would
be provided to ensure senior staff mobility.
Computer Center
3.31      Research activities, particularly systems research, produce a
considerable volume of data which should be readily accessible. The
central mini-co.mputer and the regional micro-computers would therefore be
utilized primarily as data banks. They would also store meteorological
data, perform statistical and economic computations, and handle the
institutes' financial and administrative accounts.
3.32      The joint computer center would be equipped with a mini-computer
and the ancillary hardware; it would be headed by a computer specialist,
in,itially an internationally recruited staff for three years, and later by
his Cameroonian counterpart who would have received graduate training
overseas in computer science. Recruited at the beginning of PY1, the TA
would be primarily involved in the procurement of software suited to the
needs of the institutes. Pending completion of the new IRZ building
(scheduled for completion at end-PY2), where the computer center would be
located, he would set up a compatible network of micro-computers at the
regional centers. Upon arrival of the two internationally recruited
biometricians (beginning of PY2), he would help to develop a data
collection and processing system that could be used to establish a national
data bank for each institute. Moreover, the computer specialist would
assist researchers who would use the mini-computer starting in PY3 (when
the computer center becomes fully operational) in performing statistical
analyses and modeling, and providing guidance on any other computer-
related matters.
3.33      The computer center has been designed to eventually handle the
institutes payroll, bookkeeping and inventory control. To that effect, the
computer specialist would assist the chief financial and administrative
officers in the design of new accounting procedures suitable for
computerization (para 3.11). Finally, the comuputer specialist would help
the chief librarian to establish a computerized information bank directory
and a word-processing unit.



- 29 -
D.   Project Coordination
3.34      The bead of the Directorate of Scientific and Tecbnical Research
of MESRES would be responsible for liaison with the other ministries and
agencies involved in the project and for the planning and programming of
agricultural researcb. During the first two project years, the major role
of DRST would be to prepare the NARP based on the individual programs of
IRA and IRZ, and subsequently to pursue, on a permanent basis, the planning
and programming of agricultural research. DRST would be mainly responsible
for the preparation of the reviews performed under the TACs (para 5.03) and
would follow-up on any project-related matter that would need clearance
and/or legal action.
E.   Technical Assistance, Local Staffing and Other Inputs
Technical Assistance
3.35      Currently, 48 internationally recruited staff are assigned to IRA
(para 2.21) and 10 to IRZ (para 2.23). ITnder the project a total of 43
additional man-years of long-term internationally recruited assistance
would be provided (details in table on page 30), i.e., an equivalent of
less than 9 man-years annually or an increment, excluding the joint
facilities, of 6% for IRA and 40% for IRZ, and, including the joint
facilities, of 15% for the two institutes. For IRA, if the incremental
internationally recruited assistance (9 man-years annually, para 5.09)
under the parallel USAID-financed NCRE project is accounted for, the
increase would be equivalent to about 12 man-years annually during project
implementation, or 25% of current long-term assistance. ODA has agreed to
provide, on a grant basis, 21 man-years of the long-term assistance, i.e.,
2 biometricians (7 years), one scientific editor (3 years), one librarian/
documentalist (3 years), one computer specialist (3 years) and one
nematologist (5 years), plus some supporting equipment and some training.

3.36      GTZ has agreed to finance on a grant basis a total of 6 man-years
of TA for the IRZ component, i.e., three animal production specialists (two
at Bambui and one at Wakwa) from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1988.
Additional assistance could be made available afterwards. MESRES also
intends to ask (a) ISNAR to recruit and administer the research management
spiecialist, and (b) ILCA to do the same for the IRZ livestock research
management specialist. This TA would be recruited following procedures
acceptable to the Bank. In addition, 147 man-months of consultancy would
be made available to address specific problems for which a full-time TA
position would not be justified.
3.37      Technical assistance would be provided for the following three
areas:
(a)  Research programming and support services:  at IRA, an agronomic
research management specialist (para 3.09), a biometrician (para
3.10), and a scientific editor (para 3.12) for a total of 12



- 31 -
man-years; at IRZ, a livestock research management specialist and
a biometrician for a total of 8 man-years (para 3.23); and for
the Joint Facilities, a librarian/documentalist (para 3.30) and a
computer specialist (para 3.32) for a total of 6 man-years.
(b) Disciplinary and systems research: at IRA, a nematologist for a
total of 5 man-years (para 3.18); and at IRZ, three animal
production specialists, for a total of 12 man-years (para 3.24).
In addition, at IRA it is anticipated that specialists in rural
sociology would be engaged for 8 months; 8 man-months would be
devoted to soil and fertilizer problems, 4 man-months would be
earmarked for mechanization studies and a similar time for pest
disease problems; finally 4 man-months would be retained
unprogrammed to meet unforeseen needs. Similarly, at IRZ,
consultant time for a total of 36 man-months would be made
available to address problems in specific fields, i.e., mineral
nutrition, animal traction, forage seed technology, and
sociology; and provision would be made for 9 man-months of
unallocated time.
(c) Agricultural research financial and administrative management:
a research management institute (i.e., ISNAR para 3.36) would
evaluate the training and incremental staff needs, conduct and/or
supervise training seminars and local courses, and develop
improved management, financial and administrative procedures for
IRA and IRZ. Thirty-two months of short-term consultancy would
be earmarked for the above (para 3.20 and 3.27). In addition,
the project would provide 42 months of consultancy to address
specific financial problems, including the preparation of with-
drawal applications (paras 3.11, 3.23 and 4.09).
3.38      To ensure the timely start of project activities, it was agreed
at negotiations that IRA and IRZ will employ specialized agencies like
ISNAR or ILCA in the recruitment of Bank-financed short-term consultants
(para 3.36 and 7.01(d)). The settlement in post of either the research
management specialist of IRA or that of IRZ, whichever occurs first, would
be a condition of effectiveness (para 7.03(a)). Furthermore, as a
condition of disbursement against expenditures concerning either IRA or IRZ
programs, the one research management specialist for IRZ who would not have
been in post at loan effectiveness, should be in post by December 31, 1987
(para 7.04(b)).
Local Staffing
3.39      Project senior staffing is detailed in Annex 3-3 by
position/title and location, and in Annex 3-4 by project year in which they
would be recruited.
3.40      The recruitment of support staff should pose no problems once the
housing and facilities provided under the project become available.
However, because of the difficulties that the research institutes have



- 32 -
faced in hiring, retaining, and motivating research technicians and
administrative staff (paras 2.30 and 2.31), an understanding was reached at
negotiations that Government will make available enough technicians and
administrative staff to meet the incremental needs of IRA and IRZ under the
project and will improve internal career profiles and incentives for
technicians (para 7.02).
Other Inputs
3.41      Other inputs provided by the project would include a total of
eleven micro-computers to be installed at the two institutes headquarters,
their research centers, and at the joint facilities. Furthermore, six 100
km-range 2-way radios and nine sets of agro-meteorological instruments
would be provided to the centers, stations and antennas and a total of
1,[10 m2 of accommodations for unskilled support staff and 3,250 m2 of
stores, garages, sheds and drying areas would be constructed.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINAkNCING
A.  Project Costs
4.01      Project costs, over a five-year period, are estimated at CFAF
15.6 billion (US$43.2 million), with a foreign exchange component of 44%.
These project costs cover investment costs and incremental operating costs
during the five year implementation period (1987-1991) for the incremental
research activities as the project either expands, strengthens or reorients
present research activities; they do not cover current operations. Costs
include taxes on locally procured items, but exclude taxes and import
duties on direct imports (mainly equipment and vehicles), as Government has
indlicated that they would be waived.
4.02      Cost estimates are based on mid-1986 prices.  They include no
physical contingencies on local wages and salaries, 5% on internationally
recruited assistance and consultancy, and 10% on all remaining investments
and operating expenses. Price contingencies have been computed based on
the following price escalation factors which follow forecasts of
international inflation for foreign supplied goods and services and the
estimated annual inflation in Cameroon for locEal cost.
Costs                     1987       1988       1989      1990       1991

Total contingencies amount to approximately 30% of base costs and 23% of
total project costs. Detailed cost estimates are in Annexes 4-1 and 4-2.

B.   Proposed Financing and Budgetary Implications
4.03      The proposed IBRD loan of US$17.8 million (CFAF 6.4 billion)
would finance 41% of total project costs. Cofinancing would be by ODA with
a grant of US$1.6 million (CFAF 0.6 billion) or 4% of total projects costs
and by GTZ with US$0.8 million (CFAF 0.3 billion) or 2% of project costs.
The remaining costs of CFAF 8.3 billion (US$23.0 million) would be borne by
Government. The proposed financing plan is sbown on page 34.

4.04      The IBRD loan of US$17.8 million would be made to Government for
a 20-year period, including a 5 year grace, at the standard variable
interest rate. The ODA grant would finance technical assistance (US$1.2
million), supporting equipment including vehicles, two micro-computers and
a mini-computer and reproduction equipment (US$80.2 million), and training
(US$0.2 million). The GTZ grant would finance technical assistance (US$0.7
million) and some equipment (US$0.1 million). The fulfillment of all
conditions prior to the ODA and GTZ grants effectiveness would be a
condition of the IBRD loan effectiveness (para 7.03(b)).



- 35 -
4.05      Despite Government's favorable budgetary situation (para 1.21),
timely and adequate funding of IRA and IRZ's research programs bas often
been a problem. The allocation of funds for the approved budgets has been
late, sometimes reaching the more remote stations three to four months
after the end of the fiscal year. As the timely and adequate financing of
recurrent costs is a prerequisite to successful project execution, it was
agreed at negotiations that Government funding will be provided at the
beginning of each fiscal year and at levels sufficient to cover the
approved budgets, and that after project completion, annual MESRES budget
appropriations for IRA/IRZ will be adjusted to take account of recurrent
project costs on a permanent basis (para 7.01(e)). Moreover a condition of
Loan effectiveness would be that Government would have deposited in
separate project accounts for IRA and IRZ the equivalent of six months of
project operating expenditures (para 7.03(c)). Such funds, estimated at
CFAF 800 million (CFAF 450 million for IRA and CFAF 350 million for IRZ),
would be part of Government PYI financing and would be used to prefinance
start-up activities.

D.   Disbursement
4.07      All disbursements from IBRD loan account would be fully
documented, except for contracts valued at less than US$10,000 equivalent,
for which expenses would be made against certified statements of
expenditure. Documentation would be retained for review by Bank
supervision missions and project auditors. To expedite disbursements, two
revolving funds, one for IRA of CFAF 175 million (US$485,000) and the other
for IRZ of CFAF 100 million (US$275,000) would be established in Special
Accounts to be opened in a commercial bank authorized to deal in foreign
transactions. The Special Accounts could be used for all categories of
expenditures, and would be administered by the Ministry of Finance.
Detailed description of methods to be used in making payment out of the
Special Accounts have been agreed upon at negotiations.
4.08      The Special Accounts would be replenished on a monthly basis, or
when the Special Account is reduced by a third, whichever comes first.
They could be audited by the General Government Inspectorate ("Inspection
Generale de l'Etat et de la Reforme Administrative" - IGERA). No direct
payment applications for less than US$20,000 equivalent would be submitted
to the Bank. The disbursement profile in Annex 4-3 has been estimated on
the basis of the general profile for agricultural projects in Cameroon
(IBRD and IDA) and covers a seven-year period.
4.09      The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed to IRA and IRZ under
the following categories:

E.   Financial Control, Audit and Reporting
4.10      The project would strengthen IRA and IRZ financial and
administrative divisions by developing new financial control systems suited
for computerization and involving advanced bookkeeping, cost accounting and
inventory control, so that they could handle their increased
responsibilities under the project. The project would provide a total of
42 months of consultancy services to IRA and IRZ for the duration of the
project (paras 3.11 and 3.23).
4.11      It was agreed at negotiations that IRA and IRZ will:
(a) submit to the Bank, within six months of the close of each
financial year, an annual audit report of all project related
accounts, including the IRA and IRZ Project Accounts and the IRA
Special Accounts, prepared by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank (para 7.01(f)). This report would include the auditor's
assessment as to whether (i) goods and services have been
procured from member countries of the Bank, Switzerland or
Taiwan; (ii) goods have been received or work performed; and
(iii) payment has been made.
(b) produce quarterly and annual progress reports for submission to
DRST and the Bank, showing actual against budgeted expenditures,
physical progress achieved, and objectives for the next period by
project component (para 7.01(g)); and
(c) draft their respective sections of the Project Completion Report
(PCR) and submit them to DRST for preparing and submitting the
final document to the Bank (para 7.01(h)).
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Direction of Scientific and Technical Research
Project Coordination
5.01      The DRST of MESRES is responsible for IRA and IRZ activities and
approves and audits their annual budgets. Its organizational structure,
which includes services for Studies and Projects, Programs Monitoring, and
Scientific and Technical Cooperation, is most appropriate to ensure project
coordination. During the first two years of the project one of DRST's
major roles would be to coordinate the preparation of the NARP, based on
the component program of IRA and IRZ, and subsequently to continue to plan
and program agricultural research on a permanent basis (para 3.34). The
DRST would also transmit the IRA-IRZ and disbursement requests to the Bank,
or t:o the respective Special Account administered by the Ministry of
Finance, and the IRA-IRZ reports to ODA or GTZ. It was agreed at



- 39 -
negotiations that DRST will be responsible for liaison between Government
institutes or foreign agencies (para 7.01(i)).
Research Policy and Programming
5.02      DRST's role would be to ensure that the institutes' researcb
programs are consistent with Government's agricultural strategy and its
specific research policies. The emphasis would be on regionally developed
research programs, but with the ultimate responsibility remaining with the
National Program Committee (para 2.03). Regional program preparation would
be streamlined through an in-depth review of each region's research
activities, to be carried out every two years. A small, carefully
selected, committee would visit the research center, its subsidiary
installations, and on-farm trials for at least a week of observation and
would discuss details with the staff. Two research centers at IRA and one
at IRZ would be reviewed each year. The reports, to be submitted to the
Bank, would highlight strengths and weaknesses and indicate which projects
require more or less emphasis and which should be terminated. An external
review of this type is the necessary corollary of increased regional
autonomy in programming and management.
5.03      To carry out these tasks, it was agreed at negotiations that (a)
a Technical Audit Committee (TAC) will be established for each institute by
June 30, 1987; (b) as part of its contribution to the drafting of the NARP,
it will, no later than June 30, 1988, perform a diagnostic review of all
IRA and IRZ centers and an in-depth review of each center every other year
thereafter; and (c) the reports of the committees will be submitted to the
Bank within three months following the review of each center (para
7.01(j)). The TAC would consist of two core teams, one for IRA and one for
IRZ. Each TAC would comprise the chief of research, the research
Management specialist, one or two senior scientists with national program
responsibilities and a representative of DRST. It would be chaired by the
director of the institute or his deputy. Six regional teams would also be
established (one per center, i.e., four for IRA and two for IRZ),
comprising the chief of center, a respected local research scientist, the
manager of a major agricultural enterprise, a senior representative of the
appropriate regional extension agency, and three prominent local farmers.
These regional teams would carry out the review jointly with the institute
Committee (para 5.02).
5.04      To ensure close coordination among all elements of the
agricultural research activities (Cameroonian, bi-lateral, international,
and project financed), it was agreed at negotiations that DRST will arrange
for both institutes to hold annual seminars for all scientific and senior
administrative staff and selected representatives of the Ministries of
Agriculture and of Livestock; summary reports on the proceedings of these
meetings will be forwarded to the Bank and ODA (para 7.01(k). Each
research center team would present the results of its past year's
activities and proposals for the coming year's program. In this manner
duplicative or irrelevant work would be readily identified and avoided.



- 40 -
B.   Institute of Agronomic Research
General Organization
5.05      IRA management would be strengthened at the national and regional
levels. At the Directorate, an increase in administrative capacity would
improve its ability to service the regions and manage the institute.  This
would be paralleled by a change in IRA's centtral organizational structure,
currently under consideration by MESRES, wbich would provide the upgrading
of the Administration/Finance and Research services to the level of
divisions, and the creation, under the chieF of research, of three new
services of programming, programs monitoring, and documentation and
scientific information. Improved accounting and general services
--procurement, logistics, building ma ntenance, and vehicle fleet
management--would facilitate the work of the researchers and enhance the
influence of the Directorate.  Better communications and reporting, and
decentralization of the research program management, would increase its
awareness and emphasis on policy and quality control. At the regional
level, the chiefs of centers would receive additional administrative
assistance to assume a larger role in research programming and management.
Agronomic Research Programming
5.06      To carry out correctly the key task of resource allocation, the
Director requires adequate and updated information on the problems
besetting the nation's agriculture and the relative economic and social
costs of each problem. While this ideal cannot be readily achieved,
refinement of the available information would be a priority task of the
research management specialist.  Problem-solving would become the normal
way of identifying research needs and evaluating activities and results.
This implies a "two-way" dialogue, with information on national priorities
passed down from the DRST while information on farmers' problems and
constraints are identified and passed up. The regional chiefs of centers
are ideally located to synthesize the regional research program in
consultation with local extension agencies amd the farming systems staff,
whose input will become increasingly important as they gain experience in
farmers' problems and reactions to change.
5.07      The chief of center would identify the local problems that fall
within the national priorities to establish the regional priority problems.
He would discuss them with his research teanm of local and expatriate
(bi-lateral or international) scientists to develop jointly plans for the
experimental work that would most effectively address the problems
identified. Such a research program would f'oster multi-disciplinary
approaches, encourage greater flexibility in the use of available staff,
and fully involve TA staff. The researchers would feel obliged to consider
bow they could contribute to solving problemls rather than to "find"
problems they can handle. Clearly the chief' of center's role would be
considerably enhanced by this change of approach. Thus, additional
administrative assistance would be provided to give him more time for
program planning and management.  To ease furtber the work of the chief of



- 41 -
center, management would choose among the existing staff of each center and
station one employee to perform the functions of farm manager (i.e., a
person responsible for the organization and programming of daily field
work, recruitment of casual labor, organization and maintenance of
transport, purchase of field inputs, etc.).
5.08      IRA's chief of research would assure that the proposed regional
research programs are technically sound and that the potential output
appears practicable at farmer level. While some traditional disciplinary
research is essential, such proposals would be examined with care to see
that Government policy thrust is maintained. He would assist the institute
director in aggregating the regional research programs into the agronomic
research program that would be submitted to the program committee and the
Board of Directors for approval and funding. The resources made available
for implementation of this program would be allocated to the chiefs of
centers by the IRA director.
Technical Arrangements
5.09      In response to Government's emphasis on food crop production,
which is a relatively new and complex area of research, 12 new positions
for agronomists specialized in geographically relevant aspects of the
subject would be established; thus, all research centers and most research
stations would be covered. These locally recruited agronomists would be
working closely with the 9 TA specialists in cereal agronomy (5 agronomists
and 4 plant breeders) provided under the parallel USAID-financed NCRE
project. In addition, one TA specialist in banana/plantains nematology
would be provided under the project and located at Nyombe. Priority work
on cash and plantation crops would continue and be selectively strengthened
under the project. However, the need to make research more relevant to the
conditions of smallholders implies much more stress on the farming systems
approach. While this is implicit in the problem-oriented research
programming, much cooperation and advice would be forthcoming from the
strengthened regional farming systems and pre-extension activities,
particularly through the new TLUs of the project.
The Extension Interface
5.10      For research to be relevant and for its results to be beneficial
in terms of increased food production and higher smallholder income, there
must be an effective interface of researchers, extension agents, and
farmers. The real nature of farmer problems must reach the researchers.
Their findings must be tested at farm level and the results reported back
for any necessary modification. The socio-economic and farming systems
researchers (para 3.13), to be located in each region, would play an
important role in studying farm level problems and introducing possible
solutions developed by research, and would be supported by the TLUs. Three
units have been assigned respectively to the Foumbot, Nkolbisson and Ekona
centers. One unit attached earlier to the NCRE project (para 2.12)
operates successfully at the Bambui station. Each unit would be composed



- 42 -
of an internationally recruited extension agronomist and an agro-economist,
and IRA counterpart staff as shown below.

The TLUs would play a leading role in identifying farmer problems and
constraints hindering increased production and would have a vital input to
regional research programming. As research results become available, the
TLU staff would also conduct on-farm testing in collaboration with NCRE,
IRA researchers and the extension agency personnel. They would be
responsible for evaluating the field trials and recommending any further
studies or modifications.
C.   Institute of Animal Research
Organization
5.11      As for IRA, the administrative and logistical requirements of IRZ
would be covered by short-term consultancies. The change of the
institute's emphasis from research aimed at modern and intensive
enterprises to research on livestock systems appropriate to the traditional
producer would be facilitated by the TA position for a livestock research
management specialist in charge of research programming and budgeting
(Annex 2-3). The incumbent, experienced in livestock systems research,
would work closely with the IRZ chief of research in the Directorate.
Livestock Research Program
5.12      The preparation of IRZ's research program would have high
priority, both to assist the institute in the reorientation of its research
effort and to ensure that the livestock component of the NARP is available
in due time. The articulation of the research strategy would be somewhat
complicated by the need to clarify Government policy in the livestock
sector. In particular, the desired level of self-sufficiency in milk and



- 43 -
meat (and the various types of meat) should be defined, as should the
future role of animal traction, to provide benchmark policy guidelines and
objectives. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge of the traditional systems
dictates that the initial thrust be to conduct surveys and collect baseline
data on traditional livestock enterprises. The lack of a production-
oriented extension service or of previous research on traditional systems
makes this initial data collection necessary and precludes an immediate
problem-solving approach to the research programming which IRA would adopt.
5.13      The results of these first studies would indicate the problems on
which the on-station research at Bambui and Wakwa would concentrate, while
subsequent surveys could cover animal traction in the Northern Plains and
small stock and dairy systems in the Western Highlands. As more
information on these systems becomes available, the role of the regional
chiefs of the centers in preparing their research programs would become
more important.
5.14      The project would help IRZ to initiate this production systems
research. It would be expected that the TAC diagnostic reviews and the
initial surveys would be completed approximately 18 months after loan
effectiveness. Their results would form the basis of the new research
programs of the regional centers. These, in turn, would be a key input in
the development of the NARP. As in all systems researcb, a number of
constraints would be immediately addressed in on-farm or on-berd trials.
Thus, it would be expected that two years after loan effectiveness the IRZ
research program would be undergoing a basic reorientation, witb
improvement in the relevance of on-station research and a first organized
attempt to test improved technology under producers' conditions.
The Extension Aspect
5.15      To date, MINEPIA has not been much involved in the production (as
distinct from the health) aspects of the country's livestock, and has
therefore little information that IRZ could use in deciding research
priorities. Also, because of past emphasis on the modern sector, IRZ has
little to offer to the Livestock Service for dissemination to the
traditional livestock owners. Consequently, the absence of a strong
linkage between researchers and the Livestock Service would not be critical
in the early part of the project and would therefore not obstruct project
objectives.
5.16      As farm and herd studies and research findings become available,
the regular quarterly meetings between the staff of IRZ and MINEPIA at the
regional level should be the forum for exchanging information. Moreover,
it should allow MINEPIA field staff to start extension activities among the
traditional producers as soon as appropriate production technology is
identified by IRZ.
5.17      The role of livestock on arable land and mixed farms would become
more important as a result of the project: more emphasis on animal
traction in the North, and on dairy animals and small stock in the West.



- 44 -
For this reason, routine liaison with IRA regional research staff and, in
particular, its farming systems staff would be organized under the project.
VI.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
A.   General
6.01      The project would contribute to the desvelopment of improved
techniques for crop and livestock production and of new farming systems.
It would give particular attention to adapting t:his technology to the needs
of small-scale farmers and herders, emphasizing actions designed to
accelerate the transfer of research findings to them. It would aim at
raising agricultural output both per unit area and per labor day, but would
assign priority to either, depending on the agro-ecological region
concerned. This would contribute to Government"s aim of continued
self-sufficiency in staple foods in spite of a decline in the percentage of
the population engaged in agriculture. By also increasing the efficiency
of IRA research management, it would benefit cash crop production and would
help Cameroon to maintain or increase its share of world commodity markets
in the face of rising competition. The project would give priority to
zones with 80% of Cameroon's small-scale crop and livestock farmers, most
of whom would benefit in some degree from technical improvements induced by
the project. Increased rural incomes would, in turn, help reduce the drift
of rural youth to the cities.
6.02      In addition to these general benefits, the project would
substantially raise the level of technical skills of scientists and
technicians engaged in agricultural research. Consequently, despite the
considerable initial amount of additional internationally recruited
technical assistance proposed, the project would accelerate the replacement
of internationally recruited researchers by Cameroonians. This process
would start quickly as TA positions under the project are progressively
eliminated. The project would also help to strengthen linkages with
external technical assistance agencies, in particular the international
agricultural research centers.
B.   Human Factors
6.03      The results of agricultural research are measured not in the
research stations but in thbe higher output and imnproved standards of living
of the farmers. Positive responses in the food crop and livestock sector
would depend largely on the applicability of research findings at farm
level. Thus, it will be necessary for the research programs to include
socio-economic studies to determine both the current situation and the
motivational requirements of the farmers and livestock producers and to
document past technological progress at farm level.



-- 45 -
6.04      However, it must be recognized that with its emphasis on food
crops and livestock, mainly produced by traditional farmers, the project
would aim at that part of the sector less able to respond intensely or
rapidly to improved technical opportunities. The twin strategic objectives
of increasing food production and changing the traditional sector are
undoubtedly constrained by the agricultural and social practices of this
group. Intricate crop mixtures complicate research programs, while the
common practice of women being responsible for food crop production hinders
technology transfer, particularly when inputs must be purchased. Research
programs must not only recognize these problems, but also be aware of the
possibility of change when conditions are ripe.
6.05      While overpopulation is a problem in some areas, as it is in
parts of the Western Highlands, the decline or aging of the rural
population as a whole has implications for research. Clearly, production
can only increase if less labor-intensive agricultural practices can be
developed.
C.  Environmental Considerations
6.06      The environmental effects of the project would be favorable in
relation to (a) soil and woodland conservation, and (b) pesticide health
hazards. Under traditional cropping systems where crop residues are
removed or burnt, soil fertility is restored by fallowing; as population
increases, fallows become shorter and shorter and soil fertility drops.
Erosion is already a serious problem in these densely populated areas due
to the loss of wood cover or the cultivation of steep slopes. To
compensate the decline of fertility, fertilizer use on food crops has
increased rapidly, creating a risk of soil acidification from using
ill-adapted chemical fertilizers on poorly buffered soils.
6.07      Farming systems research would develop appropriate cultural
practices for these slopes, while the overall improvement in crop husbandry
practices would maintain and progressively build up soil fertility. The
risk of soil acidification would therefore be reduced by adjusting the
fertilizer rate and grade recommendations to ecological conditions. The
development of stable and highly productive farming systems would reduce
the pressure on unsuitable land and the destruction of the fragile Sahelian
eco-system and rain forests. The introduction of improved range management
and new pasture species would reduce ovegrazing and deterioration of
grasslands. The development of pest control methods requiring low
applications of active ingredient and water, as well as an effective
interface of researchers, extension agents and farmers to prevent misuse of
agriculture chemicals, would reduce pesticide health hazards.



- 46 -
D.   Economic Justification
6.08      One major effect of project investment would be that other
Gcvernment investments in research, extension and rural development would
have a greater impact on the economy. Because of the uncertain and
interlocking nature of the investments and their returns, and the
difficulty in quantifying benefits directly in economic terms, no
conventional estimate of the project economic rate of return (ERR) has been
caLlculated. However, assuming an investment period of five years, total
project base costs (US$33.3 million) represent: annual incremental
expenditures of only 0.3% of the 1983/84 agricultural GDP. A resulting
increase in agricultural GDP of about 0.25% (UTS$5.0 million) per year from
1990 to 2010 would be sufficient to achieve arL ERR of 12%, reflecting
Cameroon's opportunity cost of capital. Considering the country's
production recorded favorable rates of return in adaptive agricultural
research, the project ERR is likely to be substantial.
6.09      Project expenditure on crop research would amount, in mid-1986
terms, to about US$5.0 per agricultural capita, equivalent to about US$25.0
per small family farm or US$12.0 per hectare of smallholding. Incremental
operating costs from 1990 onwards would be equivalent to a further US$1.3
per hectare annually. The livestock investment would be equivalent to
approximately US$2.4 per tropical livestock unit (equivalent to an animal
of 300 kg liveweight) for the estimated 4.7 million units existing in the
country.
6.10      The project-related cash-flow for Government during
implementation and three years thereafter is given in Annex 6. Eight years
after project inception, Government's incremental cash outflow for
agricultural research would be US$2.5 million annually, in current terms.
Since the level of resources channelled to research outside the project is
expected to remain the same, the project would increase total research
expenditures by about 30%, or annual research expenditures per agricultural
capita by about 4 dollars. It would also increase the ratio of research
expenditures to agricultural GDP to approximately 1.3%, a level approaching
the long-term ideal target of 2% for resource allocation to research in
countries where agriculture is the key' economic sector. The project can
therefore be seen as a significant undertaking in economic terms, i.e.,
close to the optimum that Government should invest.
E.   Project Risks
6.11      The major risk is that research resuLts may not be fully relevant
to farmers' needs and that research programs fail to meet the Government's
objective of increased agricultural production and incomes. Several
specific factors could contribute to that risk and jeopardize the project
goatls. They are:
(a) the inability of DRST to recruit Cameroonian researchers,
administrative staff and technicians in sufficient numbers, and



- 47 -
to retain them. To overcome this problem, Government indicated
at negotiations that enough qualified agricultural graduates
would be made available to DRST and that internal career profiles
and incentives for technicians and administrative staff would be
improved (paras 3.39 and 7.02);
(b) the failure of IRA and IRZ to prepare a fully articulated NARP in
the required time-frame--which would be a sufficient factor for
discontinuing disbursements after year 2. This risk is slight
since the recruitment of key technical assistance would be
conditions of loan effectiveness and of disbursement (paras 3.38,
7.03(a) and 7.04);
(c) the insufficient coordination of external assistance at the
working level by IRA and IRZ management could result in
irrelevant or duplicated work. However, the procedures for
research programming and the enhanced management and logistics
capability of the Directorates and major centers would greatly
reduce this risk. In addition, the annual seminar (para 5.04),
would bring an awareness of activities and results at all levels;
and
(d) farmers and herders might not adopt the research results relevant
to their needs in some regions because of inadequate extension
services. However, the adapted farming systems approach takes
such institutional weaknesses into account when designing the
technical packages (para 3.13). Also, extension is a potential
area of involvement for the Bank (para 1.33).
6.12      Specific project components that would contribute to minimizing
the above risks include: (a) strengthening the research programming and
administrative capacity of IRA and IRZ; (b) enhancing the ability of the
regional research centers and stations to undertake relevant studies,
especially on the farming systems approach and the effective interfacing of
extension agencies, in particular through the TLUs; and (c) providing
analytical expertise and technical facilities, as well as training for
national staff.
VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      It was agreed at negotiations that:
(a) Government will carry out an Organization and Management Study of
IRA and IRZ according to terms of reference agreed upon with the
Bank, review the recommendations of the study with the Bank, and
agree on a time-bound implementation program by December 31,
1987 (para 2.14);



- 48 -
(b,) Government will prepare a NARP on the basis of guidelines
acceptable to the Bank, submit a draft to the Bank not later than
December 31, 1988, for its comments and promptly thereafter
finalize it and put it into effect (para 3.02).
(c) IRA and IRZ will furnish to the Bank by April 30, 1987 a draft
five-year training plan (1987-91), together with a detailed
program for the period July 1, 1987 to Jlne 30, 1988; every year
thereafter, not later than April 30 of each year, a detailed
training program for the following July IL-June 30 period will be
established, finalized, and put into effect promptly after
receiving Bank's comments (paras 3.22 and 3.27);
(cl) Government will employ specialized agenc:Les, acceptable to the
Bank, for the recruitment of technical assistance staff and
short-term consultants (para 3.38).
(e)  Government will provide funding of IRA and IRZ at the beginning
of each fiscal year and at a level sufficient to cover the
approved budgets and, following project completion, Government
will continue to fund IRA and IRZ on a permanent basis, taking
into account the recurrent project costs (para 4.05).
(f)  IRA and IRZ will submit to the Bank, within six months of the
close of each financial year, an annual audit report of
project-related accounts including the ITRA and IRZ Project
Accounts and Special Accounts, prepared by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank (para 4.11);
(g) IRA and IRZ will submit quarterly and annual progress reports to
DRST and the Bank (para 4.11);
(h)  IRA and IRZ will draft their respective sections of the PCR and
submit them to DRST for preparing and submitting the final
document to the Bank (para 4.11);
(i) The Director of DRST will be responsible for internal and
external project coordinator and liaison (para 5.01);
(j) DRST will establish, no later than June 30, 1987, a technical
audit committee (TAC) for each Institute; these committees will
perform a diagnostic review of all regional research centers no
later than June 30, 1988, and an in-depth review of each center
every other year thereafter; reports of the committees will be
submitted to the Bank within three months following the review of
each center (para 5.03); and
(k) DRST will arrange for both IRA and IRZ to hold annual seminars
for all scientific and senior administrative staff and selected
representatives of MINAGRI and MINEPIA; summary reports on the



- 49 -
proceedings of these meetings will be fowarded to the Bank and
ODA (para 5.04).
7.02      The understanding reached at negotiations is that Government will
make available researchers, technicians, and administrative staff in
sufficient number to meet the incremental needs of IRA and IRZ under the
project, and will improve internal career profiles and incentives for
technicians (para 3.40).
7.03      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that:
(a) either the research management specialist of IRA or the research
management specialist of IRZ would be in post (para 3.38);
(b) all conditions for effectiveness of the ODA and GTZ grants would
have been fulfilled (para 4.04); and
(c) Government would have deposited in separate project accounts for
IRA and IRZ the equivalent of six months of project operating
expenditures (para 4.05).
7.04      A condition of disbursement (a) against expenditures concerning
construction and equipment of the joint facilities would be the completion
and putting into effect in a manner satisfactory to the Bank of the IRA/IRZ
agreement concerning the use of the joint facilities (para 3.28); and (b)
against expenditures concerning either IRA or IRZ programs, the research
management specialist who would not have been posted at loan effectiveness
would be in post by December 31, 1987 (para 3.38).
7.05      With the above assurances, the proposed project is suitable for
an IBRD loan of US$17.8 million.
