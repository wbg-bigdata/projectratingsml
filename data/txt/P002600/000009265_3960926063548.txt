I. THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE ELECTRIC POWER SUBSECTOR
A. The Energy Sector
Energy Sector Organization
1.01            The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mining  (MEM) has  overall
responsibility for policy formulation in the energy sector.   The main
parastatal organizations and implementing agencies in the sector whicb are
under MEM are the General Petroleum Corporation (GPC) and the National
Electricity Corporation (NEC).  MEM is also represented on the Boards of
two major private sector companies, namely the Port Sudan Refinery and the
White Nile Petroleum Corporation (WNPC). A major department in MEM is the
Geological Research Authorities of Sudan (GRAS), which carries out
geological studies, prospects for minerals and monitors exploration
activities in the petroleum sector.
1.02      A National Energy Administration (NEA) was created by statute in
May 1980 as the planning organ of MEM to supply a badly needed integrated
system for controlling the diverse activities across the sector. Under a
Director  General,  the  four  divisions  comprising  the  NEA  are  for
techno-economic studies, planning, information systems and studies and
financial and administrative affairs. MMW is well aware of its lack of
capability for advising the Government on all aspects of sector planning
and  policy  and  is  currently  conducting  an  internal  review  of  its
organization and relationship with NEC, NEA and GRAS.  A small technical
assistance  component  of  the  project  will  address  this  weakness
(para. 4.14).
1.03      In the woodfuel subsector, administration of all forest land is
the responsibility of the Central Forest Administration (CFA) which comes
under the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).  Many of
the powers relating to land use, forest conservation and utilization and
other aspects rest with the provincial forest services, which have weak
coordination  at  the  national  level.    MANR  also  controls  reservoir
operations at the major hydroelectric stations (Roseires, Sennar) since
irrigation requirements are given priority over power in water resource
utilizaton.
Planning
1.04      The National Energy Plan (NEP, 1983) prepared by the NEA was a
major step in acknowledgement of the sector's major weaknesses, although
the plan is not fully integrated with Government strategies and priority
setting. Much of the support to NEA under the project would be devoted 'o
transforming its policy content into an action-oriented, long-term plan.
USAID has provided assistance to NEA in planning and training since 1981.
IDA is financing a planning and management study to assist the GPC (TA
Credit  1513-SU).    Under  the  project  IDA would  support  the  NEA  as
coordinator of all technical assistance and planning activities in the
sector and would seek to strengthen its management capability in dealing
with the various aid agencies and the projects for which they and NEA are
responsible. Although the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP)
at present has part of this responsibility, NEA is better equipped with
staff to carry out the work.



-2-
Energy Development Strategy
1.05        The emphasis of the Government's strategy is to remedy energy
shortages, through appropriate pricing and increased investment in power,
particularly hydropower in the long term, petroleum, and fuelwood.
Economic pricing of energy and full cost recovery are seen as the key means
to managing energy demand, allocating resources, and mobilizing investment
resources, and power and petroleum prices for the past few years have
generally reflected this strategy. Energy sector management, particularly
investment planning, needs to be strengthened at the level of overall
sector planning and in the energy enterprises.   The energy investment
priorities in the short-term are: rehabilitation of the existing power
geoeration, transmission and distribution facilities in the Blue Nile Grid
(ONG); new power generation, transmission and distribution capacity in the
BNG to meet FY91 demand including fuel oil transportation capacity for new
thermal power stations in Khartoum; evaluation of the alternative
investment in the export pipeline for domestic crude oil (although this has
been in abeyance due to lack of security in the South), or possibly an
inland refinery; further exploration for oil and gas; and a five-year
development program for the forestry sector, emphasizing fuelwood,
including energy conservation, social forestry and tree planting.
1.06        Beyond 1991, investment priorities will include further power
generation, transmission and distribution facilities, with greater emphasis
on preinvestment required for the development of hydropower potential, and
possibly, the import of power through interconnection with Ethiopia and, if
potential reserves are proven, the utilization of domestic natural gas in
both existing and new generating capacity, thereby reducing the demand for
imported petroleum products for power generation. Other priorities within
the energy sector should include the further development and utilization of
hydrocarbon resources and the expansion of fuelwood supplies through forest
plantation and social forestry programs.
Energy Resources
1.07      Sudan's main indigenous energy resources are forests, crude oil,
and hydropower. Natural gas is potentially another. Biomass fuels in the
form of firewood, charcoal, crop and animal waste are widely used. Sudan
also has good potential for exploitation of solar and wind energy.
Prospecting for coal, uranium ore and geothermal energy has not so far
revealed substantial reserves. Detailed information on these resources is
contained in Annex 1.1.
Energy Demand and Supply
1.08      Aggregate and consistent information on Sudan's energy demand and
supply is not available and the latest Information remains the Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program's ESMAP update to 1983 of the Energy
Assessment mission's 1981 data. 1/ In 1983, Sudan's final energy
consumption was estimated to have totalled about 5.6 million toe, of which
80% was in the form of biomass fuel (fuelwood, charcoal and agricultural
1/ See "Energy Balance, FY83" from the Energy Assessment Status Report,
ESMAP November 1984.  Report No. 026/84.



-3-
wastes) and the balance was provided by imported crude oil and hydropower.
Per capita consumption of all forms of energy amounted to about
0.30 toe. 2/ The gross supply of primary energy in 1983 was 8.8 million
toe. Most of the difference between final consumption and gross supply of
energy is due to losses in the energy conversion (about 35%).
1.09        The erosion of real income in Sudan appears to be affecting
aggregate  levels of urban woodfuel  consumption.    A survey    3/  over
1978-1980 in Khartoum suggests in lower middle income households a decline
from 95 kg per capita in 1979 to 83 kg in 1986, despite the substantial
nominal increase in income and the fact that real charcoal prices have
remained quite stable.   During the survey period on average households
spent less than 4% of their income on woodfuel, However, in the case of
the lowest income level household (consumption about 54 kg per capita), by
December 1986 the proportion of income on woodfuel can be calculated to be
around 10%.  If household income continues to decline as it has over the
past 10 years, this trend will become increasingly grave.
1.10       Consumption of commercial energy in Sudan in 1983 averaged 0.06
toe per capita.   Hydropower accounts for -   about 4-5% of commercial
energy consumption, indicating the country's high dependence on imports for
final commercial energy.   Figures in tersts of sector as percentages of
commercial and total energy consumption are respectively as follows:
transport (49% and llX), f4griculture (13% and 3%), industry (18% and 5%),
household (13% and 77%) and the public sector (7% and 4%). The low level
of commercial consumption in households is partly a consequence of frequent
shortages of LP gas and kerosene and limited access to electricity.
1.11        The consumption of petroleum products itnreased by about 20%
between 1978 and 1983, equivalent to an annual average growth rate of about
6.2%. Consumption of gasoline and gasoil (diesel) increased at about 75%,
reflecting the rapid expansion of the transport sector and the dramatic
shift of freight transportation from rail to road. Consumption of fuel oil
increased by 39% during the same period, reflecting the ntaguation in the
industrial sector. Demand for petroleum products was met largely from the
output of the Port Sudan Refinery, and crude oil imports have been running
at about one million mtpy.   Imports of the mix of petroleum products
required to make up the difference between refinery output and domestic
demand has increased from 181,000 mt in 1978 to 490,000 mt in 1983, mainly
in the form of gasoil and gasoline. On the other hand, due to the refinery
configuration, the production of fuel oil in the refinery mix exceeds
domestic demand, and the excess is exported.   The value of net petroleum
imoorts currently stands at about US$360 million, equivalent to 70% of all
merchandise exports.
2/ Comparative per capita total energy consumption (toe) in other Eastern
and Southern Africa countries in the early 1980s are: 0.56 for Malawi,
0.47 for Tanzania, 0.35 for Uganda and 0.27 for Ethiopia.
3/ From report currently under preparation following ESMAP mission of
November/December 1986 to prepare Integrated Forestry/Fuelwood Project.



-4-
Energy Pricing
1.12      It can be anticipated that woodfuel prices will increase and that
increased woodfuel prices will result in interfuel substitution.   Current
analysis 3/ assumes that fossil fuel prices will increase at 2% annually,
fuelwood prices at 5% annually, and charcoal prices at 3.1% annually.
While the delivered cost of fuelwood is predicted to remain lower than the
energy equivalent cost of both charcoal and Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) well
into the next century, charcoal is predicted to become more expensive to
use than LPG around the year 2000. The case for attempts to bring down the
prices of woodfuel-improved production and delivery-is strong, but the
relationship between charcoal consumption and household income has to be
central to its design to benefit rather than disadvantage the urban poor,
who most rely on woodfuel but can least afford it.
1.13       The Government regulates prices for petroleum products through
GPC.   Following a price increase in March 1985, kerosene and fuel oil
consumption remained subsidized, the price of gasoil (light diesel for
transport, etc.) was equal to the economic cost, and the retail prices of
gasoline were substantially higher  than the economic cost.   Domestic
inflation and the drop in international oil prices have sioce affected
these relationships. Efforts are underway by NEA with United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) assistance to frame a pricing pollcy,
and a review of transport fuel prices in the context of transport costs was
carried out under the Highways III Project.   Given that use of fuel for
power generation will become substantial during the next few years, the
agreement under the Power Rehabilitatiou Project that the Government will
revise in accordance with its ongoing overall energy pricing policy review
the fuel oil prices to reflect their cost of production, transportation and
marketing has been repeated under the proposed project.  A comparison of
economic costs and official prices of petroleum products in Khartoum
following the March 1985 pri^e increase is given in Annex 1.2.
B.   The Power Subsector
Subsector Organization
1.14      A policy of decentralization of various government functions was
promulgated on December 31, 1980 in the Regionalization Act of 1980. Under
this Act certain subjects (including national water resources and power
grids) were made the exclusive responsibility of the national government*
and the regional governments were to assume responsibility for other
subjects (including regional power generation and distribution systems).
Consequently, in May 1982 the Public Electricity and Water Corporation
(PEWC) Act was repealed, the electricity and water supply functions
separated and, except for the Khartoum area water supply and the areas
served by the national power grids, made the responsibility of regional
governments.
1.15       As a result of the split of the power and water operations of
WEC, NEC became responsible for public supply of electricity in four areas
31 From report currently under preparation following ESMAP mission of
November/December 1986 to prepare Integrated Forestry/Fuelwood Project.



-5-
of the Sudan while the other five areas were to operate separately. NBC's
present responsibilities cover the Khartoum area, Blue Nile area, Damazin
area and the Eastern area, with a total aggregated installed capacity of
about 470 MW.   The five areas operating separately from NEC are the
Northern area, Southern area, Darfour area and the Red Sea area, with a
total aggregated installed capacity of about 50 MW.
1.16      In October 1985 the Government proposed that NEC should be solely
responsible for public supply of electricity in the Sudan. Although the
proposal was to be put into effect on July 1, 1986, there is no evidence
that the Government has approved it. As a result, there Is still no truly
national planning or coordination for the whole subsector.   Given NEC's
institutional weaknesses (paras. 2.04, 2.08, 2.11 and 2.12), before it can
assume the responsibilities of a fully integcated power subsector, Its
institutional and financial capabilities will have to be strengthened.
However, the Government confirmed its intention to keep the Association
informed about the process of expanding NEC's responsibilities to areas not
covered by NEC pursuant to the NEC Act of 1982 and its effects on NEC's
operations, including measures to enable NEC to meet these additional
responsibilities.
Experience with Past and Ongoing Lending
1.17        The World Bank Group has made two loans and three credits to
Sudan for electric power development. Loan 284-SU and Credit 2-SU in 1961
in the total amount of US$38.8 million (including a US$6.3 million increase
in 1963) were used to finance the PRoseires Irrigation Project and
substructures of the Roseires Power Station. Loan 522-SU in 1967 was used
to finance the first three 30 MW generating sets at the Roseires Dam, a
15 MW gas turbine, and transmission facilities.  This project, which has
been in operation since 1971, was the subject of a Project Performance
Audit Report (No. 1169) dated May 13, 1976. The conclusions of the report
pointed out the difficulties of carrying out a large program of expansion
and problems in an attempt to improve financial management.   The project
completion was delayed over a year and institutional improvements did not
meet appraisal expectations.
1.18        In 1975 IDA provided to the Government US$23 million (Credit
564-SU) to help finance a fourth generating set at Roseires, diesel
generators at Burri and Juba, distribution system improvements and
consultants  services.    The  Second  Power  Project  encountered  similar
difficulties as the first project, particularly in project implementation
and financial and institutional reforms. The project Completion Report for
Credit 564-SU was issued in January 1985. A particular difficulty was the
achievement of institutional and financial improvements within a power
entity in the context of an inefficient public sector beset with problems
of autonomy, weak organizational structure, lack of clear responsibilities,
loss of skilled personnel and low salaries.   The project was completed
after a delay of about two years, with the exception of the small Juba
diesel power station which could not be completed because of the civil war
in the South but was completed in 1986 under the Third Power Project.



- 6 -
1.19       The Third Power Project (Credit 1006-SU of US$65 million made in
1980) was jointly financed by IDA, the Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) and Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KfW), and included the addition
of the fifth and sixth generating sets at Rosetres, four diesel sets at
Burri, a new power station at Khartoum North, transmission line extensions,
consultants services and trainingo The power infrastructure components for
that project were completed satisfactorily by mid 1985, with a delay of
about one year, and include the installation of about 180 MW (60 MW fuel
oil fired power plant at Khartoum North, 80 MW hydro uniits at Roseires, and
four 10 MW diesel sets at Burri).   The Juba power station was finally
completed in mid 1986 in spite of difficult local conditions as a result of
the conflict in the South.   However,  construction of the NEC training
center, also financed unt.er the project, started well behind schedule and
is expected to be completed by end 1988. The main reason for the delays in
the construction of the Training Center have been the initial protracted
discussion relating to new training objectives proposed by NEC and the
consequent cost changes involved by that proposal, and procurement
problems, i.e. difficulties in selecting a satisfactory contractor and lack
of interest of suppliers and contractors to bid for equipment and training
aids  and  materials.    The  Third  Power  Project  has  encountered  fewer
difficulties than the earlier two projects and some improvements have been
achieved in NEC organization and management.
1.20         The Power Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1624-SU), deilared
effective in April 1986, will finance 20 MW of diesel generating expansion
at the Burri power plant, rehabilitation of units No. 1 and 2 at the
Roseires hydroplant, rehabilitation of transmission systems in the Blue
Nile and the Eastern grids, rehabilitation of distribution, engitkeering
services and  studies.    Project  implementation is proceeding generally
satisfactorily after initial delays in procurement for the expansion of the
Burri diesel station, the major component of the project. The contract has
now been signed and the contractor started working in mid-March, with a
delay of about 18 months with respect to the appraisal estimate.   The
rehabilitation of the Roseires hydro plant unit no. 2 was completed in June
1986, and the rehabilitation of unit no. 1 started in the first quarter of
1987.   Because part of the rehabilitation of Roseires was been financed
under the ongoing Power III project, and in view of the prospect that part
of the funds under that project would not be utilized, IDA agreed to
include all the rehabilitation work for the units of Roseires under the
Power III Project.  Consequently amounts disbursed for these works are now
being shown under the Power III Project.  The problems encountered in the
execution of the Power Rehabilitation  Project are  the result of weak
project management characterized particularly by a lack of autonomy and
decision making capability. To avoid the occurence of similar difficulties
under the project, a Project Management Unit (PMU) has been created
(paras. 4.17 and 4.18).
Electric Power Subsector Planning and Development
1.21         The last comprehensive planning exercise undertaken for the
electric power subsector in Sudan was the Power IV Project Feasibility
Study prepared jointly by NEC's consultants Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners
(Gibb, UK) and Merz & McLellan (M&M, UK) in 1983. 4/ The main conclusions
4/   The Power IV Feasibility Study of 1983 covered the expansion of the
Sudanese power subsector and had a broader scope than the presently
proposed Power IV Project.



and recommendations with respect to evaluation methodology, hydro-thermal
mix objectives in the long run, etc, are still generally valid.  However,
sizeable changes had to be introduced to the then proposed least-cost
long-term expansion program: the rather optimistic original load forecast
had to be scaled down, and the size and timing of the capacity additions
had to be adjusted to match the limited concessionary foreign financing
available. Under the Power Rehabilitation Project NEC committed itself to
update by December 31, 1986 its long-term expansion program. NEC, however,
had difficulties in preparing such a program mainly because of the lack of
leadership in the Planning Directorate where the position of Senior
Director of Planning has been vacant now for more than two years (para.
2.09). The program was discussed in detail with NEC during the appraisal
of the project in November 1986.   However, the feasibility studies for
hydropower projects that had been included tentatively in the program were
delayed for reasons beyond NEC's control as follows: (i) the study on the
feasibility of increasing the height of the Roseires Dam was under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Irrigation. A draft report was completed
only recently and discussed with the Bank. The final report is expected to
be completed by mid 1987, with a delay of about 18 months; and (ii) the
feasibility study for the Merowe dam, for which funds are provided under
the Power Rehabilitation project and which was orignially planned for
completion by end 1986, is now expected to be initiated by mid 1987.  The
study was being delayed awaiting a government decision on a possible
involvement by the USSR to finance all preinvestment studies as well as the
investments for the Merowe dam multipurpose project.   It was only in
November 1986 that the Government decided to proceed with the execution of
the feasibility study under IDA financing, regardless of a possible
eventual involvement of the USSR in the project.   Terms of reference for
the study and a short list of consultants were agreed with the Association
in March 1987.
Existing Facilities
1.22      The present public power installed capacity is about 530 MW, of
which 240 MW is hydropower and the balance is thermal (Annex 1.3). Taking
into account privately-owned generating capacity (all very small diesel
units) which is estimated to be about 100 MW, the total installed capacity
in Sudan is about 630 MW. The total installed capacity owned and operated
by NEC is 475 MW of which about 240 MW (51%) is hydro. The remaining 55 MW
of public electricity capacity is made up of a number of isolated diesel
power stations constructed before 1982 and now transferred to regional
governments.    On  its  formation NEC  assumed  responsibility  for  power
facilities on the two national grids: (a) the Blue Nile Grid (BNG) along
the Blue Nile with an installed capacity of 453 MW, of which 227 MW is
hydro; and (b) the Eastern Grid (EG) along the River Atbara with an
installed capacity of 27 MW of which 13 MW is hydro. The BNG facilities
produce about 96 percent of the public electricity systems' total
generation.
1.23       Prior to 1985, power supply in Sudan was rather unreliable and
subject to numerous and persistent power cuts and long periods of
blackouts.   The result was high economic costs  in the  form of lost
industrial and agricultural production, and in the rapid growth of high
cost private generation capacity.   The entire power system operated at
severely reduced levels of efficiency and essential equipment and
materials, caused in part by unavailability of foreign exchange for their



- 8 -
acquisition.    This unsatisfactory situation was compounded by chronic
delays both in planning for expansion and in maintenance of the power
system to meet the growth in electricity demand, scarcity of foreign
exchange for investment, shortage of local currency funds due to NEC's poor
financial performance and management, lack of staff discipline and the lack
of an effective management information system to provide managers at all
levels with timely reports on progress of operations. However, in the last
two years there has been substantial improvement in electricity supply
reliability as a result of the commissioning of generation and transmission
facilities under the Power III Project and other investments for both new
facilities and rehabilitation of existing ones.   Also, under a USAID
commodity import program of which US$20 million was allocated to the power
subsector, NEC imported power system equipment which is helping to
alleviate NEC's problems on the transmission system as well as at the
Roseires power plant.   The Overseas Development Administration (ODA, UK)
has also provided assistance in the rehabilitation of NEC's thermal power
facilities as well as in improving its operation and management.  The ODA
program includes provision of spare parts and materials and technical staff
for repair, maintenance and operation of NEC's Burri thermal power
station.   IDA is providing assistance under the Power III and the Power
Rehabilitation project for the rehabilitation of the Roseires hydro power
plant as well as for rehabilitation of transmission and distribution works.
Access to Service
1.24      The public systems supply electricity to about 276,000 customers
in Sudan, of which about 210,000 are located in the BNG. Although some new
capacity has been added in recent years to the BNG and isolated systems,
severe supply constraints still exist throughout the country. NEC has had
to implement considerable load shedding and load reduction and many
potential consumers remain unconnected to the public electricity system
(about 8% of total population in Sudan have access to electricity). Thus,
in the BNG area, a growing number of consumers have installed their own
generating plant to ensure power supply during the periods that NEC has
been unable to meet fully the demand on its system.
Power System Losses
1.25        The statistical records of NEC show that technical losses and
unbilled consumption were about 22% of generation in 1986. A power system
efficiency  study  (financed  within  the  UNDP/World  Bank  ESMAP,  1983)
concluded that a loss of about 15% of the units generated is the maximum
that can be realistically attributable to technical losses and that in
consequence some 8-12% of losses is consumption that has not been billed
and  is  attributable  mostly  to unmetered  or unbilled  consumption and
pilferage.   Such losses represent significant loss of revenue to NEC.
Ongoing improvements in the metering and billing systevs and an inspection
program at all levels of distribution lines to locate unmetered services
will help reduce the non-technical losses to reasonably low levels.
Technical losses were expected to be reduced through the installation of
static capacitors to improve system power factor.  This was also to help
reduce the system peak demand. About 165 MVAR of static capacitors were
expected to be installed on the 11 kV distribution lines in the Khartoum
area to meet these objectives. About two thirds of this capacity was to be



-9-
provided by the USAID program. Unfortunately, although the equipment has
been acquired only part of the capacitors has been installed because the
program did not provide funds for engineering design and Installation of
that equipment. Also under USAID assistance, NEC appointed consultants to
carry out follow-up action on load management and energy conservation to
implement the recommendations of the UNDP/World Bank ESMAP Energy
Efficiency Study. However, the program, which was proceeding more slowly
than expected, was discontinued for internal security problems in the
country.    The  program  is  now  to  be  continued  under  the  project
(para. 4.21).
Electricity Pricin8
1.26       NEC, with the approval of the MEM and the MFEP, is responsible
for establishing electricity tariffs for the areas served by the BNG and
the EG. NEC implemented a major increase in tariffs in two equal steps,
which took effect from April 1 and Decembter 1, 1983. The combined increase
ranged from 143% for domestic consumers to 278% for small irrigation
pumping loads. Tariff rates were again increased by 21% in December 1984
sad 23% in March 1985. Tariffs were subsequently increased in January 1,
1987 by about 21% on average. The increases and respective average yields
by consumer category are: residential 41% (0.285 LSd/kWh), street lighting
660% (0.236 LSd/kWh), commercial 0% (0.280 LSd/kWh), industrial 0% (0.200
LSd/kWh), and agriculture 0% (0.194 LSd/kWh).   After the increases, the
average  tariff  yield  is about 0.25 LSd/kWh (0.10 US$IkWh).   This is
generally in line with the average incremental cost of supplying
electricity in the BNG (para. 6.07).   Further tariff increases will be
needed in the future, and in the context of the existing Power
Rehabilitation Credit Agreement, NEC and the Government have agreed that
they will implement appropriate and timely tariff adjustments. The present
tariff structure does not accord with the marginal costs of supplying
demand to various consumer groups, but USAID is financing the preparation
of a tariff study to review the present tariffs and recommend a suitable
tariff structure based on long-run marginal cost of supply of electricity
(paras. 5.15-5.16).
II. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
The Borrower
2.01      The Republic of Sudan will be the Borrower of an IDA Credit of
SDR 30.1 million (about US$38.0 million equivalent at the rate of 1.26419
US$/SDR).
2*02      Of the proceeds of the credit (a) the amount of SDR 29.7 million
(US$37.5 million equivalent) will be onlent to NEC at the present Bank rate
(para. 4.16) to finance the foreign exchange cost of the power components
of the project; and (b) the amount of SDR 0.4 million (US$ 0.5 million
equivalent), will be spent under the coordination of NEA for the energy
components of the project.
2.03       The implementing agencies will be NEC for the power components
and NEA for the energy components of the project.

The National Electricity Corporation (NEC)
Organization and Management
2.04       Background.  A recent review of NEC's institutional status and
performance shows that some of the major constraints that had been
identified in the past on NEC's operational efficiency in the area of
organizational and manpower capacity have by and large been removed. There
is no longer a significant shortage of staff, a high labour turnover or a
climate characterized by strained relations between management and the
unions or by low morale.   Moreover, the Corporation appears to become
increasingly autonomous from government control.   Considering that Sudan
has faced in the last few years political upheaval, a crippling drought,
chronic shortages of foreign exchange, and continued civil war in the
south, the fact that NEC has been able not only to emerge successfully as a
separate utility after the reorganization of the original Public
Electricity and Water Corporation (PEWC), but has managed to survive as a
company, increase its installed capacity, improve the reliability of power
supply, obtain attractive salary levels for its employees and set an
harmonious working atmosphere, is something for which the company has to be
commended.    However,  there  are  still  a  number  of  weak  areas  were
improvements  are  needed  if NEC  is  to emerge  as  an  efficient  fully
autonomous entity.   A list of suitable performance indicators has been
prepared to monitor NEC's improvements (Annex 2.1).
2.05       Organizational Structure.  NEC has a Board of Directors of 10
members appointed by the Government, which includes officials of government
bodies, representatives of electricity consumers and one representative
from NEC's employees. The Director General of NEC is an ex-officio member
of the Board.
2.06            NEC's  present  organization  is  the  result  of  a  major
organizational restructuring started in 1982 with the assistance of
consultants from the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB) financed by
IDA under the Power III Project (Credit 1006-SU).  A new organizational
structure proposed by ESB was approved in late 1983. It provided for four
directorates   covering   operations   and   engineering,   finance   and
administration, planning and projects, and Khartoum province distribution.
A fifth directorate responsible for regional electricity distribution was
created in 1984 and finally, by the end of 1984 a sixth directorate was
created to provide a centralized function covering organization and methods
and management information systems. NEC's present organizational structure
is shown in Annex 2.2.
2.07        In the context of the assistance provided under the Power III
Project, consultants ESB also assisted NEC during the implementation of the
new structure, which focussed exclusively on senior and higher level
management.  The assistance included the preparation of an Organizational
Manual--which defined the areas of responsibility and their relationships-
and seminars, induction sessions and group discussions to facilitate the
implementation of the new higher-level structure. Also in 1983, ESB were
retained by NEC to continue their assistance for organizational development
under two phases that were to cover respectively training of managers, and
development  of  methods  and  procedures.    Phase  I  was  successfully



- 11 -
completed under IDA financing. Phase TI was assigned by NEC for financing
under the USAID program. New consultants were selected which started the
work but did not perform entirely satisfactorily. The execution of phase
II was interrupted in April 1986 for internal security reasons in the
country.
2,08          In summmary, although the new organizational structure is
appropriate, it represents only the first step in the organizational
development of NEC. Unless the phases following the implementation of the
structure are pursued soon, the positive impact brought about by the new
organization  will  be  lost.    NEC  is  now  considering  to  retain  ESB
consultants to finalize phase II of the program with funds available under
the Power Rehabilitation Project.   In addition,  the Power IV project
includes financing to undertake the institution-building programs for
specific areas of NEC (para. 4.12).
2.09       A -major problem which is preventing a better functioning of the
new structure is that the positions of Senior Director of Finance and
Senior Director of Planning have remained vacant for more than two years.
Their functions are being carried out on an interim basis by the Director
General. However, substantial progress has been achieved recently in this
area. The appointment of a senior Director of Finance proposed by NEC is
being considered  for final approval by the council of ministers.   A
suitable candidate has been offered the position of Senior Director of
Planning.  This appointment is expected to be resolved within the next few
months. Effectiveuess of the credit will be contingent upon filling these
two positions.
2.10       Management.  According to its governing Act, NEC is intended to
be an autonomous corporation.   However, the statutory responsibility of
NEC's Board for policy making is negated by a requirement in the Act that
the Board should follow the instructions of the Minister of Energy and
Mining.   Also, all appointments at NEC's senior and middle management
levels have to be approved by the Government. Moreover, NEC is required to
follow government  payscales and employment regulations.    This set up
confuses decision making and jeopardizes the accountability of NEC and its
Board.    Although  as  a  result,  NEC  has  traditionally  been  managed
substantially as a government entity, in practice many of these regulations
are rather "nominal" and not always adhered to strictly.  However, as a
result of the new managerial style, there is a clear trend towards more
autonomy   in  decision   making,   particularly  on   financial  matters
(para. 5.05). Within this statutory flexibilty, NEC's management has found
procedures to establish an attractive package of fringe benefits for its
employees to the extent that Inadequate salary levels is not currently an
issue at the Corporation. While the technical assistance under the Power
IV project will focus on NEC's internal organizational and manpower
improvements needed, NEC has also been included as one of the ten pilot
public enterprises to test an improved relationship system between
Government and these enterprises under the IDA financed Public Enterprise
and Economic Management Project.
Personnel and Personnel Administration
2.11      Establishment.  NEC has two categories of employees:  classified
employees, under permanent contract; and unclassified employees, who are



- 12 -
not pensionable by the Corporation.   The latter are mainly unskilled or
semi-skilled manual workers. A preliminary manpower inventory (Annex 2.3)
prepared during the appraisal of the proposed project shows that as of end
1986, NEC's total actual number of employees was close to 10,100, of which
about 2,900 were classified and about 7,200 unclassified employees.  The
corresponding approved strengths were about 3,200 classified and 9,200
unclassified, totalling about 12,400 approved positions.  Between 1983-84
and 1985-86, the number of NEC's employees (actual strength), increased
from about 7,300 to about 10,500, or 43%, although NEC claims that the data
for 1983-84 still mixes up the number of employees for the water and power
operations and in consequence is not reliable. NEC also indicates that the
increase between 1983-84 and 1985-86 was due to personnel needed for a
number of new facilities including the Khartoum North and new Burri Power
Plants. However, irrespective of whether or not the increases were high,
the absolute number of employees is high by any standards. As a result,
NEC shows only about 20 to 25 connections per employee, one of the lowest
productivity levels in the region. At the request of the Association, NEC
is preparing a comprehensive manpower inventory which would be completed by
September 1987.  Such inventory is essential to allow NEC to plan the level
of employees required for its present and future needs.  At negotiations
agreements were reached that NEC shall implement an Action Plan to improve
its productivity. To this effect, NEC will furnish to the Association by
December 31, 1987 an Action Plan designed to improve the productivity of
NEC in terms of uumber of electricity connections per employee; such
program shall be based on the manpower inventory study, and will include
annual targets acceptable to the Association.
2.12        Staff Efficiency.   The lack of discipline throughout NEC is
adversely affecting NEC's performance even in areas where staffing,
experience and expertise are not an issue. The problem is less critical at
power plants and strictly technical areas, but is becoming increasingly
accute at NEC's headquarters  and clerical areas in general.    Easily
observable indications of this situation are absenteeism, non observance of
working hours and low productivity during working hours. Other less easily
observable practices, but not less damaging to the Corporaton, are
reluctance to adhere to practices well established at NEC, such as proven
operational  procedures,   standard  maintenance  practices  and  safety
regulations, tidiness and cleanliness at offices and working areas in
general. Although the managers and supervisory staff are given sufficient
authority to establish the necessary controls, and NEC's disciplinary code
provides adequate mechanisms for corrective actions, appropriate controls
have not been established and in consequence corrective action cannot be
taken.   This problem appears  to stem mainly from the lack of clear
objectives at the various working levels.   Thus, it would seem that in
order to achieve the disciplined environment that NEC is seeking, the
adoption of a number of positive rather than negative measures are
required.   These include: establishing clear objectives  and measurable
tasks, establishing clear operating systems and procedures, providing
opportune training for the implementation of such systems, providing the
necessary equipment and means to permit realization of the tasks,
establishing appropriate controls and discipline performance indicators,
exercising supervision, designing full work loads, and reducing to a
minimum if not eliminating altogether the surplus staff. Therefore, during
negotiations agreements were reached that NEC will present to the
Association by December 31, 1987 a personal management and supervising



- 13 -
progtam designed to Improve staff efficiency and an action plan to improve
productivity measured in terms of connections per employee in the
Corporation. Such programs which should be satisfactory to the Association
would include among other measures the installation of time clocks or
attendance registers, and a full review of NEC's head ofiice accomodation
with a view to reorganizing the allocation of office space to provide for
the concentration of Departments in specific areas and, whenever possible,
open plan offices for routine clerical work.
Training
2.13      Short-term Training Needs.  In general, NEC has a solid core of
competent and experienced technical staff which enables it to undertake
technical tasks with minor or no difficulties.   Many of NEC's engineers
have attended training or post-graduate courses abroad. However, there is
still the need to strengthen planning capabilities.   In consequence, the
proposed project includes appropriate components to enhance NEC's technical
planning capability (para. 4.12).   By contrast, in the area of Finance,
little or nothing has been done to provide specialized training for NBC
Finance Directorate's personnel. As a result, NEC's financial performance
has been adversely affected.   To overcome this situation, appropriate
training for NEC's Finance Directorate has been already initiated under the
ongoing Power Rehabilitation project (para. 5.09).
2.14      Long-term Training.  NEC's training needs in the long term are to
be covered mostly through in-house training programs to be undertaken once
the new Training Center financed under the ongoing Power III Project is
completed in mid 1988.   Unfortunately, the construction of the Training
Center has been delayed by a number of reasons including difficulties to
select appropriate contractors and lack of interest from potential
suppliers (para. 1.19).
Insurance aud Taxes
2.15       NEC has insurance coverage for its plant and equipment against
the risks of machinery breakdown, explosion and collapse of boilers, fire,
and  loss and damage in transit.   However,  the adequacy of insurance
coverage will have to be reassessed in line with the replacement value of
NEC's assets and its valuation to be carried out under the proposed project
(para. 5.02).   During negotiations agreement was reached that NEC will
introduce the necessary adjustments in insurance coverage to reflect its
new asset value.   NEC is exempt from the levy of import duties and
corporate tax on its income.   It is however subject to a levy called
"Interest on Equity Capital" (para. 5.03).
The National Energy Administration (NEA)
2.16      NEA, headed by a Director General, is the planning organ of MEM
(para 1.02).   At the end of 1986 NEA had a staff of 74 professionals
grouped under four divisions responsible respectlvely for Techno-Economic
Matters, Planning, Information Systems and Studies, and Financial and
Administrative Affairs.

III. ELECTRICITY MARKET
Historical Market
3.01         Electricity demand on the BNG represents about 96% of total
demand for electricity in the areas served by NEC, as shown in Table 3.2.
Between FY80 and FY85, total connected demand on the BNG increased at an
average annual rate of 11%. However, total consumption in the same period
grew only at an average annual rate of 8.1%, mainly as a result of,
constrained supply, as shown by the 8.1% average annual growth of actual
generation over the same period. Delays in construction of new generation,
transmission and distribution facilities affected the ability of the public
electricity system to meet the system demand. Scheduled load shedding had
to be established which affected consumption by residential and commercial
consumers and light Industry. At the same time load reduction programs had
to be imposed which severely curtailed supply to large industry and
irrigation pumps.

Demand Forecast
3.03          BNG Demand Forecast.        A demand-forecast methodology and
long-term demand forecast were developed by NEC consultants in 1982.
However, although the methodology was sound and satisfactory, the long-term
load forecast proposed at that time was found to be too high and had to be
revised to more realistic values during the appraisal of a former Power IV
Project  in  1983  (pars.  4.01).    During  the  appraisal  of  the  Power
Rehabilitation Project in 1985, further reductions to the load forecast had
to be introduced to take into account lower actual and expected consumption
resulting from delays in NEC's overall investment program.   The present
load forecast is based on actual consumption and estimated connected loads
by consumer category as of FY86 and projected increases of connected load.
The respective generation forecast takes into account expected improvement
in the reduction of technical losses from 16% in FY89 to 12*5% in FY94 and
onwards, as a result of ongoing and committed rehabilitation programs
(paras. 4.04 and 4.05), and a decrease of the 'unbilled' component in each
consumer category from 9.4% of total .onsumption in FY87 to 3.1% in FY91
and 1.8% by FY96 as a result of the upgrading of NEC'a billing system
currently being implemented (para. 5.12).   All projections assume that
NEC$s investment program will be realized, which involves some uncertainty
in view of the magnitude of the financing gap for the program (para. 4.06),
and that raising soft foreign exchange funds for investments is becoming a



- 16 -
major constraint for the development of the Sudanese electric power
subsector, as shown during the recent financial arrangements for the
proposed project.   Failure to obtain sufficient soft funds to close this
gap would result in insufficient generation, transmission and distribution
expansion as required to supply the load forecasted and the continuation,
as in the past, of compulsory programs of load shedding, load reduction and
eventually a continuing mushrooming of expensive and inefficient small
private generation plants.
3.04     The load and generation forecasts for the period FY87-FY96 and the
assumptions they are based on are shown in detail in Annex 3.1. A summary
of the load forecast is shown in Table 3.2. The new load forecast takes
into account a lower starting consumption of 1,047 GWh in 1986 than the
1,213 GWh of the previous forecast. Such low consumption in FY86 was due
to a number of factors, including that FY86 was an unusually wet and cool
year which involved less electricity consumption for irrigation and air
conditioning.    Also  in  FY86,  the  power  system  experienced  several
disruptions as a result of failures in one of the high voltage Roseires
lines to Khartoum and damage in one of the power transformers at the
Meringan Substation.  On the economic side, some internal constraints in
supplying raw materials to large industry contributed to lower electricity
consumption by that sector.   It is estimated that only some 60X of the
industrial capacity installed in the Khartoum area was utilized in FY86.
Total connected demand was assumed to grow at an average annual rate of
7.6% in the period FY86-FY96, as compared with the 9.61 of the Power
Rehabilitation project forecast.   The new forecast assumes annual growth
rates for connected demand of 8.3X for residential consumption, 4.81 for
commercial and light industry, 7.6% for bulk supply and large industry,
9.9% for irrigation small pumps, and 6.1% for other categories.   As a
result, total consumption in the BNG is now expected to reach 1,685 GWh in
FY91, or 10% lower than the consumption of 1,871 GWh assumed for that year
in the Power Rehabilitation project load forecast. The above growth rates
reflect price elasticity effects expected to occur after the recent tariff
increases of January 1, 1987 (para. 1.26).  Total generation required to
supply the connected demand is now forecasted to grow at an average annual
growth rate of 7.2% in the period FY86-FY96.   The projected required
generation for total connected load in FY91 is 2,081 GWh compared with
2,226 GWh assumed in the previous projection.
3.05     EG Demand Forecast. The present EG load forecast was prepared by
NEC and is based an an extrapolation of historical data and information on
expected consumption of specific future projects.
Sales Forecast
3.06     Actual and forecasted NEC sales are shown in detail in Annex 3.3
and summarized in Table 3.2. Projected growth rates assumed for sales to
residential and commercial consumers in the period PY86-FY91 are lower than
historical trends, reflecting expected effects of recent sharp tariff
increases more in line with actual cost of supply to those categories.
Lower growth rates for residential and commercial connected load are also
expected as a result of more effective bill collection to consumers which
through long delayed settlement of their bills perceived electricity almost
as a free service.   Sales to large industrial consumers and irrigation



- 17 -
pumps assume a gradual increase during three to four ;ears in the
utilization of existing production capacity and that only 20% of plans for
approved new iudustry would materialize. It has also been assumed that new
industry would have a three year learning curve with the corresponding
lower consumption of electricity in the initial years of operation. Growth
rates for industrial and irrigation consumption appear high because of the
low starting consumption.    Sales  forecasts  assume  that NEC's planned
investments will materialize (para. 3.03). and that as a result contraints
iAn supply will be removed.   However, this will require, in addition,
sustained improvements in NEC's managerial capabilities.  On the econom4c
side, the normalization of electricity consumption by industry and large
pumps assume that constraints in the supply of raw materials will be
gradually removed.
IV. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Power Subsector Investment Program
Background
4.01        The expansion of the power subsector in Sudan has been well
planned by NEC with the assistance of competent consultants.  During the
last few years, NEC has developed considerable expertise in power subsector
planning and has consistently adhered to sound investment objectives.
However, delays in the appolntment of a Senior Director of Planning
(paras. 1.21 and 2.09) and the consequent lack of managerial leadership in
that area has made the preparation of the Power Subsector Investment
Program (PSIP) and other studies slow and difficult. The present PSIP is
based on a number of studies, including the Nile Waters Study prepared by
Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Gibb) In January 1979, which established a
Master Plan for the utilization of the Nile waters in the Sudan, the
Long-term Power Plan prepared in September 1979, which defined the
least-cost expansion program for generation and transmission required to
meet the demand for electricity in the period 1985-2000, and the Power IV
Feasibility Study 4/ prepared by Gibb and M&M in June 1983, which
confirmed that the project sequence of the Master Plan was still the
least-cost development program to satisfy the forecast demand up to the
early 1990s. Such development program, however, could not be adhered to
strictly as envisaged, due to major difficulties in obtaining the required
amount   of   concessionary   financing   for   investment   (pars.   4.09).
Consequently, instead of the original Power IV Project, a second best
alternative was adopted with IDA assistance (Power Rebabilitation Project,
Credit 1624-SU of September 1985), which included the most urgently needed
rehabilitation work, subsectoral institutional development as well as a
modest generation and transmission expansion program. All major capacity
and transmission expansion works had to be postponed (para. 4.09). Credit
1624-SU also funded an updating of the feasibility study for the Ohartoum
4/   The Power IV Feasibility Study of 1983 covered the expansion of the
Sudanese power subsector and had a broader scope than the presently
proposed Power IV Project.



- 18 -
North power plant expansion, including an optimization of the unit size,
in view that such expansion was the next project in the least-cost capacity
expansion sequence.   The study also reviewed the BNG load forecast and
other generation options and concluded that the expansion of Khartoum North
with two units of between 45 MW and 60 MW each was still the least-cost
solution for increasing the generating  capacity  in the  BNG.   /    In
addition, IDA carried out a thorough analysis of the least-cost generation
expansion program for the BNG which confirmed those findings.
Least-cosit Exansion Program
4.02     IDA has had constructive discussions with NEC and the Government
of Sudan (GOS)  leading to the definition of the Least-cost Expansion
Program (LCEP) for generation and NEC's Investment Program (NECIP) during
the preparation and appraisal of a previously proposed Power IV Project in
August 1983,  4/ as well as in the context of the Power Rehabilitation
Project.  During project appraisal in November 1986, these programs were
reviewed again and revised to take into account of recent adjustments in
the load forecast, investment costs, fuel prices, and foreign exchange
constraints.    The  present  NECIP  also  incorporates  the  findings  and
recommendations of new feasibility studies which became available at
project appraisal (para. 4.03).
NEC Investment Program (NECIP)
4.03     The NECIP for the period FY87-FY95 is described in detail in Annex
4.1 and summarized for period FY87-PY92 in Table 4.1.   It includes the
least-cost expansion program for generation (para. 4.02), and transmission
and distribution expansion.   The latter two investment categories were
reviewed and updated in two recent studies financed by IDA under the Power
III and Power Rehabilitation projects. 6/ During negotiations, agreements
were reached with GOS and NEC that (i) until the project has been
completed, NEC should not undertake any major expansion project not
included in the NRCIP agreed by the Government and the Association unless
NEC shall have furnished evidence satisfactory to the Association that such
major project is economically and technically justified.   Major projects
would be those requiring capital expenditures which shall exceed the
equivalent of US$10 million or 1.5X of NEC's gross revalued assets in
operation whichever is lower after such assets have been correctly valued;
and (ii) the NECIP, which would cover at least eight years, would be
reviewed annually by March 31, or as needed, and revised if required.
However, changes will have to be satisfactory to IDA.

Preliminary discussions held with a number of potential donors during
preparation and appraisal of the proposed project indicate little or no
interest to participate in the financing of future power subsector
investments in Sudan (para. 4.09). Considering that the country has become
completely dependent on foreign aid for infrastructure development, failure
to ensure the flow of sufficient soft funds for electric power investeents
would result in drastic supply constraints in 1993 and subsequent years.
In this climate of uncertainty, prompt and effective aid mobilization und
coordination has to be pursued without delays.   In view of the likely
shortages of financing and the consequent potential supply restrictions
involved, the evolution of electricity consumption should be closely
monitored and an effective demand management program should be set In
place, including systematic load shedding if necessary.   The proposed
project would include appropriate demand and loss studies required to
establish such programs (para. 4.13).
The Project
Project Objectives
4.07        The main objectives of the project are to provide additional
generating capacity to NEC to meet the projected Increases in demand in the



- 21 -
BNG area by 1991;  to strengthen NBC's managerial, planning, operational
and financial performance;   to support GOS in its efforts to establish
through NEA an action-oriented long-term development plan for the Energy
Sector and to review the efficiency of energy use in the transport sector;
and to develop NBA managerial capabilities.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
4.08         The project is in accordance with IDA's Country Assistance
Strategy  which,  supports  envisages  key  infrastructure  essentil  to
production and public enterprise reform. Although our strategy emphasizes.
rehabilitation, the major component in the proposed project is a power
generation expansion investmeno.  This is justified because (a) additional
power generation is necessary to achieve production incre*sa  iA both
agro-processing and industrial sectors, and (b) there are no furthet-
investments in rehabilitation which would substautially reduce the ned for
additional power capacity. In the absence of other donors, IDA's support
will be crucial to ensure continuation of NEC's institutional reform.
IDA's involvement in the energy sector in general, but particalarly in the
electric power subsector, is essential to (a) ensure impl_mentation of high
priority least-cost options for seetor expansion; (b) mobilize sutfficient
resources by organizing cofinancing; (c) promote rational energy pricing.
policies; and (d) provide necessary asssltance and coordinatiou to allow
the key institutions,  particularly NEC and NEA, to achieve sustained
institutional improvements.
Aid Inflow and Coordination in the Subector
4.09        The subsector expansion is constrained by severe shortages of
foreign exchange funds, and is reaching a critical situatior where the rtte
of investment is insufficient to provide the expansion required to s*Wply
the forecasted demand. Other donors, such as KfW, ODA and USAID, whica in
the past had traditionally supported the subsector with substantial soft
term funds, have either suspended or reduced their aid programs for pwer
investments.  In addition due to the recent volatility of oil prices and
the consequent uncertainty of oil export revenues for oil-exporting
countries concessionary funds traditionally available to the Sudan from the
Arab world cannot continue to. As a consequence, in the last few yeas,
power subsector investments had to be selected to fit the finacing
available rather than to follow the least-cost development sequence. As a
result, unavoidable load shedding, suppressed demand and unscheduled power
supply cuts are now expected to occur in the period 1989-1990.   Unless
additional financing can be secured on time for the next proposed capacity
investments required, substantial restrictions in electricity supply may
occur starting as early as 1993.   From the point of view of subsector
institutional growth and improvement, IDA appears at present as the only
donor capable of providing the subsector with a continuing stable support
and the appropriate follow-up required to ensure that institutional
development and power supply objectives are achieved.

4.12      B.  NEC Organizational and Staff Development.  IDA is supporting
NEC's institutional development under. the ongoing Power III and Power
Rehabilitation  projects.    Although  substantial  improvements have been
achieved, particularly on organizational aspects, the implementation of the
new procedures associated with the new structure as well as the trainiug
7/   Two units of 45 MW each is the minimum capacity that should be
installed by 1991.   Temporary market conditions for the supply of
steam thermal plants in this capacity range appear to indicate that
two units of 60 MW could be obtained at no additional cost.

environment of present and future thermal generation and
recommend actions to be taken to mitigate against adverse
effects. The terms of reference for the study are included as
Annex 4.2;
(ii)  Study of Load sad Consumption Characteristics and Power System
Technical and Other Losses, requiring about 30 man-months of
consulting services,  to include:   analysis of hourly, daily,
monthly and seasonal load characteristics by consumer category
for various physical areas and regions; Analysis of patterns of
electricity consumption by consumer category; provision and
installation of stationary and mobile metering equipment for
demand and consumption metering and recording; analysis of power
system technical and non-technical losses and recommendations for
their  reduction  to more  reasonable  levels.    The  terms  of

(ii) Consulting services to study the efficiency of energy use in the
transportation sector; and
(Mi) Training to enhance NEA managerial capabilities.
Project Cost
4.15       Project costs are shown in detail in Annex 4.3 and summarized
in Table 4.2.  The total cost of the project including physical and price
contingencies but excludlig interest during construction is estimated at
US$88.7 million, of which the foreign exchange cost would be US$74.8
million equivalent or 84%.  Total financing required, including interest
during construction would be about US$103 million equivalent, of which
US$74.8 million would be in foreign exchange. Base costs are at June 1986
price level. Physical contingencies were estimated by NBC consultants to
range between 9 and 15% for base local costs and between 6 and 12% for base
foreign costs.   These estimates are reasonable and reflect the level of
preparation of the various project components.   Price contingencies were
computed assuming for local inflation annual rates of 46% in FY85, 37X in
FY86, 35% in FY87, 25% in FY88, 20% in FY89, 15% in FY90, and 7% in FY91
and 3.5% in FY92 and thereafter.   The annual rates assumed for foreign
iuflation are 0.7% in 1985, 12% in 1986, 3.0% in 1987, 1.0% in 1988, 1989
and  1990,  and  3.5%  in  1991,  and  thereafter.    These  inflation  rates
are considered appropriate for the kinds of goods and services lcluded in
the project.

Ptoject Financing
4.16      The project financing plan is summarized in Table 4.3.  The total
foreign exchange cost would be financed by the African Development Fund
(US$35.9 million), IDA Power Rehabilitation Credit (US$0.9 million) and IDA
proposed credit (US$38.0 million).   Local currency requirements would be
provided by NEC from funds generated from its operations.   Local costs
required for the support to NeA would  be financed by the Gov2rnment.  The
IDA credit of US$38 million would be made to the Government and US$37.5
million will be onlent to NEC with annual interest equivalent to 7.921 of
the outstanding balance, for a period of 20 years including a grace period
of 5 years.  Interest during the grace period is expected to be added to
the principal amount.   NEC will assume the risk of foreign currency
fluctuations subsequent to each disbursement from the proposed IDA credit.
The remaining US$0.5 million of the total IDA credit would be passed on to
NeA as a grant. During negotiations the above onlending terms were agreed
with the Government and NEC.   The execution of an onlending agreement
between them will be a condition of effectiveness of the credit.

Project Implementation
4.17      Khartoum North Power Plant Expansion. NEC will be responsible for
the Implementation of the expansion of the Khartoum North Power Station,
with the assistance of consultants. NEC, with financing provided under the
Power Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1624-SU), has appointed Ewbank, Preece
& Partners, (EP, UK), as main consultants for the project.   BP, which
carried out the feasibility study for the plant with funds under the same



- 26 -
credit, has started the preparation of designs and bidding documents. The
same consultants will assist NEC in the evaluation of bids for the various
contracts and, during the construction phase, will undertake the detailed
project design and management functions, including procurement, inspection
of equipment manufacturing, testing and shipplig, supervision during
construction and erection at the site, and of final tests during
commissionning and acceptance of the entire power plant expansion.   With
the  purpose  of  ensuring  prompt  decision  making  and  appropriate
coordination, NEC has established the Power IV Project Management Unit
(PMU) and appointed a qualified and experienced engineer as project manager
responsible for the executiou of all power components of the proposed
project, including the institutional support to NEC and the power subsector
studies.   The PMU will be staffed with sufficient numbers of qualified
professionals and support staff as required  for an efficient project
implementation.  The team appointed by the consultants for activities in
the Khartoum offices and at the site will report through a Senior Resident
Engineer to the PNU Manager.   The latter will report directly to NEC's
Director General.
4.18       During negotiations agreements were reached that (i) NEC will
maintain the Power IV PMU which shall operate under terms of reference
mutually agreed upon by NEC and IDA; and (ii) during project execution, the
PMU will be staffed with appropriate numbers of qualified professionals as
required for a timely implementation of the project.   The Functions and
Organization  of  the PMU as mutually agreed between NEC and IDA are
contained in Annex 4.7.
4.19      Fuel Oil Reguirements, Supply, Unloading and Storage.  Once the
proposed expansion of Khartoum North has been completed, it is estimated
that the 150 MW then installed at the plant would consume about 800/tpd of
fuel oil, operating at 80% plant factor.   This in turn will require
transporting daily about 28 tankers of 35 t each, based on 295 days per
year.    The present  fuel  unloading  facilities  at Khartoum North  are
adequate, including rail unloading sidings and rail tanker heating
facilities with steam supplied from the main boiler plant.  The latter,
however, have not yet been used because the existing tankers are not
equipped with heating coils. For handling the unloading of the amount of
fuel required by the 150 KW station, it is absolutely essential that all
rail tankers entering the Khartoum North Power Station sidings are equipped
with heating facilities. In addition, NEC and Sudan Railways Corporation
(SRC) have informed IDA that under a bilateral agreement with the
Government of France, 90 rail tankers for heavy fuel oil have already been
supplied to SRC and that SRC is at present negotiating the acquisition of
40 additional tankers. SRC has indicated that alternatively it can retrofit
existing wagons as needed to meet NEC's fuel transportation requirements.
The Government of Japan has expressed interest in financing through a grant
to NEC eight main-line locomotives and communication equipment for ensuring
a timely fuel transportation for Khartoum North. In summary, there appears
to be reasonable assurances that a reliable fuel oil transportation can be
set in place to meet the Khartoum area requirements. During negotiations
agreements were reached from COS and NEC that, the Government shall prepare
and furnish to IDA not later than December 31, 1988 a program including



- 27 -
detailed timetable, outlining the actione required to ensure a reliable
fuel supply to the Khartoum area generation stations before the
commissioning of the Khartoum North expansion under the project.
4.20      NEC Organizational and Staff Development.  The various components
for strengthening NEC's Finance and Planning Directorate, will be
implemented by NEC with the assistance of consultants satisfactory to IDA.
The consultants will advise NEC on suitable programs for scholarships and
training and will prepare the TOR for advisors needed under the program.
The consultants will also assist NEC in the preparation of bidding
documents and evaluation of tenders for the computer hardware and other
equipment and materials included in the program.
4.21      Power Subsector Studies. The power subsector studies included in
the proposed project would be implemented by NEC with the assistance of
consultants satisfactory to IDA.  The terms of reference for the Khartoum
area  environmental   study  have   been  prepared   by  consultants  EP
(para. 4.27).   The study is scheduled to start in March 1988 and be
completed by June 1989.   The Terms of Reference for the stu4y of load
characteristics and loss analysis were finalized at technical discussions
with NEC prior to negotiations (Annex 4.6).
4.22           S ort to N     for Institutional Developent and Ener
planning.  The energy components included in the proposed project would be
implemented by NEA with the assistance of consultants satisfactory to IDA.
Status of Project Preparation and Project Implementation Schedule
4.23            Project  nreparation  is  proceeding  satisfactorily.    The
consultants for the Khartoum North plant expansion have been appointed
(para. 4.17) and are working in the preparation of preliminary design and
bidding documents. A summarized implementation schedule is shown in Anmex
4.4. The issuing of bidding documents for the expansion of Khartoum North
is expected to commence in June 1987.   The contracts are planned to be
awarded between January 1988 and May 1988. Construction activities would
begin in February 1988.  The first 45 MW unit would commence commercial
operation in February 1991 and the second in April of the same year. The
expansion of Khartoum North would take some 40 months to construct. This
schedule appears realistic based on NEC's recent experience in the
construction of the first phase of Khartoum North (2X33 MW), particularly
taking into account that all site development and infrastructure for the
plant were completed under the first phase.
4.24      The consultants for the support to NEC's Finance Directorate have
been appointed (para. 5.09).   The scope of work and computer support
required for NEC's Planning Directorate has been defiued on the basis of
information obtained by NEC from various suppliers. Scope of the training
component was defined during appraisal.    Consultants have yet  to be
appointed to assist NEC to finslize the scope of work and prepare bidding
documents and detailed arrangements for the scholarship program. The final
scope for the support to NEC's Planning Directorate would be completed by
NEC with the assistance of consultants by September 1987.   Selection of
candidates for the scholarships will take place in 1987-88 so that the



- 28 -
first group of candidates cau start courses during the academic year
1988-89 (iitiation in September 1988). NEC, also with the assistance of
consultante, will complete and issue by July 1987 the bidding documents for
the acquisition of computer hardware and software for the Planning and
Finance Directorates.   The support to the Flance Directorate from an
accountaut and financial experts is expected to comence prior to April
1988 after the EBSB consultants have completed part of their assignment
(para. 5.10).
4.25       The invitations requesting consulting services for the studies
included In the proposed project are expected to be issued by June 1987.
The studies would start in March 1988 and would be completed in June 1989.
4.26      The implementation of the support to NEA will start in mid 1988
and will be completed in December 1990.
Environmental Aspects
4.27           The project  components are not expected to involve any
significant  adverse  environmental  impact.    The  consultants  EP  have
established that the existing stack at Khartoum North i8 sufficiently high
to  dissipate efficiently the combustlon gases and that in consequence no
special equipment is required to maintain acceptably low levels of sulphur
dioxide at ground level within Bank requirements, provided that the sulphur
content of the heavy fuel oil does not exceed 3.5X.  The use of modern
burners together with dispersion of the flue gas plume will enable control
of particulates to be achieved within the USEPA limit which approximates
100 micrograms/n3. However, in view of the planned future expansion of
thermal generation in the Khartoum area, an environmental study would be
conducted under the proposed project to assess present and e,xpected
pollution levels and recommend any measures required. The detailed terms
of reference for this study are included in Annex 4.2.
Procurement
4.28         The materials, equipment and   works for the project to be
financed by the proposed IDA credit would be procured through lnternational
competitive   bidding   in  accordance  with   Bank/IDA  guidelines   for
procurement. Margins of preference for local manufacturers or contractors
would not apply in this case because the kind of equipment and materials
required for the project are not produced locally. A margin of preference
will apply to local contractors since there may be local contractors with
enough experience to qualify to bid for part of the works to be undertaken
under the project.
4.29         Consulting services for the various studies and assistance
programs included in the project and to be financed by IDA would be
selected by the implementing agencies on the basis of quality from short
lists of consultants acceptable to the Association in accordance with
Bank/IDA guidelines and proposed by the lmplementing agencies.
4.30       All contracts for the expausiou of Khartoum North for amounts
equal to or larger than US$1 million would be subject to IDA's prior
review.

ongoing Power Rehabilitation Project, and that no coutracts are expected to
be entered into before siguing of the proposed credit, retroactive
financing would not be required.
Special Accounts
4.33     In order to expedite project execution and give the implementing
agencies rapid access to IDA credit funds, the Ministry of Finance and
Plannig will open two Special Accounts at the Bauk of Sudan. Account A



- 30 -
for NEC will have an initial amount of US$ 3 million, and Account B for
NEA, will have an initial amount of US$ 100,000. Payments from the Special
Accounts shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures under the
proposed credit. The Special Accounts will be replenished by IDA from time
to  time,  as  required.    The  accounts  will  be  audited  by  auditors
satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.11).   During negotiations agreements were
reached that IDA will receive audits of the two special accounts by
independent auditors within six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Disbursement of IDA Credit Proceeds
4.34      The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed over a
period of about 58 months from September 1987 through June 1992.
Disbursements from the Credit account, including those to replenish the
Special Accounts A and B (para. 4.33), will be fully documented and made
for 100l   of foreign expenditures for parts (Al, A2, A6, B, C and D) of the
project.   The expected schedule of disbursements from the proposed IDA
credit (Annex 4.5) is based on standard profiles for Bank loans and IDA
credits for power projects in the Eastern and Southern Africa Region. The
closing date for the proposed credit would be June 30, 1992, six months
after expected project completion.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND COST RECOVERY
Introduction
5.01          NEC is responsible for developing and operating the power
facilities of the areas served by the national grids (BNG and EG) which
account for about 96Z of total public electricity capacity installed in
Sudan  (paras.  1.14-1.16).    The  financial  analysis  focusses  on  the
electricity activity of NEC only. Prior to 1982, the company was part of a
larger utility, PEWC, which was also responsible for water supply.   The
split-up has caused some irregularities in NEC's record keeping.   In
addition, the company lacks qualified accountants and experienced full time
top financial management (paras. 5.08-5.09). The financial statements for
FY85-FY86 should therefore be interpreted with caution.
Financial Position and Past Operating Results
5.02      The operating results of NEC for FY85 and FY86 based on audited
books are summarized in Table 5.1 and shown in detail in Annex 5.1. 8/
Rates of return on partially revalued average net fixed assets 9/ were
about 7% and 91 for FY85 and FY86 (adjusted for 12 months operition),
respectively.   Rough estimates of NEC's replacement value of existing
assets indicate a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets of about 71
for the 12 month period ending June 30, 1986, compared to 9X required under
8/ NEC's financial year, which is the same as the Government's, has varied
over the past years as follows:
FY85 - Sept. 26, 1984 - Sept. 15, 1985
FY86 - Sept. 16, 1985 - June 30, 1986
FY87 a July 1, 1986 - June 30, 1987
9/   NEC's fixed assets have been revalued up to and including FY84 and
adjusted in FY86 for foreign exchange losses.

the Power Rehabilitatiou Project (Credit 1624-SU).   However, return on
assets is presently not a meaningful performance indicator because NEC
lacks a comprehensive asset register and the true replacement value of
NEC's fixed assets is not accurately known. Agreements were reached with
NEC during negotiation that: (i) a computerized asset register, iucluding
curreat replacement value of existing assets, will be completed by
March 31, 1988 (para. 5.09); and (ii) NEC will revalue its assets yearly
according to a methodology to be agreed upon with NEC and IDA prior to
March 31, 1988.
5.03       Average tariffs per kWh sold of LSd 0.19 (8.6USt) and LSd 0.21
(8.4 USO) for FY85 and FY86 respectively, appear to have been at
appropriate levels. However, cash operating costs per kWh sold were high
due mainly to the large difference between electricity generated and that
actually billed (pars. 1.25).  This also resulted in significant loss of
revenues to NEC. Other contributing factors to the high operating costs
per kWh sold were high staffing levels and inefficiencies in operating the
various plants.  The latter coutributed to high fuel costs although the
actual price paid per tonne was reduced by about 13% for FY86, reflecting
world market trends.   In 1980, the Government imposed a levy on NEC
entitled 'Interest on Equity Capital". This levy, a form of dividend, is
been calculated at 5X on the equity capital balance, including reserve for



- 32 -
revaluation of assets, which in the past has reduced significantly NBC's
net income. It is understood that the Governfent, following a request by
NBC, has agreed to amend the calculation of this levy, starting in FY87, to
exclude the revaluatiou reserve. This should in the future help de6rease
NBC's needs for internally generated funds as well as the level of rate of
return required to generate these funds.

increase in net fixed assets and long-term debt for FY86.
5.05      NBC's financial situation deteriorated during the FY8S-86 period,
maiuly because of its inability to collect revenues for electricity



- 33 -
supplied  (paras.  5.13-5.14).       The  huge  build-up  of  rtceivables,
representing about 14 months of sales at end FY86, put NEC in an extremely
tight cash flow situation.  As a result, the Government paid during this
period NEC's debt service on foreign loans aud part of its fuel bill and
capital expenditures. However, since July 1, 1986, the Ministry of Finauce
is no longer covering NEC's expenses and serious efforts by NBC are now
underway to collect for electricity actually billed (pars. 5.14). On June
30, 1986, overdue payments by NEC to the Goverament amounted to some
LSd  355  million.    While  part  of  this  amount  was  offset  with  the
Government's outstanding electTicity bills to NEC prior to negotiations
(para. 5*13), agreement was reached duriug negotiations that the remainnug
amounts due the Government will be paid off by end FY92.
5.06      NEC's loug-term debt position of LSd 688 million on June 30, 1986
is  overstated.    Included  are  certain amounts which  are  still under
negotiation as to whether or not they should be grants passed on to NEC by
the Government.  Furthermore, NRC is presently carrying the liabllity ou
some long-term loans used for fiuancing power Investments in isolated areas
which are not under NEC's statutes.   The works financed are also shown
either in NEC's works-in-progress or fixed assets, dependlig on whether the
works are still under construction or completed.   Under  the present
organizational structure of the power sector in Sudau and according to the
National Electricity Corporation Act of 1982, these assets do not legally
belong to NEC and should be transferred, together with the long-term
liabilities associated with these assets, to the various utilities
responsible for electricitv supply in the respective areas.   Agreements
were reached during negotiations that (i) on-lending terms on all foreign
grants aud loans contraeted by the Government and passed on to NEC for the
purpose of financing NEC's power investmeuts will be finalized by December
31, 1987;   (ii) all fixed assets, works under construction and their
related financing appearing in NEC's books but which are for the purpose of
serving areas not of NEC's responsibility as defined it NEC Act of 1982
will be transferred to the various areas by December 31, 1987, and (iii)
NEC will not incur any debt unless a reasonable forecast of Its revenues
and expenditures show that the projected internal cash generation is 1.5
times the projected debt service requirement on all debt, includlig the
debt to be incurred.
5.07        To help ensure NEC's financial viability in the future, its
accounts receivable position will be closely muonitored aud a covenant is
included in the project to limit NEC's accounts receivable positlon to 90
days by June 30, 1988 (pars. 5.14). Additional measures, particularly with
respect to tariffs, rescheduling of overdue payments to the Government and
reconciliation of NEC's accounts receivable and payables are discussed in
paras. 5.03, 5.05-5.06, 5.13-5.14, 5.18, 5.20 and shown in Annex 5.5.
Accounting and Audit
5.08       NEC maintains its books in accordauce with Sudauese accounting
codes and regulations. In the past, NEC has had problems in closlng its
books in a timely fashion and the accounts have not always beeu certified
by the exterual auditors. The main reason for this is lack of qualified
staff, poor record keeping and lack of proper accounting systems, standards



- 34 -
and procedures. NEC's FY85 books were closed in September 1986, about one
year after the end of its financial year. Iu connection with preparation
of the project, NEC established a task force and was able to close its FY86
books in October 1986.  NEC's audited FY84, FY85 and FY86 accounts were
received by IDA in March 1987.
5.09         NEC has requested the services of the ESB to assist it in
preparing an asset register and developing modern accounting systems,
standards and procedures as well as providing on-the-job training to staff
in the Finance Directorate.   Presently, NEC does not have oue qualified
accountant.   If the full benefit of new systems and procedures is to be
derived, it is essential that the organization has fully qualified
professional accountants. Therefore, IDA has agreed to finance the cost of
full time accounting studies abroad for NEC staff. In view of the urgency
of upgrading the Finance Directorate, IDA has agreed to finance the
services of the cons'iltants and training abroad of NEC staff, estimated at
US$0.7 million, under the Power Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1624-SU).
In addition, the financing of a professional accountant for a period of
three years is included in the proposed credit.   During negotiations
agreement was reached with NEC that the professional accountant will be
hired by March 31, 1988, about the time when the ESB contract financed
under Credit 1624-SU will expire.
5.10      NEC maintains separate accounts for its area offices:  Khartoum,
BNG, Damazin and EG.  At the head office in Khartoum, only the accounts of
that office are kept. The regional offices do not send periodic accounts,
income statements, balance sheets or other reports to Khartoum more often
than  once  a year  after  the  close  of  the  financial  year.    Duriug
negotiations, agreement was reacbed that NEC will prepare accounting
information and mamagement reports in respect of all of NEC's area offices
and consolidate them with the head office accounts uo less frequently than
at quarterly intervals starting from July 1, 1988.   This date appears
reasonable in view of the technical assistance financed by IDA
(para. 5.09).
5.11       Agreement was reached during negotiations that NEC will submit
audited accounts to IDA within eight months after the end of FY87 and
within six months after the end of subsequent fiscal years. This appears
reasonable in view of the implementation of modern accounting systems,
standards and procedures, training of NEC's finance staff and technical
assistance to its Finance Directorate, all which should ensure timely
closing of NEC's books in the future. However, NEC's external auditors are
appointed by the Auditor General of Sudan generally well after the closing
of NEC's accounts, and consequently the auditor's report becomes available
long thereafter.   In order to assure timely completion of audits in the
future, assurance was obtained during negotiations that if the Auditor
General can not audit NEC's accounts within the above prescribed period,
the Auditor General will appoint a certified private accounting firm to
audit NEC's accountAa.
Billing and Collection
5.12      NEC has difficulties in billing its consumers accurately and in a
timely fashion, particularly those in the Khartoum area which are



- 35 -
computerized.    10/ The problem stems partly from computer programming
errors in processing the bills and frequent errors in meter reading, the
latter not haviug been carried out on a regular basis.   In addition, a
large number of consumers are not being billed due to lack of an up-to-date
consumer list.  A computer adviser financed by USAID is assisting NBC in
improving its billing system. Good progress has been made in this area,
although not as rapidly as expected under the Power Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1624-SU), due mainly to interruptions in the USAID assistance
program in Sudan for several months. USAID has now resumed its assistance
to NEC aud the adviser's contract has been exteuded to end-1987.   This
should provide ample time to fully computerize the billing of NEC's
consumers  in  the Khartoum  area.    The  credit  Includes  financing  for
technical assistance to help NEC with its computer activities and to
provide on-the-job training to NEC computer staff after the USAID coutract
has expired. The credit also includes financing of consulting services to
assist NEC in designing aud implementing a loss reduction program (para.
1.25).   This program is aimed at reducing not only technical losses but
unaccounted  for consumption as well.    In addition,  NEC has recently
increased the number of its meter readers and inspection crews.  Faulty
meters are being replaced by new ones financed under Credit 1624-SU and a
task force has been established within NEC to identify consumers which are
presently not included in NEC's master list. Appropriate indicators have
been defined to monitor NEC's progress in this area (Annex 2.2).
5.13       The major coutributing factor to NEC's financial deterioratiou
has been its inability to collect from consumers.  As of June 30, 1986,
NEC's accounts receivable were estimated at about LSd 250 million,
equivalent to about 14 mouths of sales.  The largest defaulters are the
domestic consumers (about 65% of total arrears) and the Government.
However, at the same time, large amounts owed by NEC to the Government for
fuel aud other charges remain unreconciled and unpaid (para. 5.05).
Recently, the Government and NEC settled their accounts whereby NEC's
accounts payable to the Governmeat was reduced by LSd 32 million.   In
addition, the Government also settled in cash LSd 10 million of its
outstanding electricity bills with NEC.   During negotiations, agreements
were reached that by September 30, 1987 the outstanding electricity bills
by Government and its non-revenue earning agencies will be brought to a
level not exceeding 90 days of their respective consumptiou over the last
twelve months.
5.14      It is estimated that a large portion of the arrears caused by the
domestic consumers has been outstanding for more than three years and is
not collectible.   NEC is authorized to disconnect almost all types of
consumers, including most Government agencies and corporations, who do not
pay their bills within three months after they are issued.   NEC has
sometimes been hesitaut to execute this discounection policy in view of
10/  Government,   domestic   aud   commercial   consumer   billings   are
computerized.



- 36 -
frequent disputes with its cousumers iu respect of the accuracy of the
bills issued. Recently NEC established a team, beaded by the Director of
Fiasuce, which moves from one area to another in a caravan, reads the
meters and disconnects on the spot, if at last 302 of the outstanding
accounts are not settled.   Average collectioi per mouth has been about
LSd 16 million which is less than the current one month sales.  Although
NEC plans to increase the number of teams, additional measures are required
to reduce the large arrears on a permanent basis.  This problem has been
chronic aud despite considerable efforts the situation has not improved.
In view of the large amounts outstanding and to avoid titerrupting NEC's
day-to-day affairs, a reasonable solution to this problem is for NEC to
hire private  collection  coutractors.    Agreemets  were  reached during
negotiations that:   (i) starting December 31, 1987, the Government will
review and settle quarterly the outstauding electricity bills of its
departments and non-revenue earning agencies; (ii) NEC will reduce its
total accounts receivable to no more than 90 days of sales by June 30,
1988, 75 days of sales by June 30, 1990 and 60 days of sales by June 30,
1992 and thereafter; aud (iii) NEC will prepare every three months,
commencing December 31, 1987, a report summarizing its outstanding
accounts, broken down by consumer groups and days outstanding, state the
actions it proposes to take to collect the amounts, and send a copy to
IDA.
Tariffs
5.15       The present tariff structure is out-of-date and does not give
appropriate signals to electricity users about the differences in the costs
of meeting their demands in critical aud non-critical periods of the day
and  seasons  of  the  year.    USAID  has  financed  consultauts  (Harza
Engineering/Coopers &Lybrand) to prepare a tariff study to determine the
appropriate structure aud level of tariffs at different delivery voltage
levels.   A draft report on the economic costs of meeting demand was
presented to Government in January, 1987, and the report's recommendations
on tariff levels will be formulated after the consultants have analyzed
NEC's future revenue requirements. The findings of the report still have
to be reviewed by Government, NEC, USAID and IDA. During negotiations the
Goverument and NEC agreed to implement a new tariff structure in accordance
with the recommendations by January 1, 1988.
5.16      The missiou has estimated the average incremental cost of meeting
the forecast increase in demand on the Blue Nile Grid based on the
least-cost development program (paras. 6.07).   At the present official
exchange rate of LSd 2.5/US$, the average incremental coat is LSd 0.26
(10 USO)/kWh sold in early 1987 price terms, which is close to the present
tariff. However, Sudan's power development program is based predominantly
on imported capital goods and fuels, and thus the appropriate exchange rate
for setting tariffs under the present exchange rate regime is the
commercial rate for imports of goods and services used in the productive
sectors, namely LSd 4/US$. At this rate, the average tariff level to cover
economic costs would be LSd 0.38/kWh in early 1987 price terms based on the
analysis  In  the  USAID  draft  report  on  tariffs  (pare.  5.15).    The
projections of NEC's future fiuancial situation as shown in Annex 5.1 shows
that this level would be required by the start of FY92 to enable NEC to
meet the specified financial objectives (pare. 5.18).

Future Finaucial Operations and Position
5.17      The projected fluaucial statements of NEC for FY87 through FY94,
together with notes and assumptions used in these statements, are showu In
Annexes 5.1 through 5.4. Major fluancial indicators for selected years are
sbown in Table 5.3. These projectious are based on a number of assumptions
with respect to asset base, domestic inflation, currency exchange rates and
load growth, which are subject to considerable uncertainty (Annex 5.4). In
particular, assumptions with respect to future devaluations aud douestic
inflation reflect trends that may not prevail in the future.  Additional
adjustments may be needed if these projected values change (para. 5.20).
Projected balance sheets for the years ending June 30, 1987 through 1994
show that the current ratio during these years varies between 1.2 and 1.7
which are satisfactory values apart from the high ratio in the early years
reflecting the unusually large amounts tied up in accounts receivable. The
debt/equity ratio will increase steadily frou 44/56 in FY87 to 65/35 in
FY93, reflecting the need for increased borrowings as NEC's investmeut
expenditures increase up to FY93 and from then ou drawdowns on &oaus are
expected to be smaller than debt repayments resulting in a decrease iu the
debt equity ratio for FY94 to 62/38. The debt equity ratio is within an
acceptable range.

a/ NEC has decided to write-off in FY87 about LSd 37 million iu bad debt
which decreases the rate of return for that year from 9X (prior to the
write-off) to 71.
5.18        To ensure flnancial viability in the future, and to meet its
future operating costs, working capital and debt service requirements, as
well as fiuancing a reasonable part of its construction program from
internally generated funds, NRC will require timely government approval of
future tariff increases in addition to the measures agreed upon and
outlined in paras. 5.03, 5.05, 5.06, 5.14 aud in Annex 5.5. Based on the
financial projections and the assumptions shown in Annexes 5.1 through 5.4,
tariff increases in nominal terms would require to be implemented at the
rates of about 20%, 60%, 201, 15X, 151, 15% and 101 every year from PY88 to
FY94, respectively.   The large increase estimated for FY89 is mainly a
reflection of the need to provide funds for the local expenditures of NEC's
construction program which is expected to almost double in PY89 compared to



- 38 -
the previous year.   In addition, the tariff increases also reflect the
increasing requirements of funds for debt service.   After adjustment for
projected domestic inflation, the tariff increases, expressed in LSd/kWhl
would be on average about 6% p.a. between FY88 and FY94. Such increases in
constant terms are quite modest, given the heavy Livestment program.
Should there be delays in the rate of investment, the required tariff
increases would be lower.
5.19        The proposed tariff revisions, coupled with projected sales,
operating costs and capital investments, are expected to generate adequate
funds to meet the financial targets set out in para. 5.18 and to finance
about 20% of NEC's capital investments from internally generated funds in
FY88 and to produce rates of return on NEC's average revalued net fixed
assets of 10% in FY89 through FY94.   The projected operations of NEC
indicate that its future financial performance would be satisfactory with a
debt service coverage varying between 1.5 and 1.9 between FY88 and FY94.
Because these projected results are subject to considerable variations
given the uncertainties surrounding the projected macro-economic variables
and the future availability of foreign exchange to finance the large
investment program, NEC will need to review regularly the level of its
tariffs (para. 5.20).
5.20      Under Credlt 1624-SU, NEC's financial performauce is linked to a
9% rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets in operation.  In
view of the uncertainty of the value of NEC's assets base it is preferable
to monitor NEC's future financial performance to a cash generation zovenant
until NEC's fixed assets have been properly identified and valued.
Therefore, during negotiations, agreements were reached that: (1) NEC will
generate internally enough funds to finance 20% of Its capital investments
for FY88; (ii) NEC will earn a rate of return on revalued average net fixed
assets of no less than 10% for FY89 and thereafter; (iii) before March 31
each year NEC will review with IDA whether NEC will meet the requirements
set out in (i) and (ii) above in respect of such year; (iv) NEC will review
semi-aunually the adequacy of its tariffs and make recommendations to the
Government based on such reviews; and (v) in the event the semi-annual
review shows that the requirement set out in (i) and (ii) will not be met,
the Government will review NEC's tariffs and take appropriate action
thereon.
Proposed Financing Plan
5.21      A detailed funds flow statement for NEC is shown in Annex 5.2.  A
summary financing plan for FY87 through FY92 is shown in Table 5.4.
5.22          During the project period from FY87 through FY92, NEC's
construction program is expected to cost LSd 4960 million (US$753 million),
including interest during construction of LSd 475 million (US$70 million).
The proposed project represents about 14%, or LSd 664 million (US$101
million) of the total construction program.   Internal cash generatiou,
after covering debt service, interest on equity, deferred payments and
increases in working capital, will produce about 20% of the funds required
for construction expenditures during the FY87-FY92 period. Borrowings will
provide 80% (US$582 million) of NEC's total requirements of funds of which
38% (US$221 million) of total borrowing required has already been committed

(paras. 4.04-4.05). The 1X representing grants to the Government passed on
to NEC as equity contribution to help finance works currently under
construction is offset by the 1Z increase in cash during this period.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC MNALYSIS
General
6.01           The  economic evaluation  covers  three main aspects,  l.e.
determination of the least-cost expansion program for generation in the
BNG, calculation of the economic rate of return for the least-cost program,
and computation of an estimate for the average incremental cost of
supplying electricity in the BNG. The main assumptions for the economic
evaluation are shown in Annex 6.1.
Least-Cost Generation Expansion Program for BNG
6.02      Load and Generation Forecast.  The main component of the proposed
project is a capacity addition to meet increases in demand for power on the
BNG system.  The review of the load forecast and resulting capacity and
generation balances for the BNG show that supply deficits are expected to
start in 1989 even after commissioning the ongoing generation projects
i.e. 20 MW of diesel plant at Burri in FY88, 35 MW of hydro plant at
Roseires (seventh unit) in 1988, and the rehabilitation of units 1, 2 and 3
at Roseires and of small steam units at Burri between FY87 and FY89.
However, realistically, new capacity addition could not be commissioned
before the dry season of FY91. In consequence, the least cost development
program reviewed during project appraisal covers the period m l-FY2001.
The load forecast is discussed in detail in Chapter III.
6.03      Alternative Expansion Programs.  A range of thermal programs were
analyzed by -consultants EP 5/ consisting of oil-fired steam units
low-speed  diesels  and  gas  turbines.    The  consultants  also  analyzed
steam/gas turbine combined-cycle options, although these would involve
introduction of a new technology to the system. The studies of BP show
that only the options containing steam units and low-speed diesels are
worth considering for detailed review. Their final recommendation is that
either two 60 MW units or two 45 MW units should be installed at Khartoum
North by 1991.   During appraisal, the most relevant capacity expansion
options were reviewed in detail by IDA to take into account revisions to
the load forecast and updated cost estimates and equipment life,and other
parameters,  for  the  various  options,  including  later  oil  price
projections. The various planting programs and cases analyzed are shown in
Annex 6.1.
6.04        Least-Cost Analysis.  The criterion selected for the economic
evaluation is the present value of total costs of meeting demand up to the
forecast level during the period FY87 through FY2001, discounted at 12Z,
the estimated oportunity cost of capital for Sudan.  Annual cost streams
were developed for the period 1989-2015 and residual values substracted at
the end of the period. The least-cost expansion analysis carried out at
appraisal confirmed the conclusion of the consultants that the next
capacity expansion in the least-cost expansion program should be the
addition of oil-fueled thermal capacity at Khartouu North. The analysis
show that there is little difference in the net present value economic cost

between planting programs containing two units of 45 MW or two units of
60 MW as the initial capacity addition.   The results of the least-cost
analysis is sbown in detall in a uumber of computer printouts similar to
the one shown in Annex 6.2.   The results are summarized in Table 6.1.
Capacity and energy balances for the month of April (critical Aonth) are
shown in Annex 6.3 for the period FY87-PY96 for Planting Programs 1 and 4.

6.06       Economic Rate of Return for the BNG Program.  The economic rate
of return of the least-cost expansion program is the discount rate at which
the present value of all costs of the program, including capital, operation
and maintenance and fuel costs equals the present value of the incremental
benefits from the program.   Costs are economic values based on the same
assumptions used to derive the least-cost generation program and the
transmission and distribution program. Average tariff yield has been used
as a measure of the value of the benefits from the program, although it is
recognized that this method understates consumers' willingness to pay and
therefore, an element of consumer surplus is not included in the benefits.
11/ Details on the computation of the economic rate of return are included
in a number of computer printouts similar to the one shown in Annex 6.4.
The results are summarized in Table 6.1. The equalizing rate is estimated
to be about 20%. A sensitivity analysis of the economic rate of return to
fuel oil prices, investment cost levels and demand growth is summarized in
Table 6.3.

6.07      Average Incremental Cost of Electricity.  A rough estimate of the
incremental  cost of  electricity was  calculated  as  the  ratio of  the
discounted  value  of  total  annual  incremental  costs  of  supplying
electricity to the discounted value of annual incremental generation. The
value  obtained  for  an  'all  thermal"  least-cost  program  is  about
LSd 0.26/kWh at 12% discount rate expressed in end 1986 price level. This
value suggests that average tariff levels in Sudan are presently generally
in line with the incremental cost of supplying electricity.   The values
obtained for the various cases analyzed are shown in Table 6.4.

least LSdO.40/kWh.

ProJect Risks
6.08        The implementation of the physical components of the proposed
project does not involve risk beyond that normally associated with the
construction of medium-size steam power plants, such as the expansion of
Khartoum North. In this case, risks would be small in view that NBC has
implemented successfully a similar power plant under the Power III Project
with the assistance of competent consultants. The same consultants have
been selected by NEC to provide assistance for the proposed project.
However, NBC's chances to achieve sustained financial viability and
institutional improvement may be endangered by political pressures for
restricting price increases in the future, or by NBC's failure to achieve
planned loss reduction, improved billing and collection, as a consequence
of managerial weakness.

Energy Resources
Household Fuels
1.            Biomass fuels (woodfuel, charcoal and agricultural wastes)
a8ccount for about 802 of total energy consumption. The available forestry
resource is unevenly allocated between the Northern (30X) and Southern
(70X)  regions.    However,  about  802  of  the  country's  population  is
concentrated in the Northern region.   The annual allowable cut from the
national forest resource is about 60% of estimated annual consumption.
Overcutting and land clearance for mechanized farming schemes contribute to
the increasing deficit between demand and sustainable supply. The problem
is particularly acute around main towns, where denudation of forests has
occurred.   Fuelwood will continue to be the most important energy source
for Sudan and more managerial effort and a higher budgetary allocation are
required for its preservation. A Forestry Sector Review was carried out at
the request of the Government of Sudan (GOS) in 1984/85 by the World Bank,
UNDP/FAO, CIDA, USAID, Dutch, West Germany and UK, bilateral aid and CARE
with the purpose of assisting GOS in developing alternative fuelwood
strategies  for the forestry  sector.    Consequently,  the Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) for the proposed Sudan Fuelwood/
Forestry Project addresses: (a) strengthening of the institutional
capabilities of the Central Forest Administration (CFA) and woodfuel
related aspects of the National Energy Administration (NA) and their
agencies; (b) introduction of incentives and mechanisms to strengthen
participation of the private sector; (c) conserving woodfuels by improving
charcoal production and fuelwood/charcoal utilization efficiency; (d)
regulating forest clearance activities under mechanized farming schemes to
retain sufficient forest cover and providing incentives to convert cleared
woody biomass into charcoal; (e) increasing the area of woodlands under
protection and managemnet; and (f) increasing woodfuel supplies through
pilot-level operations in tree-planting and afforestation.

2             A study on wind energy conducted under the NBA showed the
potential areas for application to be the Donglu, Western Sudan and Red Sea
areas. Funds are required to implement proposals for pilot windmills to be
used in pumping for the northern part of the Nile and for wells in remote
Western areas. The idea of connecting wind generated power to the national
grid has also been suggested, although its economic viability has not been
confirmed.   NEA is also looking for funds to make feasibility studies of
hybrid solar systems for pumping (sun and wind).
Biogas and Biomass
3.           Small scale activities to alleviate scarcity in traditional
energy supplies have increased in the last few years.   NSA has been
experimenting since 1983 with biogas technology for supplying household
energy on the Indian and Chinese models in various parts of Sudan. Sudan
produces considerable quantities of vegetable wastes in the form of
molasses, bagasse and cotton stalks.   Potential output of molasses from

existing sugar complexes is about 250,000 mtpa and a consultant's study has
recommended that this resource be used to produce substantial quantities of
etbanol  f or  blending  with  gasoline  for  domestic  consumption.    The
possibility for supplying electricity to the public power system generated
from surplus bagasse is under consideration. Briquetted cotton stalks and
groundnuts are also a potential source of fuel; funds beyond those earlier
supplied by DANIDA are required for further pilot efforts. Cotton stalks
are also being experimented with French assistance, to be used for
gasifiers (instead of pure gas oil) for fuelling irrigation pumps In the
Blue and While Nile Agricultural Cooperations.
Hydrocarbon Resources
4         Exploration for oil in the interior of Sudan has been proceeding
since the mid-1970s by Chevron (USA), who, of three companies with
exploration and production agreements in Sudan, first discovered oil in
1979. Although many of the exploratory wells have indicated the presence
of oil, to date only one discovery seems to be of commercial interest.
Reliable estimates of the size of recoverable reserves are not available,
but the latest estimate is at least 250-300 million barrels which are
present in ten separate reservoirs. Chevron's operations are currently at
a standstill, partly because of insecurity in Southern Sudan (Unity Field)
where they are operating and partly because of insecurity in the absence of
a well-defined government policy towards private oil companies. Chevron is
estimated to have spent over one US billion so far; the Sun oil company
has spent USSO million on unsuccessful exploration. Total's investment so
far is not known, and it has postponed exploration commitments awaiting
clarification of government policy.   Preliminary survey work has been
carried out also in other sedimentary basins.   The Sudanese crude oil
(Unity) is very waxy with a paraffin base, and it has a high pour point of
801F that makes handling difficult. The oil has a low sulfur content and
excellent lube qualities, but there is no dissolved gas in the oil.  The
Government of Sudan (GOS) has decided to abandon the export pipeline to the
Red Sea coast from the Unity field previously agreed with Chevron. GPC is
consequently considering the building of an inland refinery.   However
appropriate evaluation of such a scheme against alternative options is
lacking.
1.12      Off-shore survey and exploration activity in the Red Sea has been
going on for over two decades without major success to date.  Interest in
this area has been stimulated subsequently by re-interpretation of the
seismic survey and well test data, which indicates that it might contain
reserves of between 130 and 385 billion cubic feet of gas and up to 30
million barrels of condensate.  The discovered gas has a high calorific
content (1,300 BTU per cu.ft.) and no sulfur, which are excellent
generation and for production of fertilizers are included in the Petroleum
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1513-SU).
Hydropower Resources
5          The ultimate hydropower potential of Sudan exceeds 2,000 NW, of
which only 240 KW is being utilized.  The constraints on development of
hydropower resources in the Sudan are the high investment cost required to



- 48 -
Annex 1.1
Page 3 of 3
realize the hydropower potential of the Nlle River which has a gentle
gradient, the possible alternative use for irrigation and seasonal
limitations on firm power capacity. The characteristics of the Blue Nile
and the Main Nile give rise to two critical conditions in determining
potential hydropower output.   Firstly, water availability during the dry
season (March-May) limits the amount of energy that can be generated.
Secondly, the low reservoir levels during the early part of the flood
season combined with high downstream water levels resulting from large
flood flows severely reduce the head available for power generation. The
net result is that the maximum power output from a hydropower plant falls
usually to less than half the Installed capacity at the height of the flood
season. Further development of the Blue Nile river potential at existing
dams is limited to the addition of generation capacity at Roseires and
Sennar power stations.    However,  such additions would not contribute
significantly to the firm capacities of these stations due to the
hydrological characteristics of the river. The potential to increase the
generation at both stations by raising the maximum reservoir retention
level through heightening the existing Roseires dam has been studied by
Gibb (UK) under flnancing provided under the Power III Project (Credit
1006-BU).  The evaluation shows an economic rate of return of up to 1O0
against thermsl generation alternatives and at current projections for
agricultural  commodity  prices,  prospective  irrigation  benefits  for
heightening are considerably less than power benefits. Whether heightening
Roseires forms part of Sudan's least cost power development program, taking
account of other power options,   (Merowe hydro, natural gas, indigenous
crude oil as well as thermal) can only be determined from the prospective
update of the least cost development program funded under Credit 1624-SU.
Development of additional hydropower generation will be costly and requires
a long lead time to develop. The most promising locations are the major
cataracts along the Main Nile, with potential capacities in the range of
100 to 750 MW. Studies of these projects beyond the prefeasibility stage
are still to be made. Preliminary evaluation of this potential indicates
that the Merowe site (600-750 MW) is the most attractive, and Its
development  by  the  mid' 19909  could  be  economically  justified.    A
prefeasibility study has been carried out by consultants SWECO (Sweden),
financed by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), which
examines the timing, capacity and development stages of this site.   A
feasibility study is included in the Power Rehabilitation Credit (Credit
1624-SU). Apart from the Main Nile, southern Sudan is the only other area
in the country where major new hydropower projects might be developed. On
the While Nile between Nimule and Juba the heads available are suitable for
an installation of about 400 MW.   However,  the principal drawback to
development in this area is its remoteness from major load centers capable
of absorbing the output from these schemes.
6               Mini-Lydro.   A pilot project for the construction and
installation of a IMW power unit, associated civil works and an associated
transmission line is in process in Eastern Equatoria funded by Norwegian
Church Aid.

TERMS OF REFERENCE POR
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY
1.0  BACKGROM
Two power stations are located in the imediate vicinity of
the conurbation comprising Khartoum,North Khartoum and Omdurman.
Khartoum North steam turbine power station output is currently
66 MW and this ..s being expanded to 156 MW.  Burri, on the Blue
Nile is a 50 MW (installed capacity 70 MW) diesel station, with
some steam turbine generation. Additional generating capacity
of 65 MW comes from six diesel oil fired pas turbines: three at
Kilo 10 (130 MW), two at Kuku (20 MW) and one at Burri (15 MW).
The population of the conurbation, over 1 million persons, is
densely concentrated around the confluence of the Blue Nile
and the White Nile. Three of the potable water works serving
the population am just downstream of Burri.
Pollution is widespread, sourcing also from the light industry
in the area, from sewage, from airport heat and dust, and from
the many refuse tips and the custom of refuse burning. It is
considered however that every effort must be made to contain the
pollution sourcing from the power sector.
2.0   OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the environmental study are to identify the
power generation strategies which, while meeting the aims of the
National Electricity Corporation, will minimise pollution within
the Urban area and to prepare a cost benefit analysis for the
strategy producing the lowest pollution.
3.0  SCOPE OP STUDY
In order to achieve the stated objectives the work indicated
below daU be undertaken on atmospheric, water and waste pollution
attributable to the existing power generation facilities and
shall take account of the planned extension to Khartoum North.



- 60 -
3.1      At*ogph ric Er issions
The amouats and types of stack emissions from the power generation
facilities at Khartoum North, Kuku, Kilo IQ and Burri are to be
examined. Historic meteorological data is particularly good for
the area and a modelling study is recomeanded to take account of
existing and future pollution sources. Data should be used to model
peak one hour and annual average pollutant concentration isopleths.
Cosent must be ade on the potential adverse  ffects of these
pollutant concentrations takingSinto account potential enbanced
effects due to smoke from rubbish incinerators and vehiele
emissions within the Khartoum Urban area. Photochemical effects
are not to be considered.
Consideration should be given to supporting the above by direct
ground level sampling for NO, and 802 over a limited period. This
vould be Ln line with the EEC Air Quality Directive, Sampling
locations for a possible monitoring programe would be determined
by preliminary desk study for sources and locations of gross
pollution.
3.1.1    Fugitive Emissions
The potential sources and quantities of fugitive missions need
to be examined and appropriate measures indicated for their
reductioL.
3.2      Aqueous Discharges
The following tasks require to be undertaken:
3.2.1    Cooling Water Discharge and Effluent
Examine the quantities and qualities of waste water discharged
to the Nile at each site. Assess suitability of chemical and
bactoriological quality using current acceptable standards.
Examine the effluent collection and treatment facilities at
each site and comment on the capability of the plant to ensure
quality concrol and to meet recognised international standards.
Indicate any additional treatwent plant required to meet these standards.



61 -
Assess the probable impact of the aqueous discharges from each
site taking account of the following:
a)    the location of intakes to potable water treatment plants;
b)    the variation in river flow rates throughout the year;
c)    dispersion at outfall;
d)    hydrological mixing zones;
e)    riverine life;
f)    local amenities.
3.2.2   Storuwater
Examine quantity, quality and disposal system for stormwater
drainage and whether these are appropriate to local hydrological
environment.
3.3 Acoustxc Pollution
Examine sources of noise and their present and potential levels.
Estimate noise dispersion and acceptability or otherwise of
noise levels as judged against current standards.
3.4 Hazard
Environmental monitoring procedures and integral safety procedures
shall be re-assessed, and the following tasks undertaken:
3.4.1   Transport
Examine the method used to transport fuel, chemicals and other
consumables to each site. List the hazards involved and outline
the procedures necessary to minimise the consequences of a
spillage.
3.4.2 Storage
Examine the fuel and chemical storage at.each site. Outline
the methods installed to deal with spillages and fires and
coment on any improvements required.



- 62 -
3.4.3 Major Incidents
Comment on the consequences of a major incident at each site
outlining:
a) the potential effects on the surrounding community;
b)    the emissions to atmosphere;
c)    the potential discharges to the Nile.
3.5 Strategy
Prepare an environmental strategy which will minimise environmental
impact including maximising the generation at the sites causing
the least aquatic and atmospheric pollution. The strategy is
to take account of plant maintenance and operator training
requirements. The option of decommissioning the steam turbine
facilities at Burri following the completion of Khartoum North
Phase 1I is to be examined.
3.6 Training
The study shall include comments on the training required to
ensure the current implementation of normal operation and
emergency routines procedures to minimise polution.
3.7 Cost Benefit Analysis
The study shall include cost benefit analysis for the strategy
producing the lowest pollution.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Sales and Revenues
1.       NEC's energy projections appear in Annex 5.1.  Revenues are based
on yearly tariff Increases of 241, 571, 191, 141, 141, 142 and 12X
implemented in FY88 to FY94, respectively.
Fuel Costs
2.         Estimated total requirements of fuel for energy generation is
assumed to Increase with the installation of new plants, and the following
fuel consumption forecast was prepared:
(Thousand tons)   FY87  FY88  FY89  PY90  FY91  FY92  FY93  FY94
Fuel oil           108    130    150    151    201    235    276      322
Gas oil              7     17    32      45      9      1       1       1
Total              115   T170    Ti7   195    iW0   13s       1T7 7
The current fuel oil prices were used for FY87 and adjusted to their
economic cost in FY88.  Provision for International price escalation was
made and converted to Sudanese pounds at variable exchange rates (para. 6).
Other Operating Costs
3.           NBC's personnel cost has been increased by half the local
inflation up to FY90 in- view of the present large overstaffing at most
levels.  From FY90 onwards, personnell cost has been adjusted for full
inflation. Repairs and maintenance have been calculated at an average of
1.51 based on the preceding years' gross revalued assets. Other costs have
been adjusted for local inflation.
Depreciation
4.         Depreciation has been charged at 31 of the revalued gross fixed
assets value up to FY88 and 3.5% therafter. The increase is due to NBC's
additions of thermal stations to its total installed capacity and
construction of more distribution and transmission lines which have shorter
lifes.
Interest on captial
5.           The "interest on capital' has been calculated at 52 on the
equity capital balance at the start of each financial year, excluding
reserve for revaluation and foreign exchange losses.

ANNEX 5.4
Page 2 of 3
Fixed Assets
6.         Fixed assets and accumulated depreciation have been adjusted to
reflect estimated replacemnt values based on forelgn components of 851 and
a local component of 15 and the following estimated International and
local inflation and exchange rates:
Year ending June 30:       1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994
Domestic Infl. (2)          35    25    20    15      7    3.5   3.5   3.5
International Infl. (2)    7.5   2.0   1.0   1.0   2.25  3.5   3.5   3.5

It should be noted that the assumptions regarding devaluations are based on
historical trends which may not reflect actual changes in the future.
Current Assets
7.        Improveament in NEC's billing and collection is assumed to reduce
the accounts receivable to 90 days of sales at the end of FY88, to 75 days
at the end of FY90, to 60 days at the and of FY92 and thereafter.   For
FY87, about LSd 77 million of the accounts receivable caused by residential
consumers is assuaed to be paid over a 2-3 year period and has been moved
out of current assets to "accounts with others".  About LSd 37 million has
been assumed to be written off in FY87 Which relates to accotats receivable
caused by residential consumers and estimated to be uncollectable.
Inventories are calculated at 31 of gross revalued plant in operation in
accordance with past experience. Accounts with others are expected to be
fully recovered by end FY91.
Current Liabilities
8.         NEC's liquidity position would improve as a result of declining
accounts receivable position.   Hence accounts payable are expected to
decrease to 60 days of NEC's operating expenses in FY88 excluding salaries
and depreciation. Other payables bave been assumed to be mwstly retention
money on local contracts.   They have been estimated  at  21 of NEC's
investment cost.
Deferred Pamnts
9.         Deferred payments represent overdue debt service payments, fuel
cost and some investament costs which the Government has in the past paid on
NEC's behalf.   These deferred payments are expected to be repaid by end
FY92.
Long Term Debt
10.         The future forelgn exchange debt, including the proposed IDA
credit, iuld arise from rants and credit to the Government and onlent to



- 74 -
ANNEX 5.4

NBC to finance the foreign exchange cost of its investment program. The
proceeds of future grants and credits, including the proposed IDA credit,
are assumed to be onlent to NEC at 7.92X annual Interest (the present Bank
rate), and are assumed to be repayable in 20 years, including 3 to 5 years
grace, with NEC taking the foreign exchange risk.
Grants
11.         Future grants include those already obtained from Finland and
Italy to flnance the foreign exchange costs of the construction of a
gasturblne in Khartoum and transmission lines and substations to connect
the Eastern grid with the Blue Nile grid. These works are already under
construction.

Power IV Project
Assumption for Economic Evaluation of BNG Expansion Program
General
1.           The main assumptions for economic analysis are detailed in
Attachment I to 3.  All costs are expressed in end 1986 price level.  The
rate of exchange adopted is 2.5 LSd/US$, the rate prevailing at end 1986.
For the determination of economic costs, a standard conversion factor of
0.75 was used.
Least-Cost Analysis
2.           The Planting programs analysed and cases considered for the
sensitivity analysis are described in Attachment 2.
3.         Planting program '0' assumes that no further capacity expansion
takes place other than that of the ongoing or committed projects by the end
of 1986.  Given the uncertainty of the relative merits and timing of the
Merowe Dam and the Roseires Dam Heightening, no attempt was done at this
stage to determine which of these projects should be implemented first.
Programs 1,2 and 4, correspond to capacity expansions required to serve the
demand in the period FY91 (April 1991)-FYOI (April 2001), installing
respectively 60 MV units, 15 KW low-speed diesel groups and 45 KW units as
next capacity addition t serve expected demand in the period FY91-FY92.
Program 3 is an 'all thermal' program.
4.        The assumptions relating to investments and fuel consumption are
the same as used by the consultants 5/ and are reasonable.   The fuel
consumption assumed for low-speed diesels in the base case is relatively
high reflecting actual figures that would occur in Sudan, and are based on
actual  consumption  for  similar  installations  commissioned  recently.
However, a sensitivity analysis to a lower unit consumption of less than
200 gr/kWh shows that the merit order of the planting programs recomend
remains unchanged (Chapter 6, Table 6.1).
5.          The various planting programs analysed were designed to meet
monthly demand in the period FY91-FYO1 assuming that:
(i)  in Dry year, (probability of occurrence of I in 10 years) the
total available capacity at 90t reliability should be equal or
higher than the system peak demand plus the capacity of the
largest unit in the system.  In the Jry season of the dry year
the energy limitation balance is verified taking into account the
largest thermal set on the system; and
(ii)  in the average hydrological year criterion, the system capacity
is selected to be equal or higher than the system's maximum
demand plus the capacity of the largest unit in the system.

Finally an energy check is also carried out for the dry season in
average hydrological year.
6.          Capacity and energy balances for the month of April (critical
month during dry season) for programs 1 and 4 are shown in Attachment 4.
Economic Rate of Return
7.         The main assumptions for the calculation of the economic rate of
return, are shown directly on Attachment 4 and can be summarized as
follows:
(i) cost and benefits are those incurred and obtained by meeting
forecasted demand in the period 1987-2001 and are discounted in
the period 1987-2015;
(ii) generation costs, including investment, operation and maintenance
and fuel, are the same economic values used for or obtained from
the least-cost analysis;
5iii) transmission and distribution costs for the period 1987-1995 are
economic   costs   corresponding   to  NEC's   transmission   and
distribution  investments  for  that  period.       However,  such
investments are rather high and reflect a heavy program which
takes into account a backlog of investments required but not done
in the past. In consequence, for transmission and distribution
investments in the period FY96-FY01, economic costs were
calculated at 300 US$/kW based on annual increments of the
system's maximum demand. This figure appears reasonable, in view
that investments in that category will require more distribution
than transmission.
7.          A sensitivity analysis was carried out for fuel price levels
between 0.9 and 1.5 times the reference price (Chapter 6, Table 6.2).
8.        Fuel prices were assumed as follows in December 1986 prices
FY           87    88    89    90    91    92    93    94    95
US$/bbl     18.0  18.5  19.0  20.0  20.5  21.0  21.5  22.0  22.Q
Heavy fuel oil and diesel oil prices were estimated at 0.80% and 125Z of
crude oil prices, respectively.
Average Incremental Cost of Suergy
9.          The average economic incremental cost of supplying energy is
calculated as the ratio of discounted incremental costs to incremental
energy in the period FY87-FY01 using a standard conversion fa^tor of 0.75
and a rate of exchange of 2.5 LSd/US$.
