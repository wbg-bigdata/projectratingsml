MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SUDAN
FOR THE POWER IV PROJECT
1.         The following report on a proposed development credit to Sudan
for SDR 30.1 million (US$ 38.0 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval.   The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms.   US$37.5
million would be onlent to NEC at 7.92% for a term of 20 years, including a
5-year grace period and would help finance the power components of the
project.   NEC will bear the foreign exchange risk.  The remaining US$0.5
million would be passed on to NEA on a grant basis to help finance energy
technical assistance.  A Credit Agreement between the Government of Sudan
and ADF has been signed on November 28, 1986 for US$43.5 million
equivalent, of which US$35.9 million equivalent will be for cofinancing the
expansion of Khartoum North included in the proposed project. The terms of
the ADF credit are 40 years repayment period after 10 years of grace, 0.75%
interest.  On-lending terms to NEC are 20 years repayment period including
5 years of grace,  and 9% interest.   The Government bears the foreign
exchange risk.
2.            Background.   Sudan's main indigenous energy resources are
forests, crude oil, natural gas and hydropower. Although exploration for
hydrocarbons has shown the existence of oil, further exploration and
exploitation by foreign investors is held back by civil disturbances in the
South.   Gas discoveries in the Red Sea are encouraging.   The ultimate
hydropower potential of Sudan exceeds 2,000 MW, of which only about 240 MW
are being utilized.   Its development is constrained by high investment
costs related to the river's gentle gradient, the priority of water use for
irrigation, and the impact of large seasonal river flow variations on firm
hydropower capacity. Forests are unevenly distributed between the Northern
and Southern regions in inverse proportion to population distribution, and
consumption of fuelwood is about 60% over sustainable supply.   Fuelwood
continues to be Sudan's most important energy resource, with agricultural
clearing and urban demand causing denudation of forest at considerable
distances from main towns.   Some progress has been achieved in long-term
energy  planning  but  the  Government's  planning  framework needs  to be
strengthened to enable it to focus on an action-oriented and integrated
development program for the energy sector.
3.             Because the hydropower resources that can be economically
developed are limited and because firm  capacity requires  that varying
seasonal hydro generation be complemented with thermal generation. Sudan's
electricity supply is largely dependent on thermal power plants burning
imported oil. However, Sudan's serious shortage of foreign exchange led to
less investment in new facilities and insufficient maintenance of existing
plant than required to ensure adequate and reliable supply of electricity.
As a result, electricity demand has not been fully satisfied, and rationing
has already had a negative impact on productive and residential sectors.
Shortages of power supply became chronic during the early 1980s but, after
the commissioning of new facilities and rehabilitation of existing ones
included in the Power III project (Credit 1006-SU), reliability of supply
started to improve, and is expected to improve further once the componenls



-2-
of the Power Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1624-SU) are completed during
1988-89. Although these two projects have provided substantial support to
the power subsector, this has been insufficient to cope with past
suppressed demand and moderate consumption growth.   Even under present
economic conditions and civil war in the South, this moderate growth is
expected to continue.    Hence,  to avoid drastic  rationing,  additional
capacity is required by 1991.
4.        National Electricity Corporation (NEC), a parastatal corporation,
is responsible for power operations  covering the Khartoum,  Blue Nile,                 v
Damazin and Eastern areas of Sudan, which represent about 95% of power
operations in the country. Under the ongoing projects, some of NEC's key
constraints, in the areas of manpower capacity, salary levels and
operational efficiency, have been removed with IDA's and other donors'
support.   However, serious problems such as unsatisfactory billing and
collection, accounting and auditing, as well as lack of discipline
throughout the Corporation and weak management of operations, still
remain. National Energy Administration (NEA) is the planning organ of the
Ministry of Energy and Mining (HEM), responsible for energy planning and
energy policy formulation, and needs further strengthening in its
management and capability for evaluating policy options.  Assistance will
be provided under the proposed project to address these issues.
5.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives are to provide
additional  generation  capacity  to  meet  projected  demand  in  the
interconnected Blue Nile and Eastern Grids by 1991.  It would also assist
NEC, particularly in the areas of management, finance and power expansion
planning, in attaining sustained institutional improvements, thereby
meeting its corporate objectives.   Finally, the project would help the
Government through technical assistance to NEA to improve energy planning
and policy formulation.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project consists of:
(a) provision and installation of two oil-fueled steam thermal generating
units of between 45 MW and 60 NW each, at the existing Khartoum North power
plant (final capacity to be determined on the outcome of alternative bids,
as either option could be the least-cost solution); (b) technical
assistance, training and equipment and materials for NEC's organizational
and staff development; (c) provision of consulting services for an
Environmental Study, to review the impact of present and planned thermal
generation on the Khartoum area, and for a Study of Load Characteristics
and Patterns of Consumption by Consumer Category and Analysis of Technical
and Other Losses; and (d) technical assistance for NEA for energy planning,
studies and for institutional development.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  In accordance with IDA's country
assistance strategy, the project supports infrastructure essential to
production and public enterprise reform.   IDA's assistance has become
crucial to ensure continuation of NEC's institutional reform, because most
other donors are concentrating their support in other sectors.
8.        Agreed Actions.  To achieve project objectives, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that: (i) NEC will prepare by December 31, 1987 a
Plan of Action with targets acceptable to IDA to increase productivity
levels annually and to improve staff efficiency, and then implement them;



-3-
(ii)   Government, its departments and non-revenue earning agencies will
reduce their outstanding electricity bills with NEC to 90 days of billing
by September 30, 1987 and NEC will reduce its total accounts receivable to
90 days billing by June 30, 1988, to 75 days by June 30, 1990, and to 60
days by June 30, 1992; (iii) Government will undertake quarterly reviews
and settlements, acceptable to IDA, of the outstanding electricity bills of
its departments and non-revenue earning agencies; (iv)   NEC will finance
from internally generated funds 20% of its investment expenditures in FY88
and, after the assets have been revalued, earn a rate of return on fixed
revalued assets in operation of 10% in FY89 and thereafter.   For this
purpose, NEC will review the adequacy of its tariffs bi-annually and
Government will cause NEC to increase its tariffs as needed; (v) NEC will
establish an asset register and replacement value of its assets by March
31, 1988, and revalue its assets yearly thereafter; (vi) NEC shall review
and agree annually by March 31, with the Government and IDA its investment
program, will not undertake any investments not included in its program in
excess of US$10 million or 1.5Z of its gross revalued assets in operation
unless such investment is economically and technically justified; (vii)
Government will prepare by December 31, 1988, a plan outlining actions for
securing reliable fuel transportation to supply the Khartoum area power
plants before commissioning of power facilities under the project.  Prior
to credit effectiveness, NEC shall appoint a Senior Director of Finance and
a Senior Director of Planning.
9.       Justification.  The proposed project would relieve a Leavy
constraint on production increases in agriculture and manufacturing in the
early 90's. As part of the least-cost expansion plan, the thermal capacity
addition is needed to complement installed hydropower as this is subject to
sharp  seasonal  fluctuations.    There  are  no  further  investments  in
rehabilitation which would substantially reduce the need for additional
power capacity. The project is the next least-cost power investment over a
wide range of assumptions and has an economic rate of return of about 20%.
10.       Risks.  The physical works consist of the routine construction of
a medium-size steam power plant in Khartoum North which does not involve
any adverse environmental impact. Since NEC has successfully implemented a
similar power plant under the Power III project with the assistance of
competent consultants, and the same consultants have been selected by NEC
for the proposed project, the risk related to this component is small.
However, NEC's chances to achieve sustained financial viability and
institutional improvement may be affected by political pressures to
constrain future price increases, and by NEC's managerial weakness.  These
risks are, however, within acceptable limits as NEC has a satisfactory
record of effecting substantial tariff measures, and adhering to financial
targets under ongoing IDA power operations. Moreover, the project includes
detailed measures to strengthen and support NEC's financial and managerial
performance.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
