MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A WATER SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of Ghana (GOG) for SDR 19.3 million
(US$25 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years matuxrity and would help
finance a water sector rehabilitation project.  The project would be
cofinanced by the Government of Austria for SDR 15.0 million (US$19.5
million equivalent), ODA (UK) for SDR 11.2 (US$14.6 million equivalent) and
other donors to be confirmed.
2.        Backzround.  The Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC) is
responsible for potable water supply and sewerage services throughout
Ghana. It is operationally divided into ten regions one of which, the
region covering Accra and Tema, is dominant providing some 502 of total
revenues. The rapid decline of the national economy between the years 1978
and 1982 created a very difficult situation in GWSC. There was a depletion
of professional staff; regular servicing and maintenance of facilities was
severely hampered by shortages of spare parts, materials and funds for the
purchase of fuel and other consumables. Coupled with the normal aging of
facilities, this resulted in many of the water supply systems in towns and
villages throughout the country becoming inoperative and almost all other
systems operating below their design capacity. Long delays by Government
in approving needed tariff increases were also a significant factor which
contributed to the deterioration of GWSC's ability to meet demands for
public water supply. Concurrent with the recovery of the national economy,
GWSC is now in the process of recovering its organizational and financial
capacities and restoring adequate water supplies to its consumers. At a
water supply and sanitation conference held in Accra in September 1987,
GWSC presented a five-year rehabilitation and development plan. the focus
of which is restoring water services in urban and semi-urban areas and
improving water supply services in rural areas.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's past involvement with GWSC
(three projects since 1969) places it in a suitable position to act as a
catalyst in assembling a 'Tell-conceived investment package, coordinating
donor involvement and influencing sector policies and institutional
development.  Rehabilitation of existing assets and making full use of
existing investments is consistent with the Government's Structural
Adjustment Program. Institutional support to GWSC will help strengthen one
of the key parastatal organizations singled out for monitoring by the State
Enterprise Commission within the framework of the Structural Adjustment
Program. Moreover, consolidating donor activities will facilitate the
efficient management of GWSC's investment program.

4.        Prolect Obiectives.  'The proposed project would continue the
ongoing sector reforms started under the Technical Assistance and
Rehabilitation Project, Credit 1342-GH, by assisting the Government to
strengthen the water and sewerage sector entity, GWSC. to enable it to more
effectively administer the sector. In specific terms, the project would
aim to: (i) stringthen the managerial, financial and technical capabilities
of GWSC both at headquarters and in the regions to enable it to effectively
plan and implement a meaningful development program; (ii) improve GWSC's
operating and maintenance ability; and (iii) improve GWSC's financial
performance so that it may function as a viable institution. The project
would also assist GWSC to: (i) reduce the levels of non-revenue earning
water; (ii) increase the output of existing water systems by replacement of
plant and equipment and by general system rehabilitation; and (iii) provide
for the expansion of some systems and completion of others to further
increase water availability.
5.        Proiect Description.  The project would comprise rehabilitation
and high priority expansion of existing water supply systems, as well as
institutional development. It would complement rehabilitation works being
financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Italian Government,
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and Overseas Development
Administration (UK) in the major urban centers of Accra-Tema, Sekondi-
T-akoradi, Cape Coast and Kumasi. Project components would include: (a)
institutional support including technical assistance, studies, training,
workshop facilities and spare parts, vehicles, computers, communication
equipment and staff housing; (b) a manpower improvement program comprising
recruitment, redeployment and training of GWSC staff; and (c)
rehabilitationlexpansion of 37 systems in urban and semi-urban areas
including nine regional capitals (the system serving the tenth regional
capital, the Accra-Tema system, is being addressed under a separate project
financed by the AfDB and Italy). The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$125 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$85.1 million (68Z of total cost). A project cost summary and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Project procurement arrangements
and IDA Credit disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the location
of water systems to be improved under the project and the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 7598-GH dated May 18, 1989 are attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with the Government
and GWSC to: (a) implement a major staff recruitment and retrenchment
program; (b) restructure the capital of GWSC; (c) adjust tariffs regularly
to levels sufficient for GWSC to fully meet cash operating costs and debt
service and to finance a significant part of its investment program from
internally generated funds; (d) submit annually to IDA for review GWSC's
rolling corporate plan and draft performance contract and regularly monitor
GWSC's performance against agreed monitoring indicators; and (e) limit
other investments during the project implementation period to those the
viability of which has been established through appropriate feasibility
studies. Conditions of credit effectiveness include implementation of the
first phase of GWSC's manpower improvement program, execution of onlending
and co-financing agreements and effectiveness of GWSC's capital
restructuring program.

7.        Benefits.  An adequate and reliable public water supply is
essential to maintaining the health and welfare of the people and to
supporting Ghuna's economic recovery. By rehabilitating existing plant and
equipment and improving operational efficiency, the proposed project will
improve water supply in many areas throughout the country. Ins. itutional
strengthenir, will enlance GWSC's ability to finance and implement needed
investments as well as to effectively operate and maintain the
rehabilitated systems. The internal economic rate of return is estimated
to be 152, which is satisfactory.
8.        Risks.  Possible risks relate to GWSC's ability to generate
sufficient internal cash flow to contribute the required counterpart funds
and the capability of GWSC to satisfactorily implement a project of this
size. However, project components to reduce the level of non-revenue
producing water, improve financial management at the regional '-vel and
substantially strengthen GWSC's Project and Construction Management Unit
effectively mitigate these risks.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
