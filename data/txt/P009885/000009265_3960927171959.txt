Economic Benefits:        The proposed project investments have high economic
returns because they are largely expansion and de-
bottlenecking of existing facilities. Project
benefits would come from: (i) producing basic
petrochemicals and derivatives at economically
competitive costs to meet India's growing demand;
(ii) introduction and production of durable, high-
value engineering plastics; (iii) modernization and
improvement in the technology base of the plastic
processing industry, resulting in improved product
design quality; and (iv) the expansion of the
market for new products through improved
availability of raw material supply to plastic
processc-s. The project's output would substitute
for imports of plastic polymers and derivatives,
saving foreign exchange and stimulating downstream
industrial expansion and employment. The project
would also help optimize the use of existing
infrastructure in Vadodara and Nagothane, enhancing
the economic performance of both complexes.
Proiect Risks:            No unusual risks are involved in the specific
investments. All contracted technologies are
proven and IPCL has the technical and institutional
capability to absorb and mariage thc largc and
complex mix of technologies. There is, however, a
minor risk that the domestic market for
petrochemicals may not grow as currently envisaged
and that sorne overcapacity could develop in the
late 1990s. The risk would increase if the level
of future investments are not carefully monitored
and domestic prices of the projects's output were
to increase significantly due to increases in
taxes, import tariffs or high feedstock costs. The
probability of these events happening is, however,
considered low. The Government has agreed with the
Bank to periodically review its sectoral investment
strategy to avoid overcapacity from developing and
discuss the results of these reviews with the Bank.
With respect to domestic prices, the Government is
committed to lowering the cost of manufactured
products through gradual policy reforms and
rationalization of basic input prices. The Bank
would through its policy dialogue continue to
encourage the Government to adopt appropriate
feedstock prices and reduce protection levels as a
basis of achieving its objectives. All project
investment components are being undertaken only
after careful review of their environmental impact
assessment (EIA) reports. The design and
conscruction of project facilities would include
provisions to protect the environment and ensure
operational safety in accordance with current
Indian standards.

T. THE WORLD PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
A. General Background
1.01     Petrochemicals are petroleum and gas based synthetic materials, which
are becoming increasingly important in the world economy. The most important,
high volume group of petrochemicals are commodity plastics, svnthetic fibers,
rubbers and detergents. Although their production is capital, technology and
scale intensive, petrochemicals are becoming generally cheaper than most of
their traditional substitutes in many industrial applications. They compete
favorably with traditional materials (such as steel, aluminum, wood, paper,
glass, etc) in construction, transportation, electronics, packaging and
various capitai goods industries.  il Lthe iiaiurf.cturCe of deteLgelLts, textiles
and tire industries, petrochemicals (both as substitutes and complements for
vegetable oils, and natural fibers and rubbers) ease scarcity of supply and
land pressure.  Commodity plastics are also usod in a number of household
products, consumer durables, engireering products, packaging materials and
many other industrial applications.  In each of thi,se applications, plastics
are gaining ground because of their better economics and product perfo-.rmance,
compared to their substiztes.
1.02     The major petrochemical building blocks are olefins (etllivlIne
propylene, and butadiene) and aromatics (benrze-   tolunte and! xvlncr-s).  These
products are the basic raw materials for almost 9()I of all petrochemical
products.  All commodity plastics and. most of svnvthetic fibers, rubbers and
detergents are downistream derivai vts of thesot.ermediates   n:hvlene

B . Rc s t ruc t ur.   of tU- ' ,1.;
1.03     During 1982-85, the world petrochiemical inc8astry was subjected to
extensive restructuring and rationalizatiori.  TIhre were major shifts in
teedstock and plant locations and reduction of production capacities of basic
petrochemicals.  Petrochemical industries ii th; USA, Western Europe and
Japan, having been adversely affected by sharp increases in feedstock costs,
the downturn in the international economy and the slower growth in domestic
product markets. contracted substantially. Ethylene production capacity was,
for instance, reduced from an estimated 6.2 million to 4.5 million tons in
Japan, from 15.0 to 13.9 million tons in Wester,n Europe, and from 17.1 million
tons to 15.9 million tons in the USA.  Not a single new ethylene plant was
also planned for in the USA, Japan, or Western Europe during 1982-86.  The
increases in energy prices and the saturation of markets of basic petro-
chemical derivatives in the industrialized countries, however, led to the
establishment of production capacities in energy surpius regions and/or where
markets were growing fast. Canada and Saudi Arabia, which recently became
important producers and exporters of petrochemr ,ls, have eypanded their
production capacities on the basis of domestic supplv of low valee feedstock.
Expansion of production capacities in countries like Brazil, South Korea and
India was. on the other hand, in response to their growing and potentially
large domestic markets.

1.04      Feedstock Choice:  Nothirng typifies more the changes that have
affected the petrochemical industry thian the rapid changes in feedstock
prices.  As a direct consequence of- tit- increases in energy prices and the
accelerated exploration efforts for (il during 1974-85, world natural gas
reserves anid t'he use of gas as a fetdstock for- petrochiemicals have increased
substantially.  In many oil producing developing countries, production of gas
is dictated by t'he need to produce ol' for domestic use and/or exports.  Due
to lack of market and distri' %tion infrastructure, this often results in
flaring, venting and re-injection of associated gas. Countries experiencing
such a situation have been attempting to develop an on-site market for their
gas productior.  Except for nitrogenous fertilizei-s and methanol where there
has been overcapacitv silnce the 1980, the use of methane as feedstoclk for the
chemical i idustrv (which accountss for over 85i  of thie gas produced) is
limited.  On th,e UthleI LhaIdI d, Lhie ethalle. pi upane and buLaiie  fLactions of
natural gas (accounting usually less than 10# of gas volune) are important
feedstocks for the production of olt.'ins and the-ir use has been increasing

most important producers and consumers. Although due to the maturity of their
markets the growth of demand for petrochemicals has been low (and is expected
to remain so), the industrialized countries will remain the most important
consumers of petrochemicals (Annex 1,1). World consumption and production,
capacity utilization rates during 1987, and annual growth of consumption of
selected petrochemicals during 1980-87 are given in Table 1.1. In spite of
the large increases in energy prices in 1979-80, and the subsequent protracted
global recession during the early 1980s, cons'imption continued to grow during
1980-87.

1.09      The Olefins:  Worldwide demand for ethylene grew at about 16% per
annum during 1965-75, 4.2% during 1975-79 and 4.0% during 1980-87.  At the end
of 1987, world production capacity was estimated at around 48 million tons,
down from a peak of 52 million tons in 1980.  Consumption was estimated at
ebout 44 million tons, equivalent to 92% capacitv utilization. During
1987-88, demand for ethylene has exceeded producers) ability to supply and the
tight market situation forced some producers to place their customers on a
monthly allocation basis. During the ntx.-t_ two to three years, some additional
capacitv is coming on stream. However, since most of the capacity retired
during the early i980s had 20 years or more of operation before shutdown,
resumption of production would be costlv and not expected to iUe sig,nificant.
The market for olefins and their derivati.'es (as can be seen from Table 1.2)
is, therefore, projected to be in balance, but oni the tight side.
1.10      The situation for propylene is different.  Although its production is
to a large extent tied to that of ethvlene as a by-product of ethllene
crackers, it is also produced in refineries from catalvtic and thermal
cracking. At the end of 1987, production capaicitv of propylene associated
with £-thylene cracking was estimated at about 20 million tpy, and nearly 5
million tpy of propylene capacity existed in refineries which have catalytic/
thermal cracking facilities    Tn tht be inning  of the 11480s, the overcapacity
in ethylene was also associated with a similar overcapacity in propylene.
However, the rationalization of naph:ha 1,ased ethvlene capacities and the
shiit to ethane based ethylene crackt-rs reduc_d the potential over-capacitv of
propylete.  Effective productior capacitv is. however, difficult to determine
because it depends on the type or fi,d: ols utd.  'f refintry and ethv'lene
cL-c-er sources are combined and  hte ftt-dstoc,Ks that maxtriize production of
propv->ne are used, then effecti.e pzr<Ac .io  cp.i i tx' could be conrsiderably
higher than the 25 million tons est:mt,.td fr          -.

polypropylene (40%) and acrylonitrile < .E    The non-chemical (or fuel)
demand is basically associated wi1thi             al'kvation.  During 1970-80,
world consumption of propylene grew a; about  .-  per annum  (p.a.) before
declining to nearly 4.6* p.a. durinFg !-F,0-2-   in 1987, consump,tion was
estimated at 24 million tons, t-,u iv,Int to '4f7 of estimated capacity.  During
the next eight years, consumption is proiected to increase bv 3.7% p.a.
rLaching .6.4 million tons in 1.990 and 32.1 million tons in 1995.  A number of
projects, which are currently under construction, will come on stream  during
1990-92 and will, together with refinery sources, ease any possible shortages
of propylene that may develop.
1.12      Plastics:  Commodity plastics (LDPE, HFrE, LLDPE, PP, PS and PVC) are
high volume downstream petrochemicals. In order of importance, commodity
plastics are used as packaging materials, building materials, electronic/
transport,tion hardware components, household appliances and furniture parts.
As such, demand is highlv influeniced bhx the economic performance of these sub-
sectors and price competitiveness of commodity plastics compared to their
substitutes.  During 1975-80, world consumption of these commodity plastics
grew at an annual rate of 8.7%. During 1980-87, however, growth of
consumption declined to about 5.7% p.a. This was due to the combined impact
of the global recession (of the early 1980s) and saturation of the markets of
industrialized nations. World consumption of the six commodity plastics
(LDPE/LLDPE, HDPE, PP, PS and PVC) in 1987 was estimated at 51.4 million tons.
Wlith the notable exception of PP, the demand for commodity plastics in
industrialized countries is slowing dowr.  On the other hand, per capita
coousumption of commoditv plastics in Latin America, Asia and Africa are low



- 5 -
(ranging from 8.6 kg in Latin America to 2.4 kg in Africa) and their markets
are at an early growth phase.  Since the end of 1987, demand for comnmodity
plastics has increased substantially and in marny cases exceeded supply,
resulting in dramatic increases in polymer prices. The tight market situation
is expected to last until the mid-1990s when a number of capacities currently
under constrjction, or planning stages, are expected to come on stream. Until
then, any new capacity added could be absorbed without significant adverse
effects on prices and margins. Taking t':ese factors into account, the demand
for commodity polymers is forecast by Bank staff to reach about 58 million
tons in 1990 and 68 million tons in 1995. Capacitv is eApected to grow slowly
from arourA 55 million tons in 1987, to 63 million tons in 1990 and 7,5 million
tons in 1995, implying average capacity utilization of 90-92%.
1.13     Engineering Plastics:  As commodity plastics face maturity in many of
their applications in the industrialized countries, accelerated development of
hi-h performance engineering plastics is emerging. Engineering plastics,
which combine good structural engineering properties and the economic
advantages of commodity plastics, are becominlg increasingly important.  The
major markets for these products are in metal substitution in cornstruction,
and as compornent parts in t:ransportation equipment. electronic hardware and
home appliances.  Based on expert opinions, Bank staff projected deiiiand for
engineering plastics to increase from 2.3 miillion tons in 198, tc 2.7 million
tons in 1990 and 3.8 million tons in 1995, equivalent to an,nual  -rowi'-- of 6.5%
between 1987 and 1995.
D.  Inten_at,ional Petro(he:riciC  Prices
1.14     Due to the rationalizastul -f capacities in the first half of the
1.980s and growing demand for mosr petrochemicals fo,lowing thre recovery and
growth of the world economy siace the mid-196ls, the pet:oche.,.-cal indfustry is
currently operating at high rates of capacity for most products. Consequently,
international prices of most petrochemicals and producer marginis are high and
producers are enjoying high profitability.  BE  far the most i:rportant factors
driving prices and margins are capacity utilization and feedstocle prices.
Relative prices of substitute products and technological improvements in
production process and applications are also important.  Considering
capacities under construction/planninv stages, the international market for
polyoletins is expected to remain in balance, but on the tight side. Feed-
stock costs are expected to remain stable with gradual upward movement.
Manufacturers are, therefore, expected to operate their plarnts at high rates
of capacity and enjoy good margins and profitability through the early 1990s.
However, given the bulkiness of investmei,ts and technological improvements in
the production of petrochemicals. prices and margins are projected to decrease
compared to their 1987-88 levels.i/ These would bring down operating rates,
1/  About 3.2 million tons of ethylene per year of new capacity are being
planned in the U.S.A. Included are new plants by Phillips, Dow and
Quantum as well as restart of old facilities by Union Carbide, Texaco
and Olin. Many companies are also debottlenecking existing facilities
globallv to take advantage of current high margins.

product prices and margins. The industry would thus undergo a typical
business cycle, as in the past. Most analysts believe, however, that capacity
utilization and margins are not likely to return to the poor levels of the
1982-85 period, as the industry is eot likely to overbuild capacities to the
same extent that it had in the 1970s and early 198Os.

II.  THE INDIAN PETROCHEMICAIL SECTOR
A. An Overview of the Industrial Sector
2.01      India has a large and diversified manufacturing sector.  The share of
manufactured output in GDP has increased from about 14% in 1960-61 to 22% in
19887-88. During the past three decades, real manufactured value added has
been growing at an average of 4.8%, compared to GDP growth of 3.7%.  In the
1980s, the rate of growth of registered manufactured value added almost
doubled, averaging 10.1% compared to 5.4% in the 1970s. The incremental
capital output ratio (ICOR) for the manufacturing sector has also declined
sabstantially indicating an inicrease in factor productivity. Export of
manufactured products has been growing at about 10% in real terms during
1985-89 and by the end of F`Y88 accounted for around 65% total exports.
2.02   The improved performance of the industrial sector during the Sixth
and Seventh Plan periods was the result of an imrprovinig economic policy
environment.  Since the beginninlcg of the Sixth P'lani, India has be-en following

(MODVAT) scheme has been operat:ionol since 1985.  Thle schem,e has 1.&ped in
reducing some cf ttn  adverse effects c  the fiscal system cn resource

provided with easier access to inputs at international prices. Important
administrative simplificatior measures for duty-free imports by exporters,
cash compensation for taxes paid, procedures for export: processing zones, a,id
eligibility for advance import licenses have aiso been introduced.  These
measures, together with more flexible exchalnge rate policies, have h.elped in
improving the profitabi-itv of exports. resultin,g in higher export growth of
manufactured products.
2.05      Changes have also been made in reorientingF the import policy regime.
The 1985 Long-term Fiscal Policy advocated the need for moving thli country's
import policv away from direct controls to a tariff based system.  Following
this, there has been some progress in eliminating non-tariff barriers to



-8-
trade. There has also been reduction in the level of import tariffs for some
industrial products, including commoditv plastics.
2.06     Overall, India's industrial policy have improved substantially since
the early 1980s. Over the last five years, it has become significantly more
stable and open than was in the 1970s. The change in the economic policy
environment has fostered domestic competition, contributing to improved
industrial efficiency and export performance of the Indian economy. Improved
investment initiatives have promoted the realization of economies of scale and
technology upgradation in most sectors of the economy.
2.07     The Government in May 1990 announced additional reforms in industrial
policy which provide for further reduction in industrial licensing
requirements and greater automaticity in the approvals of domestic and foreign
investments.  However, there is need for further reforms to promote
competition and economic efficiency through (i) removal of remaining
quantitative restrictions, (ii) reduction of tariff levels, and (iii) allowing
greater flexibility to close "sick" firms, and (iv) taking measures to imp-'ove
the efficiency of public enterprises. Through its ongoing economic po'licy
dialogue and the design of its lending operations, the Bank continues to
monitor progress made and encourage the Government to take initiatives in
these areas to promote procuctivity and economic efficiency.
B.  Structure of the Indian Petrochemical Sector
Historical Development
2.08     The petrochemical industry in India is still relatively new.  Pro-
duction of basic petrochemicals began in 1966 with the conmmissioning of a
small 20,000 tpy naphtha-based ethylene cracker. This was follow,ud in 1968
with a 60,000 tpy naphtha cracker and associated downstream units in the
Bombay area. Both plants were established by the private sector with foreign
equity holding (Union Carbide and National Organic Chemicals with Shell). In
the late 1960s, commissioning of a new aromatic plant in V'adodara ownied and
operated by IPCI., a public-sector enterprise, added major capacity to primary
petrochemicals production. This was followed by IPCL's integrated naphtha-
based olefins complex in Vadodara includinig a numiiber of downstream units with
an ethylene capacity of 130,000 tpy. India's first petrochemical complex
based on natural-gas liquids is being implemented by IPCL with Bank assistance
(Loan 2505-IN) and is expected to come on stream in mid-1990. It will be the
first facili.y in India meeting international standards of scale and
technology. This project will add 300,000 tpy of ethylene, 63,000 tpy of
propylene and abnut 350,000 tpy of associated downstream products. Present
production capacity of the key petrochemicals in India, including new capacity
under construction, is summarized in Table 2.1.

2.09     India's current production of petrochemicals is based on naphtha (a
more expensive feedstock compared to appropriate gas fractions) and largely
sub-optimal scale plants. Most of the existing production capacity is also
based on outdated technology (1960s and early 1970s) and therefore does not
benefit from the recent advances in energy saving processes incorporated in
relatively new plants. Further, given the sub-optimal scale of existing
plants and the high cost structure of the Indian capital goods industry,
investment cost per unit of capacity installed has beer, high by international
norms. Because of these conditions, India's current production of petro-
chemicals is characterized by high unit costs. India employs high tariff and
non-tariff barriers on imports, and has restricted domestic capacity creation
through a comprehensive investment licensing scheme that has been followed
since the 1950s.
2.10     The sector is, however, currently at an important juncture.  In
addition to the world scale MGCC complex which is under construztion, the
sector is slated for major expansion and modernization within the next ten
years. In conjunction with the overall industrial policy reforms it has been
pursuing since the early 1980s, the GOI has already taken important steps to
improve the structure and efficiency of the sector. Minimum economic scale
criteria have been established for most key products in the industry. Th'n
private sector has also been allowed entry to all areas of petrochemicals
production and is planning major investments. The feedstock base is shifting
in favor of natural gas fractions that are less expensive than naphtha, at
least for ethylene and propylene derivatives. Significant reductions in
tariff and non- ariff barriers to imports of petrochemicals (particularly of
major plastics) ;:qve also been made over the last three years.

Sectoral Policy Environment
2.11     Economies of Scale.  Given the limited size and dispersion of demand,
India, in the past, built several suboptimal-size plants at dispersed loca-
tions instead of fewer economic size units. Appreciative of the importance of
economies of scale, the GOI now plans to approve only crackers of an inter-
national scale in an effort to reduce the unit cost of output and make the
industry more competitive. Minimum scale criteria for the award of future
licenses have also been adopted for key downstream petrochemicals. Accord-
ingly, most of the units that are being considered in the indicative list of
investments are considerably larger than most of existing installations. The
minimum economic sizes (MES) adopted for Indian plants and the range of capa-
cities of recently built plants in Asia are shown in Annex 2.1. In general,
the sizes adopted for polymers and crackers are within the range of scales
considered economic. Improvements, however, may still be needed in synthetic
fibers and rubbers. As long as effective protection remains high in some
segments, defining MES criteria for licensing new capacities is essential as a
transitional measure for promoting an interna ionallv competitive industry.
During negotiations, the GOI agreed with the Bank that it would periodically
review the MES criteria it has established for approving new production
capacities for olefins and polvolefins, aromatics and synthetic fibres, and
other important petrochemical products and their intermediates to take into
account ongoing technological developments and to upgrade those standards that
are found to be too low.
2.12     Feedstock Choice and Prices.  In i.ne  ith global trends, India is
now moving to gas fractions as petrocher'c^.i(.  f*,dstock.  Out of the five
crackers planned or being constructtcd,          a-;te hased on gas fractions.  The
two aromatic units being considered moust    srilv be based on naphtha.  The
extent to which this trend will cor::. .    d:s  furc.ion of the
availabilitv of C2,'C3 fractions in the-  '-   :ul iu ts p3ol produced and the
ability to produce natural gas liquids  T,:7h,  la:tr is linked to the gas
development program and to the speed at     -he use of gas for LPG and power
generation will develop.  It would also dopor.oi on projo,ct location which is
often influenced by GOI's concern about rebiZTil balance.
2.13      Indian energy and petrochemicai f,:te;:ock prices are generallv higher
than their long run economic opportunity cost. Due to Goverrurient revenue and
conservation considerations, domestic energ. and feedstock values have not
been adjusted downward (or have adjusted with considerable lag) to reflect
downward movements in world energy prices. Naphtha as a feedstock for the
production of petrochemicals is particularli expensive, currently costing
about US$225 per ton, about 55 percent mort- tharn its import-parity value.  Gas
has not been used as feedstock for production of petrochemicals until very
recently. The Maharashtra Gas Cracker Complex (the first gas based project)
is, however, now coming on stream.  The land fall natural gas price of
Rs 1,800 (US$105) per KM3 (including ONCC's royalties) is about the same as
the opportunity cost of natural gas as a fuel oil substitute.
2.14     Since gas (C2/C3) is expected to be the feedstock of choice for the
production of basic petrochemicals in the future, the Government is focusing
on setting the correct economic price for this feedstock. The Bureau of
lndustrial Costs and Prices (BICP) has been enraged to determine the
principles of C2/C3 pricing and to make a recoirmendation on the actual price
level to be adopted for the MGCC project.  During appraisal, the Bank has been
discussing with the Government and BICP the importance of the cost of
feedstock in the production cost of petrochemicals and the principles to be



-11-
fol½owed in setting C2/C3 prices to ensure competitiveness of domestic
petrochemicals.
2.15     The Bank recommended that the price of C2/C3 be set at its calorific
value (as fuel oil substitute) plus reasonable costs of separation. Using
this approach Bank staff estimated current economic price of C2/C3 at the land
fall point at Uran to be about US$220 per MM3. This is based on present CIF
value of US$95 per ton of fuel oil and a reasonable provision for separation
costs. The GOI has set the price of C2/C3, to be supplied by ONGC from Uran
to IPCL as a feedstock for the MGCC project, at Rs 3300 per ton. This price
is equivalent to about US$235 per MM3 and the Bank considers it reasoLaable at
the present time. The Government has agreed that it would review from time to
time the price of C2/C3 to take into account changes in various input prices
and other relevant factors which affect its value to the Indian economy, and
inform the Bank of the proposed chang s and afford it an opportunity to
comment on these changes.
2.16     Protection Levels:  During 1986-88, significant reductions in tariff
and non-tariff barriers to imports of petrochemicals have been made, parti-
cularly for major plastic polymers. Prior to the 1985-88 Import-Export
Policy, most petrochemicals imports were on the restricted list of imports.
Since then, all commodity plastics and some organic chemical intermediates
were shifted to the Open General License (OGL) status, thus allowing imports
without elaborate Government clearances. Moreover, in view of the widening
gap between demand and supply in the Indian market and the hardening of
international prices since 1986-87, GOI has also taken steps to reduce tariff
rates to ensure raw material supply to downstream users at reasonable cost, as
well as to put competitive pressure on local producers to improve efficiency.
2.17     As shown in Table 2.2, import duties on a range of commodity plastics
(such as PP, HDPE, LDPE, PVC, PS, etc.) were reduced substantially during
1986-90. Excise taxes have also been reduced on domestic output of polyester
staple fiber (PSF) and polyester filament yarn (PFY) to stimulate de-.iand. All
these reductions have provided some relief to domestic plastic converters and
polyester wsavers, which have been hard hit by rapidly rising raw material
costs arising from both the dramatic increases in world prices (particularly
since 1987) and previously high import duty and excise tax levels. Tariffs on
plastics, which account for over half of basic petrochemicals, have steadily
declined since April 1986. Realized nominal protection (defined as the ratio
of ex-factory prices actually charged to landed prices of imports excluding
tariff duties), has also been declining and during 1988-89 was consistently
below levels implied by the normal tariff structures. This is indicative of
the redundancy of current tariffs, particularly for plastics and rubbers. The
reasons for this redundancy include: (a) adjustments in domestic ex-factory
prices lagging behind increases international prices; (b) fear of domestic
producers that large price increases may constrain demand grow.h, aiid () mosSt
of the plants in operation are fully depreciated and do not need to utilize
all the available protection to achieve reasonable profitability levels.

2.18     Given the high feedstock cost and taxes on capital goods in India,
the level of effective protection enjoyed by domestic producers of petro-
chemicals is not as high as can be implied by the prevailing duty structure on
imports. A significant part of the tariff protection is needed to compensate
investors for the relatively high administered feedstock prices and the direct
and indirect taxes on capital goods. Because of direct and indirect taxes,
the capital cost of petrochemical plants in India to private investors is
25-40% higher than their economic equivalent. When the non-economic costs in
capital goods are taken into account. the net protection for most plastic
polymers in India is much lower than the nominal level of tariffs would imply.
An estimate of the level of protection required to compensate investors for
the high cost of capital due to fiscal levies is given Table 2.3 below.

2.19     Private Sector Role.  The role of the private sector in the Indian
economy is expanding rapidly. Its is now allowed and encouraged to invest in
thrust areas (such as the steel, petrochemicals and power sectors) which were
once dominated by public enterprises. In line with this, the GOI is actively
encouraging both private and public sector investments in all phases of
petrochemicals manufacture. Although the public sector has so far been the
leader in the production of poly-olefins and is expected to continue to play
an important role in the future, its dominance is expected to decline rapidly
during the Eighth Plan as the private sector establishes new production
capacities.  Considering its budgetary constraints,  .ecent industrial policy
shifts toward a more market-oriented system, and the private sector's



-13-
increasing resource mobilization capabilities, large private and joint-sector
investments in petrochemicals are being promoted. Some of these investments
are already under implementation. Three complexes (Hazira, Haldia, and Vizag)
in the list of indicative sector investments (para. 3.08) are likely to be
carried out by private and joint-sector firms. The Hazira complex, where
project execution for some of the downstream units is already at an advanced
stage, would be the first world scale private complex in India. In addition
to producing polymers efficiently, this project would help in introducing
needed competition which could lower input cost to downstream industries.
2.20     Plastic processing industries (manufacturers of plastic products
where a large number of small firms operate) are owned primarily by the
private sector. In other subsectors such as synthetic fibers, rubbers and
detergents, private sector participation is also much higher than in the
commodity plastics manufacturing sector. As much as 70% of the aggregate
production of fibers, rubbers and detergents is already in the hands of the
private sector. And, even basic commodity plastics' production will be
shifting toward higher private sector participation if projects currently
being considered are implemented. The current intention of the GOI is for the
private sector to have a predominant role in the development and future
expansion of the industry.
C. Bank Lending to Industry
2.21     The Bank has made 24 development finance loans amounting to US$2.1
billion through financial intermediaries (mainly ICICI and IDBI), for on-
lLnding to private and joint sector firms engaged in all aspects of industry.
Two loans (2639/30-IN) have been specifically for export development, and one
was for technology development through provision of venture capital. One of
the development finance loans (Loan 2928-IN) also included US$50 million for
the major government steel company, SAIL, for technical assistance to upgrade
technology and improve efficiency. The most recent PCR for the Fourteenth
Industrial Credit and Investment Project (Loan 2051-IN) indicated that wh.le
the 14 loans were successful in supporting ICICI's institutional development,
they did not adequately address the policy environment within which its
lending took place. This is no longer the case as will be clear from paras.
2.27-2.28 below.
2.22     The Bank Group has also provided US$3.5 billion for projects in the
fertilizer, cement and petrochemicals subsectors where opportunities existed
for the Bank to support policy reforms at the subsector level and finance
economic investments using modern technology. Implementation of these
projects has been generally satisfactory. All projects currently under imple-
mentation are expected to have satisfactory rates of economic return and,
despite some initial delays, to be fully disbursed by the respective closing
dates. The loans through financial intermediaries are also being implemented
well and the Bank is working closely with the financial intermediaries to
improve their project appraisal capabilities, foreign asset/liability
management and portfolio quality.
2.23     In the petrochemicals sector, the Bank's first petrochemical project
in India is the Maharashtra Gas Cracker Complex which is currently being
implemented by IPCL.  The EX-IM Bank of Japan has recently completed a co-
financing arrangement providing a loan of US$120 million  to the Government of
India to fill the financing gap for the project.  The project would help
optimize utilization of India's gas resources and its output will substitute
for existing and rapidly growing imports of commodity plastics. When it comes



-14-
on stream in 1990-91, the project will double India's current production
capacity of commodity plastics. Given its internationally competitive size
plants, state of the art process technologies and the most economically
preferred feedstock, the project is expected to produce commodity plastics at
unit costs lower than the import-parity value of similar products. Despite an
overall three month delay, the project cost (at completion) is now estimated
to be around US$1.2 billion, compared to the US$1.7 billion Bank estimate
during appraisal. IPCL's implementation of MGCC has been satisfactory and the
economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 23% (see para. 7.01).
2.24     Future Lending:  The Bank has had an active industrial sector work
program and prepared a number of sector reports on such subjects as industrial
regulation, technology policy, export promotion, public enterprise management
and credit and capital markets and a number of subsector reports including
electronics, automotive products, steel, capital goods and fertilizer. The
1987 CEM, India: An Industrializing Economy in Transition 1/ also focused on
the development of the industrial sector and supplied the broad outlines of a
reform program. Many of the issues in these reports will continue to be
discussed with the Government in the context of future operations.  The future
lending program for industry is primarily based on the sector work and will
thus include:
(i) industrial finance projects which will serve as a focal point for
evaluating and discussing with Government overall progress on
industrial and financial policy reform as well as addressing issues in
the financial institutions;
(ii) industrial energy conservation, industrial pollution control and
export development projects, which will serve as a focal point for
evaluating and discussing with Government overall progress and improve
the policy, financial and institutional support for activities in
these key areas; and
(iii) subsector projects which will provide policy, technical and financial
support for economic invEstments in areas where improved efficiency
will have implications for the growth of the whule industrial sector
(e.g., petrochemicals, electronics, and capital goods).
2.25     In all of these areas, loans are basically linked to the policy
reforms that are being undertaken either in designated policy areas such as
exports, tecl.inlogy, etc. or in the policies that affect a specific subsector.
The basic criterion that determines the decision to go ahead with a loan is
whether the policy environment is conducive to efficient investments in the
area or subsector that is being supported, Thus, the lending strategy
involves supporting investments in areas where poiicy improvements have
already been undortaken, consistent with the conclusions of the previous
sector work.
2.26     Petrochemicals have been included among the subsector projects in the
Bank's industrial lending program for India because of the scale of invest-
ments proposed, the importance of the sector to downstream industries and the
progress that is being made in reforming policies affecting this sector. Bank
lending to the sector has involved discussion of major sector issues including
protection, the future investment program, scale of production and feedstock
pricing.

III. THE INDIAN PETROCHEMICAL MARKET
A. Past and Proiected Consumption
3.01     Past Consumption:  During the last eight years, Indian consumption of
commodity plastics (LLDPE, LDPE, HDPE, PP, PVC, and PS) has almost doubled.
It grew from 267,000 tons in FY81 to 556,000 tons ir. FY88, an 11% annual
growth rate. The impressive growth was achieved in spite of the very high
domestic prices of plastic polymers, which is a reflection of the fact that
consumption of polyolefins in India is still in its early growth phase.
Moreover, despite the rapid increases in consumption, per capita use of
polyolefins in India remains among the lowesL in the world, about 0.6 kg
compared to 8.6 kg in Latin America and 60.0 k3 in North America.
3.02     Domestic Petrochemical Prices:  in addition to the combined impact of
high custom duties, capital cost, feedstock prices, and non-tariff import
barriers that often insulate domestic production from competition from
imports, Indian petrochemical product prices are subjected~ to heavy local
taxes. Domestic taxes charged on petrochemicals production consist of excise
taxes, plus a 4% sales tax on ex-factory prices anu a 2% octroi on resulting
prices. Excise taxes are between 0% and 25% for intermediates, 20% and 40%
for plastics, and about 15% for rubbers.  For fibers, excise tax rates are
specific and very high, sometimes doubling ex-factory prices, and differ
widely between types of fibers and yarns. The structures of custom duties and
excise taxes for major petrochemical products are presented in Annex 3.1. The
impact of local taxes on users' prices for some key products (as of March
1988) is summarized in Table 3.1 below:

Source: Staff estimates.
3.03     For plastics, excise taxes on inputs and intermediates are deductible
from excise ta-es paid on output under the Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT)
system, but not for textiles. Thus, users of fibers and yarns bear the full
incidence of excise taxes. In 1988, for the first time in many years, the
Government reduced excise taxes on fibers and narrowed the spread between the
various types of fibers. Nontheless, their prices remain high (as can be seen
in Table 3.1) and in all probability constraini significantly market growth.
The widespread redundancy in tariffs for most products (including plastics),
and low capacity utilization in the fiber industry combined with reported



-16-
widespread smuggling of polyester fibers are indicacions of the adverse
effects cf high domestic prices on demand.l/
3.04     Demand Prospects:  The potential for continued rapid increases in
consumpt'on of petrochemicals (particularly polyolefins) in India is
considered very high. There is a large potential for substitution of
traditional, generally more expensive materials such as natural rubber,
natural fibers, wood, steel and aluminum, whose availability and growth is
restricted by increasing pressure on land use for food production or lack of
raw material base. The advantages for India of using synthetic polymers as
substitutes of wood/paper and their positive impact on the rate of depletion
of forests is becoming increasingly clear.  Complementarity nf petrochemicals
with some natural products that are facing limits in their capacity to gro-w is
also becoming important.  The issue of competition with cotton and natural
rubber is already pre-empted by the limitations in land availability required
to further expand their production. Compared to steel, synthetic polymers
offer significant savings in production and energy costs, as well as in
tooling and handling infrastructure for many applications. Thus, synthetic
petrochemical products will play a major and increasing role in the production
of packaging and construction materials, fibers, and rubbers in India. The
rate at which such a porencial will materialize, of course, will depend on the
availability of adequate supply, the level of relative prices vis-a-vis
substitutes, and the overall level of economic activities in the Indian
economy.
3.05     GOI is using the demand projections in the "Report of the CommDittee
for Prospective Planning of Petrochemical Industry (1986-2000 A.D)", which is
referred as the Kapur Report, for capacity planning purposes. Projected
demand for selected petrochemicals derived from tnis Report is presented in
the first half of Table 3.2.  Projectio-is for 1989-90 are based on expected
supply availability scenario and continuation of present Government policies
throughout the Seventh Five Ypar Plan. Those beyond 1990 are based on
projected end use analysis under an economic policy environment where leed-
stock and product prices are rationalized to promote expansion of domestic
demand. Whether these projections would be achieved depends on the prospects
for major changes in Government policy with respect to factors that affect
petrochemical product prices and their major substitutes. Tne Kapur Committee
projections are now considered outdated and optimistic by industry, as well as
the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices and the Planning Commission.
/  The proceeds from excise taxes levied on the major products from the
petrochemica' sector (net of excise taxes on inputs and intermediates)
is estimated at about US$800 to US$900 million per year, or 6-7% of
total excise tax collection in India in 1987/88. fhe estimated
revenues from excise taxes (in US$million) by type of product
categories in 1987/88 were: (i) plastics - US$180-190; (ii) rubbers -
US$10; (iii) fibers - US$600-700; and (iv) detergent - US$30.

IPCL data and staff estimates.
3.06     Based on a more conservative approach, Bank staff have made a
substantially lower demand forecast for commodity plastics, summarized in
lower half of Table 3.2. These projections are based on recent trends in the
domestic market, and the projected GDP growth as in the Seventh Five Year
Plan. They also take into account the current low per capita consumption and
the gradual maturation and saturation of markets.
B. Domestic SuDPlY Capabilities
3.07     SuDplv ProsRects:  Over the last seven years, domestic production of
commodity polymers has increased from 167,000 tons in FY81 to 269,000 tons in
FY88, far short of meeting demand. To meet domestic demand, India had to
resort to increasing levels of imports. During this period, annual imports of
commodity plastics increased from around 100,000 to 287,000 tons (equivalent
to 16% annual growth), increasing India's import dependence from 37 to 52%.
Even under conservative market forecasts for polyolefins, annual imports of up
to about 220,000 tons will be needed to close the gap between domestic
production and demand through FY95. Table 3.3 summarizes the supply of
commodity plastics during FY81-88.

3.08     To augment future supply of basic petrochemicals, India is consider-
ing investments amounting to US$6-8 billion in the petrochemical sector within
the next decade. This ambitious program is intended to reduce I.idia's growing
dependence on petrochemical imports and to optimize the use of gas and exploit
India's potential for economic production of key petrochemicals and deriva-
tives. The indicative list of investments, which toes not in,olve any
budgetary support from the GOI, assumes that priva.te investors will expand
their role in the sector substantially. If all the projects in the list were
to be implemented and completed by the mid-1990s, India's supply capability
could exceed demand. The probability for this happening is, however, low.
Some of the listed investments are in very preliminary stages and are unlikely
to go ahead within this period. le avoid overexpansion, during negotiations,
GOI agreed with the Bank that it will review periodically, commencing in
calendar year 1991 and every two calendar years thereafter, the progress cf
planned investments on o'ef.ns and aromatics complexes to assess their
economic viability taking into account domestic and international market
developments. GOI will provide a copy and discuss the results of these
reviews with the Bank. The projects in the indicative investment program are
as follows:
(i) An expansion of the Nagothane cracker from 300,000 tpy to 400,000 tpy
and associated downstream investments. This project involves the
least expensive capacity expansion and its completion is expected by
1993;
(ii) A new natural gas liquids (NGL) cracker and associated downstream
units located in Hazira, state of Gujarat. This project will have
capacity to produce about 320,000 tpy of ethylene and about 700,000
tpy of final products. It is expected to be built in two phases over
a period of five years with an estimated completion date in 1995-96;
(iii) A new 300,000-400,000 tpy ethane/propane based ethylene cracker and
associated downstream processing plants in Candhar, state of Gujarat.
This project is expected to be implemented by IPCL with probable
completion in the second half of the 1990s;
(iv) A new 300,000 tpy naphtha cracker and associated downstream units
located in the east coast of India (most probably at Haldia) with a
completion date after 1995;



-19-
(v)  A new 300,000 tpy gas based ethylene cracker with associated
secondary units somewhere along the Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur (HBJ)
pipeline to be completed by around the end of this decade;
(vi)  A 200,000 tpy aromatics unit to be located at Manali, near Madras in
Tamil Nadu. with expected completion date in 1993; and
(vii)  A 250,000 tpy aromatics plant located at Salimpur, Uttar Pradesh,
with an expected completion schedule in 1995.
3.09     Implementation of the first two olefin projects and the first
aromatic unit is likely to begin within the next two years.  Even under
considerably more conservative market projections, there would be more than
adequate domestic demand for the output of the proposed projects at Nagothane
and Hazira. When the MCCC complex becomes fully operational by 1995, it would
increase the existing production capacity for polyolefins by over 100% and,
together with a minor expansion at Vadodara, would add around 380,000 tons to
local production. If the three downstream units in the first phase of the
Hazira complex were to come on stream and operate at 100% capacity by 1995,
which is unlikely, an additional 225,000 tons of polyolefins could be produced
and total capacity could reach about 900,000 tons by 1995. However, even
then, effective production capacity would not be adequate to satisfy domestic
demand as projected by Bank staff. Moreover, many of the capacities that are
expected to be completed by then would take two-three years to reach full
production buildup. Projected domestic supply/demand balances for the major
commodity polymers that are already being produced, or would be produced in
the future, is shown in Table 3.4. On that basis, India would continue to be,
on balance, a net importer of commodity plastics throughout this decade.

3.10     Polybutadiene Rubber Market: Most of the rubber (about 77%) currently
used in India is natural rubber. In 1988, consumption of synthetic rubbers
was estimated at about 41,000 tons, of which around 19,000 tons was PBR
Demand during 1989-95 is expected to grow at a rate of 10%, based on the
expected expansion of the automobile sector in India. The demand for PBR, one



-20-
of the products that would be produced by the proposed project, is forecast to
increase from 19,000 tons in 1988 to 35,000 in 1995 and reach 53,500 tons by
the year 2000. Against this, nominal supply capability is expected to
increase from the present 20,000 ton to 50,000 ton in 1994 when the proposed
expansion of IPCL's Vadodara facilities are completed. In view of this, small
surplus would develop in the first few year of the project's proposed PBR
operation.
3.11     Engioeering Plastics Market:  EngineerJng polymers are just being
introduced in India. Their demand would depend on performance of the
manufacturing sector, such as the use of structural materials in electrical
and electronics, automotive and consumer durables, and building and
construction sectors of the Indian economy, and the rate of substitution of
engineering plastics for metals for new and existing applications. Because
consumption of engineering polymers in India is in its early growth phase, it
is expected to grow at several times GDP growth, Demand would be particularly
driven by the need for better parts in the automotive and consumer appliances
industries where there is an urgent demand for increasing local content. Bank
staff demand projection for PC and PPO is given in Table 3.4. The projected
demand is more than adequate for absorbing domestic production that would be
produced when the project is completed. With the help of General Electric
Plastics (USA), which is a joint partner in tl,e proposed engineering polymers
sub-project (para. 6.02), IPCL plans to import the relevant raw matetial to
develop the market. Considering the projected growth of the user industries
and IPCL's marketing and technical competence, developing the market for PC
and PPO to accommodate the output of the project is not expected to be
difficult.
C. Market Development Program
3.12     As shown in Table 3.4, India's consumption and production of
commodity plastics is projected to grow rapidly. For most products, demand is
projected to exceed domestic supply capabilities. However, the projected
demand is predicated on active market development efforts being made to
promote new applications and to sustain and expand traditional ones. Given
the limited domestic polymer production and range of product grades, such
market development efforts would require imports of polymers to provide for
assured raw materials supply to downstream processors. Over the last three
years, IPCL has been making concerted p-omotional efforts to develop end-use
applications for the type of products that would be produced by the MGCC.
Using proceeds from the US$90 million World Bank loan (2505-IN) earmarked for
pre-production imports of commodity plastics, IPCL has imported about 67,000
tons of LDPE, HDPE, PP and LLDPE during 1986-88. However, to develop the
market base adequately so that the output of MGCC can be readily absorbed and
ensure rapid capacity build-u? soon after start-up, IPCL will need to continue
promoting new applications for LLDPE, PP, PBR and HDPE grades.
3.13     Linear Low Density Polyethylene:  LLDPE, the new generation polymer,
would be manufactured for the first time in India by MGCC. A 135,000 tpy
plant capable of producing both LLDPE and HDPE is being constructed and is
expected to be commissioned by early 1991. At present, Indian consumption of
LLDPE is in blend with LDPE for general purpose film extrusion. 100% LLDPE
applications (such as for thin gauge film, injection moulding, roto moulding,
etc.), which have become the major end-uses of LLDPE internationally, are yet
to be adequately developed in India, To promote the use of LLDPE in these
applications, IPCL (with the help of BP Chemicals) is conducting workshops and
seminars to disseminate know-how, including the design features of extruders.
Standard designs of extruders for 100% LLDPE film have already been provided
to machinery manufacturers. To complement these technical developments and



-21-
ensure that the quantities made available from MGCC are readily absorbed, IPCL
(during 1990-92) will need to import about 35,000 tons of LLDPE.
3.14     High Density Polyethylene:  Existing demand for HDPE as a whole is
adequate to absorb domestic production through the early 1990s. However,
narrow molecular weight HDPE grades based on a gas based fluid bed process
would be produced for the first time when the MCCC plant comes on stream by
1991. In order to familiarize the Indian market with these grades, which are
quite different from the grades of HDPE currently produced and consumed in
India, IPCL will need to import up to 15,000 tons of narrow molecular weight
HDPE grades during 1990-92. To prove the suitability of these grades for
injection and blow moulding as well as propagate the use of gas based HDPE for
film and roto moulding applications, active promotional efforts and adequate
availability of material would be essential.
3.15     PolyproDylene:  Present domestic production capability of PP is not
adequate to meet domestic demand. The situation is, however, expected to
change once the new MGCC plant comes on stream and increased quantity of PP
would be made available. While consumption of PP in existing applications
would continue to grow, there is a need for a concerted market development
efforts to promote the use of PP in new applications to ensure early
absorption of the new capacity in MGCC.  PP applications in woven sacks for
commodity packaging, fine denier fiberE and multifilaments for apparels, and
PP usage for blow moulded bottles will need to be developed. Up to now, the
major constraint in the use of PP for most of these uses has been che non-
availability of appropriate grades in sufficient quantities, as well as non-
availability of suitable machines.  This is particularly the case for woveil
sacks for commodity packaging. To develop these applications and ensure rapid
production build up of the PP plant in MGCC soon after start-up in mid-1990,
it would be necessary to import about 10,000 tons of appropriately chosen
grades of PP during 1990-91.

3.16     In summary, to develop adequately the market base for commodity
plastics that would be produced in MGCC so as to ensure early absorption of
the complex's output, IPCL would reed to import the quantities indicated in
Table 3.5 above. This is in addition to the imports that would be made using
the remaining balance in Loan 2505-IN. These imports during 1990-92 backed by
IPCL's concerted product and market development activities are critical for
ensuring adequate expansion of the market base for new grades of polymers
(LLDPE, HDPE, PBR and PP) that would be introduced in India for the first time
when MCCC is commissioned in 1990-91 and the proposed expansion of the
butadiene/polybutaduene complex under the project is completed by 1994-95.
IPCL has already furnished to the Bank its revised market development plan for
LLDPE, HDPE, PBR, and PP (including the intended use of the proceeds of the
US$75 million allocated for market seeding) and agreed to review the plan by
January 31, 1992 and inform the Bank the results of this review.

IV. PROJECT SPONSORS AND BENEFICIARIES
A. Indian Petrochemical Corporation Limited
Operation and Historical Evolution
4.01     The project sponsor for the main investment component of the project
is IPCL, a large public-sector undertaking fully owned by the Government of
India. The company was incorporated in March 1969 under the Indian Companies
Act. Its main objective is to develop domestic production of petrochemical
products. IPCL built and operates a large multiproduct complex in Vadodara,
Gujarat, which commenced operations in April 1973. It has the largest
ethylene cracker now in operation in India.
4.02     The Vadodara complex has been continuously expanded and upgraded over
the past 15 years and now produces about a dozen products plus making inter-
mediate products such as ethylene and propylene. IPCL is also building a
second major complex in Nagothane, Maharashtra, that is now under construc-
tion. That project is being assisted with World Bank financing (Loan No.
2505-IN).
4.03     The company overall has an excellent performance record.  Clearly, it
is one of the hest public-sector enterprises and compares favorably with large
private firms in India including those in the petrochemical industry. It has
not depended on GOI budgetary support since 1981 and has paid a dividend of
Rs. 186 million annually over the past 3 years. Its total cash contribution
to the national plan was Rs. 4.7 billion in 1988/89.
Management Structure
4.04      IPCL's management is competent and stable.  It has had six Managing
Directors since its inception IN 1969. Most senior management positions are
filled with experienced staff from within IPCL or with extensive experience in
other commercial or industrial enterprises. GOI's interaction with the
company is minimal and generally only at the policy, corporate plan and
investment strategy level acting through the Board of Directors. The
corporate and plant-level management are fully responsible for day-to-day
operations and for achieving annual plan targets once they are agreed.
4.05     The company's Board of Directors has adequate powers to provide
policy directions to company executives including authorization of operating
and capital budgets and guidance on employment and compensation policies.
Approval of the GOI is required only in case IPCL needs to borrow for capital
requirements. Board members include five professional senior full-time
managers of the company. The Board also includes two private-sector
businessmen and two others from outside the Government. The current Chairman/
Managing Director appointed in 1989 was previously the Director of Marketing
of IPCL.
4.06     Government of India and Indian Petrochemical Limited has already
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for 1989-90, which grants
additional autonomy and responsibility to the company. This MOU is similar
to those GOI has signed with Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAiL) and Bharat
Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL), two other successful public-sector enterprises.
Current GOI policy is to expand the number of agreements with other public-
sector firms concentrating initially on the more successful ones. The MOU
outlines the financial and physical performance targets, investment program



-23-
and financing plan on an annual basis. In particular, it will (a) fully
delegate day-to-day operation to the company mdnagement, (b) permit the
company to retain Rs 50 Cr per year of earnings to spend with Board approval
only, and (c) provide that after annual budget review, no further GOI approval
would be required regarding funds. The GOI agrees not to interfere with
management decisions and the management of the company agrees to deliver the
targets. Considering the growing complexity of its operations, the ongoing
gradual liberalization of the Indian industrial policy environment and the
increasing competition it is expected to face from private firms currently
investing in the sector, the Bank believes that this MOU will enable IPCL
management to respond efficiently to future competitive challenges. According
current GOI policy, the MOU will be renewed annually and reviewed periodically
to take into account changes in IPCL's long term goals and corporate strategy.
Organization
4.07     IPCL is organized along functional lines into six departments:
Projects, Operations, Finance, Administration and Personnel, Research and
Development (R&D), and Marketing. The departments are headed by full-time
functional directors. The Projects Department is responsible for IPCL's new
projects and a major program of plant revamping and modernization is under
way. The Department is responsible for project planning. The Operations
Department, the Finance and Administration and Personnel Departments discharge
the standard functions pertaining to their fields. IPCL's R&D Department,
with about 40 scientists, undertakes applied research to improve prccess
parameters and economics and develop processes for byproduct utilization. The
company's financial and operations planning are well organized and adequatelv
monitored through an Executive Committee of senior managers, following
techniques which include standard costing and variance analysis. The company
has also implemented a long-term corporate program that is continually
updated. This program enables the company to respond satisfactorily to the
rapidly changing technology in petrochemicals and to the major growth in the
domestic market.
4.08     The Marketing Department carries out its product promotion and sales
responsibilities through a netwcrk of regional offices in Vadodara, Bombay,
Bangalore, New Delhi and Calcutta. Actual sales to IPCL's 10,000 customers
are conducted through 48 distributors who are each located with..n a 100-km
radius from its customers. The products are sold at all distribution points
at uniform prices. The Department's Product Applications Center is
responsible for customer training, product testing and new applications, and
communications.
Staff and Training
4.09     IPCL's total staff at present numbers about 8,200, including 2,600
professionals and qualified technicians. These figures include staff for
township and social services. Because of its high professional reputation and
competitive compensation packages, IPCL has been able to attract and retain
competent staff at all levels. IPCL has extensive in-house training
facilities which plan and run programs for training technical and other staff,
often with the assistance of specialized consulting firms. Project and
operating staff are generally trained before starting up of plants entailing
new technologies. IPCL therefore has a fully trained work force competent to
operate and maintain large petrochemical facilities.

Future Growth
4.10     Government policy in the sector encourages both public- and private-
sector growth. IPCL is encouraged to expand, but it has instructions not to
utilize GOI budgetary support and has not done so since 1980/81. IPCL's
expected growth pattern over the next five to ten years is based on expansion/
modernization of present facilities, development of new product lines and
joint ventures, and technology transfer/development. Even with this growth
pattern, IPCL's share of the petrochemical sector will decline over the next
ten years, primarily because of the expanding market and the large number of
private firms that are investing in new production capacities. IPCL's
strategy is to maintain a major market presence, primarily in basic polymers
and in new product groups.
B. Central Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technoloev
Objectives and ORerations
4.11     CIPET was established in 1968 in Madras by the Government of India
with the assistance of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). It was
set up to provide manpower training and technical assistance to the plastic
processing industry. The Institute has been providing to industry (i)
technical manpower training (theory and practical) on plastic processing; (ii)
guidance in the design and manufacturing of molds, tools and dies; (iii)
advisory services in processing techniques, testing of products and materials,
manufacturing of processing equipment, and development of new products; and
(iv) assurances on quality control standards for plastic materials and
products.
4.12     Training:  CIPET offers both short and long term training courses.
The short term courses (including seminars and one-three week refresher
courses), are designed to meet the needs of skilled personnel with some
experience in the plastics industry.  They are offered in specific areas of
application on demand and are appreciated by industry as means of updating
specific areas of knowledge and trends in technology.  The long term courses,
on the other hand, are designed to develop basic theoretical and practical
training in plastic engineering and technology.
4.13     At present. a total of seventeen long term courses are being offered.
All of these courses and the Institute's teaching staff are of world-class
quality. In fact, CIPET is considered by the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) and International Labor Organization (ILO) as
a suitable training institute for developing countries. It is also well
regarded by Indian Universities as an institute for condu-ting research in
plastic engineering technology.
4.14        As of today, the Institute is unable to cope with the demand for
its graduates, despite increases in enrollment over the years. Enrollment in
1988/1989 was 340 students, and was projected to increase by 30% per year for
the next few years. Further, recognizing the projected demand for its
services derived from the planned expansion of the plastic industry, the
Governing Council of CIPET has decided to broaden and diversify CIPET's
geographic coverage by opening additional applicacion centers. To better
serve their customers, the centers will specialize on catering to inaividual
sub-sectors (such as appliances, agriculture, automotive and transport
equipment, electronics, etc) that are expanding in their respective locations.
The Bank loan included in the proposed project is intended to strengthen CIPET
to gear up to meet the rapidly growing demand from industry.



-25-
4.15     Ouality Control:  CIPET works with the Indian Standards Institute
(ISI) and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in establishing and reviewing
national standards and norms concerning quality of plastic resins and finished
products. Its quality tests for commodity polymers and evaluation methods are
accepted by ISI as industry norms. The Institute also provides testing,
inspection and evaluation of materials, mold designs, and finished products to
private industry, and is involved in monitoring the quality standards for the
plastics industry as a whole. Recognizing the need of material and product
testing for ensuring product quality, CIPET (with ass-stance of UNDP/UNIDO) in
1977 established a Plastic Testing Center (PTC). The Center is equipped with
a broad range of testing facilities (including a pilot plant) that are needed
for testing and evaluation for quality standardization. It has been useful in
analyzing plastic materials for the sector, broadening the scope of the
services offered by the Institute.
4.16      Research and DeveloRment:  CIPET was recently designated by the
Department of Science and Technology to lead research and development in
plastic products and applications. To this effect, it has initiated imports
of equipment to strengthen its research capabilities. Part of the equipment
financed by the proposed Bank loan to the Institute in this project is to be
deployed for this purpose.
Organization and Management Structure
4.17     The Institute is organized along functional lines into six depart-
ments. Five of these departments ( Design, Tooling, Testing, Processing, and
Product Development) are of technical nature, and the sixth is Administration
and Finance. Besides Madras (which is the headquarters), the Institute at
present has four centers (Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Hyderabad, and Orissa). Each
technical department has a training and consultancy function in its own areas
of specialty.
4.18     The management of the Institute is constituted by a 15 member
Governing Council. It includes representatives from the Department of
Petrochemicals, the Ministry of Education, and the plastics industry. The
Council has adequate powers to provide policy directions to the Institute and
its Centers. Operational management of the Institute and its four Centers is
the responsibility of the General Director who is also the Chief Executive of
all the four centers. The office term of the General Director is five years
and is appointed by the the Ministry of Industry at the recommendation of the
Secretary of the Department of Petrochemicals. The day to day operations of
each department and center,in turn, are run by a Director who reports to the
General Director of the Institute. All senior management and technical
positions are staffed with adequately trained people, experienced in different
aspects of the plastic processing industry.
CIPET's Finances
4.19     CIPET's administration and finances are organized under a separate
department. Most of the Institute's current operations (in Madras as well as
the four application centers) are financed by GOI grants, both as Plan and
Non-Plan budgets. It is, however, gradually succeeding in increasing revenues
generated by the sale of its services to industry to help cover an increasing
share of its annual recurrent expenditures. During 1987-88, the institute
received Rs. 6.8 million in grants from GOI and generated Rs. 2.9 million from
the sale of services it rendered to industry, against total recurrent budget
of Rs. 9.7 million. Thkis means that the Institute has already achieved 30%



-26-
self-financing on recurrent expenditure basis. As the demand for its services
grow vith projected expansion of the plastic processing industry over the next
five years, CIPET's capabilities to deliver needed services and its internal
resources generation is projected to increase at the rate of about 40% per
annum, covering up to 45% of its estimated recurrent expenditure in 1991-92.
The Bank's assistance vould help the Institute in achieving the projected
targets.

V. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. Obiectives and Components
5.01     The main objectives of the proposed pro4ect are to: (i) expand
capacity to produce basic petrochemicals acorxomically; and (ii) improve
efficiency and quality of downstream plastic. products. In addition, the
project would support the Government in its efforts to improve further the
incentive framework for the sizable investments being considered for the
petrochemical sector. The proposed project consists of the following three
components:
(a)  Investments CouRonent:  six individual investments are being
considered for implementation by IPCL to optimize operations and
enhance the economic returns of the Nagothane and Vadodara
petrochemical complexes. These investments are:
(i)  Expansion of the MGCC cracker at Nagothane from 300 to 400
thousand tpy of ethylene capacity and expansion of the LLDPE/
HDPE plant (in the same location) to include a 75,000 tpy broad
range molecular weight HDPE train using ethylene from the
proposed expansion;
(ii) Setting up a second phase 12,500 tpy wires/cables polyethylene
compounding unit at Nagothane, doubling the capacity of the
wires/cables unit currently being implemented to 25,000 tpy;
(iii) Setting up a new 7,500 tpy engineering plastics unit at Vadodara
for the manufacture of blends and composites of polycarbonate
and polyphenylene oxide;
(iv)  Setting up a new 60,000 tpy polypropylene unit at the Vadodara
complex adjacent to the existing old and small unit which IPCL
is planning to shut down;
(v)  Rehabilitation and expansion to 50,000 tpy of IPCL's existing
butadiene (BDI) extraction and polybutadiene rubber complex in
Vadodara to utilize the additional production of butadiene in
Nagothane; and
(vi) Implementation of debottlenecking and equipment modernization
schemes consisting of investments in several existing plants at
both the Vadodara and Nagothane complexes, including
improvements in the waste treatment facilities. A list of the
sub-projects included is given in Annex 5.1.
(b)  Technical Assistance Component:  strengthening of CIPET through
financing of imports of testing and training equipment and overseas
training of key personnel who will teach CIPET sponsored courses.
The objective is to upgrade and expand CIPET's capabilities to
respond effectively to the manpower and mold design needs of the
small and medium size private plastic processors in India.



-28-
(c)  Market DeveloDment Component:   financing imports of commodity
plastics (special grades of LLDPE, PP, PBR, and HDPE) for IPCL's
market seeding program. Tne objective is to supply the market
adequately to allow plastic processors to maintain and expand their
production facilities which would help ensure early absorption of the
outpuit of new grades of polymers that would be produced for the first
time in India by IPCL.
B. Project CQost
5.02     The total investmpr't cost oV the project is ertimated at about US$567
million equivalent, including physical and price conitingencies, working
capital, and interest during construction..J    A breakdown of this cost by
categories and project components is shown in Table 5.1 below.
5.03     IPCL's Investments:  The base cost estimates for IPCL's investments
component have been derived from project feasibility reports submitted to the
Bank by the Government.  Based on preliminary suppliers' quotations for key
equipment and IPCL's and EIL's data base, the total base cost estimate (in
February 1989 prices) of the investments included in the project is estimated
at about US$344 million equivalent. Working capital requirements of US$43
million, physical and price conLingerncies of US$86 million and interest during
construction of US$26.0 million have been added to arrive at the total cost of
US$499 million equivalent for the proposed investments at the Vadodara and
Nagothane complexes. About 33% (US$166.8 million) of tlis total cost is
expected to be in direct foreign exchange. Physical contingencies have been
estimated based on th. expe-;iices of IPCL and EIL gained during implementa-
tion of the MCCC complex and on average represent about 12% of the base cost
estimate. Price contingencies have been estimated based on the phasing of
expenditures consistent with the implementation schedule for each sub-project
and local and international inflation rates as projected by the Bank.
Domestic inflation assumed is 9% for FY89, 8% for FY90, 7% for FY91-93, and
6.5% for FY94-95. International inflation assumed is 5.3% for FY89-90, 5.0%
for FY91 and 4.1% for FY92-95. The total cost includes an estimated US$112.3
million equivalent for import duties and taxes.
5.04     CIPET's Component:  The hase cost estimate for the training and
extension component has bcen estimated at US$9.8 million equivalent, of which
88% would finance imports of training and analytical equipment. The remaining
balance would finance overseas training of key CIPET staff and additional
buildings to house the new equipment. The total cost of the training
component, including US$3.2 million equivalent for physical and price
contingencies, is estimated at US$13.0 million equivalent, of which about
US$12 million is in foreign exchange. Allowance for price contingencies have
been estimated based on the same assumptions regarding local and international
inflation rates as in the case of IPCL's investments above. Physical
contingencies have been computed based on CIPET's own assessment and they
represent about 15% of the base cost of training and equipment that would be
financed by the project.
1/ The Project was appraised in February 1989. The project cost and
financing plan estimates are based on prices and exchange rate that
were prevailing then.

-30-
5.05     Market DeveloRment ComDonent:  The minimum value of imports of new
grades of LLDPE, PP, PBR, and HDPE required for market development is given in
Table 3.6 (Chapter III). Based on this volume and the projected CIF prices
that are expected to prevail during FY90-92 for these products, the value of
polymer imports required for market development by IPCL is estimated to be
about US$75 million.
C.  Financing P Af
5,06      The proposed financing plan includes Bank loan's of US$245 millioni,
of which a luan of US$233 million to IPCL would finance most of the foreign
exchange costs of IPCL's investments (including US$75 million for imports of
commodity plastics, US$11 million of incremental working capital and abeut
US$26 million of capitalized interest during construction). The Bank would
finance interest during construction as IPCL will experience cash-flow
shortages during the construction period prior to the time when production
increases as a result of the proposed capacity expansion. The loan of US$12
million to the Government would finance testing and training equipment and
overseas training of staff for CIPET. The local financing gap of about
US$332.2 million equivalent for IPCL's investments would be met from its own
internal resources. There is no need for budgetary support for IPCL for
completing the financing plan for the project. Its projected internal cash
generation during project implementation is adequate to cover the financing
gap, after meeting its financial commitments for ongoing projects and routine
capital expenditures. US$8.8 million foreign exchange financing gap would be
met by General Electric Plastics (USA) as a contribution to the joint venture
with IPCL in the engineering poly!niers sub-project. For CIPET, the Government
through budgetary appropriations would provide US$1 million equivalent to
complete the local financing for this component. The financing plan for the
proposed project is shown in Table 5.2 below.

5.07     Lending Terms:  A Bank loan of US$233 million would be made directly
to IPCL with the guarantee of the Government at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate for 20 years, including 5 years of grace. Of this amounc, US$75
million would finance imports of special grades of LLDPE, HDPE, PBR, and PP
for market seeding. The balance of US$158 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of investments in the Vadcdara and Nagothane complex included in
the project (para. 5.01). IPCL will bear the interest and exchange rate risk
associated with this part of the loan. Another Bank loan of US$12 million
having the same terms would be made to the Government. The proceeds of this
loan would be passed to CIPET as budgetary allocations to finance imports of
testing and training equipment anu overseas training of some of its key staff.

D. Technology and Engineering Arrangements
5.08     The project has three components as described in para. 5.01.  The
investment component is made up ot six different units that require
engineering, construction and maintenance skills. The technology and
engineering arrangements of these units are described below-:
(a)  Units at Nalothane: The technologies for the original MGCC have been
selected after undertaking an appropriate techno-economic evaluation
of internationally known, proven and available processes. Details on
the procedures adopted by IPCL in selecting these processes are
available in the Staff Appraisal Report of the Maharashtra Ga.
Cracker Complex ( World Bank Report, No. 4467-IN, February 15, 1985).
The sub-projects in the Nagothane complex included in this project
will use the same processes as in the original plants. That is, the
expansion of the cracker will use the same technology employed in the
basic configuration which has already been licensed by Stone and
Webster (USA). Similarly, the expansion of the high density
polyethylene (HDPE) and wire and cable units will use technology
licensed by BP Chemicals (UK), which is the original licensor of the
LLDPE and wire/cable plants under constrtuction. These license
arrangements are satisfactory.
(b)  Units at Vadodara:  Technology and engineering arrangeme.-ts for the
engineering polymers plant have been ,ecured by IPCL through a joint
venture with General Electric Plastics (USA). For the PP and PBR
sub-projects, IPCL after undertaking a techno-economic evaluation of
internationally available, proven technologies has selected the
Hymont (UK) process for PP and the Japan Synthetic Rubbe:s (Japan)
process for PBR. IPCL's existing production of PP is based on Hymont
technology, while its current PBR production is based on Polvsar
(USA) process. The process of technology selection followed and the
process technologies selected by IPCL arc considered appropriate and
satisfactory by the Bank.
5.09     Basic engineering for cll units will be supplied by the licensors.
Detailed engineering will be provided by Engineers India Limited (EIL), or
through turnkey arrangements acceptable to the Bank. EIL is a well
established engineering concern with proven capabilities and is already
providing engineering and procurement services to the Bank-financed
Maharashtra Petrochemical Project.21
E. Project Management and Implementation
5.10     Proiect Management:  IPCL will have primary responsibility for all of
its investments and will coordinate project implementation and day to day
management of all activities. Its Projects Department will be responsible for
(a) administration and supervision of the engineering contracts, (b) all
procurement matters, and (c) review and award of design, construction and
erection contracts. IPCL has adeq-iately qualified staff to undertake these
tasks without difficulties. The Bank is satisfied with the way IPCL is
implementing the Maharashtra Petrochemical Project.
2/ More information about EIL and its experiences in engineering,
procurement and general project management is available in the SAR of
the Maharashtra Petrochemical Project No. 4467-IN.



-32-
5.11     CIPET will have overall responsibility for its training component,
including importing, setting up, and operation of the training and analytical
equipment and the management of overseas training of its staff. An
experienced project coordinator has already been hired to look after the
project, handle all procurement matters and administer overall project
execution. In addition, the Institute has qualified staff able to handle the
setting up and operation of the testin& and training equipment that would be
imported. During negotiations, CIPET submitted to the Bank its FY90-93 annual
training and extension program and agreed to arrange staff training with
overseas institutions satisfactorv to the Bank.  That is, fellows will be
placed in overseas training institutions cn the basis of relevance and quality
of program offered, costs and experience subject to prior review by the Bank.
For monitoring progress made in implementing this project component, CIPET
also agreed to furnish the Bank its annual training and extension program
starting by June 30, 1991, and every year thereafter until completion of
project implementation. The Bank project staff are satisfied that CIPET has
the capacity to implement the Technical Assistance Component of the proposed
project without difficulty.
5.12     ImRlementation Schedule:  The project will be implemented over a
period of four years. The implementation schedule for the major investments
is shown in Annex 5.2. The implementation periods for all project components
at the Nagothane complex (expansion of the cracker, HDPE and wire/cable units)
i.nd the PP projects at Vadodara are estimated to be 36 months. The
engineering polymers unit will be implemented in 24 months. The butadiene
(BD) and PBR expansion has an imple- mentation period of 40 months.   And the
technical assistance component for CIPET will be implemented in 36 months.
Given this imp'ementation schedule, all project components are expected to be
in operation ly end of 1993.
F. Raw Material. Utilities and Infrastructure
5.13     Utilities/Infrastructure:  All the proposed investments will be
implemented at the Nagothane and Vadodara petrochemical complexes owned and
operated by IPCL. As a result, they benefit from already existing
infrastructure, utilities, and auxiliary facilities. No additional
expenditure would be needed to accommodate the requirements of the proposed
investments for water, power, steam, roads/railways, or communications
facilities. All of these are already provided for in the respective complexes
where the proposed investments would be located. However, the additional use
of C2/C3 in MGCC will require expansion of the cryogenic tanks and the
transport system which was originally designed to handle only the requirements
of the first project.  Also, to utilize the propylene and butadiene produced
from the expansion of the MGCC cracker in Nagothane for the production of
propylene and polybutadiene rubber in Vadodara, there is a need for new
storage and shipping/receiving terminals in Nagothane and Vadodara as well as
the setting up of a butadiene extraction plant for supplying the feedstock
requirements of the expanded polybutadiene plant in Vadodara.
5.14     Raw Material Availability:  The project investment components will
produce (as marketable output) HDPE, PP, PBR, wire/cable compounds, and
engineering plastics (blends and composites of polycarbonates and
polyphenylene oxides). The additional production of ethylene, propylene, and
butadiene produced by the expansion of the MGCC cracker, will be used to
supply all or part of the raw materials to the new HDPE plant, to the new and
the existing PP plants and to the revamped PBR plant. The wires/cables plant



-33-
under the proposed project would be based on polyethylene produced within the
MCCC complex at Nagothane. Production of engineering plastics, on the other
hand, would be based on imports of polycarbonates, polyphenylene oxides and
polystyrene. Considering the small amounts needed to meet project
requirements, importing the required amounts of polycarbonates, polystyrene
and polyphenylene oxides for the proposed output of engineering plastics is
not expected to pose a problem.
5.15     The feedstock for the expansion of the MCCC cracker is the
ethane/propane (C2/C3) separated from the Bombay High offshore natural gas
separated at the ONGC natural gas processing terminal at Uran.  Th:e supply of
these feedstocks will be supplemented by propane separated from the refinery
gas fractions at Bharat and Hindustan Petroleum Corporations near Bombay.
Given the availability of offshore natural gas reserves, and the outlook for
demand from competing users, the supply of feedstock will not be a problem.
However, ONGC will need to expand (through debottlenecking) the capacity of
the gas separation plant in Uran to supply the ethane/propane requircments of
the expanded cracker. During negotiations, GOI agreed with the Bank that it
would, through ONGC, take the necesrary steps to complete capacity expansion
(through debottlenecking) of the gas separation plant at Uran to meet the
C2/C3 feedstock requirements of the expanded MGCC cracker.
G. Procurement and Disbursemert Plan
5.16     Procurement:  All procurement of equipment and materials financed
from the loans will be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Imports of polymers (LLDPE, PP, PBR, and
HDPE) for market seeding under the proiect will be procured by IPCL in
economic shipping sizes by ICB. Exceptions to ICB will be made for (a)
equipment and license fees proprietary to the process design and sole-source
equipment with an estimated value of US$7.0 million to be procured by direct
purchase (for methods of selection of technologies see para. 5.09); and
(b) items with an estimaced value of less than US$200,000 each to be procured
under limited international bidding (LIB) procedures from known qualified
suppliers from Bank member countries. The aggregate equipment and material
contracts financed under the Bank loan by direct purchase and limited
international bidding are not expected to exceed US$54 million equivalent../
In accordance with Bank guidelires, qualified local suppliers will receive a
margin of preference of 15%, or the applicable duty level (whichever is
lower), for purposes of bid evaluation under ICB. All contracts for equipment
and materials estimated to cost over US$750,000 and all contracts for
engineering services financed under the loan to IPCL will be subject to the
Bank's prior review. Similarly, contracts above $500,000 for the CIPET
component will also be subject to a prior review by the Bank. This will
result in an estimated coverage of about 70% of the total value of Bank-
firanced contracts. Procurement of equipment and materials for IPCL will be
through standard bid documents already agreed upon in connection with Loan
2505-IN. A list of equipment packages ':o be procured under the Bank loan is
shown in Annex 5.3. A summary of the procurement methods to be followed is
shown in Table 5.3 below.
iJ  Including US$7 million for equipment; US$32.4 million for license fee
basic engineering and US$3.2 million for pre-operating expenses, and
11.0 million for incremental working capital.

5.17    Loan Disbursement:  The Bank loans would be disbursed for (a) 100%
foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for
equipment and material, (b) 100% foreign expenditures for licenses and
engineering services, (c) 100% foreign expenditures for overseas training, (d)
100% foreign expenditures for materials (such as LLDPE, PP, PBR, HDPE and
other products as may be agreed by the Bank) for market development of up to
US$75 million; and (e) interest during construction (for IkCL's loan excluding
the market seeding component) of up to US$26.0 million. Disbursements would
be made against full documentat'on except for contracts for overseas training
valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent and contracts for equipment and
materials valued below US$500,000 for which disbursements would be made
against statements of expenditures (SOEs).



-35-
5.18    Documents in support of SOEs will be retained by IPCL and CIPET and
made available to the Bank for review upon request. The disbursement schedule
for the project is shown in Annex 5.4. It is similar to observed performance
for Bank financed industrial projects in the Asia Region. The disbursement of
the loan for imports of polymers will be over a period of three years,
1990-92.  This is consistent with the needs of the Indian market for comodity
plastics (the specified grades of HDPE, LLDPE, PBR, and PP) for the required
market seeding program. To facilitate disbursements, special accounts will be
established by GOI and IPCL with authorized allocat:ons of US$1 and US$20
million, respectively. These amounts are based on four months average
estimated expenditure which is the current Bank standard. The loan closing
date will be September 30, 1996.
H. Environmental Aspects
5.19    The planned rapid expansion of the petrochemical industry based on a
large number of imported processes and technologies and the disaster of the
pesticides plant at Bhopal have resulted in increased awareness of the
potential adverse environmental impact of petrochemical operations. Hence,new
industrial projects are subjected to close environmental scrutiny and strict
pollution control measures to reduce harmful affluents to acceptable levels
while at the source. Under existing Indian regulations, all major industrial
projects must receive environmental clearance from the respective state
pollution boards befora final investment approval is issued. Consent to
establish is given after the adverse effects of the expected affluents are
assessed and planned measures to control, or abate, their harmful effects to
meet established India standards are considered adequate. As for pollution
from existing industrial operations, the GOI provided a buffer period for
compliance by industry recognizing the time required to meet these standards.
As of December 1988, about 55% of the more than 4000 medium and large size
chemical plants were in compliance, or in the process of complying, with these
standards. IPCL is one of the companies that is in full compliance.
5.20    Record of IPCL:  IPCL's record on environmental awareness and
protection is very good. The Vadodara based operation has an environmental
task force with responsibilities for water treatment, air emissions and
monitoring and waste disposal. Reports on the environmental situation at the
complex is routinely kept and updated by management. Beyond strict adherence
to environmental guidelines, IPCL has also created a polishing pond for
treated water and is in the process of setting up tertiary water treatment
facility. A toxic release warning and preventior system and a large green
belt are also installed and maintained by the company. For its exemplary
initiatives in protecting the environment, IPCL won the 1988 Environmental
Merit Award from the Government. Arrangements, which are similar to those
IPCL has implemented in Vadodara, are currently being implemented at the
Nagothane complex. The Bank is satisfied with IPCL's commizment to protecting
the environment. The steps it has already taken and the provisions it has
made in the context of -i,e expansions in the proposed project to treat waste
associated with its operations are satisfactory to the Bank.
5.21    A summary of the environmental effects of the various project
components and the provisions made for abatement of pollution is given in
Annex 5.5. To determine the effect of the proposed expansions and
construction of new plants included in this project, IPCL produc^d a
comprehensive environmental impact assessment report for each complex. The
reports show the nature of the pollutants that would be produced and measures
to be taken to increase the capacity of the waste treatment plants within each



-36-
complex to handle the increased pollution loads. These reports were submitted
to and reviewed by the Bank and were found to be satisfactory. During
negotiations, IPCL also agreed to:
(i) design and operate project facilities to meet the relevant Indian and
local environmental discharge standards for liquid, gaseous and solid
wastes;
(ii) monitor plant operations, affluent streams and the ambient
environment to test if standards are being met and to take
corrective measures if they are not;
(iii) design and operate the facilities to meet the relevant Indian
national and local occupational health and safety standards;
(iv) conduct a thorough safety - risk assessment and incorporate
recommendations in the design of the expansions; a report on this
will be ready by December 1990 for the expansions at Nagothane and by
September 1991 for the expansions at Vadodara; and
(v)  prepare a detailed safety manual for all project components not later
than one year after commencement dates.
5.22     Petrochemical products are non-biodegradable.  This raises an issue
concerning proper disposal after the use of these products. In this regard,
recycling of used materials and production of high value, durable petro-
chemical products are good practices and should be encouraged where
appropriate. In India, there is already a high recycling rate of used plastic
materials. This is partly due to non-availability of virgin materials and the
high prices for virgin commodity plastics. The introduction of engineering
polymers by IPCL under the proposed project will trigger production of durable
products, restricting the volume of disposable plastic products in the Indian
market.  Both IPCL and CIPET are taking steps to promote higher value products
and recycling of used plastics in order to minimize the release of non-
degradable materials into the environment.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. India Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd.
Past Results and Present Position
6.01      IPCL is a well managed company with a sound financial position. Its
financial performance for the five years 1984/85 through 1988/89 is summarized
below and given in greater detail in Annex 6.1. Its operations for the past
five years were characterized by average annual growth of 18% and 16% in net
sales revenues and net income, respectively. These growth rates were due to
an increase in production resulting from commissioning of new downstream
plants and continuing improvement in capazity utilization. Net income in-
creased from Rs 504 million in FY85 to Rs 896 million in FY89. Internal cash
generation du.ing the period totaled Rs 5,441 million. This high level of
internal resource generation has enabled IPCL to undertake projects without
recourse tc GOI's budgetary support. IPCL's capital expenditure during the
period amounted to Rs 12,590 million, of which Rs 4,476 million, or 36%, was
financed with internally generated funds. The balance, Rs 8,114 million, was
covered by borrowings, including Rs 2,166 million equivalent from the Bank
loan for the Maharashtra petrochemical project.

-38-
6.02     As a result of the financing arrangements described above, the debt/
equity ratio has risen from a very conservative level of 9:91 in March 1985 to
59:41 in March 1989. The current ratio has been satisfactory throughout the
period. Besides generating funds to finance its own growth, IPCL has been
generating substantial revenues for the Government in the forms of excise
duties, customs duties, sales taxes, corporate income taxes and dividends.
Contributions to the Exchequer during the past 5 years totaled Rs 14.7
billion, about 1.2 times IPCL's investment for the same period.
Future Financial Performance
6.03     Financial projections for IPCL have been prepared in current terms on
a consolidated basis combining the operations of the Vadodara complex, the
Maharashtra gas cracker complex now under construction, and the various
components included in the proposed project.
6.04     Sales Volume and Revenue.  As the Maharashtra gas cracker complex,
the various components of the proposed project and a number of other expansion
schemes at the Vadodara complex are scheduled to come into operation during
the forecast period, IPCL's sales volume is projected to increase substan-
tially, from 384,000 tons in 1988/89 to 929,000 tons in 1994/95, representing
an average annual growth of 16%. In value terms, its aggregate sales revenue
(in current prices) is projected to increase from Rs.10,478 to Rs.36,537
million duiring the same period. This revenue projection is based on the
assumption that ex-plant output prices would remain at their 1988 levels in
real terms and follow the local inflation rates in current terms, except for
PBR whose price was assumed to be 30% above its CIF value starting in 1993.
6.05     Product Prices and Protection.  Indian polyolefins and other plastic
product prices were only about 10-15 % higher than the border prices of
comparable products during 1988-89. That is, they were substantially below the
duty paid import-parity price levels implied by the prevailing import tariffs
applicable to these products. International prices for petrochemicals are,
however, expected to decline to their respective long-term equilibrium prices
by 1.995 when supply and demand reach a balance. Actual and projected import-
parity prices (CIF west coast of India) fcr LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE, PP, PBR and EG,
which together would account for about 60% of IPCL's revenues by 1991/92, are
shown in annex 6.5. Prices are projected to fall by about 10-20% by around
1994-95 compared to 1988-89 average levels, before starting to rise again.
But, considering their volatility, estimates of the timing and the levels of
the equilibrium international prices must be viewed as tentative and used with
great caution. They have exhibited considerable volatility in the past and
they would likely do so in the future. For these reasons, domestic product
prices are assumed to remain constant at their 1988-89 average levels in real
terms. This would mean that the product-weighted nominal protection assumed
to be utilized by IPCL in the base case financial projections would be about
30-40% during the entire forecast period (annex 6.5). This level would be
well below current tariff levels (see Table 2.2) and are entirely due to the
25-40% higher investment cost arising from various fiscal levies on capital
goods ./ that would need to be compensated through higher output prices.
1/ Current custom duty rates on imported capital goods and materials such
as catalysts are at 90% and 140% of CIF value respectively.



-39-
However, considering the robustness of its base case financial projections,
IPCL could absorb a 10-20% cut in product prices and remain profitable. A
sensitivity test has been carried out to evaluate the impact of possible
downward movements of prices on IPCL's financial position (para. 6.10). It
shows that IPCL could withstand significant downward price movements without
major adverse impact on its financial position. In fact, IPCL would remain
financially viable, though with overall profitability and internal cash
generation substantially lower than the base case, even if tariff protection
for its output were to be completely withdrawn.
6.06      Investment ani Financing.  Total investment for the forecast period
is estimated to be about Rs 13.6 billion, of which the Maharashtra petro-
chemical project accounts for Rs 5.3 billion (39%), compared to Rs 6.9 billion
(51%) for the proposed project. About 84% of the planned investment is
projected to take place in the four-year period FY89/90-92/93, with average
annual investment on the order of Rs 2.8 billion. Financing for the remaining
capital expenditure of the ongoing Maharashtra Petrochemical project will be
provided by the remaining balance of the first IBRD loan (No. 2505-IN, US$35
million equivalent), EXIM Bank of Japan (US$120 million equivalent) and IPCL's
internal cash generation (US$210 million equivalent). For the rest of the
planned investments, financial projections indicate that cash flow would
develop steadily after the Maharashtra gas cracker complex comes into
operation in 1990/91 and IPCL would be able to self-finance the entire local
cost component of the proposed project and other investments at Vadodara.
However, due to the high levels of investment and self-financing requirements
for the four years FY89/90 thru FY92/93, IPCL's cash position is projected to
be tight. To provide some relief to this situation, the Bank has agreed to
include in the loan amount a provision of US$26 million equivalent for
financing interest during construction.
6.07     Financial Projections.  Based on the sales growth, prices and
investment and financing discussed above (and other assumptions set out in
Annex 6.3), IPCL's pro-forma financial statements for FY89/90-94/95, have been
prepared and are given in Annex 6.2.  The key financial cata are sunmmarized in
the following Table 6.2.
6.08     The financial projections indicate that iPCL's financial position
would strengthen significantly during the forecast period. Net fixed assets
will increase from Rs 3.5 billion in FY88/89 to Rs 15 billion in early 1990
when the Maharashtra gas cracker complex is commissioned. Net sales revenue
in current terms is projected to more than triple, increasing from Rs 8.4
billion in FY89/90 to Rs 28.7 billion in FY94/95 as a result of the increase
in sales volume and the change in the product mix towards high value-added
products. Income before tax would grow from Rs 1.6 billion in FY89/90 to
Rs 7.7 billion in FY94/95. Total internal cash generation during the period
is projected at Rs 28.5 billion, more than double the level of investment. As
annual capital expenditures taper off substantiallv after FY92/93, IPCL would
be in a cash surplus position with current ratio reaching 4.0 in FY93/94. The
debt/equity ratio is projected to improve to a more conservative level of
32:68 towards the end of the forecast period if IPCL does not prepay its debt,
whereas debt service coverage would be a minimum. of 2.3 times throughout the
period.

reflect possible downward movements in product prices. The key results of the
sensitivity test are s-mmarized in Table 6.3 above. These results indicate
that IPCL is not vulnerable to downward price movements as total internal cash
generation projected at Rs 23.5 billion would still be adequate to enable IPCL
to finance 60% of the planned investment. Its overall profitability, current,
debt/equity, and long-term debt service coverage ratios will remain at
satisfactory levels throughout the forecast period.
B. The Proposed Proiect Investments
Financial Rates of Return and Sensitivity Tests
6.10     The operating cost estimate for the five project components were
developed by IPCL based on comparable cost data at the Vadodara complex and
information provided by the licensors. The technical coefficients, including
specific consumption of raw materials, catalysts, power and other utilities,
compare fairly favorably with international standards. Detailed information
is available in the project file.
6.11     The financial rates of return for the five project components have
been calculated in real terms. With the exception of the engineering plastics
plant, the rates of return are calculated on an incremental basis. Detailed
financial cost and benefit streams and the assumptions used are given in Annex
6.4. For the base case, the ex-plant prices have been assumed to remain at
the 19P.8 levels in real terms throughout the project's life, with the
exception of ex-plant PBR price which is projected to increase from the
presently prevailing level of 1.1 CIF to 1.3 CIF beginning in early 1993 in
line with the expected market growth. The financial rates of return and
sensitivity tests are summarized below.

-42-
6.12     The high incremental financial rate of return (IFRR) for the
expansion of the gas cracker and the HDPE plant is due to the fact that
required investments for the separation trains to support the 400,000 tpy
ethylene production is already included in the first Maharashtra petrochemical
project. Also, this component would benefit by utilizing the available
processing capacity of the LLDPE/HDPE plant included in the first Maharashtra
project to convert 25,000 tpy of ethylene into HDPE. By comparison, the base
case financial rate of return for the first Maharashtra project is 21.2%.
Even if output prices were to fall by 20% compared to those assumed in the
base case, which is unlikely, the IFRR for these proposed investments would
remain still attractive as can be seen from Table 6.4.
6.13     The base case IFRRs for the investments on wire/cable compounds,
engineering plastics, and PP are also higher than for greenfield plants. This
is because half of these investments are for expansion and debottlenecking of
already existing plants and the basic infrastructure is already available. As
a result, the investment cost per unit of incremental output capacity
installed is relatively low compared to a grassroot plant, which is reflected
in the attractive IFRRs computed for each component. Again, sensitivity test
shows that these investments would remain financially attractive even if the
prices of their outputs were to fall by 20% in relation to the base case.
6.14     For the butadiene/PBR plant expansion, the base case IFRR though
adequate, is not as robust dS for the rest of the other investments. This is
because of strong competition from natural rubber which resulted in a slower
production build-up. The proposed expansion is, however, a significant step
forward in technology and scale of operation and would help IPCL to improve
its efficiency and maintain its competitiveness.
C. Financial Covenants and Reporting Requirements
6.15     To ensure that IPCL follows prudent financial practices in the
process of rapid growth so as to maintain its operational efficiency and
reduce its exposure to financial risks, the existing financial covenants
agreed under the first project financed by the Bank would be repeated under
the proposed project. During negotiations, it was agreed that IPCL it will
maintain on a consolidated basis (i) a long term debt to equity ratio noc
greater than 60:40; (ii) a current ratio of at least 1.3 after completion of
the Maharashtra Petrochemical Project; and (iii) a debt service coverage of at
least 1.5. Both IPCL and CIPET will have their annual accounts, statement of
expenditures and special account audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank, and will submit certified copies of the audited financial statements
together with the auditor's report within six months from the end of the
fiscal year under consideration. In addition, IPCL would be requested to
submit to the Bank quarterly financial statements for the proposed project
within 30 days from the end of each quarter and quarterly project progress
report within 15 days of the end of each quarter.

VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND RISKS
7.01     Benefits.  While the opportunity costs of Indian petrochemical
feedstock (gas oil, naphta, and natural gas liquids) is higher than in energy
surplus countries, its potentially large domestic market, availability of
natural gas resources, and low costs of technical manpower and labor provide
advantages for efficiently implemented investments in the sector to yield
adequate economic returns. The estimated good economic return of about 23%
(see Annex 7.1) for the MGCC complex which the Bank supported under the first
petrochemical project is a case in point. However, considering the overall
capital intensity and competitive nature of the world petrochemical industry
and India's lack of feedstock cost advantage, careful consideration must be
given to ensuring that only economic investments are undertaken. Also, to
ensure against market uncertainty and give flexibility to adjust supply at the
margin i:hrough imports, future investments in the sector should be confined to
producing 70-80% of the projected domestic market demand. India is not likely
to be able to become a major exporter of petrochemicals.
7.02     The investments included in the project are consistent with current
GOI efforts of increasing productivity through least cost capacity expansion,
optimizing the use of existing infrastructure, upgrading the scale of
industrial operations to the minimum economic size, and modernization of the
technology base of industry. All the investment components are economically
attractive and yield good economic return, and by producing petrochemical
derivatives efficiently will help in lowering overall input cost to industry.
The aggregate economic return (on capital invested in the components of the
project) has been calculated at about 37%. This attractive incremental return
is due to the fact that most of the investments are for plant expansion and
the availability of already developed infrastructure at both the Vadodara and
Nagothane complexes. The economic cash flows for the aggregate return and
those of the individual components are given in Annex 7.1.
7.03     The economic rates of return of the individual components have been
calculated in real terms using the same assumptions as for the financial rates
of return, except for (i) the exclusion of all identifiable duties and taxes,
and (ii) the use of shadow prices for inputs and outputs to reflect their
opportunity costs to the economy. Revenues of the individual components have
been calculated based on the projected CIF (Bombay) prices of the products
concerned since all project products are internationally tradeable. The C2/C3
for the gas cracker has been valued at its calorific value equivalent derived
from the projected CIF price of fuel oil (after adjustment for calorific
content) plus estimated costs of separation. A standard conversion factor of
0.8 has been applied to other locally supplied inputs. The base case economic
rates of return of each investment component and sensitivity tests on key
project parameters are given in Table 7.1 below. The results show that the
economic viability of all these components is robust under a range of adverse
assumptions as to capital costs, processing costs and output prices.

7.04     In addition to all its investment components yielding good economic
returns, the project also generates substantial other benefits in foreign
exchange saving, employment generation, stimulation of industrial output and
technology-transfer. During the productive life of its investment components,
the project will save foreign exchange in an amount estimated at US$240
million (in 1988 dollars) per annum. Direct employment for 678 people will be
created during the peak of project implementation, of which some 340 will
become permanent. Indirect employment created through forward linkages with
the local plastic processing industry is expected to generate some 3500
additional jobs, The project will also have backward linkages with the
domestic capital goods industry as part of the plant/equipment needed for the
investment components is expected to be supplied by local manufacturers,
stimulating higher capacity utilization, employment and investments. Local
engineering firms involved in project implementation will gain valuable know-
how and experience from the technology-transfer arrangements contracted
between IPCL and foreign technology suppliers, particularly in the area of
engineering plastics and the manufacture of polybutadiene rubber where modern
technology will be introduced to India for the first time. Further, through
the technical assistance component, the project will help in upgrading the
design and quality standards of Indian plastic products.
7.05     Risks.  No unusual risks are involved in the specific investments.
All contracted technologies are proven and IPCL has the technical and
institutional capability to absorb and manage these technologies. The
potential market ri-k arising from possible overexpansion of capacity would be
contained by the periodic reviews of investments in the sector, which the
Government has agreed to undertake. The favorable trends of input-output
prices reforms would also allow demand to grow and reduce the probability of
surplus capacity from developing. The Bank would through its policy dialogue
continue to encourage the Government adopt appropriate feedstock prices and
reduce protection levels as a basis of achieving its sectoral objectives.

VIII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Agreements
8.01     During negotiations, the Bank reached the following agreements with
GOI and IPCL. Together with the standard covenants governing Bank loans,
these agreements form the basis for providing the proposed loans to India and
IPCL.
8.02     The GOI agreed with the Bank that it will:
(i) review periodically, commencing in calender year 1991 and every
two calender years thereafter, the progress of investments in
Olefins and Aromatics complexes to assess their economic
viability. GOI also agreed to provide a copy and discuss the
results of these periodic reviews with the Bank (para. 3.08);
(ii)  review periodically the MES criteria established for
petrochemical products and intermediates taking into account
ongoing technological developments (para. 2.11);
(iii) maintain the appropriate price it established for ethane/propane

petrochemicals and inform the Bank of any proposed change therein
and afford the Bank an opportunity to comment on the proposed
change (para. 2.15);
(iv)  arrange for the timely supply of adequate quantities of feedstock
to IPCL for the purpose of the project (para. 5.15); and
(v) cause CIPET to (a) furnish to the Bank its rolling annual training
and extension program starting by June 30, 1991, and every year
thereafter during project implementation and (b) arrange staff
training with overseas institutions satisfactory to the Bank.
Fellows will be placed in overseas training institutions on the
basis of relevance and quality of the program offered, costs and
experience subject to prior review by the Bank (para. 5.11).
8.03     IPCL agreed with the Bank that it will:
(i) implement its market development plan (including the intended use of
part of the proceeds of the loan for such purpose) furnished to the
Bank for LLDPE, HDPE, PP, PBR and such other products as may be
agreed to by the Bank (para. 3.16);
(ii) build and operate the project facilities in accordance with
environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank and carry out a
detailed safety audit by qualified consultants prior to commissioning
of the project to assess the risks to the project area and the
surrounding community by December 31,1990 for the Nagothane Complex
and by September 30, 1991 for the Vadodara complex (para. 5.21); and
(iii) follow prudent financial practices and comply with the financial
covenants described (para. 6.15).

Description of Modernization Schemes Under Investment Component
A. Ener&y Conservation Measures at the Baroda Petrochemical Complex
1.       This proposal essentially consists of the implementation of the
conclusions of the ICI Energy Conservation Study contracted by IPCL in 1986.
The project will address the following process modifications suggested in the
ICI study.
(a) Heat recovery from xylene fractionation columns for preheating
boiler feed.
(b) Replacement of steam turbine drive at Mono ethylene glycol plant by
an electric motor
Other schemes are already being implemented with IPCL funds and together will
allow savings of over 22 million kcal/hr.
B. Control of Airborne Pollutants at VCM/PVC and ACN Plants (Incinerators)
2.       This projects consists of the installation of (a) an incinerator at the
VCM/PVC plant to burn chloracarbons and hydrocarbons from vent gases and purify
HCI produced during incineration for recycling, and (b) to replace the current
incinerator at the ACN plant by a high performance burner fitted with heat
recovery for steam generation. This unit will a'low the reduction of airborne
pollutants from the ACN plant and the PVC/VCM plants.
C.  Modernization of the NaDhtha Cracker at the Baroda Complex
3.       This project consists of the implementation of the results of an
internal IPCL study to improve the operational performance and yields of the
naphtha cracker at Baroda. The project will revamp the pyrolysis furnaces and
install new heaters to allow for higher thermal efficiency, higher throughput
and reduced processing times.
D. De-bottlenecking of Ethvlene Oxide Plant
4.       This project consists of the implementation of measures to augment EO
plant capacity from 5,000 to 10,000 tons per year through the use of improved
catalysts and process modifications to reduce by-product formation.
E. Modernization of Control Systems at the Baroda Petrochemical Complexes
5.       This project consists of the adoption and implementation of modern
control systems including DIDC and advance control software to improve
efficiency and reduce operating costs. This component will include:
(a) replacement of obsolete instruments,
(b) installation of computer hardware for process management and data
compilation,
(c) provision of redundancy in process control and safety systems, and
(d) increased standardization of process control systems.

F.  Expansion of PVC Plant at the Baroda Petrochemical ComRlex through
Installation of a New Polymerization Reactor
6.       This project consists of the installation of a new reactor and
ancillary equipment to increase production capacity from 55,000 tpy to 75,000
tpy and the setting up of additional VCM storage and handling facilities.
G.  Modernization of the Ammonia Refrig2ration System
7.       This project consists of the setting up of satellite ammonia
refrigeration systems to meet the requirements of the new and expanded plants at
Baroda.

Environmental Impact Report
(Operational Directive 4.00-Annex Al)
(A) POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRANMEORK
1.         During the last fifteen years, India has made remarkable progress
in the establishment of a policy and regulatory framework for protection of
the environment. The key laws concerning environmental issues are: (i) the
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act; (ii) the Air
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act; and, (iii) the Environment
(Protection) Act.
2.         The Water Act was first enacted in 1974 and later amended in 1981
and 1987. The Act calls for the prevention of water contamination ".. .or
such discharges of any sewage or trade effluent or any liquid, gaseous or
solid substance into water (whether directly or indirectly) as may or be
likely to create a nuisance or render such water harmful or injurious to
public health, safety, or to domestic, industrial, agricultural or other
legitimate use...R. The Act resulted in the establishment of a Central and
State Boards for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution as the key
agencies for monitoring and enforcement of water pollution regulations.
3.         The Air Act of 1981 mandates the control and abatement of air
pollution, the prevention of air contamination and the establishment of air
quality standards. The Act also stipulates that no new industries are to be
allowed to operate in an air pollution control area. The mandate for
monitoring and enforcement of air quality standards and regulations has also
been given to the State Pollution Boards.
4.         At present, there are no adequate regulatory provisions for safe
disposal of hazardous and toxic waste in India. The existing environmental
legislation (Water and Air Acts) and corresponding safety laws (such as the
Factories Act) do not adequately address the safe management and disposal of
toxic wastes. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is now engaged in the
development of regulations for management, treatment and disposal of toxic/
hazardous residues under the provisions of the Environment Act of 1986.
Effluent Standards
5.         Water and air quality standards and water discharge effluent are
regulated for all industries. Water effluent standards in Gujarat and
Maharashtra, where project facilities will be located, are comprehensive,
adequate and incorporate the following provisions: (i) effluent discharge
standards into waterways depending on the user classification of the
receiving waters; and (ii) effluent discharge limits established on an
industry specific basis. The effluent disposal standards are in effect for
the following categories: (i) standards for disposal of effluent from
specific from specific industries, including the chemical industry, based on
Minimum National Standards (MINAS); (ii) standards for disposal of effluent
from all industries depending upon the ultimate point of disposal of the



-68-                       Annex 5.5
Page 2 of 12
effluent; for example, standards are set for disposal in surface waters,
onto open land, public sewers, agricultural land and marine and estuary
areas; (iii) standards for disposal of sewage; and, (iv) standards for
effluent disposal of toxic effluent under the provisions of the Environment
(protection) Act.
6.         Airborne pollutant emissions have been limited for a number of
chemicals or established on an industry-specific basis for several of the
most polluting industries. Standards are in effect for the following
categories: i) Gaseous emission standards for industrial plants under the
provisions of the Air Act (1981). These standards include emissions from
fertilizer plants and oil refineries as well other non-chemical industries;
(ii) gaseous emission standards for industrial plants under the provisions
of the Environment (Protection) Act. These standards include some other
industrial sectors but not from chemical and related plants; (iii)
permissible process emissions for specific substances. Maximum permissible
emissions for 42 chemicals are specified under the provisions of the Air
Act.
Administrative Framework
7.         As a condition for issuance of a license, all new industrial
projects must comply with the provisions of the environmental acts and
prepare and .-ivironmental Impact Assessment at an early stage of the
project. The Impact Assessment is prepared according to format established
by the Ministry of Environment and reviewed and approved by the State
Secretary of Environment. Financial provisions for the necessary
environmental safeguards must be included in the project capital cost and
operating costs estimates. In addition, all public sector industrial
projects, such as this one must receive an environmental clearance from the
Ministry of Environment prior to submission for Cabinet clearance.
IPCL Corporate Policy on the Environment
8.         IPCL has long adhered to a wide-scope and ambitious environmental
policy calling for w ...strict compliance with all environmental regulations
during the design, construction and operation of all facilities of the
corporation.w Past efforts of IPCL and its leadership in the field have
been recognized through numerous environmental and safety awards including
the 1988 Award on 'Best achievement in hazards and pollution control in the
chemical industry' conferred by the Indian Ministry of Industry and the 1989
FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) award in
'recognition of outstanding contribution to Environment Preservation and
Pollution Control'.
9.         Some of the efrorts pioneered by IPCL in the environmental field
include: (i) implementation and management of a large polishing pond and
associated farm for the effluent of the tertiary water treatment from the
petrochemical complex at Vadodara; (ii) the set up and management of a large
reforestation program around the petrochemical complex at Nagothane; and,
(iii) sponsorship of R&D efforts for the development of waste treatment
technology for the chemical sector.

10.        To oversee the environmental performance of the processing plants,
IPCL maintains an environmental department with a total staff of 35
persons, including a technical and scientific team qualified in waste
treatment and disposal, water ecology and environmental chemistry.
Reference Documents
11.        For purposes of this project, IPCL has prepared two extensive
Environmental Impact Assessments, one for each complex under expansion plus
an Executive Summary which was prepared according to an outline jointly
agreed with the Bank. The three documents review in detail the various
environmental implications of the project expansions and contain the
documentary basis on which this EA report is based.
(B) PROJECT DESCRIPTION
12.        A brief project description is included in this EA report.
Reference is made to the full project description in section V of the Staff
Appraisal Report. In broad terms, the project under consideration consists
of the expansion of two existing petrochemicai complexes with most of the
additional equipment being installed within the plant boundaries.
13.        Furthermore, the nature of the products and processes are widely
considered to have a relatively innocuous impact on the environment during
manufacture. The final products are polyolefins and derivatives, which are
relatively stable compounds with few byproducts and no toxicity.
14.        The Vadodara component of the project consists of the expansirl or
modernization of three existing plants and a new manufacturing unit: (i) a
new Polypropylene plant with a manufacturing capacity of 75,000 tpy, which
will replace an old plant slated for closure in 1991; (ii and iii) the
revamping on an old train for Butadiene extraction and PBR manuftcture, to
enable 50,000 tpy production of PBR and the use of advanced catalysts; and,
(iv) the commissioning of a production facility for the manufacture of
alloys, blends and composites of engineering polymers.
15.        The first three plants will be built inside the company
petrochemical complex at the site of the old units being replaced or
adjacent to these. There is no land acquisition involved. The engineering
polymers plant will involve a small parcel of land (2 hectares) adjacent to
the complex.
16.        Because of the integration of these units into the existing
operations, no provision is required for the supply of power or water beyond
the current capacity levels of the power and water supply system available
at the site. On the contrary, the modernization of the polypropylene
facilities should result in a net reduction in power use. No provisions are
needed for additional manpower as the level of instrumentation and
automation of the new facilities will compensate for the larger capacity in
terms of labor requirements. Therefore, no additional housing is required.



-70-                        Annex 5.5
Page 4 of 12
17.        The existing warehousing and storage facilities are also expected
to accommodate the increases in production levels and requirements for raw
materials. Feedstocks for the projects will be supplied by the
petrochemical complex or by the refinery located adjacent to the
petrochemical plants.
18.        The expansions do not require of an extension or improvement in
access roads. IPCL Vadodara complex is already well connected to the
national highway Bombay Ahmedabad and is accessible through the broad gauge
rail system.
19.        The Nagothane component of the project consists of the expansion
of the ethylene cracker and associated infrastructure to process 400, 000
tpy of ethylene (up from the current capacity of 300,000 tpy), the addition
of a third line with a 75,000 tpy capacity to the HDPE/LLDPE swing plant,
and the expansion of the wire and cable plant to process 25,000 tpy of final
products. In addition, the expansion of the cracker will result in the
production of about 15000 tpy of butane which will then be transported by
truck to feed the butadiene extraction plant being expanded at Vadodara.
20.        As in the case of Vadodara, the three expansion projects will be
located within the existing complex plant limits; therefore, there is no
need for land acquisition. The resulting additional requirements in power
and water usage are within the design limits of the captive (gas based)
power plant at the complex and the water supply system. Housing facilities
at Nagothane are expected to accommodate the small increment in labor force
resulting from the plant expansions.
z2.        No additional warehousing and storage facilities are required and
no provision is needed for expansion of the surface transport network as a
result of the expansions.
Location
22.        The Vadodara conplex is located north west of Vadodara city in the
state of Gujarat. The site is also a focus for petroleum and chemical
industries, including refineries, fertilizer plants and downstream
manufacturers of petrochemical products. There are more than 300 small and
medium scale industries, mostly chemical plants that utilize feedstocks and
raw materials produced by the Petrochemical, refinery and fertilizer
complexes. The area is one of the leading chemical industrial areas in
India, both in terms of production and number of employees. The general
location plan of the Vadodara complex is provided as IBRD Map 21539 in the
SAR.
23.        Land use around the Vadodara complex shows that despite the rapid
industrialization of the district the main economic activity is still
agriculture. Around a 20 Km. radius from the plant, 83Z of the land is
under cultivation, less than 1 is officially classified as forest land and
the balance is dedicated to other uses.
24.        The Nagothane complex is located southwest of the Uran peninsula,
about 100 miles south of the city of Bombay and 50 miles inland from the
coastline. The area was originally selected as the site for the complex
based on the relative lack of economic activity in the region and the poor



-71-                        Annex 5.5
Page 5 of 12
quality of the soils.  Since construction of the complex started, Nagothane
has been connected by rail, road and pipeline to Uran and Bombay. The
general location of Nagothane is provided in IBRD Map 21539 in the SAR
report.
Project Area's Natural Resources
25.        Water resources in the Vadodara region include the Mahi river
(main tributary) and the Mani, Jambuva, Surya and Khambe rivers. All these
discharge into the Gulf of Cambay. There is a large lake (Ajwa) situated 24
km to the East of the complex. Ground water resources are in alluvial
formations occurring both under confined and unconfined conditions.
Alluvial deposits consisting of sand, clay, pebbles and gravel abound in the
area.
26.        The district is badly deforested.  The forest survey of 1970 found
forest cover in only 9.42 of the total area. The problems associated with
deforestation have since been addressed through efforts in 'social forestry"
undertaken by the GOI and with the sponsorship of chemical companies located
in the area. The concept is to provide for future needs of fuelwood and
ground cover while at the same time preventing soil erosion and dust
formation.
27.        Wild life is almost non existent in the district.  There is no
recognized national park or wild life sanctuary. There are on the other
hand important inland (fresh water) fisheries in the district. These
include the fishing centers of Bhadarwa, Angadh and others. The estimated
fish production is 1500 to 2000 tons per year. The topography of the
terrain is flat with a gentle, slope towards the southwest. The site is
well above the flood level of the Mahi River.
28.        Water resources in the Nagothane region are relatively abundant
and have already been tapped for a variety of industrial uses. The Ambi
river supplies the water requirements for the project. The Nagothane
district is relatively deforested save for small clusters of trees around
the plant area. However, southwest of the plant there is an area of forest
land under exploitation for timber.
29.        A relocation scheme for the inhabitants of the site has been
successfully completed bv IPCL as part of the original project. The new
village built by IPCL has been constructed North-East of the Nagothane site.
The village is now fully functional.
30.        Wild life is not abundant and only present in those areas under
forest cover. Areas north of the plant (downstream the Ambi river) are
under agricultural cultivation. But, the actual treated effluent discharge
is by extended pipeline into the Bay. The actual point of discharge was
selected after a hydrographic and oceanographic study was conducted in the
area by the National Oceanographic Institute. As a result of the study, a
point of discharge has been selected that maximizes dispersal into the Bay
waters and diminishes the likelihood of back mixing into the estuary area.

(C) ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
31.        The nature of the project (expansion of existing plants) and of
the end products to be manufactured (polyolefins) minimize the environmental
impact on the surrounding areas. Nevertheless, the plant expansions will
result in an increase in the emissions and pollution loads both of airborne
pollutants and wastewater. Little or no increase in the release of solid
residues is expected as a result of the project. No toxic materials will be
manufactured or released as byproducts.
Nagothane
32.        The increased emissions of airborne pollutants at Nagothane are
mostly associated to the increase in cracking capacity of the plant (through
the addition of one cracker furnace) and the associated increases in plant
emissions due to the incremental increase in power consumption. Marginal
increases of fugitive emissions and Volatile Organic Chemicals are also
expected due to the increase in transportation and handling of volatile
feedstocks for the cracker and the addition of the third line in the
HDPE/LLDPE plants.
33.        Although there are no specific standards for emissions at
petrochemical plants, the corresponding emission standards for power units
can be used to compare with the level of airborne pollutants emissions
expected at the plant.
34.        Table 1 below compares the current adopted standards for power
plant units with the level of em .ssions expected from the original project
and the expected level after the expansion is completed. The SOx emissions
reflect the fact that the gas used for the captive power plant and feedstock
for the cracker has been treated and is practically sulphur free.
Nevertheless, the stack of the power plant has been designed with a height
of 37.5 m to guarantee proper dispersal of any SOx emissions. The NOx,
Hydrocarbons and particulate matter are also expected to fall within the
tolerance limits.
35.        The air quality standards for the area are shown in Table 2 below.
The expected impact on the air quality standards is expected to be very mild
and maintain area compliance due to the isolated location of the plant and
the relatively low emissions of airborne pollutants.
36.        Waste water discharge is expected to increase due to the addition
of production capacity. The table 3 below compares the quality of the raw
water (at the Ambi river intake point), with the expected plant effluent
characteristics before treatment. The plant effluent requires treatment in
order to comply with the effluent standards. The Nagothane Complex already
includes a wastewater treatment plant with primary and secondary treatment
plus dedicated modules for the treatment of sewage from the associated
township.
37.        The Table 4 below compares the expected design parameters after
the expansion of the complex with the applicable State standards. The
expected output of the plant meets the discharge standards and is not
expected to contain cyanide, phenol, sulphides or heavy metals.



-73-                        Annex 5.5
Page 7 of 12
38.        In addition to the treatment and disposal procedures, IPCL has
been required by the MOE to return the spent catalyst to the manufacturer
for regeneration. This provision eliminates the concern of spent catalyst
disposal in the Nagothane area and also eliminates a potential although
small source of heavy metal contamination in the area.
Vadodara
39.        Expansion of the three units at Vadodara and the implementation of
the engineering polymers plant will result in an increase in the level of
vastewater discharges, emission of airborne pollutants and generation of
solid residues. But, contrary to the expansion of the Nagothane site, the
expansions at Vadodara will not result in an increase in the capacity of the
cracker and therefore are not likely to produce but a marginal additional
requirement of power. The reason behind thi3 is that the feedstocks
required for the expansions will come from the Nagothane complex or from
refinery sources in the Vadodara area.
40.        The Table 5 below compares the current airborne emissions
standards in the State of Gujarat with the conditions granted to the
expansion by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. These conditions are
expected to be met by the complex after the expansion becomes operational.
As no modification of the cracker operational conditions and no additional
power requirements are expected, emissions from the cracker and the power
unit will not change after expansion.
41.        The additional handling of propylene and butadiene associated to
the new PP and PBR plants are nevertheless expected to result in an increase
in fugitive emissions and Volatile Organic Compounds emissions. No change
in dealing with Benzene or romat'c c^mpcunds is envinad iiunder the
expansion.
42.        The wastewater treatment loading is expected to increase.  Table 6
below compares the State standards with the design parameters for the
wastewater treatment plant after expansion. It must be noted that
simultaneous with the expansion of the complex IPCL is implementing a
tertiary treatment system for the wastewater effluent that will result in a
significant improvement in the water quality of the effluent. The design
characteristics of the tertiary treatment system are shown also in Table 6.
The central unit of the system is a reverse osmosis plant.
43.        The effluent from the tertiary treatment plant plus other selected
effluent from the plant will continue to be fed into the polishing pond at
Vadodara, while the bulk of the treated effluent will be discharged into the
Common Effluent Channel. Discharge standards into the channel are regulated
by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and managed through the Gujarat
Investment Development Corporation. The Effluent Channel discharge
standards are summarized in Table 7. The design parameters of the water
treatment plant after expansion will comply with the Effluent Channel
Standards.
44.        No changes in the characteristics of the greenbelt nround tne
plant are required for this expansion.

Page 8 of 12
45.       Although the expansion is not expected to result but in a marginal
increase of solid residues, IPCL has included in the expansion project the
set up of an incineration facility. The incinerator is expected to take the
sludge generated by the waste treatment plant and other solid residues from
existing plants not necessarily included under the expansion project. The
comissioning of an incinerator at Vadodara will result in a drastic
reduction of solid residues disposal.
(D) MITIGATION PLAN
46.        In section C above, a description of the wastetreatment plant
effluent and stack emissions has been sumarily included (see tables 1 to 7)
and shown to comply with existing regulations. In addition to point sources
treatment of discharges, IPCL has taken a number of additional measures to
further contribute to the maintenance or recovery of the surrounding
ecosystems. The most important of these actions are briefly summarized
below:
Greenbelt and Reforestation Program at Nagothane
47.        The Greenbelt and reforestation program around the Nagothane plant
site exceeds the requirements established under the law and makes part of
IPCL voluntary efforts to recover the ecosystem in the area and contribute
to its economical exploitation and maintenance. Under the program a total
of 145 hectares have been planted out of 384 hectares planned. Upon
completion the program will increase the total forested area in the district
by an estimated 200Z. The program is being managed by BAIF a private sector
company. As part of BAIF responsibilities, a promotion program for
horticulture and husbandry of forested areas is being developed.
Hazardous Emissions Warning System at Vadodara
48.       Although not an issue directly related to the project expansion,
the complex at Vadodara deals with feedstocks and other materials that
require continuous monitoring. These include intermediate2s and feedstocks
required in the manufacture of PVC and ACN (none of these plants is being
affected by the expansion program).
49.        The system consists of a state of the art sensing and analytical
monitoring and modelling system that uses real time meteorological
information to predict the dispersal pattern, concentrations and
requirements for evacuation upon simulated toxic material releases into the
atmosphere.
Noise Pollution Abatement Program
50.        For reducing noise pollution at the source IPCL designs have
incorporated the use of enclosures, soundproof materials and silencers,
muffler and sound absorbers. The IPCL has established an upper limit of 85
to 100 dB at the plant sites.
51.        In addition to these programs, IPCL is active in the set up of an
Incineration Facility and a Tertiary Water Treatment system at Vadodara.



-75-                        Annex 5.5
Page 9 of 12
(E) MONITORING SYSTEMS
52.        Upon completion, the Nagothane Complex will feature an automatic
continuous air quality monitoring system in and around the complex. The
system will gather air quality data from remote sensing apparatus. will
compile, analyze end report the results continuously to the control room.
The remote sensing stations are equipped to monitor SOx, NOx, CO, HC, and
particulate matter. A total of three stations are being installed. In
addition to the monitoring of specific pollutants, the Nagothane site vill
include a meteorological station.
53.        The Vadodara Complex operates a four station remote sensing
monitoring system, including a mobile station. The system has been in
operation for several years and has successfully contributed to monitor and
document the area and plant air quality situation. Because of the proximity
of other plants to the site of the Vadodara complex and the nearby location
of Vadodara city, data from IPCL monitoring system has been made routinely
available to environmental authorities as part of efforts to establish
baseline air quality standards in the region.
54.        At both sites, water quality laboratories will operate or are in
operation parallel to the operation of the water treatment plants. The
water laboratories are monitoring (at Vadodara) and will monitor (at
Nagothane) biological and chemical parameters of the raw water supply, plant
effluent and treated effluent. Data collected has been routinely used to
adjust the operation parameters of the water treatment plant at Vadodara.
(F) EtVIRONMENT PERMITTING FOR PETROCHEMICAL
EXPANSIONS IN THE USA
55.        Ethylene and polyolefin expansions are considered to have a
relatively small impact on the environment. The emphasis in environmental
permitting is centered around emissions from the cracker, volatile compound
organic emissions, and benzene emissions. Water treatment plants are
required to maintain levels of discharge but toxic chemicals contamination
has not been a concern. Of the first three categories only the first two
are of relevance to the current proiect (the expansions do not deal with
aromatic compounds).
56.        During the period 1988-1989 five ethylene and associated
polyolefins expansions were permitted in the USA. For each of these
projects the key critical concern was the air construction permit. A review
of the permit files reveals that the main concern by the permitting agency
was the emission of NOx and CO. The release of particulate, Volatile
organic compounds and SOx was also examined but found not to be an issue.
The permits established a range of 0.04 to 0.11 kg per million BTU for NOx
and a range of 0.017 to 0.034 kg per million BTU for CO emissions.

INDIA
SECOND PETROCHEMICALS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assumptions Used in the Financial Proiections
1.       General.  The financial projections for IPCL have been prepared in
current terms assuming the following local inflation rates:
EX
1989/90                         8.0%
1990/91 - 1992/93               7.0%
1993/94 - 1994/95               6.5%
2.       Sales.  Sales during the forecast period are based on the
production from the existing facilities at Vadodara and the projected
production build-up profiles of the Maharashtra gas cracker complex and the
individual project components as shown below:
Production Build-up
1990/91   1991/92   1992/93   1993/94   1994/95
MGCC                           60%        80%       100%
Gas cracker expansion                                60%        90%      100%
New HDPE plant
Wire/cable compounds plant                70%       100%
Engineering plastics pLant                60%        80%       100%
New PP plant                                                    60%       80%
Butadiene & PBR expansion                            75%        90%      100%
3.       Ex-Dlant Prices.  For the base case, the ex-plant prices of
various products from IPCL have been assumed to remain at the 1989/90 level
in real terms and follow the local inflation rate in current terms. The
ex-plant prices of 11 major products which together account for 88% of
IPCL's net sales revenue in 1989/90 are given below:
Ex-plant prices for maior IPCL Products

4.       Operating Costs.  The operating cost estimates for the existing
facilities at Vadodara were prepared by IPCL based on the actual cost data
for the recent years. For the Maharashtra gas cracker complex and the
individual components of the second petrochemical project, the operating
cost estimates were developed by IPCL based on the comparable cost data of
the Baroda complex and information provided by the lirensors. These
estimates are considered realistic and are used in the financial
projections.
5.       Variable Costs.  All variable costs including feedstock,
catalysts/chemicals, utilities, have been escalated by the local inflation
rates.
6.       Salaries and Wages.  Like other public sector enterprises salaries
and wages are governed by an agreement reached between the unions and the
management which is negotiated every four years under government issued
guidelines. The last agreement expired on December 31, 1986. Negotiations
on the new agreement are behind schedule. In the meantime, the government
has sanctioned the payment of interim relief.   Any wage increase
associated with the new agreement will be back-dated to January 1, 1987.
The anticipated wage increase and its back-dating is reflected in the
salaries and wages for 1989/90. As per the historical trend, salaries and
wages have been assumed to increase by 15% in 1991/92 when the agreement is
due for renewal and by the local inflation rates in the other years.
7.       Repair and Maintenance Costs.  About 40% of the repair and
maintenance costs is labor. As per the recent trend, repair and
maintenance costs for the existing facilities at Vadodara are estimated to
be equal to 5% of the gross fixed Assets. For new assets to be
commissioned during the forecast period, repair and maintenance costs are
assumed at a level equal to 3% of the investment. The percentage
difference is due to the fact that IPCL does not revalue its gross fixed
assets thus the assets commissioned in the earlier years have an
understated book value.
°.       Insurance.  Based on the actual cost data of recent years,
insurance cost is projected at 1.1% of gross fixed assets.
9.       Administrative Overhead.  For Vadodara complex, administrative
overhead has been increased by 10% per annum for years 1990/91 to 1994/95.
The figure for 1989/90 is 19% higher than the previous year due to the
back-dating of anticipated wage increase associated with the forthcoming
new wage agreement. For MCCC and the proposed project, administrative
overhead costs were developed by IPCL in 1988 terms and escalated by the
local inflation rates.
10.      Depreciation.  For the determination of net fixed Assets,
depreciation is calculated as per the straight line method whereas for
comput'ng taxable income, the declining balance depreciation method is
used. The depreciation rates allowed under the Companies Act are given
below:
