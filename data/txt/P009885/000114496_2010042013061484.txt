After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Auth-
orized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
 
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the
Page  11
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.
 
(b)   (i)
For replenishment of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
deposits into the Special Account at such
intervals as the Bank shall specify.

Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph
4
of this Schedule for the payment or payments in
respect of which replenishment is requested. On
the basis of each such request, the Bank shall,
on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit into the Special Account such
amount as the Borrower shall have requested and
as shall have been shown by said documents and
other evidence to have been made out of the
Special Account for eligible expenditures. All
such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from
the Loan Account under the respective eligible
Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
 
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
3
of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
 
(a)
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph
(a)
of Section
2.02
of this
Agreement; or
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories for Part C of the Project, less the
amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section
5.02
of the General Conditions with respect
to Part C of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the
Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories for Part C of the Project shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.    (a)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2
of this
Schedule; or
(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or
(B)-deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless
Page  12
the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
 
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
 
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
(d)
Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6
(a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
