MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF C-HANA
FOR A MINING SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to Ghana for SDR 29.3 million (US$40 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval.  The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity and help linance a mining sector
rehabilitation project. The project is expected to have several
cofinanciers, including the European Investment Bank (EIB), the African
Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
In addition, private sector participation is very likely.
2.       Background.  Ghana's mining sector accounts for roughly 17? of
export earnings and employs around 24,000 persons. The main product, gold,
accounts for over 85Z Qf the total value of mineral exports. It is mainly
produced by two companies, Ashanti Goldfields Corporation and State Gold
Mining Corporation (SGMC) plus some small-scale production. Ghana also
produces bauxite, manganese ore, and diamonds. Following a steady decline
for a number of years, the outlook for mining has improved recently with
the adoption by Ghana of a more realistic currency exchange rate regime,
availability of retention accounts for foreign exchange, and the partial
rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure. Output of the mines is now
rising though most of the mines ne"d considerable rehabilitation.
Goverment agencies dealing with the sector need strengthening, since they
generally lack equipment and skilled personnel. Foreign investors are
showing increased interest in Ghana's gold prospects with three new joint
venture gold mines having just been established. The Government, aware of
the economic potential of the mining sector to greatly increase output, is
giving high priority to its rehabilitation and expansion.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The rehabilitation of Ghana's
mining sector is vital for increasing export earnings, an important
objective of Ghana's recovery program. IDA is involved in this sector
through prior credits; the Export Rehabilitation Project (ERP), the Export
Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Project (ERPTA), and the second
Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC II). These Credits helped to begin the
rehabilitation of SGMC. IFC is also involved in the sector through a
US$27.5 million loan to the joint venture Ashanti Goldfields Corporation,
and equity investment in a new joint venture, Canadian Bogosu Resources
Corporation. Continuation of IDA involvement both financially, and through
policy and technical advice would help to: (i) ensure continued
development of the mining sector through rehabilitation and restr-ucturing,
(ii) encourage its opening to private sector participation; and (iii)
mobilize both public and private co-financing.
4.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project aims to: (i)
rehabilitate SGMC's mines with as much private participation as possible;
(ii) develop Ghana's gold mining potential by attracting private investors;



(iii) strengthen Government agencies dealing with the mining sector; and
(iv) increase benefits from small-scale gold mining activities.
5.       Project Description.  The Project would:  (i) continue the ongoing
rehabilitation of the SGMC mines (Tarkwa, Prestea, Dunkwa), started under
prior credits, to increase their output and reduce safety hazards, by
repairing or replacing much of their equipment; (ii) assist in attracting
capital by financing evaluation studies of SGMC, Ghana Consolidated
Diamonds (GCD) and Ghana National Manganese Company (GNMC) to be used to
attract joint venture partners and, in addition, help fund mineral
exploration mainly oriented at establishing gold prospects and promoting
them to potential investors; (iii) provide technical assistance to the
major governmental institutions dealing with mining (Minerals Commission,
Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources), to strengthen them and assist
them in dealing with private investors; and (iv) improve the operations of
small-scale miners through technical assistance. The Project, to be
carried out over four years, provides funds for new equipment, repairs and
replacement of existing equipment, shaft sinking, technical assistance,
training, vehicles and working capital. The total cost of the Project is
estimated at US$120 million equivalent-with a foreign exchange component of
US$113 million (94Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 7039-GH dated May 10, 1988, is also attached.
6.       ARreed Actions.  The Government and SGMC have agreed on the
following actions: (i) a four year rehabilitation plan for SGMC including
a strategy for implementing this plan by seeking joint venture partners (a
condition of effectiveness is satisfactory progress in establishing
management and financing aJrangements for the rehabilitation of the three
mines while the conclusion of such arrangements is necessary for tranche
release); (ii) a study to be carried out by December 31, 1988 of ways to
raise salaries in the Mines Department; (iii) the relocation of the Chief
Inspector of Mines to Accra as soon as office space and housing are
available but no later than Decamber 31, 1989; (iv) the Mines Department to
be responsible for monitoring the quality of underground air at the major
underground mines; (v) the tailings ponds at Tarkwa and Prestea to be
fenced by December 31, 1988 and farming prohibited within their boundaries;
(vi) a plan for monitoring effluents at the SGMC mines to be developed by
September 30, 1988 with monitoring to begin by June 30, 1989, and a plan to
control effluents by March 31, 1990; (vii) a report on reclamation of
surface mines by July 1, 1989, to be reviewed by IDA, which will be used by
the Government to formulate, not later than July 1, 1990, appropriate
reclamation regulations; (viii) conversion of SGMC's older debt to the
Government into equity (also, a condition for tranche release) and a study
by December 31, 1988 of methods to convert SGMC's debt to VRA and Ghana
Commercial Bank into equity or near equity; (ix) an action plan to be
implemented by June 30, 1989 providing legal and competitive sales channels
for Ghana's small scale gold miners; (x) half of the funds provided by IDA
and CIDA to the Government and on-lent to SGMC under the ERP to be
converted to equity; (xii) SGMC to revalue its assets by June 30, 1989 and
establish estimated useful lives for the assets to be acquired under the



-3-
project acceptable to IDA; (xiii) a gold exploration company to be set up
by December 31, 1988 under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA; and
(xiv) the adherence by SGMC after  rehabilitation to certain financial
requirements including a minimum current ratio.
7.       Benefits.  The Project has several major benefits for the country.
First, it will lead to a major increase in gold output, exports and foreign
exchange earnings of SGMC. Second, the Project will help attract private
investors to Ghana's minerals sector by: (i) providing assistance for
attracting joint venture partners for SGMC mines; (ii) strengthening the
Government agencies dealing with private investors and improving their
ability to work with investors- (iii) helping develop prospects; and (iv)
through the evaluation studies, creating a framework for considering joint
ventures for the diamond and manganese mines. Private sector participation
in turn would lead to an inflow of private capital and provide access to
management and technical skills needed for sector developmen;. Third, the
Project will benefit Ghana by improving the operations of small-scale
miners. Finally, it will considerably improve the safety and environmental
conditions at SGMC mines, and ultimately throughout the mining sector by
helping formulate environmental regulations.
8.       Risks.  The Project faces four major risks.  The first is that the
increase in production at the SGMC mines would be less than expected or
slower than e-'ected as a result of a lack of skilled personnel or
operating problems at the mines. This risk is, however, substantially
reduced by the requirement that prior to credit effectiveness, SGMC should
have made arrangements satisfactory to IDA to strengthen its operating
management, by the rehabilitation program which includes training and by
the inflow of private capital with attendant management skills. The second
major risk relates to the possible lower price of gold, but the assumption
used (US$400/oz) appears conservative. A third major risk is that it may
not be possible to attract private investors for the SGMC mines. This risk
is, however, limited since private investors have shown interest in Ghana,
the Government is showing flexibility in its negotiations, and IDA should
be in a position to encourage cooperation between the Government and
private investors. Finally, there is a risk cofinancing will not be
available. However, tentative commitments by cofinanciers are currently
sufficient to fund the project even with substantial cost overruns.
9.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
