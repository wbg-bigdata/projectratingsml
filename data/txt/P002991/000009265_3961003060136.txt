MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL EXMNSION PROJECT
1.      I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of Uganda of SDR 11 million, the equivalent of US$15.79
milion. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help
finance improvements in the delivory and impact of agricultural extension services.
Contry and Sector Background
2.      'Te Ugandan economy has been disrupted by years of political instability and civil strife.
Agriculture provides 60 percent of GDP, 80 percent of employment, and 95 percent of exports.
About 4.5 million hectares are cultivated by some 2.5 million small farming families, mainly for
subsistence. Foodcrops account for about 74 percent of agricultural GDP, followed by livestock (16
percent) forestry and fisheries (6 percent) and cash crops (4 percent). The country has fertile soils
and adequate rainfall but technology levels are low and yields in both crops and livestock are being
affected by disease. Dissemination of improved technology and disease-control measures has been
constrained by the macroeconomic situation and weak agricultural services.
3.       Over the past five years IDA has provided substantial assistance through economic
recovery and structural adju stment credits and an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC).
Focus is now on strengthening agricultural services as a means of promoting increased productivity
and growth in the agricultural sector. Ihese services are severely constrained by infrastructural,
financial and organizational problems as a result of the previous civil strife, the weak revenue base
and inadequate management systems in government. The Structr Adjustment Credit (SAC) and the
Economic and Financial Management Project (EFMP) include measures to improve the revenue base
and the management framework.
4.       Direct assistance to strengthen extension and research is now a priority. Some of the
urgent disease problems can be addressed immediately by extension. Yields can also be increased
through dissemination of improved husbandry practices and planting material currently being
multiplied with assistance from IDA and other donors. IDA assistance in these priority areas will be
through the proposed Agricultural Extension Project (AEP), and an Agricultura Research and
Training Project (ARTP) which was recendy appraised. Both projects are part of a wider long-term
program, financed by several donors, to strengthen the management and delivery of key services in
the agricultural sector. The program was designed by Working Groups set up by GOU with funding
from IDA.
5.       The extension strategy supported by the proposed project emphasizes quick dissemination
of available technologies to address urgent problems. Given the conditions prevailing in Uganda, the
extension organization and approach need to be flexible and capable of responding to sectoral resource
constraits and local conditions. Resource and capacity constaints dictate that extension should be
initially ft cussed on selected districts with a gradual and phased expansion of coverage.
Implementation capacity needs to be strengthened; the parent ministry, MAAIF, recently created
through the merger of two ministries, has not yet been able to establish strong management and
coordination systems. Financial management and program implementaion are areas of particular
weakness. GOU is also involved in a major decentralization of all government services to a system of
unified management at district level. The implications for the management and implementation of
etension are not yet fully apparent but the project design is sufficiently flexible to adjust to



-2 -
decetalized district management. Despite these constraints, the momentum and experience in
extension built up by preparatory actions under ASAC provide sufficient basis for proceeding with a
limited operation in extension at this time. The project was therefore designed on a modest scale
focussing on the delivery of extension services in 16 districts out of a total of 38 in the country, and
on Improving the supporting management services within MAAIF.
Project Objectives
6.      ITe project would support Government's strategy for the improvement of productivity and
diversification in the agricultural sector. The broad objectives of the project are to address the urgent
needs for disease control and yield improveraents ana build capacity to deliver and support effective
extension services. In the 16 selected districts the project would aim to improve: (a) efficiency in the
delivery of extension services; (b) skills of extension agents and farmers; and (c) adoption of
improved techniques by farmers. The project would also improve efficiency in MAAIF's
management services to support the delivery of extension and ensure its sustainability. The lessons
and experiences of the project in implementation and impact would provide the basis for the design
of country-wide extension services.
Project Description
7.       The project would cover the field extension operations of 16 districts as shown in IBRD
Map 24007. At least two districts have been selected from each of the six agro-ecological zones of
Uganda. The project would also strengthen central training and management capacity of MAAIF.
Financing would be provided for: (a) Strengthening of the delivery of extension serices (US$8.1
million) through the provision of transport, equipment, rehabilitation of facilities, and incremental
operating costs; (b) Inmprovements in traiing capady and sklls (US$5.1 million) through (i)
provision of equipment, supplies, facilities, and transport for regular in-service training of extension
staff and periodic farmer training at the District Farm Institutes (DFIs), with the involvement of
research staffi (ii) rehabilitation, curriculum development and upgrading of staff capabilities at
Bukalasa Agricultural College; and (iii) demonstration plots at the DFIs and farmer managed trials in
their own fields; (c) Strengtheing of management sysms in MAAIF (US$0.8 million) through (i)
training in management and team building for staff at headquarters and in the project districts; (Hi)
staff training and consultancy services to improve financial management, procurement, and budgetary
procedures; (iii) operational support for monitoring and evaluation of extension activities; and (iv)
improved office equipment and facilities; and (d) Stu tes (US$0.1 million) on (i) the rationalization
of the training instittes and colleges of MAAIF; (ii) the efficiency and impact of alternative
technology transfer mechanisms; (iii) a Mid-Term Review and assessment; and (iv) a follow-on
project.
Project Finandng
8.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.8 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$8.5 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in Uganda are given in Schedule C and D, respectively.
9.       Given the current problems in Uganda in providing counterpart funding (para. 12), it is
proposed, while keeping IDA's total contribution within 90 percent of project costs, to fund 100



- 3 -
percent of incremental recurrent costs for field activities for the first two years and 65 percent of local
costs thereafter. This finding arrangement is designed to provide some lead time for: (a) the
extension service to demonstrate its Impact and win support within MAAIF and the rest of
Government for gradual absorption of its recurrent costs on a guaranteed basis; (b) Government to
implement its Civil Service budgetary and revenue collection reform programs supported by the SAC
and EFMP; and (c) MAAIF to develop improved management systems which can respond efficiently
to changes in funding flows.
Project Implementation
10.     The project would be implemented through MAAIP with improvements in capacity and
organizational arrangements. Attention has been m.ven to absorptive capacity in MAAIF and the
smooth integration of the project into the regular organizational structure of MAAIF. Management of
extension services would be strengthened at headquarters and in the field with training and facilities.
The programs in extension delivery, training, and farm trials/demonstrations would be gradually
phased into about eight districts per year and be based on localized diagnostic surveys of farmers'
problems by extension agents. Within districts, coverage would also be gradual, spreading outward
from county and parish bases. Variations in extension approach, intensity of coverage, and
research/extension linkages would be applied in different subsets of districts. and their comparative
efficiency evaluated. Monitoring and Evaluation of the programs would be coordinated by the
Planning Division of MAAIF. The strengthening of management systems in MAAIF would ensure
essential back up support for financial, procurement, and disbursement procedures and for budgetary
allocations.
Project Sustainablilty
11.     The greatest threat to project sustainability is likely to be the availability of local resources
to fully maintain country-wide extension services as well as those currently being designed for
research. Given the state of the Ugandan economy, GOU would need about ten to fifteen years to be
able to expand its revenue base sufficiently to absorb the recurrent costs of full-fledged national
services. The rate of expansion of extension services would therefore be gradual and directly linked
to the availability of funding for operational costs from domestic and donor sources. Measures have
also been included in project design to incresse beneficiary participation in the delivery and funding
of etension through community groups and Non-Governmental Organizations.
Lemons from Past Experience
12.     Project implementation in Uganda has been affected by inadequate and tardy counterpart
funding, inadequate salaries, and weak management and financial systems; all of which are being
addressed by measures under the SAC, ASAC and EFMr Projects have also tended to be too
complex, involving several agencies and thereby creating c, .dination bottlenecks. These lessons
from Uganda and elsewhere are reflected in the focus of the project on one main activity, phased
implementation, and limited scope. This approach is designed to build a solid foundation for a full-
scale national project. Reviews of extension projects in Africa have highlighted a number of
implementation issues, including a preoccupation with staffing arrangements, procurement procedures
and finacial reporting to the detriment of measures of organizational improvements and impact.
Project design therefore includes the identification of tangible benchmarks of improvements in
management and delivery of extension, research/extension linkages, and impact at farm level. The
strengthening of financial and management systems of MAAF was also included in project design to



- 4-
avoid the potential problems in procurement procedures and financial reporting. Project design was
also influenced by the recent extension project for Ghana and the pilot extension project for Zaire.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
13.     IDA has suppored GOU's economic recovery program, and under ASAC is assisting in
the deepening and broadening of the agricultural sector reform program. There is now a need for
smaller, more focussed investment projects to restore the effectiveness of key agricultural support
services as a means to promote growth. Support is necessary to strengthen sectoral management,
refurbish the research and extension services, and to accelerate and rationalize manpower training.
IDA's direct involvement in this project is essential in order to: (a) encourage increased focus on
efficiency and impact in the restructuring of extension; (b) promote strong linkages between research
and extension; (c) transfer experience gained from extension projects in neighboring countries and
elsewhere; and (d) coordinate with planned IDA involvement in the strengthening of agricultural
research and other key supporting services. The project would build on the experience of previous
and current donor support to agricultural research and extension and complement other ongoing and
proposed IDA/lFAD operations.
Actions and Main Assurances
14.     The organizational changes to be supported under the project have been designed on the
basis of considerable discussion within 0OU and between GOU and IDA. MAAIF has already issued
a directive on the organizational arrangements necessary for the implementation of a unified extension
approach and assurances were obtained that these arrangements would be continued. In order to
ensure and build amplemention cpacity and intionat proceses, assurances
were obtained that: (a) an Extension Adviser would be recruited under international procedures, and
an Extension Training Specialist, a Financial Officer and a Procurement Specialist would be recruited
under local procedures, with temrs of reference, qualifications and conditions of service satisfactory
to IDA; (b) the agreed management development program would be implemented at central and
district levels with assistance from the Management Training and Advisory Center; (c) the
strengtening of Bukalasa Agricultural College would be implemented as agreed with assistance from
Makerere University for curriculum development; (d) the training programs would be implemented as
agreed and approved annually by IDA; (e) the Directors of Agriculture and Animal Resources would
be members of the board of the National Research Organization; and (t) A Research-Extension
Linkage Committee would be established with membership as proposed. In order to avoid delays
and diluton offoeus on project objectives, assurances were obtained that: (a) the
Departm  of Extension would prepare for each new district a District Action Plan (DAP) based on
brief diagnostic surveys of farmer problems covering also the special needs of women and young
farmers in the area; (b) annual work programs and budgets based on the crop year and incorporating
the DAPs and other extension activities would be submitted to IDA for review and approval by
November 1 of the preceding year; (c) a monitoring system would be put in place to track elapsed
time and bottlenecks in financial, budgetary and procurement procedures; (d) the implementation and
impact of extension as measured by agreed key indicators would be monitored; and (e) an assessment
and joint Mid-Term Review of the project would be carried out by March 31, 1995. Conditons
of Effeedveness woudd be: (a) appointment of the Extension Adviser, the Procurement
Specialist and the Finance Officer; (b) opening of the Project Account; and (c) submission of a
satstory Anmual Work Program for the first year of operation.

Environmental Assessment
15.      A National Envirornental Action Plan for Uganda is being prepared with assistance from
IDA. 'There are no major environmental issues; the project is classified as Category B. Potenmial
issues of Increased soil erosion as a result of intensive cultivation, and of increased use of chemicai
fertilizers and other chemicals would be addressed under the project. Extension messages would
cover: proper husbandry and soil management practices; crop rotation; agro-forestry; education of
farmers on effects of uncontrolled erosion; integrated pest management practices including use cf
biological control methods combined with judicious use of chemical pesticides through the use of
economic threshold level (of pests) indicators. Bank guidelines on pesticides would be followed,
including clearance procedures for procurement of chemicals. Improved livestock management
practices would also be promoted including zero-grazing where appropriate.
Program Objectives Categories
16.      The project addresses poverty directly and indirectly. It is focussed mainly on small
farmers who are presently producing at subsistence levels as a result of the breakdown of the
economy. Since small farmers are the major producers in the economy, their increased production
would increase food availability for the urban poor, as well as export and tax revenues. The project
would benefit women through the overall improvements in technology transfer mechanisms as wall as
hough special emphasis on appropriate extension messages, nutrition, and income-generating
activities. Attention will be paid to increasing the number of women involved in the extension
services.
Project Benefits
17.      The improved delivery of extension services is expected to improve crop and livestock
husbandry practices and technology adoption among small farmers. These improvements in turn are
expected to lead to increased agrictural production and exports, and higher incomes for
smaliholders.
Risks
18.      The project is subject to institutional, financial and macroeconomic risks. Safeguards
against institutional and financial risks have been included in project design. Considerable resources
would be devoted to human resource development and the strengthening of management capacity and
processes. Risks of delays and dilution of focus . ould be addressed through dated action plans and
regular monitoring of tangible benchmarks of operational improvements and effectiveness of
research/extension linkages. Financial risks would be minimized through the phased approach, local
cost financing by IDA and testing of beneficiary participation in delivery and funding of extension.
Rationalization of public expenditures is being pursued through structural adjustment operations and
annual public expenditure reviews. The macroeconomic risks are being addressed by the adjustment
operations (SAC and ASAC) which are aimed at ensuring that unfavorable market prices, lack of
inputs, and market restrictions are not constraining farmers' incentives to apply new technology.

Recommnendation
19.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

UGANDA: DISBURSEMENT ISSUES
1.    Overall disbursements on the 27 investment projects in the Uganda portfolio are
satisfactory as compared to the disbursement profile estimated at appraisal. Three projects in
the portfolio, all approved in 1985, were slow disbursing: Cr. 1539-UG, Agricultural
Development; Cr. 1560-UG, Second Power; and Cr. 1561-UG, Petroleum Exploration. In all
three projects the civil war and subsequent turmoil and lack of security delayed the start
implementation by about two years. The start of the Agricultural Development Project was
particularly slow, since unrest persisted in the north until about two years ago. It was
restructured in March 1991, and implementation has considerably improved since then.
Implementation of the Second Power Project and the Petroleum Exploration Project was
delayed by about two years because of the civil war Oack of access to the field was a serious
problem for the petroleum project), but the rate of implementation for both is now
satisfactory. Progress on PAPSCA (Project for Alleviation of Poverty and the Social Costs of
Adjustment, Cr. 2088-UG) was initially slow. The projectes various components had first to
be sub-contracted to several NGOs who, in turn, had to become familiar with Bank
procurement procedures and required time to establish appropriate field implementation units
to reach the widely dispersed beneficiaries. Implementation is now satisfactory.
2.    In the agricultural portfolio, disbursements in two other projects are behind appraisal
estimates. The South West Region Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr.1869-UG,
approved in FY88) was delayed because of institutional problems in the implementation of the
feeder road component which accounts for about half of project costs. These problems have
been recently resolved and disbursements are expected to accelerate. The Sugar
Rehabilitation Project (Cr 1893-UG, approved FY88) is being successfully implemented under
private management. Disbursements have been slower than appraisal estimates because the
management has re-phased the rehabilitation program in order to maximize profitability.
Major procurement activities are underway or planned and the project is expected to be fully
disbursed on schedule.
3.    At a Country Implementation Review, jointly organized by Government and the Bank,
the main recommendato  for continued good implementation performance focussed on
measures to ensure: adequate and timely release of counterpart funds; timely procurement of
goods and services; adequate use of Special Account funds and prompt disbursement
processing; improved financial management, budgetary controls, and compliance with audit
covenants; expeditious credit effectiveness; and effective project management and
coordination.
