INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Swaziland for the equivalent of US$10.1 million to help
finance a Third Education Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, with interest rate at 7.95 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Economic Memorandum on
Swaziland": (No. 852a-SW) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
November 24, 1975. Updating missions visited Swaziland in December 11978 and
May 1979 and a report is under preparation. A summary of social and economic
data is included in Annex I.
3.        Swaziland with only 17,400 sq km is one of the smallest countries
on the African continent. In 1977, its population was estimated at about
520,000, including about 25,000 Swazis who live abroad, mainly as migrant
workers in South Africa. The population has been growing at a rate of about
2.8 percent per annum. Relative to its size and population, the country is
well endowed with natural resources and has good potential for development.
It has some mineral deposits and its soil and climate are favorable to diver-
sified agricultural production.
4.        The economy is highly dualistic.  The modern sector, which is
largely foreign owned, consists of mining (asbestos, coal), large-scale
plantations of forestry, sugar, citrus and pineapples, and associated indus-
tries such as pulp, saw-milling, sugar and fruit processing. The traditional
sector, on the other hand, is based largely on cattle raising and subsistence
agriculture (maize, groundnuts, sorghum); it supports about two-third of the
population.
5.        This economic dualism is to some extent a reflection of the govern-
ment structure. The King rules the modern Government through an appointed
Cabinet of Ministers who manage the country's economic activities and provide
the bulk of services to the people. In traditional matters and all activities
concerning Swazi Nation Land (this term refers to about 60 percent of the
territory of Swaziland which is held communally for the Swazi people by the
King), the King relies on the advice of the Swazi National Council, a group
of Swazi chiefs and elders. Whenever the modern Government became involved
in developing the Swazi Nation Land's agricultural and mineral resources in
the past, it has had to seek the approval of the Council in all decisions
relating to the enterprises, and this process has been slow. Consequently,
economic progress on Swazi Nation Land has lagged behind that of the modern
sector.



6.        Over the last two decades, the Swazi economy, led by the modern
sector, developed rapidly and real GNP grew at about seven percent a year.
Until recently, no major new industries apart from tourism have been estab-
lished; however, expansion of existing enterprises and the government sector,
together with a growing number of smaller enterprises, sustained real growth
in GNP at 8.8 percent a year between 1971/75. At current prices, GNP per
capita was estimated at US$550 in 1978. Since 1975, GNP growth has been
somewhat slower due to achievement of full capacity in several key sectors
(sugar, wood pulp), completion of iron ore mining, stagnation in the subsis-
tence sector, and the effects of the world recession. However, in the period
through 1985, real GNP should grow at favorable rates due to new investments
in sugar production and expanding export markets for citrus, beef and wood-
based industries.
7.        The country's economic growth has been due mainly to private
investment. Since 1968, gross private investment has averaged about 19
percent of GDP and government capital expenditures about seven percent. As
Swazi entrepreneurship was, and still is, quite limited, almost all modern
activities have been carried out by foreign companies, under foreign manage-
ment, and with foreign capital. This development pattern has actually
sharpened the dualism in the Swazi economy. The modern sector now contri-
butes about 80 percent of GDP, 85 percent of wage employment, and 90 percent
of direct taxes. The main sector, agriculture and forestry, accounts for
close to 30 percent of GDP and 35 percent of total wage employment, while
manufacturing contributes 16 percent and 11 percent respectively. The tradi-
tional rural sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of GDP, has remained
virtually stagnant over the years. Because of the rapid expansion of modern
sector employment during the 1960s and early 1970s, the share of the tradi-
tional sector in total employment fell from 72 percent in 1960 to about 60
percent in 1975. Since 1975 modern sector employment has been virtually
stagnant because of slow sectoral growth and the share of the traditional
sector in total employment again exceeds 70 percent.
8.        Swaziland's Third National Development Plan (1978-82) emphasizes
three main objectives: (1) to create conditions for sustained economic
growth; (2) to achieve a greater measure of self-reliance; and (3) to provide
social justice and stability by spreading economic opportunities and services
more widely in the rural areas. Expressed in constant 1977 prices, the Plan
represents a total public investment program three-and-one-half times than
actually achieved under the Second Plan (1973-77). While the proposed Plan
represents a substantial increase over the Second Plan figures, a sizable
amount of the new investment is already committed for several large projects,
including a US$150 million irrigated estate and sugar mill project in which
the IFC has participated. The Government expects to finance about 60 percent
of the Plan expenditures from domestic revenues and to mobilize the remainder
from external sources. The proposed investment program concentrates on modern
sector investment, and will likely intensify the dualism already existing in
the economy.



- 3 -
9.        Since 1971, owing to the sharp increase in mining wages in the
Republic of South Africa, the number of Swazis recruited for mining employ-
ment has doubled. On the domestic front, there is a shortage of skilled
Swazis to man the modern non-agricultural sector and a growing surplus of
school-leavers with arts and humanities background who cannot find employment.
The Government's long-term education policy aims at alleviating this problem
through restructuring the educational system and emphasizing vocational and
technical rather than purely academic training. Programs assisted by the
Bank already are underway to accelerate curriculum reform, particularly to
better serve rural development.
10.       Together with Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa, Swaziland belongs
to the Southern Africa Customs Union. Under this arrangement, Swazi:Land
draws customs and excise revenue from a common revenue pool according to the
value of its total imports and production of taxable goods. Swaziland also
belongs, along with Lesotho and Republic of South Africa, to the Rand Monetary
Area. In September 1974, Swaziland issued its own national currency, the
Emalangeni (E) with the same par value as the Rand; both currencies are legal
tender in Swaziland. The Central Bank of Swaziland manages the country's new
monetary system. In order to remain in the Rand Monetary Area and be able to
continue drawing on its foreign exchange reserves, Swaziland has agreed to
maintain 100 percent of the value of the Emalangeni in circulation in a Rand
account with the South African Reserve Bank.
11.       Budgetary policy has been generally conservative.  Revenues were
sufficient to cover both recurrent and capital expenditures and thus to
generate an overall surplus up to 1976/77. Recurrent revenues doubled in
current prices between 1974/75 and 1978/79. Growth was fast, but uneven,
due to fluctuations in the two most important sources of revenue: receipts
from the Customs Union and revenues from the sugar industry. The latter
peaked in 1975/76 because of the boom in world sugar prices, but declined
steadily thereafter due to depressed prices. Customs Union receipts tripled
to E 39 million in 1977/78 as the result of the 1976 revision of the revenue
formula which determines Swaziland's share in the Southern African Customs
Union pool. Customs Union receipts accounted for one-half of government
revenue in 1977/78. Growth of recurrent expenditures was rapid too, stemming
mainly from a substantial increase in the Government's wage bill following a
major public sector wage review in 1976.
12.       Capital expenditures jumped from about E 10 million in 1974/75 to
E 85 million in 1978/79, resulting in overall deficits in the last three
years. Despite these deficits, the Government managed at the same time to
increase its balances with the banking system by using foreign borrowing to
finance the largest part of capital outlays. The Government's net dlomestic
balances with the banking system equaled about 26 percent of total public
expenditures in 1978/79.



- 4 -
13.       Since 1974, Swaziland's balance of payments performance has been
satisfactory with overall surpluses each year. Capital inflows have been
more than adequate to cover the rising current account deficits which have
emerged since 1976 due to the rapid deterioration in the terms of trade
combined with substantial increases in import volume. In March 1979
accumulated international reserves (net) amounted to E 109 million,
equal to about five months of merchandise imports.
14.       Until 1977, Swaziland had relied on foreign public loans to a lesser
extent than other African countries at a similar level of per capita income
(e.g., Botswana, Ivory Coast, Zambia and the People's Republic of the Congo).
However, during 1978 Swaziland's outstanding disbursed public debt increased
by 90 percent and reached US$103.3 million at the end of December 1978, re-
flecting the Government's heavy borrowing in 1977 and 1978 to finance the
fast expanding public investment program. However, the relatively low level
of indebtedness prior to 1978 coupled with soft terms and the size of exports
relative to GNP have kept debt service in 1978 below two percent of total
export receipts. Until 1972/73 the UK and Bank Group were the only sources
of public external financing, but since then the Government has been success-
ful in diversifying its sources of foreign finance, including borrowing on
commercial terms. Swaziland's major creditors at the end of 1978 were private
financial institutions (27 percent), the UK (23 percent) and the Bank Group
(20 percent). With borrowing from commercial sources, loan terms have become
harder leading to a grant element in total commitments of about 25 percent,
considerably lower than those of the past. Future loan terms are likely to
be similar (or, if anything, harder) as Swaziland attempts to mobilize a large
increase in foreign resources to finance its Third Plan. On this basis, the
seven percent per annum growth in GNP projected for 1979-85 would lead to
required foreign capital inflows averaging over US$100 million per annum and
an increase in the debt service ratio to about 6 percent in 1980 and 10 per-
cent in 1985.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SWAZILAND
15.       The Bank Group, which began operations in Swaziland in 1962, has
approved eight loans, two credits and one IFC loan for a total of US$57.8
million. These have helped finance three road projects, two power projects,
two education projects, plus projects for rural development, water supply and
sewerage, a development finance company and an irrigated sugar estate and
factory (IFC). Implementation of these projects is proceeding satisfactorily.
An exception was the bank's First Rural Development Area project, approved
in 1977, which had a slow start up owing to the failure of the Central Rural
Development Board to approve development plans which resulted in the project
being about 20 months behind schedule. Steps, however, are being taken to
remove the constraints and project implementation is expected to improve.
A summary of Bank Group operations is given in Annex II, together with notes
on the execution of ongoing projects. The Bank aims to assist Swaziland in



addressing its development problems through stepped-up economic and sector
work, intensified policy discussions with the Government and lending in rural
development, education, roads, power and urban projects.
16.       In recent years, the Bank Group has become an important source of
financing for Swaziland's development.  At the end of 1978, the Bank Group's
share in debt outstanding and disbursed was 20 percent (IBRD's share was
14 percent).  The Bank Group's share in total debt service in that year stood
at 45 percent.  As a consequence of the large capital inflows required by the
Third Plan and in succeeding years, the Bank Group's exposure is expetcted to
decline sharply: its share in debt outstanding and disbursed is expected to
fall to eight percent by the end of 1985 while its share in debt servicing is
expected to total only nine percent in that year.
PART III - EDUCATION SECTOR
Overview
17.       The formal education system in Swaziland consists of seven years of
primary schooling, three years of junior and two of senior secondary education
and two to five years of higher education. There has been rapid expansion at
all levels since 1973 and both the adult literacy rate (65 percent) and
enrollment ratios of the school age population are now higher than in most
African countries. The expansion is a result of implementation of educational
policies formulated by the National Education Commission in 1973. These
policy goals, reaffirmed in the Third National Development Plan for 1978-82,
are (a) provision of Universal Primary Education (UPE) by 1985; (b) expansion
of junior secondary education to provide ultimately a full ten years of basic
education to all children; and (c) expansion of upper secondary education and
technical, vocational and university education on the basis of manpower
needs. In broad outline, these goals are appropriate for Swaziland and, with
some modifications of specific targets, they are financially feasible. Some
issues do require attention and these are highlighted below.
Structure and Issues
18.       At the primary school level, overall enrollment in 1977 was about 100
percent; 50 percent of the enrollment are girls. Although there are some
regional disparities, the main problems at this level relate to internal
efficiency and curriculum reform. Despite an official government po:Licy of
restricting repetition, 11 percent of primary school children repeated the
school year in 1976 and only half the entrants completed the full seven year
cycle. Improved efficiency requires curriculum and educational material devel-
opment, improved teacher training, and the construction of additiona:L physical
facilities.  Curriculum and textbooks, now in use at the primary level, have
little relevance to Swaziland's political and socioeconomic environment, and
the cost of textbooks, paid by the students at the primary level, is a major



-6-
factor affecting dropouts. A primary curriculum unit, established in 1973
with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) assistance, is
now embarking on an ambitious program to develop and distribute, at nominal
cost to students, more relevant teaching material to the primary schools in
Swaziland. Also in need of improvement are the physical facilities of many
primary schools, only 53 percent of which currently offer the full seven years
cycle. Excessive walking distances to primary schools offering the seven year
primary schooling are another major factor contributing to drop out at this
level.  Local communities are generally responsible for construction of
primary schools, and building fees often greater than US$25 equivalent for
each student per year are charged to students, but these fees can only meet
the construction costs of one or two makeshift class rooms per year. Recently,
the Government has begun to provide small amounts of funds for construction
and these amounts need to be augmented if adequate facilities are to be
provided.
19.       Junior secondary education is expanding rapidly in accordance with
the Government's long-term policy of universalizing it.  The 1977 enrollment
of 15,900 was equivalent to 40 percent of the population aged 13 to 15 years
and was half as high again as the enrollment in 1973. Enrollment opportunities
for rural students have improved significantly, and, with the completion of
the two previous Bank Group projects, will continue to do so. Female students
account for about half of the total enrollment.
20.       Efficiency in junior secondary education is high but could be
improved with respect to the quality of instruction and the strengthening
of training in practical subjects. Only about half of the secondary school
teachers are fully qualified, and of these, 80 percent are expatriates. Some
training programs for junior secondary teachers, particularly in the science
and technical fields, are inadequate and lack flexibility. Facilities for
the teaching of science and industrial arts need to be improved in a third
of the country's 70 junior secondary schools, and most of these schools also
require additional staff housing, particularly in rural areas.
21.       At the senior secondary school level, the 1977 enrollment of 3,400
accounted for 15 percent of the population aged 16 and 17 years. Only half
of these pass the School Certificate Examination and even fewer pass mathematics,
biology and physical sciences where the critical manpower shortages lie. In
addition, there is an overall surplus of senior secondary school leavers over
the available number of jobs in the modern sector. The Ministry of Education
is strengthening science education at University of Botswana and Swaziland
(UBS) and William Pitcher Teacher Training College (WPTTC) to improve the
quality of those students who will become science school teachers.
22.       At the post secondary level, the Ministry of Education (MOE) is also
responsible for formal education programs at the University of Botswana and
Swaziland, which, despite rapid enrollment increases since 1973, still produces
an inadequate supply of scientific and business management specialists. MOE
is also responsible for non-formal and adult training in these institutions.
Outside the MOE, the Ministry of Agriculture provides satisfactory extension
services and training to farmers; the Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT),



- 7 -
which falls within the purview of the Deputy Prime Minister's Office, trains
technicians and craftsmen, but the college's teachers and facilities are
underutilized and its management weak; and the Swaziland Institute of Manage-
ment and Public Administration lacks adequate facilities and trained staff
to discharge its responsibilities of training civil servants.
The Financing of Education
23.       Between 1971 and 1978, the Government of Swaziland devoted about
12 percent of its total capital expenditures to the development of the
educational system. Over the same period, recurrent expenditures on edu-
cation grew in line with total recurrent expenditures and averaged about
18 percent of total government annual recurrent budgetary allocations.
Government plans for expansion of the system, especially at the primary level,
will entail an increase in the share of the capital budget to about 14 percent
over the next seven years. This level of capital expenditures is feasible as
a large proportion is expected to come from multilateral and bilateral sources.
If the Government lowers student teacher ratios and raises the real salaries
of teachers at an annual rate of three percent, as it has proposed, then the
proportion of recurrent expenditures on education would rise significantly
to 25 percent by 1985. This level, although similar to that in many African
countries, would be difficult to achieve in Swaziland given the competing
demands from other sectors. An alternative possibility of no increasie in real
salaries and a slight increase in student teacher ratios would result. in a
much more modest and feasible increase in the share of education to 19 percent
of the recurrent budget in 1985.
Previous Bank Group Assistance to the Education Sector
24.       To date Bank Group assistance to the education sector in Swaziland
consists of an IDA credit for US$5.0 million approved in 1974 and a flank loan
for US$4.0 million approved in 1977. The first education project provided
assistance to expand vocational/technical education, to establish a curriculum
development center and several school materials production centers and to
build several rural education centers (RECs). The project is substantially
completed, and most of the project's educational objectives are expected to be
fulfilled. A second education project focuses on increasing the avaLlability
of junior secondary education by providing four new schools in rural areas,
and strengthening the practical and technical orientation of junior secondary
education through the addition of workshops and science classrooms in 13
existing schools. Project implementation has proceeded well.
25.       Overall preliminary evaluation of the first and second education
projects shows that many, but not all, of the educational objectives have been
achieved. In particular, curriculum development at both primary and secondary
levels is moving forward, satisfactory junior secondary school programs have
been established at new schools constructed under the project, and SCOT has
successfully initiated commercial and catering courses. A number of problems
remain; these include the need for SCOT to expand and improve its vocational
and technical teacher training programs, for MOE to integrate the primary and



- 8 -
secondary curriculum units, and for MOE to evaluate non-formal education
programs at the REC's. The Government is actively addressing these problems,
which should be gradually resolved.
Bank Sector Knowledge, Objectives, and Strategy
26.       The Bank's knowledge of the education sector is good.  A Bank
mission completed a sector survey in 1976, the MOE itself has produced a
number of useful diagonostic studies of the system, including a manpower
study, and MOE is now completing a tracer study of secondary school leavers.
In late 1978, UNESCO conducted an in-depth review of the education and
training sector, which includes detailed recommendations for expansion and
improvement of the system. Bank education missions have regularly visited
the country and participated in a continuing fruitful dialogue with government
officials over policy questions.
27.       The Bank's long-term strategy is to support the Government's
educational goals as articulated in the Third Development Plan. Specifically,
the Bank would continue to help strengthen junior secondary education and
to support primary education, in keeping with the high priority attached
by Government to achieving UPE by 1985.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed project was formally identified in March/April 1978
and prepared by the Government with assistance from the Bank. The project
was appraised in February 1979 and reviewed in the field in July 1979, and
negotiations were held in Washington from October 15-17, 1979. Mr. V.E.
Sikhondze, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, led the Government
delegation. A Staff Appraisal Report on the Project is being circulated
separately. Annex III provides supplementary project data.
Project Objectives and Description
29.       The proposed project aims to improve access, efficiency and
relevance of primary education and junior secondary education as well as
management training for civil servants. The project would carry out these
objectives by:
-    constructing, furnishing and equipping about 31 new primary
schools, 6 new junior secondary schools; and expansion of
about 12 existing primary schools; and expanding 10 existing
junior secondary schools, curriculum development and in-
service training centers and SIMPA;
-    providing about 1.1 million textbooks and 78,000 teachers'
guides to primary school students and their teachers;



- 9 -
implementing evaluation and pre-investment studies; and
-    providing technical assistance.
Overall, the project would provide for construction, furnishing, equipping
and improving of almost 14,000 primary and junior secondary school places,
about 270 staff houses and dormitory space for 26 students at SIMPA.
Project Details
30.       Primary Schools.  The primary schools to be constructed under the
project would be located mainly in rural areas. About 11,000 student places
would be provided and a total of about 13,000 students in new and existing
schools would be accommodated in adequate facilities.  A school mapping study
recently completed by MOE has identified locations for 31 new schools and for
expansion of 12 existing primary schools.
31.       Primary School Textbooks.  The project would support the costs of
four years of a new textbook program, beginning in 1981, during which time
about 1.1 million books and 78,000 teacher guides would be prepared, produced
and distributed to primary school students and their teachers. The books
would be published by a recently established local publishing agency under an
agreement between the Government and a private international publisher.  The
Government would implement an in-service training program for primary school
teachers and would prepare, by January 1, 1982, a plan to continue the fin-
ancing of primary school textbooks after completion of the project (Sections
3.05 and 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
32.       New and Existing Junior Secondary Schools.  Six new junior secondary
schools to be built under the project are located in areas where the problem
of access to secondary education for primary school graduates is particularly
acute. These schools will provide a total of 1,440 new places and will have
adequate facilities to teach the proposed new junior secondary curriculum with
its emphasis on industrial arts, science, home economics and agriculture.
Each school will provide housing for seven of ten staff members.
33.       The proposed improvement of 10 existing junior secondary schools
under the project will enable these schools to teach the new junior secondary
curriculum, and will bring to two-thirds the proportion of adequately equipped
junior secondary schools in the country. Project assistance would enable
these 10 schools to enroll an additional 1,200 students. Although overall
teacher supply is expected to be adequate, Bank staff would monitor this
critical area during the course of the project.



- 10 -
34.       Curriculum Development and In-Service Training.  The present fac-
ilities for curriculum development are inadequate for the staff working in the
primary and secondary curriculum units. The project would support the con-
struction, and/or improvement of a library/curiculum resources center, a
science laboratory, an industrial arts workshop and six offices and would also
provide eight vehicles. The project would also finance construction of a
small, in-service training center in Manzini which would be similar to the
four centers constructed under the first education project and would serve as
a forum for teachers, for in-service training and for the distribution of
learning materials. The center would also include district education offices.
The Government would merge, by January 1, 1981, the primary and secondary
curriculum units into a single integrated curriculum development department
(Section 3.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
35.       The Training of Civil Servants.  The project would support the
expansion and improvement of SIMPA's facilities to enable it to cater for
training of 100 students at any one time, to hold conferences for 100, and
furnish satisfactory boarding for up to 50 middle and high level officials.
Technical assistance to upgrade the quality of staff at SIMPA, and organize
training programs for civil servants, will be provided by USAID and by IDM, a
private management training body. The Government, is preparing a long-term
plan for coordinating the provision of training for civil servants. Dis-
bursements for financing of contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment
for this component would be conditional on the completion of this plan, which
is expected before mid-1980 (Schedule 1, para. 4(b) of the draft Loan Agree-
ment).
36.       Studies and Evaluation and Technical Assistance.  The project would
provide funds for a number of studies focusing on key education issues in-
cluding, inter alia, the measurement of overall results of primary and junior
secondary curriculum reform, the additional pre-testing of learning materials,
an analysis of needs and proposals for the expansion of vocational training,
and the preparation of future projects. The project would also provide funds
for technical assistance and consultant services for architectural design,
procurement and supervision of construction.
Project Implementation
37.       The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), already established within
the MOE under the First Education Project, would administer the proposed
project. The project includes US$740,000 for technical assistance and con-
sultants for architectural, engineering, procurement, and supervisory services
required for project implementation. The PIU would be responsible for the
architectural design and supervision of all project components. Primary
school construction would be based on a simplified design benefitting from
experiences with ongoing building programs. Secondary schools would be
constructed on the basis of second project designs and contracts would be



- 11 -
tendered and awarded in three groups. The project would be implemented over
four years with a proposed Closing Date of June 30, 1984, including nine
months for the completion of payments and withdrawals (see Section 2.04 of
the draft Loan Agreements).
Project Costs and Financing
38.       The total project costs are estimated at US$15.9 million equ:Lva-
lent (including taxes estimated at US$0.6 million) of which approximately
US$10.1 million equivalent, represent foreign expenditures. The proposed
IBRD loan of US$10.1 million would finance the foreign exchange cost or
about 65 percent of the project cost net of taxes while the Government would
finance local costs. The project provides for about eight staff/years of
technical assistance estimated at US$50,000 for 12 man/months. The estimated
price increases for civil works are based upon recent trends and forecasts by
the Ministry of Works and the Project Implementation Unit which are considered
by Bank staff to be reasonable. Price increases for other items are based on
expected world wide trends at the time of appraisal. Total price increases
are equal to 19 percent of the base cost plus physical contingencies.
Procurement
39.       Contracts for civil works, furniture, equipment, and vehicles
estimated at US$13.1 million equivalent, including contingencies, would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with the Bank Group's procurement guidelines. Exceptions to these procedures
equivalent to US$1.3 million are as follows:
(a) Civil works contracts estimated to cost less than
US$250,000 equivalent each for expansion of existing
primary schools and construction of isolated new primary
schools would be awarded according to competitive bidding
advertised locally under local procedures acceptable to the
Bank. The value of such contracts would be about US$1.0
million equivalent including contingencies.
(b) Furniture, equipment and vehicle contracts estimated to cost
less than US$50,000 equivalent each would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally under local
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The value of such con-
tracts would amount to about US$250,000 equivalent including
contingencies.
(c) Services for transporting furniture, equipment and textbooks
to school sites would be procured by local procedures accept-
able to the Bank or would be implemented directly by the PIU.
The value of such contracts would be about US$60,000 equivalent.



- 12 -
40.       Where ICB is used, local manufacturers of furniture, equipment, and
vehicles and textbook printers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15
percent of the c.i.f price of competing imports or the total applicable
customs duties and import taxes, whichever is lower. It is expected that
foreign bidders not already established in the country would not be attracted
to civil works and these contracts would be won by locally registered firms.
41.       The architectural sketch designs, draft tender documents and master
lists of furniture, equipment and vehicles, including proposed grouping, would
be reviewed by the Bank staff. Items would be bulked to the extent practicable,
to encourage competitive bidding and to permit bulk procurement. Review of
tender evaluation documents by the Bank prior to award would be required only
for civil works contracts of US$250,000 equivalent and above and for furniture,
equipment and textbook contracts of US$50,000 equivalent and above.
Disbursements
42.       Proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported furniture,
equipment and vehicles and for printing of imported textbooks; (b) 100 percent
of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured furniture and equipment and of
locally printed textbooks; (c) 70 percent of total expenditures for locally
procured imported furniture and equipment; (d) 100 percent of foreign and
70 percent of local expenditures for technical assistance, consultants, and
studies; (e) 70 percent of total expenditures for project administration
and local transportation of furniture, textbooks and equipment; and (f) 56
percent of total expenditures for civil works. Because of the numerous small
items involved, disbursements for project administration, studies, and local
transportation of furniture and equipment would be made against certificates
of expenditure, documentation for which would not be submitted for review but
would be retained by the Government for inspection by the Bank during project
supervision. All other disbursements would be fully documented. Project
expenditures would be audited annually and audit reports would be provided to
the Bank within six months of the end of the Borrower's fiscal year. Retro-
active financing not exceeding US$100,000 is recommended for project adminis-
tration and for the services of architechtural/engineering consultants after
July 31, 1979.
Benefits and Risks
43.       At both the primary and secondary levels the project would improve
access to education for rural and underprivileged children through provision
about 11,000 places at the primary level and 2,640 places at the junior second-
ary level. The construction program for primary schools emphasize selection
of school locations where children have poor access to primary education or
where there is severe overcrowding.  The six new junior secondary schools
would be located in rural areas with inadequate access to secondary education
and 8 out of the 10 existing secondary schools to be improved would be located
outside the three main cities.



- 13 -
44.       The project would also improve the efficiency and relevance of
education and training. At both the primary and secondary levels new curri-
cula are being introduced which would better equip Swazi children with the
basic skills needed for them to contribute to Swazi social and economic
development. Assistance to SIMPA would specifically strengthen management and
administration of the Swazi economy through support of training programs for
civil servants. Improved primary and secondary school facilities and related
teacher training and education materials would improve promotion rates and
achievement, especially in science.
45.       The project would continue the emphasis on institution buiLding
introduced under the first education project. In particular, through further
support of the curriculum development center, the project would strengthen the
capacity to prepare appropriate curricula and learning materials, and, through
continued support to the PIU, the project would strengthen the capacity for
physical implementation of school construction projects. The project would
also assist in the establishment of a new, permanent program for mass produc-
tion of educational materials.
46.       The project faces no special risk.  The Swazi Government is fully
committed to project goals and has the active assistance of numerous bilateral
and multilateral agencies. The effects of curriculum reform are difficult to
measure because of the complexity of the factors affecting school efficiency
and relevance. Support included in the project for evaluation programs will
provide measurement of some of these effects. A possible obstacle to achieve-
ment of certain project goals lies in the management capabilities of the
curriculum development units of the MOE and the quality of personnel and
programs at institutions such as SIMPA and SCOT (see para. 25). These risks
would be minimized through integration of the curriculum units into a single
department; through implementation of studies to be undertaken on vocational
and nonformal education, and through technical assistance and training provided
by other international and bilateral agencies.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of Swaziland and the
Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, section

C. BANK PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 1058-SW Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$3-5 Million Loan of
December 8, 1974; Effectiveness Date: March 12, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
After earlier delays, project construction is complete. However,
the Water and Sewerage Board (WSB) faces problems of recruitment and retention
of staff. The project's Closing Date has been extended from December 31, 1978
to December 31, 1979. Due to devaluation of the Rand and lower bids than
originally estimated, there will be a loan surplus of about US$0.8 million
which will be cancelled.
Credit No. 518 Education; US$5 Million Credit of December 9. 1974;
Effectiveness Date: March 11, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
Project implementation continues satisfactorily and is proceeding
ahead of schedule due to, inter alia, an early selection of architectural
consultants, as well as consultants for procurement of furniture and equipment.
All civil works contracts have been awarded and nearly completed; all furniture
and equipment have been procured and almost all delivered. Commitments, as
of March 31, 1979, represent about 92 percent of total project cost. Most
of the educational objectives are being achieved. However, the industrial
areas program at the junior secondary level is not suitable for students at
this level; and the Government is currently revising the curriculum in this
area. Additional studies and plans are expected to improve the functioning
and scope of various non-formal education programs.
Loan No. 1108-SW Second Highway; US$7.0 Million Loan of December 9, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: October 13, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
During execution of the project works, a devaluation of the Emalangeni
in December 1975 enabled Government with Bank approval, to expand the size of
the project to include the Phuzumoya-Big Bend Road (24 km). All three roads
were completed on schedule. The last one in June 1978. The total project
cost, including the additional road section, are US$10.1 million, compared to
appraisal estimate of US$9.9 million. Upon Government's request, Bank approved
extension of Closing Date from December 31, 1978 to December 31, 1979 to allow
utilization of unwithdrawn balance towards payment of retension monies to
contractors and supervisory consultant.

Loan No. 1375-SW Rural Development; US$4.0 Million Loan of April 6, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: January 27, 1978; Closing Date:
November 30, 1982
The project became effective on January 27, 1978. Limited releases
of capital by Government caused delays in early project execution, especially
in construction. Additional delays are due to the failure of the Central
Rural Development Board (CRDB) to approve development plans for the IBRD
financial Rural Development Areas (RDAs) and the delayed arrival of the USAID
financed heavy equipment. The project is approximately 20 months be'hind
schedule. Certain steps are being taken towards mitigating the main con-
straints and the rate of project implementation is expected to improve.
Loan No. 1409-SW National Industrial Development Corporation of Swaziland
(NIDCS); US$5.0 Million Loan of May 12, 1977; Effectiveness
Date: July 18, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Commitments under this project are lagging behind expectations
because NIDCS' operations have been slowed down by departure of key staff
members and by its relatively high onlending rate of interest. While commit-
ments are expected to pick up again it is unlikely that disbursements will be
completed before December 31, 1981.
Loan No. 1478-SW  Education II; US$4.0 Million Loan of August 8, 19,'7;
Effectiveness Date: November 7, 1977; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980
Implementation of the project is in general satisfactory. All civil
works contracts have been awarded and construction will shortly be completed
on all components, except that (i) a decision on a site for one school has
not yet been taken because of local disagreements, and (ii) additional staff
housing approved in March 31, 1979 has not yet been completed. Most furniture
and equipment has been ordered and delivered. The project is expected to be
completed about six months behind schedule.
Loan No. 1619-SW Third Highway; US$11.0 Million Loan of September 27, 1978;
Effectiveness Date: December 29, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The contracts with consultants for construction supervision of the
Big Bend Nggwavuma River, and Manzini Mhakondvo River roads were recently
awarded. Bids for construction of the roads were opened recently and are
being evaluated.
