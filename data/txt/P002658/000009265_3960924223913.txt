THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1792-SW)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Education
Project in Swaziland (Loan 1792-SW), for which a Loan of US$10.1 million
was approved in January 1980. The project has been completed and the Loan
accotint was closed on December 31, 1985, eighteen months after the original
Closing Date.
Unesco accepted the Government invitation under the Unesco-World
Bank cooperative Agreement to send a mission to prepare the PCR. Before
going to Swaziland, the mission, comprising a general educator (mission
coordinator) and a consultant architect, spert a week in Washington, D.C.
studying the relevant Bank files and consulting with Bank staff involved
with the project.    The mission  visited  Swaziland during February 2-13,
1987, during which additional data were collected and discussions were held
with some officials who had been involved with the project. A draft
report, based on data collected in Washington and Swaziland, was sent to
the Government and the World Bank for review, and their respective comments
have been incorporated in this report.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comments in September 1988. No comments
were received.

US$10.10 million) was  identified  in Apri.  1978  and soon thereafter was
prepared by the Government.   Project  appraisal in February 1979 and post-
appraisal in July 1979 by the  Bank was followed by negotiations in October
1979. Total project cost was estimated at US$15.90 million equivalent or
Emalangeni 13.83 million,  including  contingencies.   The foreign exchange
cost estimate4 at US$10.10 million, representing 63 percent of the total
project cost, was covered by the Bank loan of the same amount. Following
Board approval on January 15, 1980, the Loan Agreement was signed on
February 7, 1980. The Loan became effective on June 24, 1980.
The project was originally scheduled to be completed in September
1983 and the Closing Date was June 30, 1984. Staff and organizational
problems in the PIU delayed implementation, complicated by a shortage of
experienced contractors for civil works.    Price changes due to the rising
value of the US dollar and the shortage of local funds required the reduc-
tion of some civil works for primary schools. By December 1984, hcwever,
civil works had been substantially ccapleted, except for 68 staff houses
which, because of a technical error in budgeting, were finished in December
1986 with Government funds. Total actual project cost amounted to US$12.74
million, about 20 percent less than the appraisal estimate, but the cost in
local currency was E 18.50 million, about 34 percent more than the apprais-
al estimate. The Closing Date had been postponed to December 31, 1985. Of
the US$10.10 million loan amount, US$7.91 million was disbursed and the
loan account vas finally closed on August 8, 1986 when the undisbursed
balance of US$2.19 million was cancelled.
Obiectives and Scope
In accordance with the Government aim of gearing the education and
training system to be more responsive and relevant to national development
needs, the project was designed to improve (a) access and efficiency in
primary and junior secondary education, and (b) the management skills of
civil servants. In pursuit of the above oLJectives, the project consisted
of the following activities:
(a) Civil Works, Equipment and Furniture for:
(i) Primary schools - construction of 31 new schools and
expansion of 12 existi.g schools to provide a total of
about 11,000 student places; and construction of 203 staff
houses;



(vii)
(ii) Junior secondary schools   construction of six new schools
and expansion of nine existing schools to provide a total
of 2,600 student places, and construction of 66 staff
houses;
(iii) William  Pitcher  Teacher   Training   College  (WPTTC)  -
expansion of science laboratory and industrial arts work-
shop for joint use of WPTTC and Secondary Curriculum Unit
(SCU) staff; zonstruction of a new library/cuiriculum
resource center adja ent to the WPTTC library to provide
support for the 25 professional staff at the SCU and the
Primary Curriculum Unit (PCU); and
(iv) Swaziland    Institute    of    Management    and   Public
Administration (SIMPA) - construction of new offices,
classrooms and 26 dormitory places.
(b)  Tublication and Distribution  of  about 1.1 million Textbooks
and 78.000 Teachers' Guides for Primary Schools
(c)  Technical Assistance.   Fifteen  man-years of expert services
in architectural design, procurement and civil works supervi-
sion for the Project Implementation Unit. Additional funds
were provided for pre-investment studies to be carried out
during project implementation.
Implementation Experience
Tardiness in streamlining the PIU and in appointing key staff was
responsible for the initial  implementation  delay.   Although the PIU per-
formed reasonably well despite staffing and organizational problems, no
attention was given to its institutional development. After three Bank-
funded projects over an 11-year period, there appears to be no permanent
trained PIU staff (paras. 2.04-2.05).    The  rising value of the US dollar
against the Emalangeni raised local costs and reduced the availability of
local funds. This led to a 53 percent reduction in the number of primary
school classrooms constructed, from the project target of 10,880 to 5,126,
resulting in gross overcrowding in existing schools and possibly thwarting
the objective of improving access in primary education (para. 4.03). On
the other hand, while the project succeeded in constructing 95 percent of
the targeted junior secondary school classrooms, enrollments fell short of
the appraisal target by 27 percent, thereby implying considerable space
underutilization (para. 4.04). Overall, the quality of civil works, equip-
ment (including eight vehicles for the Primary Curriculum Unit) and
furniture was satisfactory (paras. 2.14-2.15 and 2.18-2.19). Technical
assistance was used as intended and consultant services were satisfactory
(para. 2.20).
Compared with appraisal estimates, civil works, furniture and
equipment had cost overruns in local currency, whereas in US dollars there
was a cost underrun in  all  categories.   The gross areas constructed were
reduced by 27 percent in primary schools and 13 percent in junior secondary
schools. The reductions accounted for E 1.71 million or US$1.97 million of
the appraisal estimates. Thus the imputed cost overrun is about 16 percent



(viii)
in US dollars and 94 percent in local currency terms (para. 3.03 and Annex
4). The PCR does not explain why the areas per student place for primary
schools were increased by 56 percent and those for junior secondary schools
decreased by seven percent compared with the appraisal provision. At any
rate, the cost per square meter constructed was 151 percent for primary
schools and 62 percent for junior secondary schools above the apprassal
estimates (para. 3.04 and Annex 2).
Results
The PCR declared that the project's educational objectives were
"generally achieved, despite some  shortfalls"  (para.  4.01).   This audit
considers the project to be only partially successful in achieving its
objectives, based on the evidence provided by the PCR. While enrollments
in the project primary schools had increased from 5,650 in 1980 to 12,220
in 1986, the project had provided only 5,130 new places or 42 percent of
what was needed, without taking into account the need to replace facilities
considered inadequate at appraisal (Staff Appraisal Report No.2560-SW,
dated October 30, 1979,  paras.  2.13-2.14).   Using multipurpose rooms and
headmasters' offices as classrooms to accommodate the increased enrollments
(para. 4.03) implies a disruption or at least curtailment of those school
functions for which the converted facilities were intended.
'tIe provision of textbooks and teachers' guides was an important
means of atldressing the issue of educational relevance and quality, but the
project's success in providing the gross numbers of books is clouded by
serious problems in distribution, price and quality of textbooks. Between
1979 and 1987 the Government was reported to have published 96 titles and
1.75 million books, but there is no information on how many were textbooks
and how many teachers' guides (Annex  7).   Progress was slow in developing
new curricula and textbooks mainly because of unclear guidelines on educa-
tional policy, inadequate staff and lack of sui~Ject panels in some areas
(para. 4.09). This audit concurs with the YCR's highlighting of three
issues regarding textbooks and  teachers'  guides:    (a) tardiness of book
distributior in some caLes half a year behind schedule, which undermined
the purpose of publishing the textbooks; (b) acute textbook shortage in
some schools, which appeared to have an adverse impact on student achieve-
ment as measured by the Junior Certificate Examination; and (c) the high
cost of textbooks, even at subsidized rental rates, which has placed them
beyond the reach of many students (paras. 4.11-4.15). The overall quality
of education and efficiency of the system does not seem to have improved
(paras. 4.23-4.24).
In-service training to upgrade the quality of teachers was accele-
rated with assistance from an oversess agency, using a "cascade" system of
training. Regrettably there is no information on the number of teachers
upgraded. The scale of in-service training, however, is limited as long as
the Manzini training center is used for textbook storage instead of teacher
training (para. 4.21). The in-service training of civil servants by SIMPA
has not been successful mainly because of fundamental problems arising
froms (a) lack of a clear mandate for SIMPA and autonomy to perform its
functions; (b) lack of trained staff; and (c) absence of appropriate train-
ing materials (para. 4.26).



(ix)
Sustainability
While the project primary and junior secondary schools, as
Government institutions meeting a basic need, have a reasonable assurance
of being sustained, they face the system-wide problem of inadequate funds
for physical maintenance. Part of the problem stems from the fact that
maintenance is in the hands of the Ministry of Works and Communications
(MOWC) which is inadequately staffed, equipped and funded to carry out its
responsibilities (para. 2.17).   Unless  the  main  issues facing SIMPA are
adequately addressed quickly, the in-service training of civil servants is
unlikely to have any impact on the administrative system.
Findings and Lessons
The following findings and lessons supplement those presented by
the PCR (paras. 6.01-6.06):
(a) The appointment of all essential qualified staff in the PIU
should be a condition of loan effectiveness to avoid costly
implementation delays (paras. 2.04-2.05);
(b) Facilities for storage and distribution should be in place
before the actual publication of textbooks to avoid inordi-
nate delays in delivery of books to schools (para. 4.11); and
(c) The role and responsibilities of a major training institution
such as SIMPA should be clearly spelt out, if necessary by
legislation, and-adequately staffed and equipped as part of
project design to ensure its viability (paras. 4.26-4.27).



CHAPTER I
PRO3ECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
1.01   The Kingdom of Swaziland, a land-locked country lying between the
Republic of South Africa and Mozambique, is one of the smallest countries in
Africa. It has an area of about 17,000 square kilometers. The 1986 Census gave
a population figure of 715,000 compared with the 520,000 estimated at the time
of appraisal in 1979. Topographically there are three regions: the Highveld,
consisting of about 32 per cent of total land area and noted for its wet mountains
and forest; the Middleveld, about 28 per cent of total area, composed mostly of
valleys and most advanced in agriculture; and the Lowveld, ahout 37 per cent of
total area, not too elevated and here cattle production is well advanced. The
country is divided into four administrative regions, namely, Hhohho in the north,
Manzini in the central west, Shiselweni in the south and Lubombo in the east.
1.02   Two district land tenure systems exist in Swaziland. Swazi National
Land (SNL), accounts for about 56 per cent of the rural land area, the ownership
of which is vested in the King in trust for the Swazi nation. Local chiefs
administer land use and allocate the land. The remaining 44 per cent of the total
land area is freehold land, much of which is devoted to large commercial estates
that produce cash crops and exploit forestry resources, all for export.
1.03   Swaziland is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)1/
and the Rand Monetary Area (RMA).   Thus the Swazi economy is highly
vulnerable to developments in and the interests of the Republic of South Africa,
since about 90 per cent of Swaziland imports originate in, or pass through South
Africa which itself absorbs a quarter of the Swaziland merchandise exports.
1.04   Agriculture and forestry are the largest components of the Swazi
economy, accounting directly for 29 per cent of GDP in 1977, compared with 25
per cent in 1984. The manufacturing sector is primarily based upon processing
agricultural and forestry products for export and accounted for 60 per cent of
total exports in 1977. The industrial sector accounted for about 25 per cent of
GDP in 1977 compared with 22 per cent in 1984. Swaziland has a rapidly growing
modern sector which has coexisted with a largely stagnant, traditional, primarily
rural one, which has barely kept pace with the population growth, of 2.8 per cent
per year in 1977 and 3.6 per cent in 1985. About 48 per cent of the population is
under the age of 15 and about 49 per cent is of working age (15 - 64 years). The
labour force is growing even more rapidly than the population as a whole. Per
capita income in 1986 was about US$500.
1.05   Economic  development  in  Swaziland  is  constrained  by  (a) low
productivity on SNL; (b) shortage of skilled manpower; (c) rising unemployment
in the face of growing population pressures; and (d) a limited capacity to plan
and implement an appropriate development strategy.
1/    Other members are Botswana, Lesotho and the Republic of South Africa.



Sector Setting
Primary Education
1.06   The major problem of primary education, as seen at appraisal when the
overall enrolment ratio was estimated at 92 per centl/, was the fact that only
53 per cent of all primary schools offered the full seven-year primary cyclz. It
was considered necessary, therefore, to provide a full primary education (seven
years) to all children, especially those in the poorest and most sparsely pouulated
areas and, at the same time, improve the efficiency and quality of primary
education and its relevance to national needs.
1.07   The appraisal mission also felt that excessive walking distances to those
primary schools with the full seven-year cycle _nd the high cost of the few
available textbooks both contributed to high dropout. Furthermore, the imported
textbooks had few references to the social, political, economic and geographic
context of Swaziland. In this regard, considerable efforts had been made by a
Primary Curriculum Unit (PCU), established in 1972, to revise the curriculum
and develop appropriate leaming materials, including textbooks, workbooks and
teachers' guides and appropriate teacher training programmes. All of these
activities needed further development.
Secondary Education
1.08   At the junior secondary level, the major problem identified was lack of
student places to respond to the high social demand. About two thirds of those
completing primary schools entered junior secondary schools which, in 1977,
enrolled 40 per cent (15,900) of the population aged 13 to 15. Because of a
shortage of places, junior secondary school directors restricted entrance to their
schools on the basis of geographic proximity and/or examination scores. The
need for physical expansion was felt to be acute.
1.09   Although intemal efficiency  was relatively  high, the quality of
instruction, especially in science and training in practical subjects, was felt to be
in need of strengthening. The curriculum was seen as having been designed to
prepare students for further study at the senior secondary level.
1.10   As with the primary programme, imported textbooks were costly and had
limited relevance to the Swazi environment. A Secondary Curriculum Unit
(SCU), established in 1978, had reformed the junior secondary school curriculum
emphasizing science, agriculture, industrial arts, home economics, and
"development studies".  This reform  was supposed to provide educational
experiences valuable for those who would terminate their schooling at this level,
preparing them for a more active participation in Swazi economic and social life.
However, large scale implementation of these programmes required the provision
of appropriate facilities and training of teachers,
1/    This was on the basis of a population estimate of 520,000 (para. 1.01).



-3 -
Teachers
1.11   The appraisal mission noted that about 74 per cent of the 2,700 primary
school teachers in 1977 were qualified. However, it was estimated that, by 1985,
there would be a shortfall of over 700 teachers. The Government intended to
expand enrolments in teacher training and provide in-service teacher training.
About half of all secondary school teachers were fully qualified but 80 per cent
of the latter were expatriates. It was estimated that about 150 new teachers
would have to be trained locally per year up to about 1987 in order to reduce
dependence on expatriates. The existing programme to train junior secondary
teachers was inadequate and attempts were being made to improve it.
Curriculum Development and In-Service Training
1.12   The PCU and the SCU had developed several curricula and a large
volume of learning materials. First grade Siswati and science textbooks had
already been tested and were ready for distribution by January 1980 along with
the accompanying teachers' guides. However, facilities were inadequate for
further curriculum development and for a necessary increase of 25 professional
staff working in the two curricula centres. It was foreseen that all teachers
would need in-service training to be introduced to the new curricula and their
teaching skills would have to be upgraded in order to use the new learning
materials effectively. It was therefore necessary to provide additional facilities,
especially for science and practical subjects, at the William Pitcher Teacher
Training College (WPTTC).
Training of Civil Servants
1.13   The Government had recognized the need, at appraisal, to upgrade its
7,000 civil servants and antici?ated planning a large scale programme to train
every employee. The Institute for Development Management (IDM), located in
Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, had not been sufficiently responsive to
government training needs. However, the Swaziland Institute for Management
and Public Administration (SIMPA), the agency responsible for training civil
servants, did not have adequate physical facilities.
Formulation of the Project
1.14   The Project was formulated o.ver a period of 19 months. Initial Bank
discussions with the Government on a possible Third Education Project took
place in March 1978, following preparation of the draft education chapter for the
Third National Development Plan and the completion of a manpower survey.
During that time three project items were identified: (i) improvement and
expansion of primary schools; (ii) provision of science and practical facilities for
junior secondary schools and construction of a small number of new junior
secondary schools in disadvantaged areas; and (iii) construction of one or two
regional vocational training centres. The high cost (E 7,876,557) of these centres
together with a supporting Technical Teacher Training Centre may have been
among the reasons why they were not included in the eventual project. Extensive
follow-up discussions were held with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the
Deputy Prime Minister's Office during a Bank supervision mission in April 1978,



- 4 -
and agreement was reached in principle on the overall scope of the Project. In
July 1978, a Bank consultant assisted government officials in initiating a school
location planning exercise necessary for the primary school component of the
project. In December 1978, a Bank mission reviewed preparation activities and
identified two additional project components which would: (i) assist primary and
secondary curriculum development and production of associated teaching
materials; and (ii) assist in improving in-service training of Government officials.
To assist in project preparation the Government utilized the services of a local
consultant who was working under contract at the Project Unit. These services
were financed under the Second Education Project.
1.15   With  preparation   sufficiently  advanced,  a   four-man   Bank
Preparation/Appraisal Mission visited the country in early February 1979,
followed by a Post-appraisal Mission in July 1979. Negotiations were held in
Washington between 15 and 17 October 1979, followed by Board approval of a
Loan of US$10.1 million on 15 January 1980. The Loan Agreement was signed on
7 February 1980 and became effective on 24 June 1980.
1.16   The Project prepared was in harmony with the country's education needs
and with the Government's objectives and development strategy.
Project Justificatiork
1.17   The Project was designed to assist the Kingdom of Swaziland make its
education and training systems more responsive and relevant to national
deveilopmeant needs, with the view to ensuring that its civil servants would
contribute more effectively to national development. Furthermore, since most
schools did not have sufficient staff housing, which was necessary (particularly in
rural areas) to attract and retain qualified staff, the Project provided for staff
housing. Various studies were also included to provide useful data needed for
future planning of development projects.
Pro}ect Objectives and Description
Project Objectives
1.18   The objectives of the Project as stated in the Appraisal Report were to
assist the Government in improving: (i) access to and efficiency of primary and
junior secondary education and its relevance to national needs; and (ii) the
management capacity of civil servants.
Components
1.19   In order to attain these objectives, the Project, as finally agreed,
consisted of the following:
(a)  Primary Schools
Construction, furnishing and equipping of (i) about 31 new and
expansion of 12 existing primary schools to provide about 11,000
student places at the 43 schools and (ii) 156 two-bedroom houses
and about 47 bachelor (one-bedroom) houses.



-5-
(b)  Junior Secondary Schools
Construction, furnishing and equipping of (i) six new junior
secondary schools and expansion and equipping of nine existing
ones, for about 2,600 student places; and (ii) 45 three-bedroom and
J two-bedroom staff houses for the 15 schools.
(c)  *iextbooks
Provision of about 1.1 million textbooks and 78,000 teachers' guides
to primary schools.
(d)  Curriculum Development
Expansion of physical facilities for curriculum development and for
in-service training at WPTTC in Manzini.
(e)  Expansion of SIMPA
Construction, furnishing and equipping offices, classroorns and
about 26 semi-private dormitory places.
(f)  Te&rical Assistance
15 main/years of expert services to the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) for architectural design, procurement and supervision of
construction.
(g)  Studies
(i)  Pre-investment studies included a study of primary school
fees and a study of needs for expanded vocational training;
(ii) evaluation studies were to include first, the pre-testing of
learning materials and secondly, the measurement of the
overall results of the non-formal education programme
supported by the First Education Project and of the primary
and junior secondary education reform;
(iii) a tracer study of secondary school leavers in terms of their
employment and performance;
(iv) a school mapping exercise to facilitate proper school
locations;
(v) a manpower study with emphasis on skilled manpower and
training requirements of the country.
All of these studies were expected to provide useful data for
planning future educational development projects, responsive to
the manpower requirements and training needs of the country.



-6-
Anticipated Benefits and Risks
1.20   The Appraisal Report identified the expected benefits of the Project as:
(i) improved access +o primary and secondary education especially in rural areas;
(ii) better provision of the basic skills needed by school leavers for contributing
to social and economic development; (iii) institution building in preparing
appropriate curricula and learning materials, and in project management; and
(iv) strengthening of management and public administration.
1.21   In the view  of the appraisal team, with the Government's full
commitment to project goals and the active assistance of numerous bilateral and
multilateral agencies which were operating in the country, no special risks were
to be foreseen. However, some doubts were expressed about the quality of
personnel and programmes at SIMPA and their capacity to achieve certain
project goals.

CHAPTER 11
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
2.01   The project was originally scheduled to be completed in four years but
took five and a half years. Instead of the original Closing Date of 30 June 1984,
the disbursement of Loan proceeds ceased on 8 August 1986 when unused
proceeds totalling US$2.2 million of the US$10.1 million Loan were cancelled.
Project management and implementation were efficient and virtually all
covenants were fulfilled. Civil works, delayed by some two years, were reduced
in scope but were completed as finally agreed and the quality of construction
was good. Furniture and equipment were appropriate.
2.02   By and large, the objectives of the project were achieved and the
services of consultants were overall satisfactory. The final cost of the project
as implemented was US$12.7 million compared to US$15.9 estimated at
appraisal.
Project Management
2.03   The PIU, established within the MOE to administer the implementation
of the first and second Education projects, was also responsible for the third
Education project.
2.04   Staffing and Organization Problems. From 1980 to the end of 1981 there
were two separate PlUs. The Primary School Building Unit, established under
the SIDA/Unesco primary school building project, was directed by an expatriate
and the Secondary School Unit had a Swazi director. During this period only one
project primary school and two junior secondary schools were built. In early
1982, the two units were unified into a single PIU. However, a Swazi director
and expatriate deputy director were not appointed until 18 months later because
of differences in views within the MOE concerning the appropriateness of the
qualifications of the candidates.  The rest of the staff included a Swazi
accountant, at one tim.e three expatriate architects, under a chief architect, an
expatriate procurement officer and supporting staff. The PIU was assisted by a
locally based firm of quantity surveyors and a local firm of water supply
engineers. Other supporting staff included an expatriate clerk of works, two UN
volunteers and four Swazis recruited for training as building supervisors (one for
each administrative district). Tender documents and contract awards were
completed by December 1983, about two years behind schedule. This delay was
due to the late appointment of the architectural staff.
2.05   In spite of initial delays and staffing problems, the overall performance
of the PIU was satisfactory. The expansion to the physical facilities for the
Primary and Secondary Curriculum Units, the new In-service Training Centre and
SIMPA were carried out by MOWC more or less on time. The Borrower prepared
and submitted regular semi-annual reports in accordance with the Loan
conditions. These reports were informative and generally on time. However,



8 -
owing to the Project Director's absence abroad on training, such reports were not
submitted during the period from June 1984 to December 1985.
2.06   The present PIU, which is responsible for all MOE schools has been
reduced to the Project director, an accountant, a procurement officer and a
building supervisor (all Swazi nationals). It is grossly understaffed for these
duties. The Project director's high status is reflected in his direct access to the
Principal Secretary (PS) in MOE. However, PIU's present staff capability is
extremely '.mited. The expatriate technical staff left at the end of their
contracts, without fully trained Swazi nationals available to replace them. This
has repeated the pattern in the previous two projects where expertise in PIU
terminated at the end of each project, leading to a loss of experience gained in
project implementation. The last PIU architect's contract expired in December
1985. MOE is willing to appoint an architect in the PIU. However, there are no
Swazi architects in the country and the government is reluctant to hire an
expatriate, without external funding. Consequently, the post remains vacant. Of
the four building superviso s who underwent on-the-job training under expatriate
architects (supplemented with training courses abroad), only two qualified. Of
these, one left for the private sector and the other is still with PIU. The lack of
a permanent trained PIU staff after three projects over a period of II years
(1975-1986) is a serious problem which should concern the Government and the
Bank Group. Particularly crucial is the absence of trained Swazi architects.
Institutional capacity building should have included the training of an adequate
technical staff, and provided appropriate salaries and other incentives to retain
them for the long-term educational development task. This benefit was neither
sufficiently planned for nor fully realized.
Professional Services and Buildin Design
Sites
2.07   At appraisal, the sites of the existing 22 schools eventually included in
the Project were already owned by the Government (para.1.02). Suitable sites
for the 31 new primary schools and 16 junior secondary schools were identified
during appraisal. Owing to preferences expressed by the community, the site of
one of the junior secondary schools was changed during project implementation
with subsequent Bank approval. In general, the new schools are well sited and
adequately laid out with provision for future expansion. However, only 10
project primary and six junior secondary schools have access to electricity.
Availability of water has been a problem, with frequent breakdowns of the many
pumps provided. In a number of schools, water is regularly delivered by tankers.
Design
2.08   In general, PlUs designs for the Project are adequate. The new school
facilities (including related staff housing), together with expansion to existing
ones were undertaken by architects appointed to the PIU, with services provided
by local consultants for quantity surveying and structural/mechanical
engineering. Design of extensions to the Primary and Secondary Curriculum
Units, the In-service Training Centre and SIMPA were all undertaken by MOWC.



-9 -
Tendering was in accordance with ICB procedures. The 66 staff houses, later
approved by the Bank for inclusion in the Project, were designed by MOWC and
were tendered locally.
2.09   Schools have concrete floors, load-bearing brick and/or concrete block
walls, timber roof structures and corrugated asbestos roofing. Teaching spaces
are in accordance with the agreed working papers and provide acceptable
teaching conditions. Teachers' housing is of an acceptable minimum level of
comfort and space. However houses designed for married teachers are often
used as shared accommodation by single teachers, a situation which suggests the
need for design flexibility and adaptability.  However, some spaces  (e.g.
multipurpose rooms, library, etc.) could have been better planned. Initially, the
multipurpose space was first approved as a covered area, which later was found
inappropriate and had to be enclosed at additional expense. In some instances,
owing to increased enrolment, multipurpose rooms were divided into two
classrooms by movable partitions. Similarly, in some cases, the headmaster's
office has been converted to a classroom. A utilization study was dearly needed
to find out requirements in relation to existing schools rather than reliance on
assumptions made by the architects who were somewhat unfamiliar with the
local situation. Funds were available to undertake such a study.
2.10   Another issue is the need for school security, to avoid willful damage and
theft.  In many instances, communities have undertaken to provide night
watchmen.  Although it should be recognized that it is difficult to design
completely vandal-proof buildings, it is possible to introduce various design
features to ensure increased security. However, in the experience of the
Goverment, the best security is provided by strengthening the skills of the school
administrations in establishing good relations between school and community.
2.11   The new Library/Curriculum Resource Centre, constructed adjacent to
WPTTC Library at Manzini, is satisfactory, but the extension to the library is
used by the students only for study purposes. Because the Project did not include
funding for books for these shelves, they remained partially empt since project
completion. The drainage system is inadequately designed and is frequently
blocked. The conversion of classrooms into offices has been adequately designed
but the function of these facilities has changed to storage of books and
equipment for distribution.
2.12   The design of the In-service Teacher Training Centre at Manzini has
been adequately carried out as a self contained building on a clear site. The
two-storey building consists of an upper floor of offices and a lower floor of
library, workroom and a classroom. Essentially, the lower floor (including the
entrance hall) is used for storage of books for distribution. This is a wasteful use
of space that was designed for other purposes. There is sufficient space on site
to design and build an appropriate area for the storage and distribution of books.
With reasonable foresight, this storage space could have been included in the
project or added to it when the need became clearly urgent.
2.13   The expansion and improvement of SIMPA  is adequate, but the
multipurpose conference room has severe problem of acoustics. A number of
changes in utilization have taken place. The two seminar rooms provided have
been converted to a computer room and a large classroom, respectively. The
conference room is being used as a multipurpose hall. The new offices provided
have been converted to the Principal's office. The library space is adequate but



- 10-
has not been sufficiently stocked. The documentation area is currently used for
storage and many of the library shelves remain there unassembled. Of the three
separate residential blocks provided, one is in a dangerous state of virtual
collapse as a result of settlement and inadequate foundation design. Therefore it
is only partly used.
Civil Works and Maintenance
Construction
2.14   The booming construction industry and higher inflation rates in South
Africa led to the departure of South African (the only foreign) contractors from
Swaziland. Consequently, only Swazi contractors were able to bid for school
construction works.  The construction of the primary and junior school
components was supervised by PIU architects and the appointed firm of quantity
surveyors (see para. 2.08). Site plans were provided by PIU architects, showing
location of standard design blocks supplemented with standard detail drawings.
Bills of quantities were prepared for each school. Contracts were awarded to
small local contractors who often required special guidance and advice. Although
supervision of construction by PIU architects and quantity surveyors was
adequate, primary schools were delayed by 12 months, while junior secondary
schools were delayed by 30 months. At the primary level, however, there was a
shortfall of some 53 per cent in regard to the number of places. Only 5,126
places were provided. This shortfall of 5,754 places was due to the reduction in
the number of classrooms at design stage from seven to three because of
increasing costs, mainly as a result of changes in the exchange rate of the
national currency. Similarly, only three houses per school were built - a total of
only 121 houses, compared to 200 included originally in the Project.
2.15   Because the contract of the last PIU architect ended in January 1986,
supervision, particularly of the 68 remaining houses (completed in December
1986), was inadequate. Because of a technical error in budgeting for the 68
houses, only the government's financing was included in the budget. When these
funds were exhausted, there were delays in paying contractors' final certificates.
Other project components were more or less completed according to appraisal
estimates (see Annex 1). On the whole, contractors performed well and the
quality of construction was satisfactory. Table 2.1 shows the facilities as built
by type of institution:

2.16   The total gross area provided is about 27 per cent less than estimated
appraisal (Annex 2). This is as a result of inflation costs resulting in most cases
in providing only three classrooms, Instead of seven as originally agreed, for
primary schools.
Maintenance
2.17   The majority of the buildings are in reasonably good condition. However,
MOWC does not have the capability in terms of staff, budget and transport to
provide adequate long, term maintenance of school buildings. Already some
buildings show serious defects without MOWC being able to undertake repairs.
For example, MOWC has decided to allow the collapsing residential block of
SIMPA (para. 2.13) to fall completely and then it will be rebuilt. At the
Curriculum Resource Centre, for example, the r-oof leaks badly because of a
construction fault. There are also instances whero~ the toilet facilities for an
entire school have not functioned since the building was occupied. A particular
problem is also recurring damage to water pumps which is due to vandalism
and/or lack of maintenance. Without a qualified architect in PIU, project
buildings are likely to deteriorate rapidly with little hope of repair. In the case
of furniture and equipment, MOE is responsible for repairs, but does not have
adequate funds. In some instances, repairs are being undertaken by school
communities, and whe-e possible, this needs to be encouraged and coordinated.
Any further project requires to take account of building maintenance and, with
the appointment of appropriate PIU staff, can become the responsibility of the
PIU. Future projects need to address the question of a maintenance capability.



- 12-
Furniture and Euipment
2.18   Various school inspectors and the procurement consultants, in close
collaboration with PIU, prepared furniture and equipment lists. The consultants
prepared tender documents and supervised the procurement and distribution of
the goods to the schools. Tendering for furniture and equipment followed ICB
procedures. All furniture was of South Africa origin and all equipment of UK
origin. Furniture and equipment were satisfactorily stored and delivered in time
for the opening of all schools. Where there was a shortage of specialized
teachers (particularly in home economics and technical subjects), PIU withheld
equipment until teachers were posted to Project schools.  Furniture and
equipment are generally satisfactory. However, in some schools,particularly
where the rotating system of classroom use is in force and pupils have not been
allocated specific places, individual desks have been damaged. Plastic chairs
need regular maintenance and repair. The lockers provided are easily broken and
damaged, as keys to locks are frequently lost. Equipment is in general
appropriate to the subjects being taught. However, a frequent complaint from
head teachers of schools visited by the mission is that the size of classes for
home economics classes is limited to the number of kitchen stoves. A similar
constraint regarding equipment exists in the industrial arts workshop.
Vehicles
2.19   The eight project vehicles for the PCU and the regional In-service
Training Centre were provided as originally intended. However, as project
vehicles are now more than five years old, repair and maintenance is of prime
importance. Moreover, there has been a constant increase over the years in the
cost of repairs and maintenance. Consequently, adequate funds are not available
for repair and maintenance. It would have been helpful if the Project had
included funds for a stock of essential spare parts.
Consultants and Technical Assistance
2.20   The technical assistance provision in the Project was used as intended to
hire four staff members for the PIU (two expatriates and two local); for
architectural design, procurement and supervision of construction, a senior
architect and an architect assistant (from June 1980 to January 1984) and two
Swazi draftsmen on consultant contracts (April 1983 to September 1984 and
September 1984 to December 1985, respectively).  The coordinator/chief
architect, the assistant architect, the clerk of works, and two building
supervisors (UN Volunteers) were all funded by Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) and Unesco was the executing agency. The services
of the chief architect were terminated in june 1985. Quantity surveying and
structu.al/mechanical services were carried out satisfactorily by locally based
firms. The services of consultants were overall satisfactory.
Covenants
2.21   All covenants have been satisfactorily fulfilled with one exception
(Annex 3). There was no architect (as was required under Section 3.05 of the
Loan Agreement) in the PIU during the last 12 months of construction.

CHAPTER M1
COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
ProLect Costs and Financng
3.01   The total estimated cost for the Project (including contingencies and
excluding taxes) at appraisal was US$15.9 million, the equivalent of E 13.8
million. The Bank financing of US$10.1 million was expected to cover 63.5 per
cent of total costs. As implemented, the final cost of the Project was US$12.7
million (E 18.5 million), about 34 per cent higher than the appraisal estimate in
local currency and 20 per cent lower in US dollars. The Bank financed 62.3 per
cent of the actual costs, with the Government covering the remainder.
3.02   A detailed comparison of appraisal estimates and actual costs by
categories and items, expressed in local currency and in US dollars, is shown in
Table 3.1.

3.03   As comoared with appraisal estimates, including contingencies, three major
categories had cost overruns in terms of local currency, whereas, in US dollar
currency terms, there were cost underruns in all five categories. The difference
according to currency is explained by the rise of the dollar relative to Emalangeni.
The Project itself was reduced in scale by 27 per cent in gross area in primary
schools and 13 per cent in junior secondary schools. These reductions accounted
for E 1.71 million or US$1 J7 million of the original total cost estimates. Thus the
imputed cost overrun is of the order of 16 per cent in US dollar terms and 94 per
cent in local currency terms. A comparison of appraisal estimates and actual
capital cost for physical facilities, furniture, equipment, professional services and
technical assistance in US dollars is shown in Annex 4.

Areas and Cost per Student Place
J.04   In comparison to appraisal expectations, areas per student place for
primary schools provided under the Project increased by 56 per cent. Areas per
student place for junior secondary schools appear to have decreased by some seven
per cent. In terms of local currency, there was an overall cost increase per square
meter above appraisal estimates, for both primary and junior secondary schools, of
151 and 62 per cent respectively. Details on the above ire provided in Annex 2.
Disbursements
3.05   Final disbursement was made and the Loan Account dosed on 8 August
1986. US$7,910,469.06 were disbursed out of a Loan of US$10.1 million. A
comparison of the original estimation and actual disbursement of the Loan
proceeds is given in the Disbursement Table in Annex 5. The disbursement lags
accurately reflected the reduction in the scope of the Project and the delays in
project execution.

CHAPTER IV
INITIAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING OUTCOMES
Overview
4.01   The educational objectives of the Project were generally achieved,
despite some shortfalls. Total primary enrolment in project schools in 1986
exceeded the 1984 appraisal target by 1.2 per cent, although the number of
primary student places was only 47 per cent of the originally agreed number.
Ninety five per cent of the target of places at the junior secondary level was
provided, but there was a 27 per cent shortfall in enrolment. Relevance to
national needs was improved through the continued revision of the curriculum
and the publication and distribution of new textbooks and teachers' guides.
However, this success is still clouded by problems of distribution and of pupil
capacity to buy the books. It is too early to determine the educational impact of
this project upon the efficiency of the educational system. Recent studies
indicate that there has not been any substantial improvement in pass rates on
examinations during the last few years, and there is a general increase In
repetition rates, but drop-out rates have stabilized. Taking account especially of
the economic trends in the region, the problem of provision of jobs for school
leavers may become more difficult. Teachers were upgraded through several
seminars and workshops, and are in general sufficient in number, but there Is a
shortage of qualified teachers for science and practical subjects.
4.02 In regard to the training of civil servants, the number trained at SIMPA
fell far below appraisal estimates of 1,500 per annum. This was due mainly to
staff shortage at SIMPA caused by the lack of salary competitiveness. Four of
the expected five studies completed were found useful in planning future
development projects, but the study on the financing and distribution of
textbooks was incomplete and deficient in that it did not provide for a smooth
and economical distribution system.
Improving Access to Primary Education
4.03   The Project provided 5,126 or 47 per cent of the appraisal target of
10,880 places in primary schools. Enrolment in 1986 in project schools exceeded
the 1984 appraisal targets by 1.2 per cent (para. 2.14). The schools were able to
accommodate this Increase in enrolment by converting some multipurpose rooms
and some headmasters offices into classrooms. Annex 6, summarized below,
presents enrolment in 1980, used by appraisal as the base data, compared with
appraisal 1984 targets and actual places provided and enrolment in 1986. The
differences in enrolment from school to school are considerable. A study of the
reasons for this has not as yet been made.

Improving Access to Junior Secondary Schools
4.04   At the junior secondary level, 95 per cent of the originally planned
student places (for Form I to 111) was provided. However, there was under-
utilization of the facilities. Enrolment in 1980 was 2,164 in the 10 existing
schools compared to the 1984 target enrolment of 4,680 students for the 15
schools3/. In 1986 only 3,433 students were enrolled in the 15 project schools, a
27 per cent shortfall. The mission could not ascertain whether the reason for the
shortfall was over-estimation at appraisal, migration of parents in search of
work, or both. Had a detailed study been undertaken as to the needs at primary
and junior secondary levels, when the reduction in project scope was being
conducted, it might have been found more appropriate to reduce the size of some
junior secondary schools instead of scaling down all of the primary schools. The
school mapping study4t/, completed in August 1979, could have been quite useful
in this respect. Details of enroiment are given in Annex 6. At this level,
however, there was less variation from school to school in the ratio of enrolment
to places. The Government view is that the underutilization of the buildings
stems as well from the inadequate exposure of school administrators to the
rotating use of classroom space. The seminars intended to acquaint them with
this system were inadequate and not properly planned and did not include the
school supervisors; consequently these latter cannot provide the assistance to
the school administrators that they should provide on this matter.
I/     Data were not availatle at the PIU on the schools which had been
reduced in size and efforts to obtain the information from the MOWC
failed.
2/    Schools were completed on 31 December, 1985. One was incomplete.
321    One of the 16 planned schools was not built, reducing the original 5,040
expected enrolment by 360 to 4,680.
4/    This study was used as a criterion in identifying the locations of the 43
new schools.

Curriculun and Textbooks Development
4.05   The PCU, established in 1972, and the SCU, established in 1978, were
merged in May 1983 to form the National Curriculum Centre (NCC). The
Project provided a library/curriculum resource centre (para. 2.11) on the
premises of the WPTTC to be used jointly by the WPTTC and NCC staff.
Primary
4.06   Relevance of curricula to national needs was improved through the
revised primary curriculum, publication and distribution of new primary
textbooks, and teachers' guides by the NCC. Each curriculum designer worked
clo,ely with the respective subject panel in developing the syllabus, teachers'
guides and textbooks which were then examined by the review committee of the
panel, prior to being sent to the 17 pilot schools for a two-year trial period.
Subsequent revision incorporated the feedback from the field trial. The MOE
finally approved the manuscripts and had them published and distributed
nationwide. New curricula have been developed for all primary subjects, but
practical arts materials are still being pilot-tested. The published textbooks,
workbooks and teachers' guides that have been introduced in the nation's primary
schools are given in Table 4.2.

4.07   Practical arts materials in the areas of agriculture, art and crafts, home
economics, physical education and music have been produced and are being tried
out in the 17 pilot schools. The centre hopes to introduce for the first time in
pilot schools trial materials in religious education in 1987.
Secondary
4.08   At the secondary level, the development of relevant educational
materials has not progressed as fast as has been the case at primary level. A
major reason was that when Unesco's involvement in the Secondary Curriculum
Project ended in 1982 (a year before the NCC was established), project activities
decreased. Only four secondary subjects were to be revised: integrated science
and integrated home economics do not have pilot schools. The new curriculum
materials for these two subjects are used nationwide immediately after
development. New curriculum materials for commercial studies have been



- 18-
developed for Form I only and are now being tested in 50 schools. Development
studies, an integrated course of history, geography, and civics emphazing issues
in Swaziland's social and economic development, has only six pilot schools and
revision has also been slow.
4.09   Progress in developing new curricula and textbooks has been generally
slow mainly because of: (i) unclear guidelines on educational policy;
(ii) inadequate staff; and (iii) lack of subject panels in some areas. The mission
urges that the recommendation made by the 1985 National Education Review
Commission (NERCOM) be implemented as soon as possible. This would involve:
(i) reactivating and reinforcing the curriculum co-ordinating committee;
(ii) establishing, filling and supporting the required number of subject panel
posts; and (iii) teachers' colleges working more closely with the NCC.
4.10   However, the mission was assured by the MOE that efforts would be
made to speed up curriculum development at this level. The NCC has set 1991
as the date for having curriculum development at primary school level
completed. Secondary textbooks and teachers' guides have not yet been
standardized, revised and published. They are still being imported and sold by
commercial firms. Individual headmasters select the books they wish to use in
their respective schools, and this results in a wide variation in prices and
standards.
Textbooks
4.11   Three issues have emerged from the textbook development experience.
The first is that distribution from Regional Education Offices (REO) has been
about a half year behind schedule in some places because of a shortage of staff.
An attempt to resolve this problem has been made in 1987 by the publisher
providing funds for one Junior Certificate holder to assist at each REO office.
From 1979 to 1987 the Government published 96 titles and about 1,748,149 books
at a cost of about E 2,715,223. Details are given in Annex 7. A list of student
books by grade and cost was not available.
4.12   The second issue is the impact of books on the performance of students
in school. For example, in a primary school where students had all their books
and supplementary learning materials, 11 scored first-class passes and four
second-class on the Swaziland Primary School Certificate (SPC) examination. On
the other hand, where about half of the students at the junior secondary had no
books, one student scored a first-class pass, nine a second-class, 22 a third-class,
and 19 failed the Junior Certificate Examination (JC)!I. This 37 per cent failure
is alarming and appropriate steps are needed to alleviate the situation. The
principal attributed the lack of textbooks as the major academic problem in that
school. A shortage of books is more acute at the junior secondary level.
According to the school mapping study (published in 1986) 12,600 primary school
pupils and over 3,000 secondary students did not have individ"al textbooks. This
situation is a serious drawback and impinges upon the quality of education
received by those without the required textbooks. An evaluation of the impact
of the books on learning is urgently needed as a basis for a more informed policy
on funding priorities.
1/    The mission could not obtain comparable data for primary and junior
secondary school.



- 19 -
4.13   The third issue is the high cost of textbooks and the ability of students to
purchase them. At appraisal the high cost of textbooks was identified as a major
problem (paras. 1.07 and 1.10). It was expected that by publishing books locally,
students would be able to afford the price. Under the Project a sufficient
number of books for all primary schools has been produced. Since most children
are unable to purchase the books at cost price, the Government has introduced a
rental system of one fourth of the cost price per year per book.
4.14   However, the mission found a variety of patterns in regard to making the
books available: one school rented all the books according to Government
regulations; another school rented only the most expensive ones - social science,
mathematics, and science; still two schools included the cost of all the books in
the annual charges levied on pupils. Some schools covered the books with clear
plastic material to ensure greater durability. At one rural primary school, the
mission was informed that the rent for a set of books was E 50 or US$26.00; for
the secondary school it was E 200 or US$105. These are formidable amounts. In
1987 there was a revised version of third grade social science. This seemed to
have posed a financial problem because copies of the previous version were on
hand still in some schools which had fully paid for the first version. This also
places an additional economic strain on students.
4.15   Considering the fact that most families have at least three children in
school, the total cost for books is far be-ond their ability to pay, especially if
students are at both school levels and in the rural areas. Even at the one fourth
rental price, many students cannot afford to rent the books and therefore go
without any. A provision for this group of children should have been included in
the financing and distribution plan, which seem  not to have recognized the
seriousness of the problem of domestic resource and its negative impact on
learning. This is a serious problem that requires the Government's immediate
attention. It is therefore necessary that Government reviews the rental system
in force with the view to ensuring that each student would have a set of books.
This may involve distributing books, free of charge, to all rural schools.
Impact of In-Service Teacher Training
4.16   The expansion of 1.hysical facilities for in-service teacher training at the
WPTTC (para. 1.12) and the cnnetruction of an in-service teacher training centre
in Manzini were intended to improve the academic qualification of teachers and
increase their skills in presenting materials and teaching methods.
4.17   A  formal in-service  teacher  training  prejcamme  sponsored  by
UNDP/Unesco began in 1975 as an extension of a previous 1972 tJNDP/Unesco
project. At the end of that project in mid-1979 about 1,100 teachers (nearly half
of the total teaching force in primary schools) had passed through the
programme. This project was based at the WPTTC which continued to provide
in-service training on a reduced scale until the arrival of the Ohio University
contract team in May 1984.



- 20 -
4.18   The arrival of the Ohio team  in-service advisor in January 1985 has
resulted in the in-service activities being coordinated on a national basis, using
the 'multiplier effect' principle. Consequently, the team works with 40 selected
schools for each of the four regions, giving a total of 160 schools and
approximately 1,600 teachers coordinated by 10 District In-Service Education
Specialist (DIES) and 20 Local In-Service Teachers (LITS). From December 1985
through November 1986, the Ohio University personnel have conducted over 20
regional workshops which led to over 1,700 individual school workshops.
4.19   As the Permanent Secretary of the MOE observed, ...'enthusiasm for this
in-service programme still remains high, and in-service teacher specialists have
become more skilled in presenting materials and teaching methods for fellow
teachers in their local workshops. These workshops have changed the attitude of
teachers towards inspectors...'l/. Furthermore, in his 1985 report No. three, the
chief of party of the Ohio team declared, '...Never has this Chief of Party seen
such commitment and enthusiasm for an in-service programme'.
4.20   In addition, in-service training through workshops is an integral part of
the NCC activities, organized by the teacher education component, introducing
pilot school teachers to new materials, obtaining feedback, synthesizing
feedback for revision of materials and familiarizing in-service teachers with new
syllabi (see Annex 8) to enable them to introduce these curricula in the schools.
Within recent years there has been an increase in momentum regarding upgrading
of teachers. How much of this was attributed to the Third Education Project is
not clear. However, NCC now operates four types of workshops and seminars
(Annex 8), but no data were available to the mission on the numbers held and
numbers of participants.
4.21   Despite these achievements, in-service training on a larger scale has
been limited by the use of the in-service training centre in Manzini for book
storage. Unless a more efficient book distribution system is established or
another storage space be provided, in-service training at this centre is still a far
way off.
4.22   Other efforts to upgrade the quality of teachers include: (i) cooperation
among teacher training Colleges,,the Ohio University team and the NCC in the
areas of curriculum development and in-service and pre-service teacher
education;  (ii) assistance by the Ohio University team  to the Faculty of
Education of the University of Swaziland in upgrading its curriculum and degree
programmes, including establishing a bachelor's degree programme in primary
education which in 1986, had seven students in the first year and four in the
second year, and (iii) MOE policy, announcing in August 1986 that from 1991 all
teacher educators at the training colleges must possess a bachelor's degree.

DIES workshop: 'School for the Deaf', 19 January 1986.

Efficiency
4.23   It is too early to assess the impact of the qualitative changes now being
introduced in the system upon its internal efficiency, as measured by repetition
and drop-out rates, and passes on examinations. Two studiesi/ conducted in 1986
included the internal efficiency of the education system. The first study found
that there was a general increase in the repetition rates at both primary and
secondary level since 1975 with the inidenre of repeating being 12.64 per cent
of the total primary enrolment, compared with 6.32 per cent at the secondary
level. On the other hand, drop-out rates have stabilized at all levels during the
last decade. The second study indicated that the 'qualitative changes introduced
in the system  apnarently have not made a major impact on improving its
retention capacity'.
4.24   Examination results have become stagnant over the last decade, showing
very little change in the pass rates at the primary and junior secondary levels;
for example, a total pass of 72.7 per cent in 1985 compared with 72.2 per cent in
1986 at the primary level, and 63.2 per cent in 1985 at the junior secondary level
compared with 63.5 per cent in 1986.
4.25   A study of the internal efficiency of the system and the impact of the
qualitative changes now being introducvd could be better determined when all
|.          subjects have been introduced in all grades and when a cohort of students has
gone from grade one through seven.
Training of Civil Servants (SIMPA)
4.26   The Project provided additional physical facilities such as classrooms,
offices, residential quarters and an extension to the library at SIMPA in the
expectation that certain other measures to strengthen the institution could be
taken with bilateral assistance. This item has been a failure in a large measure.
The physical facilities have been provided. However, one of the three dormitory
blocks is unsafe and useless. Moreover, as one report indicated, SIMPA is still in
need of accommodation and physical facilities. The key issue facing SIMPA,
however, is that it is operating at a low level of efficiency (about 25 per ceht of
expected outputs, see Appendix) because of certain fundamental problems which
have been identified in two recent studiesz/:
(i)  lack of clear mandate and the autonomy to perform its functions;
(ii) lack of trained staff including staff at its management level; and
(iii) the absence of appropriate training materials (see Appendix).

- 22 -
4.27   In this context it is clear that the Project priorities were misplaced. Not
only was the assumption about adequate assistance from some other sources
flawed but no investment in physical plant enjoyed higher priority than a more
vigorous effort to place the institution on a sound opera,ing basis, including
conditions about autonomy, the  direct financing of an adequate staff
development plan, including education and training and provision for the library
and for preparation of software.
4.28   Nevertheless, even with its current difficulties, potential exists at
SIMPA. In early 1981, SIMPA carried out an extensive study of training needs in
the Civil Service with the view to improving its own programme in response to
identified needs. This study led to SIMPA preparing a document entitled
'Developing SIMPA's Capabilities - Suggested Areas for Assistance', March 1985.
A second study conducted by SIMPA was 'Planning and Management Skill
Acquisition: A Study of Training Needs in Broad-Casting Services of Swaziland'.
In collaboration with the Division of Extra-mural Services of the University of
Swaziland, and other organizations, SIMPA made an assessment of private sector
training needs in large scale industries. Although the outcome of these studies is
not yet known, they demonstrate SIMPA's potential, if given adequate working
incentives. SIMPA has prepared its own 'Blue-Print for Progress' which aims at
improving SIMPA's training programme to create a regional impact. This study
as well as others made by international organizations merit the serious
consideration of the Government and potential donors.
Studies and Evaluation
4.29   The mission was informed that the following studies had been completed:
'i) a 'Plan for Financing Prira.ary School Textbooks' (by a consultant, May 1985);
(ii) a 'Tracer Study' on secondary school leavers, February 1983; (iii) 'Swaziland
School Mapping/Micro-Planning in Education', MOE 1986; (iv) 'Manpower
Education and Training' by ILO, 1986; and (v) 'Educational Finance in Swaziland'.
The mission was able to receive copies only of the third and fourth of these
studies and received no information on the fifth.
4.30   The Textbook Study   Textbooks and teacher guides were produced
satisfactorily by a ocal publisher in number and quality as envisaged at
appraisal. About 70 per cent of sc!;ool textbooks and teacher guides had been
distributed at the end of 1983; however, the process of distribution, expected to
be completed by June 1985, was one year behind schedule. The Bank supervision
mission of June 1985 found that the system of supply, distribution and financing
of primary school textbooks was unsatisfactory, and urged the MOE to make
further analysis of the recommendations made by the consultant. No further
action appears to have been taken by the Government or by the Bank and this
serious problem was as yet unresolved at the tirme of the completion mission. The
authorities at NCC expressed the view that the distribution plan provided by the
consultant was not suitable and had contributed to the delay in distribution by a
half year. However, the Government and the publishers had made a strenuous
effort to improve the situation in 1987 (para. 4.11).
4.31   The Tracer Study. The tracer study on secondary school leavers had
been found useful by the MOE.



- 23 -
4.32   The School Mapping Study.  The comprehensive school map was
completed satisfactorily in October 1986 with the assistance of an international
specialist and has become a basis for the Govemment to plan objectively and
realistically the future scope of its educational system. The mapping exercise
also provided a valuable opportunity for on-the-job training for local staff, and
enabled the members of the Regional Education Advisory Boards, which are
concemed with the development of education in each of the four regions, to
make appropriate recommendations concerning the future trend and scope of
development of education throughout Swaziland.
4.33   The Manpower Study. The Manpower, Education and Training Study has
not yet been acted upon by the Government. During the visit of the completion
mission, a final printed version was made available to the mission. However, the
Govemment has prepared a synopsis of the report. Printed copies of the report
were to be distributed among ministers in preparation for an inter-ministerial
meeting which will examine it and discuss its policy implementations, after
which the Govemment will issue a 'White Paper'.
4.34   Although the report is useful irn terms of presenting and analysing a
considerable amount of essential data, it did not fully cover three key items of
the agreed terms of reference (TOR) particularly:
(a)    Documenting the shortfall between job requirements and attainments in
the education and training of currently-employed persons (section (ii) of
TOR);
(b)    quantifying the need for and probable cost of specialized manpower
training with special regard to the establishment and ownership structure
of the Swazi economy (Section (iv) of TOR); and
(c)    outlining  a  national training  strategy  indicating  the  relative
contributions of the private and public sectors in meeting the training
needs indicated.
4.35   The Govemment is very concemed that the study did not include the
financial implications (TOR number (v)) for the proposals made, especially since
the report would be used as the basis for planning future development projects
and technical assistance requests. However, according to the Govemment, ILO
now has no further contractual obligation to carry out any further work.
4.36   The Govemment's synopsis of the report contains its main findings and
major recommendations as well as the Borrower's preliminary reactions,
indicating where the Government had already taken recommended steps on some
issues and the need for further in-depth studies in other areas. It is suggested
that the final stage of review of the report to draw-up a national manpower,
education and training policy and strategy and determine its financial
implications be done in the form of a strategically planned workshop attended by
all potential donors, including the Bank and Unesco. This would provide the
forum for identifying specific areas of investment for donor assistance on a
coordinated basis. The importance of convening such a workshop as early as
possible cannot be over-stressed.

CHAPTER V
BANK PERFORMANCE
Project Generation
5.01   Project generation covered two and a half years, and was in response to
the Government's educational goals. Bank's support was based upon its policy of
giving priority support to primary education and upon the conviction that the
goals of the country's Third National Development Plan were appropriate and
feasible for its level of derelopment. In addition, the major benefits expected
from the Project were properly identified, although all were not realized. The
concern expressed about the quality of personnel and programmes at SIMPA
being a possible obstacle to the achievement of certain project goals was well
founded and proved to be real. In order to overcome this danger, it was expected
that technical assistance and training would be provided by other international
and bilateral agencies. It appears that this support was not provided at the level
expected. The Bank should have endeavoured to obtain better guarantees for
assistance, followed by close monitoring. The Project should have provided funds
for the purchase of an adequate number of library books and for training a
librarian for SIMPA. The cost of some project items was under-estimated by the
appraisal mission, furniture in particular (para. 3.02).
Project Implementation
5.02   The expected training and development plan for SIMPA, prepared in
April 1980, did not yield positive results. SIMPA did not operato effectively and,
despite efforts by supervision missions to have the authorities take corrective
measures, the Bank proved ineffective on this.  Textbook distribution was
unsatisfactory, even at the time of the Completion Mission which was informed
by the authorities at the NCC that the incomplete textbook distribution plan
prepared by the consultant in May 1985 and received by the Bank in June 1985,
proved unsatisfactory. The Borrower feels that as a result of following the plan,
distribution was about one half year late.
5.03   Although curriculum and textbook development accounted for a major
portion of the Project, no specialist in curriculum development and no general
educator visited the Project. Table 5.1 below shows the extent of participation
in field supervision by various specialists.

5.04   Bank performance on this project was generally good. The areas in
which more Bank attention was needed include: (a) the issue of textbook storage,
distribution and pricing; (b) the development requirements at SIMPA which went
well beyond providing physical facilities and needed specific provisions relating
to organization (including its mandate and autonomy), software development, and
staff development; (c) the inclusion in the Project of arrangements and funding
as needed for maintenance of buildings, equipment and vehicles; (d) the design of
arrangements to ensure institutional capacity in project management
particularly as regards training of architects and procurement specialists; and
(e) the closer supervision of building design work.

CHAPTER VI
LESSONS DRAWN FROM THIS PRO3ECT EXPERIENCE
6.01   The Project concept and design were responsive to the developmental
needs of the country and in accordance wit' -he Bank's policy and priorities. In
general, the objectives of the Project were achieved, although there were some
shortfalls. A lack of proper monitoring by the Government and insufficient
attention and follow-up by supervision missions contributed to these.
6.02   The initial 18 months' delay in appointing architects generated in turn
other delays and cost overruns. After three Bank Group-assisted projects, as
well as the Unesco/SIDA Primary School Building Project, there was no Swazi
architect in the country at the time of the mission. Neither the previous Project
Performance Audit Reports for Projects I and 11, nor the Manpower Education
and Training Report by ILO, draw particular attention to the need for nationals
to be qualified as architects. The experience of this and the first two projects
clearly shows that deliberate and precise measures need to be taken to train
architects and procurement specialists from the outset, especially in the case of
countries where they simply do not exist at all.
6.03   Because in the majority of cases primary school provision was reduced
from seven to three classrooms, there was severe overcrowding. In contrast,
there were instances where junior secondary schools remain underutilized. A
utilization study and a careful analysis of cost effective reductions in relation to
needs in specific catchment areas would have contributed to rdtional savings in
terms of space allocation and costs. A detailed school mapping study was clearly
an essentiai tool in this kind of situation.
6.04   The pace of curriculum development in the practical arts and at the
secondary level suggests that for all curriculum development to be completed by
the Government target date of 1990 some major acceleration is needed.
6.05   The acute shortage of science and practical arts teachers, identified at
appraisal, has not been resolved. This points to the need for more precise
planning and programming of the steps by which the required targets are to be
achieved.
6.06   The provision of textbooks has been fraught with problems of storage,
delivery and financing. It is clear from this case that much more detailed
attention was needed to these aspects and to assessing the teasibility of
proposals from the standpoints of logistics and parental ability to pay.

Appendix
APPENDIX
MANAGEMENT TRAhNING (CIVIL SERVANTS)
1.    SIMPA is the primary government management training institution with
responsibility to provide training to civil servants.  However, the level of
training which SIMPA should provide has not been clearly defined and this is a
source of conflict between the Ministry of Labour and Public Services (MLPS)
and SIMPA administration.  Two recent studies have identified the major
problems of this institute and m.ade recommendations for its improvement.
2.    In 1985 a consultant!' identified the acute shortage of teaching staff as
the basic problem and recommended that:
(a)    a Governing Board, of between seven to 14 persons, including members
from the Government, the private sector and other educational and
professional bodies, chaired by the Principal Secretary of the MLPS be
established;
(b)    a four-to-five year rehabilitation programme be established not later
than July 1985, manned by a team of four international experts;
(c)   the salary structure for faculty and other professional posts be upgraded
substantially in order to attract suitably qualified nationals of the
country to work at SIMPA and have them trained by the international
experts;
(d)    no more trainers should be recruited directly from the university without
prior experience.
3.    The 1986 Bank Report2/ confirms this problem and points out that
SIMPA has reached a position now where its further development is hampered by:
(i) quality of the training programme; (ii) capacity of teaching staff; (iii) salary
and grading structure; (iv) its limited outreach; (v) lack of autonomy; and
(vi) accommodation  and  facilities.   The Report makes an  appropriate
recommendation for each of the above items, some of which are In agreement
with those of the 1985 consultant report. Other major recommendations of the
Bank Report are that:
(a)    SIMPA should be given the next five years to reinforce its base in terms
of its mandate under the proposed Governing Board;
(b)    SIMPA and the IDM, located on the same campus, should collaborate:
IDM should focus on training for the most senior management and SIMPA
should  concentrate  on  programme  for junior and  middle-level
management;

Appendix
(c)    SIMPA should establish a programme of course evaluation, going beyond
participant appraisal of courses at the end of the programme.
4.    In its "Blue Print for Progress", SIMPA identified many of the same
w;oblems as the two previous studies and made similar recommendations. The
need to produce more materials relevant to Swazi managerial requirements, and
the " ... woefully inadequate" teaching staff were strongly emphazied in its "Blue
Print". The report recommended an addition of seven specialist trainers in six
areas! /.
5.    The Completion Mission supports these findings, on the basis of its
assessment of the leadership and the institute itself. All the studies and the
mission's findings tend to convey the same message: SIMPA has not performed
satisfactorily and therefore requires substantial multilateral assistance.
6.    The mission also identified two additional, but more subtle problems. The
Manpower Division of the MLPS, under which SIMPA falls, is equipped neither
administratively nor professionally to exercise its organizational responsibility
for coordination of training. Furthermore, there is no clearly stated policy
regarding SIMPA activities. SIMPA staff belileve that their mandate is to train
staff at every level of government and parastatal agency and they attempt to
provide such programmes, but the Manpower Division thinks that SIMPA should
train staff only up to the middle-level grade. The issue has not yet been
resolved. The second problem is the lack of effective leadership of SIMPA itself.
Leadership crisis involved the retirement of the former Principal, followed by a
vacant period, then the appointment of a new Principal, who has not yet set in
motion the steps needed to resolve the problems.
7.    Regarding the acute shortage of staff at SIMPA, of an approved total of
11 posts, only seven including the principal had been filled at the time of the
Completion Mission. Of this number, one person each in financial management
and computer sciences had gone on study leave in 1987. Therefore only five
staff members were at the Institute at the time of the Completion Mission, two
expatriate Senior Staff Training Officers, one Swazi national Staff Training
Officer and two Swazi national Assistant Staff Training Officers. The shortage
of staff is due mainly to the uncompetitive salary levels.
8.     The Completion Mission was informed that the Bill to make SIMPA
autonomous had been passed in May 1986 by the National Assembly and was
awaiting Royal Assent. It should be emphasized that autonomy alone, withot't
effective leadership and the improvements proposed by the various studies,
would be of no consequence. An effective Governing Board which would effect
the rehabilitation programme would be a major positive endeavour to making
SIMPA what it was originally perceived to become when it was established a
decade ago.

Appendix
9.    The training outputs of SIMPA were far below the appraisal forecast of
1,500 civil servants per year. There were 361 participants trained in 1983
involving 4,325 participant days; 297 in 1984 involving 2,309 participant days;
and 414 in 1986 involving 5,318 participant days. The achievement has been less
than 25 per cent of appraisal target. Clear enrolment figures for 1985 were not
provided for the mission but 16 courses were offered as was the case in 1986.
Summaries of the programmes given by SIMPA for three years are given in
Annex 9.
10.   The facilities provided by the project have been under-utilized as
evidenced by low enrolment and the disorganized library. The staff upgrading
and training programmes that the appraisal team expected to have been
sponsored by USAID and developed by IDM in early 1980, did not materialize;
however, IDM expanded its training programme to cover areas supposed to be
covered by SIMNPA. This over-lapping of functions has been a source of conflict
between the two training institutions.
11.   The functions of SIMPA should be clarified by the Government. For
example, during the visit of the Completion Mission, the Localization and
Training DOtpartment in the MLPS, under which SIMPA falls, conducted a
seminar_ on "Human Resource Development" at a hotel attended by officers
from the Ministry of Health and the MLPS. For reasons unclear to the mission,
it was not possible for SIMPA to host and conduct the seminar, although it had
been requested by the MLPS to do do.
12.   The World Bank study indicated that SIMPA programmes are "too long to
appeal strongly to the private sector", where time is costly in terms of
management and productivity. Short, intensive quality courses would be more
attractive to the private sector (an important participant). Programmes of this
kind could increase enrolment and output.
13.   It is clear that SIMPA needs a complete rehabilitation programme that
would include improvement in management development programme responsive
to national and regional demands, increased staff training (including a trained
librarian) and library devel ;ment, all aimed at full utilization of facilities
provided by the project I . the programme expands in response to identified
needs, the existing facilities could be upgraded accordingly.
