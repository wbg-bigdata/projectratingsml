IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Credit 2109-GH)
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Sixth Power Project in
Ghana, for which IDA approved a credit of SDR15.2 million (US$20 million) on March 27,
1990. The Credit became effective on November 9, 1990 and closed on June 30, 1998, two
years after the original closing date of June 30, 1996.
2.    As of the closing date 28.3% of the credit was disbursed, and the remaining balance of
SDR 10.9 million was canceled. The EIB provided the equivalent of US$28 million, which
together with the IDA amount financed the foreign cost of the Akosombo Hydropower Plant
rehabilitation component of the project, while VRA financed the local cost. Financiers of other
components of the project included: CFD (US$19. 14m), SIDA (US$5m) and AfDB
(US$790,000).
3.    Under-utilization of the Credit occurred because the original technical solution of
refurbishing the hydro turbine runners at Akosombo was abandoned after one refurbished unit
had failed to register the expected efficiency gain. It was therefore decided to replace the
runners instead and IDA financed the design of the runners and model testing. The design was
completed in September 1998 and resulted in turbine that will provide efficiencies higher than
those envisaged at project appraisal. On the basis of these designs, VRA will replace the runners
with EEB and own financing. IDA financing could not be extended for the runner replacement
or for other un-funded components because at the time the decision was made to switch from
rehabilitation to replacement, VRA was already in default of financial covenants under the
Credit.
4.    The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Reynold Duncan, Power Engineer, (AFTGI), and
Takeshi Kikukawa, Energy Specialist, (AFTGI). It was reviewed by Messrs. Mark Tomlinson,
Sector Manager, (AFTG1), Jaime Biderman, Lead Specialist, (AFTS 1), and Joel Maweni, Sr.
Financial Analyst, (AFTG1). Comments were also received from previous members of the
Ghana energy team; Messrs. Mark Segal, Sr. Economist (CPW), Carlos Algandona, Sr. Power
Engineer, (CPW) and Said Mikhail, Sr. Power Engineer (AFTGI). This report was processed
by Erica Hyde, Team Assistant (AFTGI).
5.    Preparation of the ICR began during the Bank's supervision mission in October, 1998
and the draft ICR was completed following the supervision mission of February, 1999. It is
based on material in the project files and information from the borrower, in particular that on
project costs. The borrower's comments and contributions are attached; the co-financiers'
comments have been incorporated as footnotes to paras. (iv) of the Evaluation Summary and
para 17 of the main text.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
GHANA
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Credit 2109-GH)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    The Sixth Power Project was part of a broad program of improving infrastructure to
support economic expansion and reforming public enterprises to deliver goods and services more
efficiently. It focussed on generation, transmission, distribution and institutional development.
The implementing agency of the project was Volta River Authority (VRA) and the project was
in accordance with VRA's development plan for the period 1991 - 1996. The IDA Credit was
used to co-finance the generation component with European Investment Bank (EIB).
Project Objectives and Description
ii.    The main objectives of the project were to enable VRA to maintain the high standard of
reliability of the country's electricity supply and meet projected domestic and export demand up
to the year 1995. The projectwas also to assist VRA to implement its on-going program of
institutional development, designed to meet the challenges of the 1990s. The project
components consisted of: (i) the rehabilitation of the Akosombo hydropower plant, (ii)
transmission development within Ghana and construction of a sub-transmission line to Burkina
Faso; (iii) construction of a second bulk supply substation in Accra; (iv) provision of Northern
Electricity Department (NED) needs up to 1994 for network extension in the Northern Region;
(v) the establishment of a training center; and (vi) studies for future generation and transmission
development and tariffs.
Implementation Experience and Results
iii.   Some of the project components remained incomplete as of the planned completion date
of the project and neither the training center nor the line to Burkina Faso had commenced yet.
Except for the line to Burkina Faso, the main reason for the delays was unavailability of funding,
as some tentative financing at appraisal did not materialize. Furthermore, VRA was unable to
provide the counterpart funding as agreed at appraisal due to its poor financial performance,
caused by low tariffs, reduced hydro generating capacity and the high cost of thermal
supplementation. The distribution component was superceded by the NEP (Cr. 2467-GH),
whereas VRA is yet to secure funding for the training center.



- ii -
iv.   IDA's involvement in the project ended on completion of the design and model testing of
replacement runners for the Akosombo plant, when it was decided, jointly by the borrower and
IDA, to change the project design. As a result, the IDA Credit was under-utilized. IDA
financing could not be extended for the runner replacement or for other un-funded components
because at the time the decision was made to switch from rehabilitation to replacement, VRA
was already in default of financial covenants under the Credit.'
v.    The project achieved its objectives only to a limited extent. All studies, except the
generation development plan, were successfully completed, but out of six physical components,
only the transmission line to Wa was completed. Whereas the redesign of the rehabilitation
component shows an increase of 2% in the EIRR (Economic Intemal Rate of Return),
completion will be delayed by a further eight years. The first phase of the Bulk Supply
Substation for Accra will be completed in 2000; the sub-transmission line to Burkina Faso was
yet to commence due to disagreement on tariffs between VRA and SONABEL(Societe
Nationale Burkinabee d'Electricitie), the power utility of Burkina Faso. The decision by
Burkina Faso to develop its own diesel-driven power plants may have been partly responsible for
the delay.
vi.   During implementation, VRA did not comply fully with the rate of return on fixed assets
(ROR) covenant. The main constraints were inadequate revenue due to adverse hydrological
conditions, the high cost of operating Tema diesel power plant and inadequate tariffs due to
GOG's reluctance to approve increases. Under the ongoing sector reform program, GOG has
since established the Public Utilities Review Commission (PURC), which is an independent
body, reporting to the legislature and among whose responsibilities is the review and approval of
tariffs.
Future Operation and Sustainability
vii.   The only physical component completed, the overhead line to Wa, has sufficient capacity
to sustain demand growth in the Upper West Region of Ghana well into the next decade. The
cost of operation and maintenance will be sustained by revenues from energy sales in the areas
that were electrified and those whose power supply system was reinforced by the line.
Operation and maintenance will make use of the existing, decentralized, organizational structure
and resources. Overall, the project's sustainability is rated uncertain because it is too early to
assess, unambiguously, the outcome of the main component, the Akosombo turbine runner
replacement, now expected to be completed in year 2004.
1 In its comments of June 25, 1999, BIB states ""...1DA fmnacing could not be extended for the runner replacemnent
or for other un-funded components because .VRA was in default of financial covenants under the Credit" (§ 3 of
Preface and iv) of Implementation Experience and results). We understood from our previous contacts that in
any case you would not continue funding VRA investments as long as VRA would remain into the public sector.



- iii -
viii.  Two ongoing projects, the NEP (Cr. 2467) and the Thermal Project (Cr. 2682-GH) are
assisting commercialization of the power sector and continued expansion of the power system.
The ultimate goal of GOG is to improve efficiency of the sector by introducing competition,
private sector participation, and an adequate regulatory mechanism.
Key Lessons Learned
ix.   The major lessons learned in implementation of this project were in: (i) project
preparation; (ii) power supply diversification and (iii) financial viability.
(a)   Project preparation. Extensive research and investigations are important
prerequisites to the preparation of unconventional projects such as Akosombo. Where
uncertainty persists, a properly planned pilot project should be prepared to precede the
project. On the other hand, the Bank and the Borrower should be flexible and accept to
change the design of a project, its scope or the procurement process if it is seen that such
changes will improve the project's outcome. In the case of Akosombo, the change in
design and the selection of two firms to compete in design achieved an efficiency above
the anticipated value.
In the case of cross-border projects, in addition to ensuring that a project is in line
with the development plan of both countries, the Bank should also ensure that there is
agreement on tariffs between the parties. Such agreement should be reached early in the
project in order to avoid delays in implementation due to prolonged negotiations (paras.
v and 29a). In the case of the line to Burkina Faso, it appears that Burkina Faso would
rather develop internal power plants and that could have influenced the disagreement on
tariffs.
(b)   Power supply diversification. Power supply diversification is essential,
especially for countries highly dependent on hydro, such as Ghana was. In Ghana, the
government's delay, until 1995, in deciding to proceed with a 300 MW combined cycle
gas turbine plant which had been planned in the late 1980s, had a severe impact on power
supply in the country, reducing supply reliability and increasing the cost of supply.
(c)   Financial viability. Independent power utility regulation is key to
implementation of cost-reflective tariffs and subsequently, to the financial viability of the
utility. The case of VRA is a classic one where the utility was reduced from being one of
the best performers in sub-Saharan Africa to one of the poor performers in a period of
less than five years, the main reason being late and inadequate tariff approvals by GOG.
The PURC has since been established as an independent body reporting to the legislature,
and one of its responsibilities is to review and approve tariff adjustment applications. In
1998, it approved two tariff increases totaling over 200%. It remains to be seen if its
independence is sustained.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
GHANA
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Credit 2109-GH)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    INTRODUCTION
1.    The power sector in Ghana is characterized by two state-owned power utilities that fall
under the ambit of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MoME) and of late, a number of private
generators providing emergency supplies. Volta River Authority (VRA) supplies electricity in
bulk to Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG), the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO),
several mines, the Akosombo Textile Company, Akosombo Township and to the northern part
of Ghana through the Northern Electricity Department (NED). It also trades electricity with
Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB) and Energie Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI).
ECG distributes the electricity it receives from VRA and the emergency generators to the
southern part of Ghana.
2.    In order to maintain the reliability of electricity supply, meet the projected power
demand, and implement a program of institutional development, VRA studied the economic
viability of the key Power VI project components, and prepared an investment plan for the
period 1991-1996. The program consisted of generation, transmission, distribution and
institutional development.
3.    Credit 2109-GH was a continuation of the Bank's lending to the power sector, which
exceeds that to all other sectors and has helped finance virtually all of the country's major power
sector investments since the country's independence. The project was appraised in June 1989,
and the Credit was approved by the IDA Board on March 27, 1990. The Credit and Project
Agreement were signed on May 7, 1990 and declared effective on November 9, 1990. The
Project was originally scheduled to be completed in 1996 but the completion date was extended
to Junel998. Despite the two year extension, some components of the project remained
incomplete and others were yet to commence at the time of preparing the report. The Credit was
used to finance turbine refurbishment and replacement of governors at Akosombo.

B     STATEMENT AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Statement of Objectives and Components
4.    The main objectives of the project were to enable VRA to maintain the high standard of
reliability of the country's electricity supply and meet projected domestic and export demand
through the year 1995. The project also aimed to assist VRA to implement its ongoing program
of institutional development, designed to meet the challenges of the 1990s. The project
components consisted of:
(a)   rehabilitation of the Akosombo power plant, including reconditioning of the six
turbine runners, installation of new governors, stator windings, equipment for the
overhaul of the electromechanical systems and the supply of spare parts for the
next five years of operation;
(b)   transmission development, including the extension of the 161 kV grid to the
Upper Western and Northern regions, provision of an interconnection with
Burkina Faso (part of the project was a 33kV sub-transmission line and a study on
interconnection) and a second bulk supply substation in Accra;
(c)   provision of the NED needs through 1994 for network extension, to provide
electricity supply in all regional and district capitals in the NED service area;
(d)   the establishment of a training center for VRA that could also be used by ECG
and other Government agencies; and
(e)   studies for future system requirements, tariffs and cooperation in power
generation amongst neighboring countries - Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Burkina
Faso and Nigeria.
5.   In general, the project objectives and their importance to VRA's performance were clear.
However, the means of achieving the objectives were unclear with respect to two components.
First, the intention to supply distribution equipment and materials worth US$17 million was
based on the risky assumption that VRA would fund and execute the installation using its own
resources. Second, there was a failure to clarify the scope of the study on regional cooperation
in power with the result that the study was not carried out (para. 16).
Achievement of Objectives
6.    Overview. Overall, the project's achievement of its objectives was negligible (Table 1),
mainly because most of the components were not completed (paras 13-17). The reliability of
the country's electricity supply diminished and power demand could not be fully met. However,
one of the causes of inadequate generation capacity was outside the control of the borrower.



7.    Reliability. Whereas reliability and efficiency of the single hydroelectric unit that was
retrofitted improved, the improvement in its efficiency was sub-optimal. Optimal performance
could have been achieved if the turbine runner had been redesigned and replaced (para 26, Table
9). Over the project's implementation period, the reliability of power supply in general and
production from Akosombo, in particular, were reduced by unfavorable hydrological conditions,
that resulted in insufficient water in the Volta reservoir. The impact would have been minimized
had the government made a timely decision to proceed with the Takoradi thermal power plant.
Consequently, VRA had to reduce its supply to VALCO, import from Cote D' Ivoire and run the
old and very expensive diesel-driven power plant at Tema. In 1998, GOG invited private
investors to install emergency diesel-driven power plants on a fast-track basis, in order to sustain
industrial production.
8.   Increased Access and Export. Connection of Wa to the grid facilitated implementation
of the NEP and thus increased access to electricity in the Upper and Northwestern region,
although its evaluated EIRR was below the estimate at appraisal (Table 9). Slow
implementation of the distribution component in the NED supply area slowed down access in the
area. Due to delays in implementing the Bulk Supply Substation for Accra and the line to
Burkina Faso, the expected total economic benefit estimated for the Transmission components at
appraisal will not be achieved. Exports of power declined mainly due to the receding level of
the Volta reservoir, and also due to the delay in completing rehabilitation of the hydro units at
Akosombo.
9.   Institutional Development. Among the studies was a study of the White Volta and
other potential hydroelectric sites. The results of this study should assist GOG in implementing
an optimal generation development plan, provided it gives a go-ahead to the study whose terms
of reference were submitted for approval after the hydro study was completed. A study to
interconnect the power systems of Ghana and Burkina Faso will facilitate GOG's and the
region's development of an integrated power system, which will enable the countries to benefit
from the region's diverse generation sources and economies of scale. The tariff study did not
achieve its objective since the tariffs remained below cost recovery levels during most of the
implementation period. The newly instituted independent regulatory body, PURC, aims to
ensure that tariffs are at cost recovery level. Its first test was in 1998, when it approved two
increases totaling an average of over 200%, one in February and the other in September.
PlTRC's future effectiveness will depend on its continued insulation from political influence, be
it from the government or the legislature to which it reports.

C.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
Implementation Record
10.   Overview. The estimated project implementation period at appraisal was from 1991 to
1996, in accordance with VRA's investment program. As of the closing date of the IDA Credit
in June 1998, most of the project components remained incomplete and others, not financed by
IDA, were yet to commence at the time of preparing the report. IDA's involvement in the
project ended on completion of the design and model testing of replacement runners for the
Akosombo plant. This component, which was originally expected to be completed in 1996 as
rehabilitation, is now expected to be completed in 2004 in the form of replacement of turbine
runners. As a result of terminating its involvement before completion of the rehabilitation
component, the IDA Credit was under-utilized. Some tentative financing at appraisal did not
materialize and this resulted in some of the components not being implemented, in particular the
training center.
11.   Generation Rehabilitation. At appraisal, both the consultant and manufacturer of the
original turbines had recommended refurbishment of the turbines because the benefits of
replacement were estimated to be marginal; hence VRA's decision to proceed with
refurbishment. However, tests carried out after refurbishment of one unit revealed that the
turbines had been operating below the manufacturer's guaranteed efficiency since
commissioning and that the efficiency gain of runner design and replacement would be much
higher than the originally envisaged value. A decision was therefore taken to suspend the
project and plan for replacement of the runners (para. 26). However, the possibility of
redesigning the runners to provide an efficiency even higher than the guaranteed value at
commissioning, was not investigated. If this had been done it is likely that the decision to
replace the runners would have been taken at the outset.
12.   The change in design, from runner refurbishment to replacement, shows an increase in
the economic rate of return of 2% (Table 9), but as a result of the change being made midway
through the project, completion will be delayed by about 8 years. The method adopted to select
the contractor to design and supply the new runners was unique and required special
dispensation by Procurement. Selection. of two contractors to compete in the design and
modeling process produced a runner model of higher efficiency than had been anticipated.
13.   Transmission Expansion. The overhead line to Wa is the only physical component that
was completed, and its cost to completion was within the appraisal estimate. Although financing
was available for the sub-transmission line to Burkina Faso, implementation was yet to
commence at the time of preparing the report, due to disagreement on the level of the cross-
border tariff between VRA and SONABEL. Commencement of the Bulk Supply Substation for
Accra was also delayed and work had just commenced at the time of preparing the report, with
completion expected in 2000.
14.   Distribution. For the period up to March 1996, VRA had constructed only about 98 km
of 33kV and 1 lkV lines and about 135km of low voltage lines using its own resources. This



-5 -
component was not properly structured at appraisal and its slow implementation was exacerbated
by shortage of funding. It was superceded by the National Electrification Project (Credit 2467)
which was under implementation and was expected to be completed by March 2000.
15.   Training Center. This component was not implemented due to unavailability of
funding. At the time of preparing the report VRA had completed the building designs using
internal funding, but was still looking for external funding for the foreign cost of the scheme.
The training center remained a high priority project for VRA.
16.   Studies. All studies included in the project, except for the generation development plan
study, were completed within the original implementation period. However, on Regional Power
Cooperation the only study carried out was on a proposed interconnection between Ghana and
Burkina Faso. It was not clear at appraisal what the scope of the study would be.
17.   Project Costs. At commencement, only financing for Akosombo and some of the
institutional components had been secured and the situation did not improve much through
implementation. Of the two physical components that were fully funded, the cost of the
transmission line was within the appraisal cost estimate (Table 8A). Rehabilitation of
Akosombo is expected to cost 86%2 higher than the estimate at appraisal. The increase is due to
the cost of terminating a number of the original contracts, the additional cost of replacing instead
of refurbishing the runners, additional needs due to further aging of the plant and the cost of
delayed implementation.
Major Factors Affecting Implementation
18.   Factors Subject to Government Control. The main factor subject to GOG control
which significantly impacted on project implementation was the adjustment of tariffs. The GOG
was slow in increasing tariffs in response to the devaluation of the local currency and the
resulting inflation. The adjustments, when they came, were also inadequate. Poor financial
performance of VRA was also caused by high receivables due to non-payment by government
departments and ECG. The two factors caused increases in the cost of goods and services and
diminished VRA's capability to provide counterpart funding for the project. GOG was also
responsible for non-implementation of the generation development plan study due to its non-
approval of the terms of reference.
19.   Factors Subject to Control of the Implementing Agency. Delays in securing
fimancing for some components of the project, by VRA, were a major contributor to delayed
completion of the project. At appraisal it was expected that the Government of Spain would
provide US$20 million towards transmission development and US$20 million would come from
the VALCO trust fund. However, when the VALCO fund did not materialize and the loan from
2 EIB states "...Rehabilitation of Akosombo is expected to cost 86% higher than estimate at appraisal..." (§17. Project
Costs). We agree that final cost is to be higher than that of appraisal but we esimate the increase +/- 50%.

Spain was rejected because it was too costly, very little alternative funding was secured to fill
the gap. The funding secured was mainly for the studies.
D.   PROJECT OUTCOME, SUSTAINABILITY, AND FUTURE OPERATION
20.   The overall outcome of the project was unsatisfactory as most of the physical
components were not completed. At Akosombo, the main component and one which the Bank
co-financed, only one out of the six generating units was completed; yet the results were not
optimal. Nonetheless, for this component the additional work that the Bank financed to redesign
the project was highly successful.
21.   Economic analysis. The analysis compared the outcome of the refurbishment work for
the unit that was completed and the results that would have been obtained if the runner had been
redesigned and replaced instead, on the same basis as the original analysis. The only difference,
therefore, was in the cost of implementation and difference in efficiency gain. A higher EIRR
(31% compared to 29%) due to the turbine was obtained for the replacement option.
22.   For the line to Wa, the evaluated EIRR based on the demand growth experienced since
commissioning was 9.7%, compared to the marginal appraisal figure of 11%. However, as the
line was part of a wider development program, with future benefits that include increased
security of supply when the loop from Techiman to Wa is completed, and also taking into
account its social impact, this component is rated satisfactory.
23.   Sustainability and Future Operation. The overall sustainability of the operation is
rated uncertain since the main component, the Akosombo retrofit to be completed in year 2004,
is not sufficiently advanced to permit an unambiguous assessment. However, the benefits of the
line to Wa are likely to be sustained. The line was designed for 161 kV operation but would be
operated at 33kV until demand growth justifies its upgrading to the higher voltage. The line
should therefore sustain demand growth in the Upper West Region of Ghana well into the next
decade. VRA has a well-established and decentralized structure for operating and maintaining
the transmission network and substations. Furthermore, remote operation is possible from
central control using the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. VRA will
use these existing resources and facilities to operate and maintain the line. The quality of
operation of the line will be based on the indicators shown in Table 6. The cost of operation and
maintenance will be sustained by revenues from energy sales in the areas that were electrified
and those whose power supply was reinforced by the line. The only major future expenditure
will be on the cost of upgrading the substations to the higher voltage level to cater for increased
demand.
24.   The ongoing Thermal Power Project, approved in February 1995, and supported by an
IDA Credit (Cr.2682-GH) of US$175 million, will also contribute to the sustainability of the
investments under this project in two ways. First, it is already providing additional generating
capacity to meet demand growth, including demand in areas served by the line to Wa. Second,
it is supporting the restructuring of the power sector which includes, among other actions, the



-7 -
establishment of transmission activities as a commercially-managed business unit with a separate
tariff from that of generation and distribution activities. Further, the planned divestiture of
distribution activities within the next two years and the regulatory changes (para.9) will help to
strengthen the revenue base to support upstream activities in transmission and generation.
E.   IDA PERFORMANCE
25.  IDA's overall performance was satisfactory, although it was deficient during preparation
and implementation with respect to the Akosombo retrofit and most of the other components
respectively. IDA assisted VRA in preparation and identification of the project, which was
consistent with GOG's and the Bank's strategy for the power sector. Comparison between
refurbishment and replacement of the runners, to restore the original efficiency and reliability
could be considered normal. However, with hindsight and considering scientific and
technological development that had occurred in turbine design since the plant was first
commissioned, in 1964, the possibility of exceeding the original efficiency, by redesigning the
runners, should have been considered a possibility at the outset. More expert advise should have
been sought as widely as possible on best practices in the area of turbine rehabilitation. This
would have avoided suspension midway and the resulting delays. Apart from the above,
supervision of the Akosombo rehabilitation component was generally satisfactory. The decision
taken and the method adopted to change the design were unique and best practice under the
circumstances (para 13), although the change should have been effected faster in order to avoid
diminishing the benefits of the increased efficiency.
26.   The deficiency in implementation arose from the little or inadequate attention that was
paid to other components. This may have been the result of the high degree of focus on
Akosombo retrofit. In particular, the shortage of funding that arose due to the VALCO trust not
materializing and the inability of VRA to provide other counterpart funds due to its deteriorating
financial position, was not addressed. As a result of the shortage, the training center was not
constructed, the distribution component was done piecemeal and not completed and the Bulk
Supply Substation for Accra was delayed. If the overall project performance had been regularly
reviewed and if the mid-term review had been conducted timely, it might have been found
necessary to restructure the project. However, the mid-term review was conducted in May 1998,
just before the Credit closed.

F.    BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.   The overall performance of VRA was satisfactory, although the GOG's unwillingness to
increase tariffs and to put in place a power sector planning framework later contributed to weak
financial utilities and to substantial power shortages in 1998. At the corporate level, VRA
established a project team headed by a Director and assisted by a consultant for the rehabilitation
component, while the other, smaller, components were managed by the Engineering Directorate.
It prepared necessary reports timely and fully cooperated with IDA supervision missions.
However, strategic matters such as the design change and identification of outstanding funding
could have been addressed better. Despite the financial difficulties caused by inadequate tariff
adjustments and exacerbated by poor hydrological conditions (para. 28), VRA was successful in
maintaining its contingency fund for foreign exchange throughout the project implementation
period.
28.   The performance of GOG was deficient. Although GOG approved power tariff increases
several times during the project period, the increases were delayed and inadequate to compensate
for the adverse impacts on VRA finances, caused mainly by devaluation and inflation. This was
the main reason for VRA's non-compliance with the ROR covenant (Table 14). In June 1998,
the Bank did not agree to the GOG's request for extension of the NEP Credit, due to the severe
impact low tariffs were having on the performance of both VRA and ECG. It was only then that
a major tariff increase was approved and a Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) was adopted with
both utilities. For VRA the plan comprised: (i) the tariff adjustment, (ii) assumption (by GOG)
of ECG debt to VRA on account of power purchases amounting to Cedi53 billion outstanding as
of December 31, 1997; (iii) deferment for two years (1998 and 1999) of VRA debt service to
Government attributable to IDA Credit on-lent to VRA; and (iv) implementation of efficiency
improvement measures. IDA agreed with the FRP and amended the Credit Agreements for the
ongoing two projects, to postpone the requirement for the 8% ROR for 1998 and 1999. Further,
the GoG was reluctant to conduct a least cost power generation expansion study which could
have identified the higher demand growth than that forecast at appraisal and consequently the
investment needed to meet demand in the late 1990s (para. 18).
G.   MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED
29.   The major lessons learned in project implementation were in: (i) project preparation; (ii)
power supply diversification and (iii) financial viability.
(a)   Project preparation. Extensive research and investigations, followed by proper
design, are important prerequisites to the preparation of unconventional projects such as
the rehabilitation of Akosombo. If uncertainty persist and if practicable, a properly
planned pilot project should precede the main project. At present, a LIL may be the most
appropriate lending instrument in such a situation. On the other hand, the Bank and the
Borrower should be flexible and accept to change the design of the project, its scope or
the procurement process if it is seen that such changes will improve the project's
outcome. In the case of Akosombo, the change in design and the selection of two firms



to compete in the design and model-testing phase achieved an efficiency that exceeded
that which was expected. In addition to ensuring that a project is in line with the
development plan of both countries, the Bank should also ensure that there is agreement
on tariffs between the parties. Such agreement should be reached early in the project in
order to avoid delays in implementation due to prolonged negotiations (para. 30c). In the
case of the line to Burkina Faso it appears that Burkina Faso would rather develop
internal power plants and that could have influenced the disagreement on tariffs. This
should have been resolved much earlier and the funding could have been freed for the
other components that were not funded.
(b)   Power supply diversification. Diversification in the source of power is essential
for continuity and sustainability of supply, especially with uncertain hydrological
conditions such as Ghana was faced with. A mix between hydro and thermal, as well as
regional interconnection, should provide the best security of supply. Although VRA had
planned for thermal supplementation in the late 1980s, GOG decided to go ahead with
the project only after the drought had begun, around 1995. The 300 MW combined cycle
gas turbine (CCGT) plant was under implementation by VRA and other thermal power
plants were planned at the time of preparing the report. The action was late and the cost
of energy from the emergency thermal power plants, which were installed on a fast track
basis, was much higher than would have been the cost of energy from Takoradi CCGT.
(c)   Financial viability. The problem of low tariffs in this project was a case out of
numerous others and as in almost all cases the cause of the problem is political influence
in the running of the power utility, including the setting of tariffs. The case of VRA is a
classic one where over a period of less than five years, the utility was reduced from being
one of the best performers in sub-Saharan Africa, to joining the band wagon of poor
performers. Independent regulation is key to implementation of cost-reflective tariffs. In
Ghana, the PURC has since been established as a multisectoral independent utility
regulating body, reporting to the legislature, whose main responsibility is the review and
approval of tariff adjustment applications. However, it remains to be seen if such
independence is sustained.

Part A: Sector Policy and Restructuring Reforms
1.01 The Govermment's policy reforms are aimed at facilitating market entry into
the energy sector through establishment of a transparent regulatory framework for
tariff setting, licensing of operators, securing additional power generation capacity
and operation of the national grid. Simultaneously, a financial recovery plan has been
developed to improve the viability of the utilities, provide needed financing for
investment and create necessary conditions for private sector investment.
1.02 Significant progress has been achieved with the establishment and operation of
the Public Utilities and Energy commissions. The PURC has increased average tariffs
by more than 200% in 1998 and is set to publish tariff setting guidelines by
September 30, 1999. The EC has been established recently and is working our
arrangements for licensing of operators by December 31, 1999.
1.03 During the pre-appraisal mission for ERSO-I1, it was agreed that the GoG
would prepare a statement of sector development policy (SSDP) describing the
progress achieved todate in sector reforms and the remaining actions. The mission's
preliminary review of the draft outline indicates that the areas discussed during the
December 1998 mission are covered.
1.04 However, to enable the Bank to provide formal comments, MoME will submit
a complete draft including all annexes by March 12, 1999. IDA will provide
comments within five working days of receipt of the draft. In view of the limited
time for the Government to make the SSDP public by March 31, 1999, it is essential
to adhere to this timetable.
1.05 The remaining policy agenda as discussed during the December 1998 mission
comprises: (i) preparation of a strategic indicative plan for the sector; (ii) preparation
and publication of tariff setting guidelines for electricity; (iii) licensing of all
qualifying operators in the electricity and petroleum markets; (iv) preparation of rules
for operation of the national grid; and (v) corporatization and divestiture of selected
business activities. The mission reviewed the status of GOG actions to implement
the remaining agenda and the results are summarized below.
Strategic Investment Plan
1.06 During ERSO II pre-appraisal it was agreed that pending preparation of a
strategic sector indicative plan by the EC when it becomes fully operational, a
Transitional Power System Development plan (TPDP) for 1999-2002 would be
prepared and that capacity requirements under the Transitional Plan, other those filled
by projects under the Emergency Power Supply Expansion Plan (1998-1999) would
be met through competitive bidding. MoME was to advertise consultants services for
preparation of the TPDP by March 31, 1999 and to complete preparation of the plan
by December 31, 1999.
1.07 MoME has subsequently decided to break down the TPDP into three
components comprising the wholesale power supply market plan (WPSM) and the



3
transmission and distribution systems plans. MoME has amended an existing contract
with Synex (Chile) to include the WPSM and this is scheduled to be completed by
September 30, 1999. The WPSM plan will include the power plants already
committed and any others that may be identified based on the load forecast. The
mission requested MoME to include the list of generation plants considered as
committed as an attachment to the SSDP.
Next Steps
(a) MOME to prepare terms of reference, seekfinancing and prepare timetables for
preparation of the transmission and distribution plans by December 31, 1999
(b)provide list of generation plants considered as committed and to be included in the
TPDP as part of the SSDP
(c) complete preparation of the WPSMplan by September 30, 1999 to coincide with
the publication oftariffsetting guidelines.
Preparation of Rules for Operation of the National Grid
1.08 Based on the outcome of the TPDP, the GOG will enact by LI "Electricity
Regulations-Operation of the National Interconnected System" by December 31,
1999. The preparation of the regulations is in progress under a contract with Synex
of Chile.
Tariff Setting Guidelines
1.09 The PURC Act requires the commission to prepare and publish tariff setting
guidelines. An initial draft was reviewed during a workshop of key stakeholders in
1998. PURC has updated the report and plans to hold further consultations with other
sector players before publishing the guidelines in September 1999. The tariffs would
need to be consistent with the structure of the sector; i.e. separate tariffs at the
generation (bulk generation tariff), transmission and distribution levels.
Corporatization of the Electricity Transmission Unit (ETU) is planned for completion
by December 31, 1999 at which time there should be separate tariffs for the
transmission services from those of generation. New tariffs consistent with the
emerging sector structure will be ready for implementation by January 1, 1999.
Corporatization and Divestiture of Selected Business Units
1.10  The reform strategy in this area focuses on the vertical unbundling of VRA
into generation, transmission and distribution; the internal restructuring of ECG into
four business units followed by sale of shares in ECG. VRA has forrned four
companies; (i) Takoradi Power Company; (ii) National Grid Company; and (iii)
Northern Electricity Company.
1.11   Negotiations have taken place between VRA and CMS Generation (US) for
divestiture of the Takoradi Thermal Power plant. A review of the proposed
divestiture is in progress by VRA independent financial advisers. The mission
reviewed the financial advisers inception report which is well prepared and correctly



4
identifies the main areas for analysis to determine the benefits of the proposed scheme
to the various stakeholders. The mission requests VRA and MoME to ensure that
the financial advisers are provided will all relevant and up-to-date information on the
Government decisions regarding the transaction. Further, the advisers should also
access information on lenders requirements (including IDA ) for approving
divestiture transactions related to assets financed with their loans.
1.12 National Grid Company (NGCo). Corporatization of the NGCo will require
an inventory and valuation of transmission assets to be carried out and tariffs for
transmission services to be established. The PURC has collected data on the
transmission network and is updating the value of the network based on the 1996
revaluation and additional investments since then. PURC intends to complete
calculation of transmissions service charges and to be in a position to set transmission
service tariffs by December 31, 1999. For its own corporate purposes, VRA will
conduct its own transmission assets inventory and valuation.
1.13  Northern Electricity Company (NEDCo). The SSDP needs to spell out
Government policy (or process for arriving at policy) regarding the management and
financing of distribution services in the northern part of the country. The
management and financing arrangements need to ensure that any subsidization
required would be explicit. Possible options are: (i) to reintegrate NEDCo with the
rest of the distribution system under a restuctured ECG and have the NEDCo services
subsidized by other consumers; (ii) maintain a separate NEDCo under public or
private management, but with subsidies borne by the Government; (iii) allow for
tariffs reflecting actual costs in the NEDCo concession area. MoME indicated that
its preference for reintegration of NEDCo into the total distribution system.
1.14 ECG . The main actions to be taken in preparing ECG for divestiture are:(i)
(i)inventory, revaluation and allocation of distribution assets into separate business
units as part of internal restructuring of the company; (ii) communication by MoME
of the policy for ECG to the DIC by March 31, 1999; (iii) engagement of a financial
advisor in consultation with DIC by June 30, 1999.
1.15 With respect to the internal restructuring, the mission understood that the
proposals of the change management unit are to be submitted to ECG top
management by March 5, 1999. After management approval the proposed
organizational structure would be submitted to the ECG Board by mid March.
1.16  The assets revaluation and allocation study is proposed to be funded under the
Therrnal Power Credit. The mission requested ECG to submit a draft RFP comprising
draft terms of reference, LOI and draft advertisement for expressions of interest to the
bank by March 31, 1999. The October 1998 mission had already commented on the
draft terms of reference. The consultants will be selected competitively in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines for selection of consultants
1 .17 MoME assured the mission that the memorandum on GoG policy for ECG
would be submitted to the DIC by March 31, 1999 thus triggering the process of
selecting the financial advisers.

Part B: Takoradi Thermal Power Plant
Technical
2.01 Corrosion of Combustion Turbine Parts. The two 100 MW gas turbine sets
(Contract TKI) have been in operation for over a year but are yet to be officially
handed over to VRA. Inspections carried out in November 1998 revealed corrosion
of parts of the combustion turbines, in particular the transition pieces. The corrosion
was severe in Unit 2. The units were therefore taken out of operation while
investigations were in progress. The cause of the corrosion has been found to be high
concentration of sodium and potassium in the light crude oil (LCO), which is the
primary fuel that is presently in use. The contractor, GE, was reluctant to provide the
required spares before receipt of payment because it claimed not to be at fault. The
spares have since been supplied following part payment by VRA (US$ 0.8 million)
and Kuwait Fund (US$ 3.5 million). VRA requested US$ 3.25 million to be provided
from the IDA credit to cofinance the spares. This amount will be allocated from the
unallocated category. Meanwhile VRA has lodged an insurance claim for the damage.
With respect to liability for the damage, whereas GE claims that since the cause was
the LCO, which was supplied by VRA, VRA plan to claim the repair cost from GE on
the basis that the treatment plant (supplied by GE) did not treat the LCO to the
required specification. Measures have now been put in place to ensure that the
sodium/potassium concentration is reduced to the specified level of 1 ppm before it
enters the combustion chambers. One unit was back in service and remaining spares
for the other one had just been received, at the time of the mission. As a result of the
fault, the two associated heat recovery steam generators and the 100 MW steam
turbine generator sets (Contract TK2) are expected to be completed in July, 1999.
2.02 Marine Fuel Pipeline. Following agreement by the contractor GE/Stone and
Webster to carry out a detailed survey of the pipeline and remedial works thereafter,
the contractor commenced the work in October, 1998 and later suspended it on the
basis that they required additional payment. A meeting on the issue, between VRA
and the contaractor is planned for March 11,1999, after which if no agreement is
reached VRA will exercise its option to carry out the work and deduct the cost from
the contract amount. The mission requested VRA to ensure the work is carried out
with no further delay as the pipeline is the lifeline of the project. VRA will inform
IDA the outcome of the meeting, and measures planned to be taken, immediately after
it is held.
2.03 Cooling Water Pipeline. Following initial delays in executing the work,
steady progress is now being achieved and is expected that the pipeline will be
completed in time to allow the projects completion by in July, 1999.
2.04 Exhaust Duct Explosion. Following the explosion that was caused by
residual LCO due to rapid change-over from distillate to LCO between a trip and
restart of Unit 1, temporary repairs were carried out. The damage has now been
repaired permanently using new parts, at the contractor's cost.



6
2.05 Contractor's Claims (TK1 and TK2). The contractor has lodged substantial
claims for extension of time and other reasons. The mission suggested to VRA that it
might be helpful to seek the services of a claims expert in evaluating the claims.
2.06 Site Visit. A visit was made by the mission to the project site. Despite the
delays caused by the corrosion problem, significant progress had been achieved since
the last supervision mission. This included progress on the cooling tower, which was
operational, but using a temporary water supply, heat recovery boilers (that for Unit 2
was operational), and the control system, which was also partly operational. The
mission expressed concern at the careless covering of the fuel pipeline by rocks as a
means of stabilizing it, without informing the client or the Engineer. This clearly
shows that the contractor is aware that the pipeline is unstable and stresses the need to
carry out the work to stabilize it without furither delay.
Status of Utilisation of Credit Proceeds
2.07 A review of the cost estimates and financing arrangements for the Thermal
Power Project during the October 1998 mission had indicated the need for
reallocating funds from the unallocated category to cover cost overruns on the power
plant package. The Government subsequently submitted a reallocation proposal to
the Bank during December 1998. A decision on the reallocation proposal was
delayed pending a detailed update of the estimated costs to completion taking into
account the problems that had resulted in the plant being taken out of service during
November-March, 1999 (para. 2.01).
2.08 The updated costs indicate that VRA requires an estimated US$14.6 million
out of the unallocated category to cover the higher power plant and project
management costs including financial advisers for Takoradi Power Plant divestiture.
In the proposal for reallocation the Government had also requested US$1.7 million to
finance the costs for Akosombo turbine model design and testing. Thus, VRA's total
estimated funding requirement out of the unallocated category for both Akosombo
and Takoradi Power Plant is US$16.3 million.
2.09 The original allocation for MoME components is $4.8 million against US$8.0
million estimated requirement. Thus, MoME is proposing to reallocate US$3.2
million to support policy reform and demand side management components.
2.10 The estimated funds under the unallocated category is about US$14.6 million
of which US$2.0 million should be retained as a provision for contingencies. Thus,
US$12.6 million can be considered available for reallocation. The GoG should review
the VRA and MoME requirement of US$19.5 million and submit a revised
reallocation proposal to the Bank.

Part C: National Electrification Project (NEP)
3.01 The NEP consists of (i) a rural electrification component in each of the areas
supplied by ECG and VRA, (ii) electrification of small urban areas by ECG, (iii)
reinforcement and rehabilitation of ECG's urban network and (iv) improvement of
ECG's operational efficiency through strengthening of its commercial operations.
3.02 ECG's Urban Components. The mission focused on the remaining
procurement: (i) substation rehabilitation, (ii) transforners, (iii) telecommunications,
(iv) service centres civil works, (v) materials; implementation schedules; Y2k, and the
financial recovery plan (covered under finance).
3.03 Procurement. The mission clarified the confusion that had arisen on the
method of procurement for the remaining components:
(i) LIB (limited to all previously responsive bids) for substation rehabilitation.
Letters of invitation will be issued to these bidders by March 8, 1999.
(ii) ICB for telecommunications. An SPN will appear in the Development Forum of
March 31, 1999. Draft bid document has been submitted to IDA for review and IDA
response will be provided by March 12, 1999.
(iii) extension of orders to previous suppliers for distribution materials
(iv) competition between previously qualified bidders for service centers. ECG will
clarify the question on prequalification by March 8, 1999
The mission reiterated the need for speed in completing all activities by the credit
closing date (March 31, 2000) and pointed out that IDA would not issue no-objection
for procurement recommendations if it considered it not feasible to complete the work
by the said date.
3.04  It was agreed that due to the very short period of time remaining, procurement
of transformers is unlikely to be achieved by the closing date. ECG may therefore
consider utilizing the funds for Y2k consultancy and critically needed
implementation. A consultant is required to assist with problem identification after
which further financial assistance is likely to be required for implementation. The
mission would support ECG's request. However, ECG agreed to finance minor needs
from internal resources. The next step is for ECG to identify a consultant to assist in
problem identification and to request IDA no objection.
3.05 Implementation Progress. The mission noted good progress on all project
components, except Contract 1/93 B -- Cable Laying. Progress has been slow partly
due to the contractor encountering rock, and mainly due to its poor performance.
Close supervision by the Engineer should ensure completion by the first quarter of
2000. The mission noted the inadequacy of counterpart staff on the project and
advised ECG to make full use of the remaining implementation period of the project
to provide training to its personnel by attaching suitable counterpart staff. ECG
agreed with the mission on the need to put in place a suitable customer management



8
system to adequately support the additional sparsely populated customer base created
by the project, to ensure satisfactory maintenance and operation, including revenue
collection.
3.06 Compound Housing. Due to shortage of meters, most compound houses have
only one meter through which all customers in the compound are supplied. Whereas
most of such customers have low consumption, due to the stepped tariff, the total bill
for each customer is much higher than it would be if each customer was metered
separately. ECG will ensure that future installations are metered separately. For the
short term, ECG proposes to amend its billing software to account for multiple
residential customers per metering point. Over the longer term load limiters and
meters will be installed for existing compound customers.
3.07 VRA's Rural Component. All 13 district capitals that were planned to be
electrified have been connected. The remaining work under VRA's component of the
project consists of supplying 70 out of 115 town contracts (82 remained as at the
November, 1998 mission). The remaining work falls under one contract (out of an
original seven) and is expected to be completed in May, 1999. The mission made a
site visit that included parts of the Brong Ahafo and Northern regions. All work was
of high standard. The project, including the old network of NED, covers a very wide
area and needs adequate resources and an appropriate management structure to
support it. Focus should not only be on technical aspects, but also on commercial,
especially on revenue collection and customer relations. For such a wide area,
decentralization of functions, such as maintenance and revenue collection, is likely to
be cost-effective. VRA took note of the missions advice.
3.08 Y2k Compliance. The mission was informed that the billing system for NED
was about 15 years old and needed replacement. Due to its being non-Y2k compliant,
VRA would like to replace the system before the end of 1999 and requested if it could
be financed under the Thermal project. Due to shortage of funding under the Thermal
Project, VRA was asked to come up with a modest proposal to address critical needs.
However, the scheme shuld be designed to enable expansion at a future date.
Part D: Financial Performances of VRA & ECG
Financial Recovery Plan (FRP)
4.01 The Government, VRA and ECG adopted the Financial Recovery Plan (FRP)
in 1998 in order to improve the financial performance of the two utilities. The FRP
comprises: (I) tariff adjustments; (ii) conversion into equity of ECG accumulated debt
arrears to GoG amounting to c62 billion outstanding as of December 31, 1997; (iii)
assumption of ECG debt to VRA on account of power purchases totalling c53 billion
outstanding as of December 31, 1997; (iv) deferment for two years (1998 and 1999)
of VRA and ECG debt service to Government; (v) reform of the cross debt house
clearing system; and (vi) implementation of efficiency improvements by VRA by the
utilities.



9
4.02 The tariff increases component of the FRP has been implemented effective
September 1998, the debt service streams to be deferred for 1998 and 1999 have been
agreed between VRA and MoF but those for ECG are yet to be finalized.
Finalization of the debt equity conversion approvals for ECG has been delayed. The
mission met with MoF and ECG officials to review the status of these actions and
were informed that the formalities would be completed by the end of March to enable
the 1998 financial statements to reflect the conversions.
4.03 At the Government's request, IDA amended the Credit Agreements for the
National Electrification and Thermal Power Projects to postpone the rate of return
financial covenant on revaluated assets of 8% for the two years of 1998 and 1999 and
replace them by minimum covenants based on the requirements to generate adequate
cash for covering operating expenses, debt service and critical investment needs.
4.04 As part of the FRP, the GoG also required VRA and ECG to prepare and
implement actions plans designed to ensure that ECG payments for bulk power
purchases from ECG and emergency power producers would be met on time; the
GoG would recover the cost of debt equity conversions through subsequent sales of
shares and/or assets in the utilities and the business relationship between ECG and
VRA would be put on a commercial basis through a power supply contract
arrangement. To complete the formalities for GoG adoption of the FRP, VRA and
ECG will confirm to MoF and MoE that their Boards have approved the action plans
submitted by the companies in December 1998. ECG will provide this confirmation
by March 22, 1999 following its next Board meeting on March 18, 1999. VRA will
also confirm prior to March 31 and in time to obtain MoF response by March 31,
1999.
4.05 To ensure timely settlement of bills for power purchases, VRA and ECG were
required to establish an escrow account and to reform/terminate the cross debt
clearing house system. The mission understands that ECG has established an escrow
account which has started to operate since February 1, 1999. Under the arrangement,
75% of ECG's revenue collection from the sale of electricity will be paid weekly into
account. The 75% is an estimation of the ratio of purchase to sale and after a few
months operation of the system a more accurate ratio or percentage will be
established. The mission suggest that the rules for operation of the account including
the priorities for payments out of the account be discussed and formalized between
MoME, VRA and ECG.
4.06 ECG also needs improve its collection of receivables which would enable it to
better meet the cost of bulk power purchases. At the current collection rate the
amounts being escrowed are not adequate to meet the costs of bulk power purchases
and would result in increasing arrears to VRA. The mission met with MoF and ECG
to discuss options for ECG to improve its collection from large public sector and
governmental organizations and ECG will be prepare an action plan by March 31,
1999. The action plan will include proposed mechanisms for expediting collection
form GWSC through escrow or other arrangements and for collection from subvented
organizations through the Common Fund. Implementation of a program of



10
prepayment meters would help to improve ECG cash flows. The mission
recommends that the GoG assist ECG to secure the necessary funding.
4.07 To assist the Government with recovery of the costs of debt equity
conversions, ECG has undertaken a survey of its stock with a view to disposing them
and an action plan to offer ECG for sale by December 31, 1999 has been prepared.
The results of the stock survey indicate that the amount that could be raised from
selling slow moving, obsolete and damaged stocks is negligible. Nevertheless,
discussion of the subject indicated the need for ECG to optimize its stock
management systems. VRA is also reviewing the divestiture plan for Takoradi
Thermal Power Plant.
4.08 Negotiation of a power supply contract between VRA and ECG are planned to
take place in March 1999.
Estimated and Projected Financial Performance (1998-2000)
4.09 The mission reviewed the estimated financial statements for 1998 and the
financial projections for 1999 and 2000 for VRA and estimated financial results for
1998 for ECG. The main assumptions for the future projections include:
(i)    The bulk supply and average retail tariff for 1999 will remain the same as the
current level at the beginning of 1999 until January 1, 2000.
(ii)   Hydrological conditions for Akosombo reservoir will be an average inflow
based on probability study.
(iii) Fuel price for 1999 will remain at the January, 1999 level.
(iv)   The foreign and local inflation rates in 1999 will be 3.4% and 15.0%,
respectively.
(v)   The energy demand and consumption have been estimated by a trend analysis.
4.10  ECG: The mission reviewed ECG financial estimates in 1998. ECG would be
able to cover their operating costs, debt service and critical investment in 1998 as
required under the amended project agreement for NEP. Net financial losses (net
income) for 1998 would be Cedi 33 billion compared to Cedi 51 billion in 1997. The
main factors for the improvement are the tariff increase, deferment of debt service
payments, and the reductions in budgeted capital expenditures for 1998. ECG will
update its financial projections for 1999 an 2000 and submit a copy to IDA by March
19, 1999.
4.11 VRA: The VRA financial estimates for 1998 indicates that VRA would be
able to cover their cash operating costs, debt service and critical investment in 1998 as
required under the amended project agreements for NEP and the Thermal Power
Project. Net financial losses for 1998 would be Cedi 117 billion as compared to Cedi
59 billion in 1997. In 1999, VRA is expected to record net financial losses of Cedi
111 billion. Its debt service coverage ratio would also improve from 1.98 in 1998 to
2.21 in 1999. Even though VRA will be able to cover their cash operating costs, debt
service and critical investment in 1999, the ROR for 1999 is expected to be 0.96%.
The financial projections for 2000 suggests that about 54% of average tariff increase



I1
would be required on January 1, 2000 in order to achieve the covenanted 8% ROR in
2000.
4.12 Debt Contingency Fund. One of the agreements (PA. 4.05 (d) under the
Thernal Power Project requires VRA to maintain a fund to cover foreign exchange
debt service obligations due during the succeeding 12 months period, or the
equivalent of US$ 25 million, whichever is lower. The purpose of this fund is to
ensure that VRA is able to service its debt when faced with shortages of foreign
exchange due to poor rainfall. The amount is banked in a US$ foreign account into
which are paid dollar revenues from VALCO and export. Due to the poor rainfall of
1997 VRA is unable to service its debt and requested IDA's acceptance to utilize the
fund; a similar request was made to EIB. The mission would provide an official
response to VRA's request after consultations in head office, but sees no problem in
VRA utilizing the fund provided it would be used for the intended purpose and would
be replenished over the following year as planned.
Current Issues and Actions
4.13 Y2K Compliance: (a) ECG: ECG has established Y2K committee this year.
The consultancy for the Y2K compliance for the customer billing information system
has been undertaken by ESBI. However, the first invitation for bid of the consultancy
contract for other computers and equipment failed due to lack responses and the
second call for bids has been done. The cost involved in all the Y2K compliance is
being estimated. ECG intends to complete the Y2K compliance preparation work by
July and start testing the system in August so that the system would be ready by the
end of 1999.
(b) VRA: VRA is also in the process of upgrading its system to be Y2K
compliant. Two major systems necessary for the upgrade are the payroll and billing
for NED. While the payroll system has been financed from VRA's internal source,
VRA is seeking an external source for financing the compliance for billing system.
4.14 Customer Operation for ECG: The mission reviewed the current status of
ECG's operations as of the end of 1998. The overall losses in the commercial
operation is 23.0% compared to 21.7% in 1997. The debt sales ratio for non-sensitive
customers has increased to 134 days compared to 109 days at the end of 1997. ECG
assesses the factor for poor revenue collection as the impact of the tariff increase and
the problem in metering compound houses (para. 3.06). ECG has identified doubtful
debt and customers, and contracted with debt collectors for negotiations on the
doubtful debt. The mission urged ECG to further implement a consistent approach to
bill collection and reducing system losses (para. 4.06)
Part E: ICR for Sixth Power Project
5.01  The original scope of this project involved the rehabilitation of Akosombo
hydro-electric units as the main component and included transmission expansion and
several institutional development components. IDA financed part of the rehabilitation
(US$ 15.2 million out of US$ 53.2 million). The mission informed VRA that



12
although IDA had financed only part of the project, it was necessary to evaluate the
performance of the whole project in the ICR since it was the inclusion of all the
components that had justified IDA's participation.
5.02 The mission and VRA discussed implementation of the project. Reports on
the various components and the remaining statistical information were provided by
VRA. The draft ICR will be sent for VRA and GOG's comment by the first week of
April, 1999 and VRA agreed to submit its comments by April 30, 1999.
5.03 Akosombo Retrofit. Information on performance of the single unit that was
retrofitted was provided by VRA. Economic analysis, comparing performance before
and after retrofit will be carried out on the mission's return to headquarters. The
results will be extrapolated to represent the performance that would have have
resulted had all six units been retrofitted, and will be compared with the expected
performance of replacing the runners instead of rehabilitating them, as is now
planned.
5.04  The tentative program for replacing the runners and retrofitting the remaining
units shows completion in 2004. The contract to supply and install the redesigned
turbines has been awarded to GENoest Alpine, whose designs registered the highest
efficiency at model testing. However, VRA is unable to raise its contribution to the
cost of the project and asked for IDA's assistance. As IDA's participation in the
project had recently been completed the mission advised VRA to seel alternative
funding. VRA's further requested IDA to provide US$ 4 million for the replacement
of stator windings on two of the units. This work was not necessary at the time the
present project was appraised and was therefore not included in the original scope..
The mission indicated that this could be considered under a proposed new project,
however, VRA may also wish to first approach EIB which is already involved in the
project.
5.05  Transmission Development. At appraisal of the project the transmission
component was expected to be partly financed by the Government of Spain and other
financiers were being sought to finance the Bulk Supply Point in Accra. Financing
from Spain did not materialize, and AFD financed the 161 kV line to Wa and a
temporary 34/11 kV substation. Construction of the line commenced in February,
1994 and was completed in October, 1995. It replaced the diesel-electric generators at
Wa. Since commissioning, the load has grown by approximately 70%, to 1900 MWh
in January, 1999 and the number of consumers has more than doubled, to 7096 in
January, 1999. The cost of the project was US$ 18.3 million for Phase I; Phase II,
which is yet to commence, is expected to cost US$ 6.5 million; a total of 24.8 million,
compared to US$ 20 at appraisal. The second Bulk Supply Substation for Accra is
under implementation and will be completed in three phases between 2000 and 2004.
Phase I is under implementation with financing from SIDA.
5.06  Institutional development. This component consisted of the establishment
of a training center, and studies on hydroelectric potential, interconnection with
Burkina Faso and tariffs. The former was not implemented due to non-availability of
funding; the study on hydro-electric potential was conducted between 1993 and 1994,



13
with funding from AfDB, and identified Bui on the Black Volta as the least cost
alternative with minimal resettlement. VRA has called for expressions of interest
from private developers to participate in the development of the scheme. The mission
pointed out the need to consider altematives other than hydro in drawing up the
country's generation development plan. GOG's plan is to include both thermal and
hydro alternatives in the planned Indicative Planning Study. A study on
interconnection with Burkina was concluded in October, 1997 and recommended an
construction of 198 km of 225 kV transmission line, to initially be operated at 161
kV. La Cooperation Belge of Belgium have indicated interest to finance, through
AfDB, design and preparation of bid documents for the first phase of the project (161
kV operation). Work is expected to commence in 1999. The tariff study was carried
out in 1992.
5.07 Distribution. The project planned to provide distribution materials for
electrification in areas supplied by NED, but this component was not implemented.
Part F: Possible New Lending Operation
6.01 MoME, VRA and ECG discussed with the mission their tentative
requirements for a possible future lending operation. The objectives of the project
would be to: (i) support institutional reforms, particularly the unbundling of VRA and
ECG; (ii) improve the efficiency of the distribution system components; and (iii)
facilitate private sector investment by financing complimentary investments needed to
transmit and distribute private sector generated power.
6.02 Possible components would be:
(i) transmission system development, especially construction of lines required to
evacuate private sector generated power;
(ii) distribution system reinforcements including separate metering points at bulk
supply points for the business units to be created in the restructuring of ECG; and
(iii) management information systems development for improving the operations of
the restructured ECG and VRA.
6.03 The GoG will formally request the Bank for initiation of work on the proposed
project. VRA and ECG promised to provide the mission background information and
reports on studies already carried out on some of the proposed components.

Thermal Power Project
Takoradi Power Plant
1.01 The Takoradi 300 MW combined cycle thermal power plant currently under
construction is owned by VRA. The combined cycle comprises two 100 MW gas
turbine generator sets that can be fueled by light crude oil (LCO) or natural gas, two
associated heat recovery steam generators and one 100 MW steam turbine generator
set.
1.02  The project consists of eight contracts, TK-1 to TK-8, which are at various
stages to completion, with only TK-8, Marine Investigations, complete. Due to
various factors, completion of the project, which should have been within 1997, has
been delayed. The latest program shows completion in March 1999, but first
synchronization of all three units is scheduled for the end of December, 1998. The
causes of delay include (i) delays in civil works due to a contractor that had to be
replaced, (ii) modifications, such as the relocation of the substation bay for Unit 1,
(iii) the explosion in the exhaust duct of Unit 1 that resulted in major damage and
repair and (iv) problems with the submarine fuel pipeline.
1.03  As of the last supervision mission (May 1998) the major outstanding issue was
that of the marine fuel pipeline. VRA and the contractor, General Electric/Stone &
Webster, were in disagreement as to the status of the pipeline; in particular, whether
or not it needed to be buried. The contractor has since agreed to carry out a detailed
survey of the pipeline and carry out remedial work as found necessary. The mission
requested VRA to ensure that the remedial work is done within the contract amount in
accordance with contractual terms.
1.04  Another outstanding issue was determination of the cause of the explosion in
the exhaust duct. This has been found to be inadequate time allowed between shut-
down and restart to allow for change-over from LCO, which is highly volatile, to
distillate, for the restart. Procedures have now been put in place to avoid recurrence.
The temporary repairs carried out will be replaced by installation of new equipment
on the entire affected section. The fault occurred under operational supervision of the
two gas turbine units by GE, which has been on-going sirce December 1997. During
this period a number of other operational problems have been identified and are being
addressed, such as: the effect of NOx on wear, water treatment, oil sampling,
compressed air system and load rejection. The mission advised VRA to ensure that
all snags are addressed to their satisfaction before take-over. Operational statistics of
the two units are shown in the following table.

1.05  The possibility of conflict between CMS (planned joint owner of the project)
and ESBI (contracted operator) raised during the previous mission, was discussed
with VRA and CMS and both stated that there would be no conflict and that ESBI
would complete their contract as agreed.
1.06 The mission advised VRA on the need to ensure that all equipment supplied
and to be supplied, especially components of the control system, was Y2K compliant
and was informed that standard inquiries had been made by the consultant to the
contractors.
1.07 A visit was made by the mission to the project site. There was good progress
on the heat recovery system, cooling tower, water pump, civil works and the steam
turbine and generator. Work on the plant's control system had stopped due to
unavailability of control cards. The mission advised VRA to ensure that adequate
spares were provided for the control system on hand-over of the project. It is
necessary to commission the control system in time for synchronization of all the
three units. A deadline of December 1998 has therefore been set.
Power Sector Reform and Institutional Development
1.08 Of the total cost of US$ 10 million estimated at appraisal for this component,
about US$ 5.5 million were to be funded out of the IDA credit. The IDA amount was
allocated as follows:
i.    strengthening the power sector regulatory framework and developing a reform
program for the sector (US$ 1.0 million);
ii.   development and implementation of a demand side management program
(US$ 1.5 million); and
iii.  supply of equipment for demand side management (US$ 2.5 million); and
iv.   Institutional development for VRA (US$0.5 million).
1.09  With respect to (i) above, progress to date includes completion of a power
sector reform study, establishment of two regulatory bodies for the sector; i.e. the
Public Utilities Regulatory Commission and the Energy Commission.
Implementation of some elements of the reform program are in progress, especially
restructuring of the utilities into separate business units and divestiture of some units,



4
such as Takoradi Thermal Power Plant. A lot of emphasis is also being placed on
implementation of a financial recovery plan which will facilitate private sector
participation (paras 4.01-4.07). The Government also recognizes the need to
strengthen the framework for private sector participation by clarifying the rules for
competitive market entry, licensing, procedures for defining capacity requirements,
and preferred sources of energy through an indicative planning process. Discussions
on these aspects as well the restructuring of the sector are expected to take place
between the Government and the next IDA energy mission before the end of the year.

1.11   Due to the delays in completion, the Takoradi Power Plant component has
experienced cost overruns, currently estimated at US$5.0 million (see table above). In
addition to these cost overuns, VRA has requested the Bank to consider financing,
the cost of model design and testing for the Akosombo runner replacement which
could not be completed within the closing date of Cr. 2109-GH ( Sixth Power
Project). MoME has also expressed an interest in financing of a number of activities
whose implementation would either advance the power sector reforms or assist the
companies to implement their financial recovery plans and improve their financial
performance. The cost increase on the Takoradi Power Plant and the model design
and testing for Akosombo Hydropower Plant units could be financed out of the
Credit's unallocated category. Activities to support the power sector reforms and the
financial recovery plan could be financed either out of the power sector reform
component or the unallocated category. MoME and VRA will review the options for
utilization of remaining funds (estimated at about US$ 11.7 million) and propose a re-
allocation to the Bank.
'Based on SDR I = 1.41 USD as at appraisal
2 Based on IDA disbursement records, amounts approximately same as those provided by VRA

1.12  It is expected that the proposals for reallocation would also cover completion
of the outstanding demand side management components. MoME is in the process of
contracting implementation activities under this sub-component to the Ghana Energy
Foundation, an NGO partially-financed by USAID. The leader of the Foundation
used to be MoME's official in charge of this sub-component. MoME will send a
report on the proposed contractual arrangements for implementation of the remaining
activities.
1.13   With respect to the cost increases and additional items for the Takoradi
Thermal Power plant, VRA will need to prepare a detailed analysis of the cost
increases which should accompany the request for a reallocation. For the cost
increases in project management costs, a draft addenda should be negotiated with the
consultant and submitted together with detailed justification. Since the design and
model testing for Akosombo Hydropower Plant units was not part of the original
scope and objectives of the Thermal Power Project, the proposed funding under Cr.
2682-GH may require approval by the IDA Board.
1.14  Activities to support the power sector reforms and the financial recovery plan
include: (i) preparation of an indicative plan for the power sector covering demand
forecasts, identification of generation, transmission and distribution capacity
3requirements; (ii) analytical studies and/or other support required to facilitate the
restructuring of VRA and ECG into separate business units; (iii) building capacity in
regulatory affairs in ECG and VRA, particularly formulating and defending tariff
proposals before the regulator; (iv) prepayment meters to assist ECG and VRA in
improving their cash flows; (v) load limiters to assist ECG and other equipment to
assist ECG in managing certain loads; etc. These items fall within the scope of the
original project objectives and could be considered in a re-allocation of the credit
proceeds.
1.15  With respect to the preparation of an indicative plan for the power market,
MoMe will together with the utilities work out the proposals for management of the
study, prepare draft terms of reference for the study and request IDA financing under
the Credit. The mission urged MoME to clarify its policy for competitive
participation in the power market, with respect to bidding vs. negotiation with
suppliers.
1.16  The mission suggested that MoME should coordinate a review of priorities
with the utilities and prepare a proposal for re-allocation of the credit for submission
to IDA through the Ministry of Finance. However, at this stage it may be appropriate
to retain a contingency of about US$2-3 million in the unallocated category.
Divestiture of Takoradi Thermal Power Plant, Phase 1
1.17  VRA briefed the mission on the status of the divestiture process for the first
phase of the Takoradi Thermal Power Plant and on the remaining steps to completion.
3 Support for capacity building for the Energy Commission and the PURC will be considered under
the PEPTA Credit which is managed by the Ministry of Finance.

The mission was informed that the contract for financial advisers to assist VRA in
assessing the terms of the divestiture, preparing required documentation negotiating
with CMS and presenting the divestiture plan to lenders was signed on September 22,
1998. VRA work program shows that the lenders' roundtable review of the proposed
transaction is likely to take place in February 1999. As agreed during the last mission,
the Government will provide lenders with copies of the information memorandum at
least three weeks in advance of the date of the roundtable discussions.
1.18  The mission informed VRA that the Bank has recently developed guidelines
for review of divestiture transactions involving IDA financed assets for which
repayments are still outstanding. The mission agreed to provide VRA with a copy of
the guidelines for information.
1.19  The mission received copies of the financial adviser's contract and inception
reports. IDA comments on the inception report will be forwarded to VRA by
November 5, 1998.
National Electrification Project (NEP)
2.01  The NEP consists of (i) two rural electrification components in each of the
areas supplied by ECG and VRA, (ii) electrification of small urban areas by ECG, (iii)
reinforcement and rehabilitation of ECG's urban network and (iv) improvement of
ECG's operational efficiency through strengthening of its commercial operations.
2.02 ECG's Urban Components consist of (i) reinforcement and rehabilitation of
the main supply points (33/11 kV substations) in the main load centers, (ii)
reinforcement of the sub-transmission system (33 kV overhead lines and underground
cables) and (iii) the extension of supplies to urban settlements.
2.03  The earlier problem of shortage of wood-poles has now been resolved; poles
are being delivered from Norway and local supply has also resumed. However, there
are some shortages of materials such as cross-anns and 11 kV cable. ECG has
requested these, amnong other additional requirements, to be financed from the
unallocated amount.
2.04. A number of work sites within Accra were visited during the mission. Work
was on-going on most sites and was of high quality. The latest commissioning, of
three 33/11 kV substations under component 15/96, is expected to be achieved within
the first quarter of 1999. ECG was advised to ensure that their counterpart staff were
fully involved during implementation, especially on commissioning of the equipment
being newly introduced to the network. The visit included a completed urban
electrification component, Kwashieman, and one under implementation, Sowutoum.
Extensive low voltage networks have been constructed in these areas. Although an
appreciable number of consumers have been connected, there is potential to achieve
many more service connections. The mission requested ECG to put more effort in



7
connecting such consumers and to ensure that the connections were metered and
accounts opened timely, as one way of improving its cash flow.
2.05. ECG's Rural Component consists of the electrification of 348 townships in
six regions. The program is financed by IDA, several bilateral funds and
contributions from the Governmnent's National Electrification Fund. The IDA funds
are utilized mainly in the Eastem and Ashanti regions, while other regions are
financed by the other cofinanciers. Progress of this component has also suffered due
to shortage of poles, but work has resumed with commencement of delivery of both
imported and local poles. The expected completion of this component is March 1999.
2.06. VRA's Rural Component consists of seven contracts; one for the
construction of a grid 161/34.5 kV substation, five for the construction of
subtransmission and distribution systems to provide power supply to 13 district
capitals and 115 towns and one for quality assurance. Work completed so far is
electrification of the 13 district capitals and 33 towns. The main outstanding issue is
the procurement of poles. Due to the financial strain caused by the delayed tariff
adjustment, VRA requested IDA to finance the purchase of 5000 wood-poles. VRA
will compare the feasibility and cost of procuring poles from previous suppliers in
Norway and the local supplier, and inforn the Bank.
2.07. VRA also requested IDA to finance an extension to the project from the
unallocated funds, but agreement was reached with the mission that this was not
possible due to high cost overruns on the on-going components. Therefore
reallocations were made only to cover the overruns, caused mainly by differences
between tendered and actual quantities.
Proposed Reallocation of Credit 2467-GH
2.08. The mnission agreed with VRA and ECG on reallocation of the credit to cover
the cost overruns mentioned above, extensions of reinforcement and rehabilitation
work on the ECG network, procurement of prepayment meters, as well as
implementation of an asset revaluation study and training of staff. The proposed
reallocations (in SDR,000) are shown in the following table.

2.09.  The following remaining components were agreed between ECG and the
mission: (i) supply of prepayment meters, (ii) supply of additional materials for
completion of the rehabilitation work, (iii) replacement of old 1 I kV switchgear, (iv)
33/11 kV transformer upgrading, (v) replacement of the Accra radio communication
system, (vi) consultancy services for replacement of the radio and SCADA systems
and (vi) an asset revaluation study and training. For the SCADA system, agreement
to finance the consultancy services is conditional to ECG providing an acceptable
implementation program for the scaled-down scope, achievable within 15 months, to
the submission of an updated report that justifies the project and provision of written
evidence of availability of bilateral funding for the SCADA system. A brief
description and proposed method of procurement of each of the components follows:
2.10. Supply of Prepayment Meters (SDR580, 000). It is proposed to procure about
2,500 meters whose installation will assist in improving ECG's revenue collection.
The government has also agreed to assist ECG in expanding its prepayment metering
through provision of meters for government and public institutions residential
properties. For consistency, ECG requested that the meters be procured from a
previous supplier of about 4,000 meters currently in service. This would avoid
duplication of vending stations and other additional costs of operating two systems.
The mission agreed to recommend to IDA Management procurement from the same
supplier.



9
2.11  Supply of Additional Materials for Rehabilitation (SDR 500,000). The
materials are required to complete on-going work being carried out directly by ECG
on the II kV and low voltage networks. The mission agreed to recommend to IDA
Management acceptance of ECG's request to procure these items from previous
suppliers provided the suppliers maintained their original prices.
2.12. Replacement of Old 11 kVSwitchgear and Upgrading of Transformers (SDR
1,225, 000). New switchgear is required because spares are no longer manufactured for
the existing switchgear, installed in the 1 960s. Furthermore, the fault ratings of the
switches are below the fault levels of the areas in which they are installed and are
therefore a danger to the lives of operators and a potential source of poor system
reliability. The transformers are required to replace overloaded units in the main load
centers. Procurement for both sub-components will be by ICB.
2.13 Replacement of the Radio System in Accra (SDR 295,000). The original scope
of this work covered both Accra and Tema. In view of time and financial limitations,
only Accra can be achieved. The new system is required for increased capacity and
improved reliability, which will facilitate more efficient and safer operation of the
power supply network in Accra. Procurement will be by ICB.
2.14 Consultancy/Project Management (SDR 495, 000). ECG propose to extend the
contracts of the existing consultants, ESBI, to cover the Radio and SCADA
replacements, and the remaining sub-transmission and the contract with M&M for
rural work. The mission requested ECG to negotiate the extension with the consultant
and submit the draft contract for the Bank's review.
2.15 Asset Revaluation Study(SDR 370,000). The study is required in connection
with the on-going sector reform process. It will revalue the fixed assets and allocate
them to the anticipated business centers. The consultants will be selected
competitively in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Selection of Consultants...
ECG will submit an RFP comprising draft terms of reference, LOI and draft
advertisement for IDA review by November 10, 1998. An initial draft of the TOR
was reviewed by the mission and the revised draft is attached as Annex 2.1. The draft
requires to be developed to provide such additional information as, the size and
geographic distribution of ECG assets, available asset records, available reports from
previous revaluations; detailed reporting requirements specifying the reports to be
produced and the time scales involved; etc.
2.16  Training (SDR 105,000). The proposed program includes mainly short
courses, some of which are provided irregularly by specialized institutions. ECG will
communicate individual requests for the Bank's review.
2.17  Distribution Service Centers (SDR 172,000). This sub-component consists of
the construction of new buildings for the service centers, required to improve
customer service. Procurement will be by local competitive bidding.
2.18  The mission understands that draft bidding documents are available for
replacement of the 11 kV switchgear and upgrading of transmission lines (para 2.12),



10
for replacement of the radio communication system in Accra, and for distribution
service centers. The mission requested ECG to revise the bidding documents taking
into account the revised scope of the components and using the latest SBD ( 1997).
ECG will also submit to IDA by October 30, a procurement plan for all outstanding
activities bearing in mind the need to complete all activities within the remaining 17
months before the Credit closes on March 31, 2000. With respect to the procurement
of additional materials for rehabilitation works and of meters, IDA decision on sole
sourcing will be communicated to ECG by November 10, 1998.
Sixth Power Project
3.01. Project Status. The original scope of this project involved the rehabilitation of
Akosombo Hydro-electric units. However, after rehabilitating one unit it was found
that the expected efficiency improvement was not achievable without major
modifications to the turbines. It was therefore decided to issue bids for the design and
model-testing of new turbines which would have a higher efficiency and replace the
existing turbines. The Bank agreed to finance the development of the models but to
limit its involvement in rehabilitation to the work that had already been carried out --
retrofitting one unit and supplying materials and equipment for the other units.
3.02. Two manufacturers, GENVoest Alpine Joint Venture and Sulzer Hydro were
selected for the model development and design. The contract was completed in
September, 1998, with the performance of both models far exceeding VRA's
specifications. The model of GE/Voest Alpine was selected as least cost. It registered
a higher efficiency (95.08%) at a lower cost.
3.03. The contract to supply and install the turbines has already been awarded to
GE/Voest Alpine and will be financed by EIB. The materials and equipment ordered
for the original scope will be utilized in the new design, with some additions required,
for upgrading of the generators to utilize the increased efficiency of the turbines.
3.04 The mission and VRA discussed arrangements for preparation of an
Implementation Completion Report for the project. It was agreed that an operational
plan for the plant would not be required as the works envisaged at the start of the
project have not been carried out and the revised works are yet to be executed. The
mission provided VRA with copies of the guidelines for preparation of ICRs and
explained the roles of the Bank and the borrower in the process. The following
schedule for preparation of the ICR was agreed:

Financial Performance of VRA & ECG
Financial Recovery Plan
4.01 In mid 1998, the Government VRA and ECG adopted a Financial Recovery
Plan (FRP) for the two utilities. The FRP comprises: (i) tariff adjustments; (ii)
conversion of ECG's accumulated debt service arrears to Govermnent amounting to
c62 billion outstanding as of December 31, 1997; (iii) assumption of ECG debt to
VRA on account of power purchases amounting to c53 billion outstanding as of
December 31, 1997; (iv) defennent for two years (1998 and 1999) of VRA and ECG
debt service to Government attributable to IDA Credits onlent to the companies; (v)
reform of the Cross Debt Clearing House system; and (vi) implementation of
efficiency improvement measures by the utilities.
4.02  Progress to date is as follows:
i.   the average retail tariff was increased by about 129 % as of September 1,
1998;
ii.   The bulk supply tariff for VRA was also increased by about 126% as of the
same date;
iii.  the Government agreed to implement the debt/equity conversion and debt
assumption measures on condition that VRA and ECG submit action plans for
addressmg the measures required of them under the FRP;
iv   IDA agreed to the FRP and will amend the Credit Agreements for the National
Electrification and Thermal Power Projects to postpone the requirement for the
companies to achieve the 8% rate of return for two years, 1998 and 1999 and
to replace it with lower targets for these two years.
v.    VRA has completed technical discussions with the Ministry of Finance's Debt
management Unit to quantify the debt service deferments and to agree on the
modalities for resumption of payments in year 2000.
4.03  Because the debt-equity conversions, debt service deferments and assumptions
are critical components of the FRP, the mission discussed the conditions required of
the companies and the timing for their fulfillment. The mission understands that
submissions to the Ministry of Finance of dated action plans is the basic requirement
for the Government's final concurrence to be given.
4.04 For VRA the action plan should cover: (i) arrangements for a power supply
contract with ECG, including establishment of an escrow account by ECG from which
the settlement of ECG bulk supply purchases to EPPs and VRA will be made; (ii)
reforming of the Cross Debt system, including amongst other things, elimination of
transactions to be settled under escrow arrangements; and (iii) assisting the
Government in formulating a strategy for divestiture of selected power assets.
4.05  For ECG the action plan should cover the following areas: (i) setting up of an
escrow account as described for VRA above; (ii) development of an action plan for
installation of pre-payment meters to be funded by the Government and interested



12
donors; (iii) carrying an inventory of the company's stocks and disposing them, and
collecting long outstanding dues from customers; revaluing its assets; (iv)
restructuring the company into profit centers; and (v) developing a plan for attracting
equity participation in ECG.
4.06 The mission understands that a consultant provided by MoME is assisting
ECG in many of the aspects above. With respect to contractual arrangements with
VRA, ECG staff are also drawing on the expertise of several consultants.
4.07 In discussions with MoME, VRA and ECG it was agreed that the utilities
would submit the action plans at the earliest possible time with a view to obtaining the
formal approvals of the FRP prior to December 31, 1998.
Estimated Financial Results for 1998 and 1999
4.08   The mission reviewed the financial estimates for 1998 and projections for
1999 to establish whether VRA and ECG would be able to meet the interim financial
covenants to be incorporated in the amendments to the credit agreements. The interim
targets are:
i.    coverage of the cash operating costs plus own-guaranteed debt service and
minimum investment needs in 1998; and
ii.   coverage of operating costs plus own guaranteed debt service and minimum
investment needs in 1999.
4.09  ECG. The review of the 1998 financial estimates indicates that ECG will be
able to cover their operating costs, debt services and to finance critical investment.
Net financial losses for 1998 will be Cedi 34 billion compared to Cedi 51 billion in
1997. The main factors for the improvement are the tariff increase, deferment of debt
service payments, and the reductions in budgeted capital expenditures for 1998.
4.10 In 1999, net financial losses will be further reduced to Cedi 0.4 billion
compared to Cedi 34 billion in 1998 as the higher tariffs will be in effect for a full
year. In 1998, ECG debt service coverage ratio is estimated at 1.4 compared to the
covenanted 1.5. The company's debt service capacity is expected to improve to about
1.6 in 1999 in line with improvement in overall profitability.
4.11   VRA  VRA also will be able to cover their cash operating costs, debt services
and critical investment in 1998. Net financial losses for 1998 will be Cedi 35 billion
compared to Cedi 59 billion in 1997. In 1999 VRA is expected to record a positive
net income of about Cedi 60 billion. Its debt service coverage ratio would also
improve from 13. in 1998 to 2.5 in 1999.

Current Issues and Actions
4.12  In addition to the issues being addressed under the FRP described above, other
issues impacting on the financial performnance of the companies are: (i) tariff structure
and level; and (ii) commercial management of ECG operations.
4.13 Tariffs. With respect to taiffs, ECG is incurring losses on sales: (i) to
residential customers consuming below 300 KWh per month, which represents about
64 % of total residential consumption; (ii) of power purchases from emergency power
plants. In addition VRA's current bulk supply tariff does not include the cost of
power supplies form EPPs and this will negatively impact VRA when it starts to
receive this power in the coming year. These issues need to be reviewed by MoME
and the companies and taken up with PURC.
4.14 Commercial Operations. A three year management contract to assist ECG
with improving its commercial operations came to an end in April 1997. The mission
mission was informed that a completion report has been prepared and is currently
being discussed by ECG, CFD (financiers and the management contractor group).
According to the completion report, the following achievements have been made:
i.    overall losses in the ECG system have been reduced by about 3% from
estimates of 25% at the start of the contract4;
ii.   debt sales ratio for non sensitive customers has improved from about 198 days
to about 109 days at the end of 1997;
iii.   about 43,000 illegal connections were eliminated; and
iv.   billing systems have been decentralized and customer management procedures
have been firmly established in the Customer Service Department.
4.15  Despite the above, the mission noted that: (i) about 60, 000 premises are either
unmetered or have fault meters; (ii) estimated illegal connections remain high at more
than 40,000; and (iii) customer receivables remain at substantially high levels (about
90 days as of August 31, 1998). The arrears from consumers are particularly high
for domestic and commercial consumers who account for about 65 % of the
consumption and 61 % of the revenues. The mission urged ECG to adopt a more
commercial approach to revenue collection including adopting a consistent approach
for disconnecting delinquent customers. The metering issues will be addressed as part
of the FRP as described above.
West African Gas Pipeline Project (WAGPP)
5.01  The mission met with the Minister of Mines and Energy and officials of the
Ministry to discuss progress on the project and were also provided an update on the
status.
4The baseline loss estimates were not clearly established because of metering problems



14
5.02  The mission was informed of the formation of a Project Implementation
Committee (PIC) made up of a representative each from the Nigeria, Benin, Togo and
Ghana. Acting on behalf of the Steering Committee of Ministers, the PIC will serve as
the point of contact on matters conceming the formulation and negotiation of a Build-
Own-Operate (BOO) concession agreement with the sponsors of the project. A
framework for project development has been agreed between the sponsor countries, a
copy of which was provided to the mission.
5.03 As part of their work program, the PIC has initiated the process to engage
experts to provide "just in time" advice, and among other tasks; (i) review the
feasibility study on the proposed gas pipeline ind advise on the tenns under which the
BOO project would be commercially viable; and (ii) review the existing regulatory
framework and recommend exemptions, waivers, new legislation, etc. to ensure a
successful financing and execution of the proposed project
5.04 The mission was provided a draft Terms of Reference and a shortlist for the
proposed assignment for its review and comments and IDA's non-objection to launch
the process of engaging these experts. The cost of the assignment would be financed
under the existing 3 PHRD grants and the PIC will propose to IDA a payment
structure that would indicate an agreed cost sharing scheme between Ghana, Togo and
Benin.
5.06 The mission noted that the PIC will keep IDA timely informed of progress on
implementation of the project.
Next World Bank Mission
6.01  The next mission is proposed for early December. The mission's objectives
would be to (i) attend meetings of the PIC for the West Africa Gas Pipeline on the
interim feasibility study report; and (ii) discuss policy issues on strengthening the
competitive environment for the power market and further deregulation of the
petroleum subsector. A further mission by February 15, 1999 to discuss the
completion report for the Sixth Power Project and to supervise the NEP and the
Thermal Power Projects.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GHANA
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
CREDIT 2109-GH
Implementation Experience and Results
Please update the different results for the retrofit of the hydro unit
in generation from those of NEP.
The performance of the retrofitted for has improved by about 3%
points, which significantly exceeded the minimum, expected
increases in performance. Therefore the project was worthwhile.
As a result of the National Electrification Project (NEP), a number
of communities have been added to the network expanding the
coverage locations of NED.
Para. 9
Mention Bui as the hydro site with the least cost option
Paras. 11 and 12
The Akosombo Power Plant retrofit could have been more
optimally implemented if replacement of runners had been
included in the retrofit. However, the replacement decision was
not included in the retrofit due to the unfortunate conclusion that
the existing runners could nearly achieve the maximum possible
increase in efficiency, if retrofitted. Subsequently, tests on Unit 4
(the first unit to be retrofitted), both before and after retrofitting,
indicated efficiency levels several percentage points lower than
what all previous tests had indicated. The Turbine Runner
Replacement Study (TRRS) in 1993-1994 proved beyond any
doubt that new replacement runners would yield excellent
economic returns, in spite of delayed implementation and
increased costs.
Nevertheless, the performance of the retrofitted Unit 4 has
improved by about 3% points, which significantly exceeded the
minimum, expected increases in performance. Therefore the
retrofit project was worthwhile.

4.0   VRA Training and Development Center
This project involves amonst others, the construcdon of an up to date ttining
complex, where tchcaL administrative and manageal traig can take
place. This is exected to improve VRA's overall perfomance by way of
manpower and human resource development
The centre as presently conceived has three (3) main components viz.:
-   Training facilities comprising classrooms, workshops, laboratories,
semia halls and a library
-   Administrative component involving offices and training material
production rooms
-   Residential and common facilities component consistig of hostels,
laundry, dining/kitchen facilities and a leisure hall.
The cstimated cost of the project s     at twenty-five (25) billion Cedis.
Fuiding for the works is being sought VRA is however hmding the cost of
the pr-conmc consultancy services.
Local Consults engaged on the project are providing pro-contract
consultancy services. Review of designs and tender documents recved from
these Consultants are in progress. The review is expected to be completed by
August 1999.
While VRA is seekng fimding for the onstrutonal work, aragements ar
underway to construct a Traine Hostel and rehabilitate the existing Training
SchooL Designs arm almost cowmplete ft thi work and construction is
expected to be cmpleted by the end of 1999.
W'ith the estabsbhment of the new training facilities, it is expected that staff
training needs will be adequately met and a high level of perfiomance
achieved in all sectors of the Autofity.
5.0   Studies
5.1   Generation and Tansznission Master Plan Study
Since the last comprehensive power system development plan was prepared in
1985, considerable changes in the domestic load gowth have occurred in the
power sector. These changes necessitated a study involving the development
of a least cost generation and transmission expansion plan for the twety year
period between 1995 - 2015 that will ensure tt the expected domestic load
demand and fium supply contacts are reliable and economically served. This
plan amongst othen includes a ranldng and timing of additional generation to
meet the loadI

Pmposals were requested in 199 and evaluated. The evaluation report was
subsequnly submitted to the Ministry of Mines and Energy for approvaL
However, a decision on Contnot award was not made.
£2   Tarff Study
This project which was undmrtaken by Acres Intemational of Canada on behalf
of VRAwas completed in 1992.
Following the setting up of the Public Utilities Regulaory Commission
(PURC) in 1997, VRA undeook an in-house Tariff Study in 1998 to scen as
an input in PtJRCs Guidelines for Rates Chargeable for Blectricity Sevices.
5.3   White Volta Prefeasibility S*vdy
In a bid to find new sourees of power generation in the northern part of the
comntry, VRA contracd Coyne Et Bellier of Fnce to investigate the
posible development of hydro-electric resources from the White Volta The
studies, which were completed in 1993, gapv a preliminary assessment of the
technical and economic feasibility of each of the thrce possible hydra sites
idendfied on the White Volta. These are Pawlugu, Kulpawn ad Daboys Of
the tr  sites, Kulpawn was detennined to be uneconomical. Pawlugu and
Daboys are therefore potential hydro sites being considered in the tanking of
hydro options under the Ghana Power Sector Master Plan Study.
The study was financed by AD.
5.4   Bu Hydroelectrc ProJect Update
The Bui Gorge, located on the Black Volta was identified as early as in the
1920's as a potential site for a major d  and hydroelectric project and has
since been the subject of a series of ctudies.
The site was sudied in detail by J.S. Zhuk Hydroprojeckt of the formnr USSR
and subsequently, a feasioility study was peformed by Snowy Mountains
Engineeing Corporation (SMC) of Australia in 1976. In 1994, the SMEC
feasibility asttdy was updated by Coyne Et Bellier (C&B) of Prance.
Based on the recent update of the foasibility studies, the project has bee re-
designed as a roller compacted cqirete (RCC) dam of a height of 1 10m with
a total volume of 1,000,000 m3. There will also be two (2) saddle dams wit a
tntal volulme of about 600,000 m3. The total installed capacity is 4OOMW
(3x133MW Francis otbine units) with a rated discharge of 600 MI/s.
The economic Rate of Retun of the project as esimated by C&B is 12.4%
while the ecoomic cost of energy generation at Bui H?.P., calculated for the
discount rate of 10%, is US$ 0.06(KWIL The unit cost of installed cacity is
US$ 1,090/KW.
The Bui project is expected to increase yearly generation capacity of the VRA
system by approximately 1,00OGWh.
The total implementation cost of the project, including interest during
constrcon and price contingency, is estimated at US$ 660 million.

A total dumtion of four (4) years is estimated for construcon. Prepatory
works involving the Environmental Impact Aessoment, Geological Surveys
and Studies and Topographical Studies are expected to take 18 months to
complete. The expected commissioning time iS year 2005.
In order to achieve the target commissioning fime, the preparatory works for
the project arc to be caried out This is expected to cost US$16.5 milion.
With the assistance oft.f World Bank, a Consulta was engaged by VRA to
prepare te Tems of Reference for the prea tory woks and final desis for
the Bui project.
Proposals for the development of t hydro project we subsequently
requested from potential private developers. The proposls have been
received and are being reviewed.
