                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To mitigate the impact of the continued socio-economic crisis on a subset of the poorest and most vulnerable households. An additional objective would be to
                         strengthen the institutional capacity of MOSA to manage cash transfer programs. The primary objective would be achieved by implementing a pilot incentive-
                         based cash transfer mechanism with improved targeting modalities that would contribute to improving the living conditions of the beneficiaries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to be satisfactory. The Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA) has increased the number of beneficiary households in West Bank and Gaza. MOSA
                         fulfilled its commitment to re-certify 31,000 households in Gaza using the updated proxy means-test formula (based on Palestinian Household Expenditure and Consumption Survey/
                         Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics 2007 data) on September 22, 2011 well in advance of the required date for completion of December 31, 2011. The actual number of
                         households currently receiving payments is about 5,000 households in West Bank and Gaza (WBG).

                         The second additional financing in response to the Global Food Price Crisis grant (GFRP) has been fully disbursed and closed on April 30, 2011. A total of $3.4 million was
                         disbursed to about 25,000 poor households negatively affected by the food and fuel crisis. The grant was implemented satisfactorily and in a timely manner. The final audit report
                         was satisfactory overall. It verified the soundness of the payment process and ascertained households eligibility to receive cash benefits under the GFRP grant.

                         The MOSA is committed to strengthening its outreach to ensure certification of the remaining extremely poor households in WBG.

                         The Bank and MOSA are cooperating to evaluate the CTP targeting system and the database functionality. The Bank continues to be concerned about the sustainability of the CTP
                         and the financial implications for the CTP on the PA budget in the short- and long-term.
