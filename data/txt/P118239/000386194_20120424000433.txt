        Implementation Completion and Results Report for the Emergency Development
                            Operation to the Republic of Haiti

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      Haiti not only remains the poorest country in the Americas and one of the poorest in the
World with a GDP per capita of US$661 as of 20101 but it is also one of the most unequal, with
a Gini coefficient of 0.59. Over half of its population of 10 million lives on less than US$1 per
day, and 78 percent live on less than US$2 per day. The country lags in social indicators, ranking
148 out of 172 in the 2010 Human Development Index and has suffered from repeated
exogenous and political shocks that have threatened the survival of households. In 2008, rising
food and fuel prices led to riots and the fall of the Government. Tropical storms and hurricanes
that year caused losses estimated at $900 million (15% of GDP). Despite this, Haiti’s economy
saw modest but stable growth in the 2000s, with an average real growth of 2.2 % p.a. 2004-2009.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.      On January 12, 2010, a magnitude earthquake hit Haiti causing widespread damage
and massive loss of life. The earthquake caused unprecedented destruction of human and
physical capital, with damages and losses estimated at 120 percent of 2009 GDP. The estimated
death toll was 225.000 persons while 300.000 were injured or permanently disabled. 2 Most
ministries, hospitals, and schools were destroyed or damaged, including the National Palace, the
Supreme Court, the Law Courts, the Parliament and police facilities. Other affected key public
entities included the Tax and Customs Administrations, the National Statistical Institute, the
National Procurement Commission, the Court of Accounts (CSC/CA), and the Road
Maintenance Fund (FER). The disruption of major economic, financial and governance activities
and functions caused a critical slow down for the country following sustained progress in
macroeconomic stability and public sector governance in the five years preceding the earthquake.

3.      The January 2010 earthquake was a major setback for Haiti but macroeconomic
indicators have been more positive than expected over the post earthquake period. The
earthquake-triggered economic decline was less pronounced than anticipated owing to a stable
agricultural output, resilient manufacturing industries, and reconstruction activities. In 2010 real
GDP growth declined by 5.4 percent, while annual inflation remained in the single digit level
closing the year with 4.7 percent inflation. The fiscal deficit for FY 2010 was lower than the
previous year reflecting higher domestic revenues (11.9 percent of GDP compared to 11.2 of
2009), while current expenditures (11.6% of GDP) were kept broadly at the same level of 2009.
However, the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) at 15.7 % of GDP in 2010 was much higher than in
2009. The external current account deficit was 2.6 percent of GDP, almost 1 percent lower than
2009. Finally, debt relief, including IADB, IMF, World Bank, and Venezuela following the
earthquake, significantly helped lower the country’s external indebtedness.

4.       Haiti had an IMF program since 2006, which was on track at DPG appraisal. The
sixth and final review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) covering the period (November
2006-May 2010) was completed immediately after the earthquake (January 27, 2010) and in late
May 2010, an IMF mission reached agreement with the Haitian authorities on a new three-year
ECF-supported program. The new ECF arrangement supported macroeconomic policies aimed at
facilitating the absorption of aid inflows and raising medium-term growth, in line with the
authorities’ objectives. At end-December 2010 most indicative targets were met, with the
exception of the poverty-related spending, reflecting a slower than- expected policy response in
the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.

5.      Haiti faced extraordinary reconstruction needs and its government benefited from
strong support of development partners. The March 2010 Post-Disaster Needs Assessment
(PDNA), which included consultations with Parliament, civil society, the Haitian Diaspora, the
private sector and the population, set damages and losses at US$7.8 billion and reconstruction
needs at almost US$11.5 billion, of which $3.2 billion (about 120 percent of GDP) were needed
in the first 18 months – the highest cost of a disaster relative to the affected country’s economy
in the last 35 years. The most affected sectors were housing, followed by commerce, private
education, industry, food and transport. Following the PDNA the government developed an
Action Plan for the Reconstruction and the Development of Haiti, which was presented to
international donors at the UN in New York in March 2010. In support, donors pledged nearly
US$10 billion, of which US$5 billion were pledged for the period 2010-2011.

6.      On April 15, 2010, the Senate approved an 18-month extension of the state of
emergency that the President of Haiti decreed after the January earthquake. The law
significantly expanded the powers of the Executive branch to implement the reconstruction plan,
authorizing the President to approve contracts without bids, to requisition private land and build
camps for people displaced by the earthquake, and to evacuate the displaced from their camps in
case of emergency. In order to ensure efficiency and coordination of reconstruction funds, the
government created, under the Emergency State Law of April 2010, new institutional
arrangements consisting of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission and the Haiti Reconstruction
Fund (HRF), for which the Bank was appointed fiscal agent. A Steering Committee made of
government officials at the ministerial level and representatives of various stakeholders would
ensure that projects approved for HRF are in line with the Government Action Plan (See Box 1)

7.       The earthquake had created political uncertainty and increased the risk of political
instability. Progress had been made in the functioning of democracy before the earthquake,
including the political process towards legislative, presidential and municipal elections scheduled
to be held in 2010. Elections for twelve of the thirty Senate seats took place in April 2009, with a
run-off in June 2009 that favored Lespwa (President René Préval’s party), strengthening its
Senate presence. In late November 2009, the legislative election was moved to November 2010
together with the presidential ballot. The Parliament modified the 2008 electoral law so that
President Préval would remain in office until May 14, 2011. This situation fueled political
instability and civil unrest as a series of protests had taken place in Port-au-Prince and other
cities in opposition to such decision. Officially, his five-year term ended on February 2011.

8.     Security had deteriorated in the months following the earthquake. Although volatile,
the security environment had improved significantly prior to the earthquake. With the help of the
                                                 2
UN Peacekeeping mission (MINUSTAH), the Haitian Police regained control of the two most
dangerous slums in Port-au-Prince (Cite Soleil and Martisant) following the dismantling of gangs.
Public demonstrations related mainly to poor living conditions, were peaceful and small.
However, following the earthquake former gang leaders escaped from prison, posing a threat to
security. The number of kidnappings increased and the National Police was substantially
weakened and had not been able to respond appropriately due to limited law-enforcement
capability.

9.      The earthquake further deepened Haiti’s existing development challenges. The
disaster severely diminished already weak government capacity, threatened emerging progress in
economic governance, endangered limited government service delivery and low domestic
investment in infrastructure and human capital. The disaster had also threatened longstanding
efforts to increase access to services for the most vulnerable, a critical developmental objective
under the National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction (DSNCRP) as well as Haiti’s
already weak prospects of reaching the MDGs. However, the exceptionally large reconstruction
financing promised by donors opened a new chapter in Haiti’s development dialogue and
sharpened the focus of government, stakeholders, and development partners on improving the
quality, sustainability, and results of reconstruction and development policies.

                       Box 1: Haiti’s Reconstruction and Development Architecture
  The government of Haiti has established a structure to oversee and coordinate reconstruction efforts.

  Reconstruction is directed by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which was created in April
  2010 to implement the Government’s Action Plan during the 18-month state of emergency. The commission was
  initially co-chaired by former U.S. President Bill Clinton (the U.N. special envoy for Haiti) and by Haitian Prime
  Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. The President of Haiti retains veto power. The Commission’s decisions would be
  guided by a 20-member board comprised of government, private sector, civil society and the donor community.
  Over the 18 months of the emergency the IHRC will identify priorities and projects that best support the
  objectives of the Government’s Action Plan. At the end of the emergency period, the Commission is expected to
  become the Haitian Development Authority (HDA), a more permanent development entity that would plan,
  sequence and coordinate projects over 10 or more years (See note)

  The Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF) is a multilateral financing mechanism in which donors pool their
  resources to finance reconstruction projects and programs as well as provide budget support to the Government
  in a coordinated manner. The HRF has been established at the World Bank as a Financial Intermediary Fund
  (FIF). The World Bank would serve as a trustee for the FIF. The HRF was expected to channel as much as
  possible of the aid pledged by the international community for reconstruction over the next two years following
  the earthquake. The HRF finance investment to support reconstruction and development in accordance with the
  Government’s Action Plan. Projects will be supervised by partner entities such as the Inter-American
  Development Bank, UN agencies and the World Bank. Governance of the HRF is led by a high-level Steering
  Committee chaired by a ministerial-level government representative and comprising representatives from key
  donors, partner entities and the trustee, which are responsible for approving all allocations of trust fund
  monies for projects and programs consistent with the Government’s Action Plan..

Note: The IHRC mandate expired in October 2011. The GoH has expressed interest in seeking the
renewal of the IHRC for another year while working to create the Haitian Development Agency. Due to
political stalemate, the draft bill has not been submitted to Parliament yet. Since the IHRC’s mandate
expired, the Ministry of Planning has been working on a more permanent alternative coordination forum
chaired by the Prime Minister and assisted by the Minister of Planning and the Minister of Finance. Civil
society organizations, local authorities and members of the international community also participate in the

                                                         3
process. The forum, called “the Coordination Council on External Assistance? is to guide and coordinate
external assistance in support of the planning system, programming, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation of national development.

1.2    Context during implementation

10.     Macroeconomic policies have been sound resulting in solid and improving macro
indicators. IMF ECF second and third reviews have been satisfactory. In 2011 growth
reached an estimated 5.6 percent despite the cholera outbreak, political turmoil and a
disappointing agricultural output due to adverse climatic conditions. Growth was driven by
construction, manufacturing, and services which picked up significantly. The exchange rate has
been stable despite significant capital inflows. The current account deficit has slightly widened
as a result of a fall in official transfers but international reserves have remained high (equivalent
of 5.3 months of imports) due to a better trade balance and a sustained high level of remittances.
Inflation reached 10.4% (end of period) in FY11 compared to 4.7 in FY10, mainly driven by
international commodity prices, despite the fact that prudent monetary policy and a flexible
exchange rate policy has helped lower the impact of exogenous shocks on inflation. The current
pressure on consumer prices is projected to gradually fade away in 2012 and 2013 with end-of-
period inflation expected to cool down to 8.0 percent 2012 and 4.9 percent in 2013 (Table 1).

11.      The fiscal balance has been under control due to increasing revenues and efficient
fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP recorded in FY2011 was less than
initially projected due to higher than expected domestic revenues and a reasonable management
of current expenditures. Domestic revenues in 2011 were the highest Haiti has ever achieved
(13.1% of GDP) thanks to stronger tax administration and improved tax policy. The economic
recovery also contributed to expanding the tax base. Current expenditures increased slightly
compared with the FY10 performance, by 0.5% of GDP, thanks to a well-managed fiscal
consolidation, reflecting the Government’s efforts aimed at limiting the wage bill and non-
priority spending in a context of uncertain budget support disbursements. Overall capital
expenditures increased significantly to support the reconstruction effort (from 10.8% of GDP in
FY09 to 21.7% of GDP in FY11). However, the current provision of public goods still remains
insufficient to support growth and poverty reduction.

12.     During FY2011 the current account deficit widened as a consequence of a fall in
official transfers received. The trade balance recorded a smaller deficit thanks to a very
dynamic export sector stimulated by the HELP initiative. Although exports are a relatively small
part of the external financing picture, the expansion of US trade access in textiles has opened the
door for rapid export growth over the medium term. The sharp increase in imports recorded since
the earthquake has been matched by inflows of official transfers, and to a lesser extent by exports,
however in FY2011 imports grew at a slower pace due to limited public capital expenditures.
Official grants, while at historically high levels, were inferior to 2010. Thanks to significant
bilateral and multilateral debt relief initiatives, Haiti’s debt burden has considerably shrunk in the
aftermath of the earthquake. However, rapid debt build-up is expected over the medium term. As
a result, Haiti's risk of debt distress is still assessed as high. The debt dynamics remain sensitive
to external shocks pointing to the need for highly concessional borrowing, but also aggressive
diversification of exports.

1.3 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

13.     The Emergency Development Policy Grant (DPG) for the Republic of Haiti, was
approved by the Bank on August 5, 2010. This is the Bank’s fourth DPG supporting the Republic
of Haiti, after its successful reengagement with the donor community in 2005. The grant is a
single-tranche operation supporting the FY2009-10 budget, with an additional co-financing of
US$25 million by the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF), of which the Bank is the partner agency.
Both operations supported maintaining sound economic governance in the post-earthquake
period and strengthening the reforms started before the earthquake.

The Program Development Objectives were the following:

14.    The operation supported policies in three areas deemed critical at strengthening checks
and balance mechanisms in view of the negative impact of the earthquake on governance and
oversight institutions; and important at supporting the consolidation of gains achieved in public
finance management and public sector governance over the few years preceding it. .

        The component on transparency in budget transfers supported the government’s capacity
         to manage public resources efficiently and transparently. More specifically, the operation
         had the objective of increasing transparency and monitoring of financial transfers to the
         electricity sector;

        The public finance management component supported the re-establishment of budget
         controls and of external and internal audit processes;

        The public sector governance component was intended to enforce anti-corruption laws
         and reinforce public procurement aimed at (i) improving transparency in public affairs
         through the enforcement of the Law on Declaration of Assets; and (ii) reinforcing public
         procurement regulation and enhancing transparency in procurement practices


The Key Outcome Indicators expected to be achieved by September 2011, are as follows:

   I.       Transparency in Transfer Management

(i) All invoice payments by the Ministry of Finance (MEF) to the Independent Power Providers
(IPP) follow the rules described in the joint-memorandum signed by the MEF and the Ministry
of Public Works (MTPTC).

(ii) Data on payments to IPPs published on the Ministry of Finance’s website and actual
payments are reconciled by the MTPTC and the MEF.

   II.      Public Finance Management: Budget Control

(iii) Improved compliance of external audits and the Budget review Law submission within the
statutory timeframe: (a) the MEF submits to the Court of Accounts the 2009-10 government

                                                 6
accounts no more than 8 months after the end of the FY2010; and (b) the Court of Accounts
communicates to the MEF the results of audits of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 government accounts
by September 30, 2011.

(iv) All IGF activities comply with the plan of action adopted by the Ministry of Finance (MEF)
(2010-14); and the following reports will be given to competent and concerned authorities: (a) an
inventory of government and NGOs’ projects; (b) the audits of subsidies in the education sector
and the transfers by the MEF; (c) the analysis of audit reports issued by the Court of Accounts;
and (d) the audits of public accountants’ activities in the MEF.

   III.    Public Sector Governance: Anti-Corruption and Public Procurement

(v) The anti-corruption unit (ULCC) sends a report to the Court of Accounts showing that
compliance rate with the Declaration of Assets Law of the members of the government increased
from 87 percent (as of May 2010) to 100 percent.

(vi) The share of non-competitive procurement in total procurement decreases from 56 percent
(as of 2008) to 45 percent. This indicator is measured by the value of contracts awarded without
competition as a percentage of all contracts that do not fall under the accelerated procedures
invoked by the State of Emergency Law.

(vii) The Prime Minister has given prior authorization to all contracts awarded by under     the
Emergency Law’s accelerated procedures.

Reasons/Justification

N/A

1.5 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

15.     The DPG supported policies and reforms for strengthening the legal and regulatory
framework to improve accountability and transparency in the context of the Haiti’s
reconstruction. The overall goal of the program was to help the country strengthen checks and
balance mechanisms in view of the negative impact of the earthquake on governance and
oversight institutions while consolidating the gains achieved in governance over the few years
preceding the earthquake. The operation supported the government’s Action Plan, which outlines
the priorities for Haiti’s reconstruction. The objective of the program was to support key policy
actions under three components: (i) transparency in the management of the transfers; (ii) public
finance management, in particular budget control and audits; and (iii) public sector governance
understood as anti-corruption and procurement.

Component 1: Transparency in the Management of Transfers

16.   This component of the operation supported the government efforts to enhance
transparency and monitoring of financial transfers in the electricity sector. In 2009, the

                                               7
government designed policy reforms to improve EDH management and reduce fiscal
inefficiencies through a two-pronged effort: (i) improving the financial situation of the utility;
and (ii) strengthening institutional capacity in the sector. Unfortunately, the earthquake damaged
previous efforts to address weak billing, increase revenue collection, and improve delivery,
further aggravating the EDH operating capacity and its financial situation4. Unable to generate
revenues, EDH has relied on fiscal transfers from the Treasury, amounting to US$100 million on
average annually over the past years. As a result of the earthquake due to a drop in the number of
customers in Port-au-Prince and the difficulty for EDH to deploy teams in the capital to bill for
electricity, revenues were approximately 30 percent of their December 2009 level. Therefore
transfers were expected to increase, contrary to previous forecasts, thereby putting further strain
on the budget. Given the impact of the earthquake on the electricity sector, the FY09-10 amount
of transfers already increased from a budgeted amount of US$50 million to an adjusted amount
of US$72.6 million. For FY10-11, it was projected to reach $110 million (approximately 76% of
the budget support) but has actually reached $190 million (30% in excess of total budget
support).

17.    The management of transfers to the electricity sector lacked transparency and
required rapid corrective action in view of the projected amounts. The specific prior actions
supported by this component of the operation include:

       The strengthening of the monitoring of payments to the electricity sector, evidenced by
        the issue of a joint memorandum from the MEF and the MTPTC (under whose authority
        EDH operates) describing: (i) the procedures to be followed by the MEF and EDH for
        payments of IPPs pursuant to the IPPs’ respective contracts currently under
        implementation; and (ii) MEF and EDH’s respective obligations in this procedure.

       The publication on the MEF’s website of the monitoring table – consolidated by MTPTC
        – for the period October 2009 through March 2010. The table includes monthly data on:
        (i) payments made by the State to each IPP, as well as transfers to cover EDH fuel costs,
        (ii) payments made by EDH to each IPP, (iii) energy produced by each IPP, and (iv) the
        amounts billed by each IPP during the period.

18.     By the end of the operation, the identified policy reforms were expected to
contribute to lasting enhanced transparency and monitoring in the management of the
transfers to the electricity sector. In particular, it was expected that: (i) all invoice payments by
the Ministry of Finance (MEF) to the Independent Power Providers (IPP) would have followed
the rules described in the joint-memorandum signed by the MEF and the Ministry of Public
Works and reconciled by both entities; and (ii) data on payments to IPPs would have been
published on the Ministry of Finance’s website.

  Electricity supply by the National Electricity Company (EDH) has been largely insufficient relative to
demand. Overall, less than 20 percent of the Haitian population and only a few areas had access to
electricity before the earthquake.
                                                    8
Component 2: Public Finance Management: Budget Controls

19.     This component of the DPG was aimed at reinstating budget controls and external
and internal audit processes. Over recent years, the government had achieved significant
progress in budget control, including the completion of the audits of the FY2003-2007
government accounts and submission of the corresponding Budget Review Laws to Parliament.
Meanwhile, the progress made in external control since 2006 was slowed by the impact of the
earthquake on the CSC/CA following the destruction of its offices. In conjunction with the DPG,
the Bank had planned support to the Court of Accounts to complete the submission of the audit
reports to the MEF and Parliament 5 . With respect to internal audit, in 2006, the IGF was
established as a decentralized entity of the MEF to be responsible for the internal audit function
of the public sector. Although the functioning of this internal audit body was not significantly
disrupted by the earthquake, it had to revise its action plan and work program in order to adjust
to the impact of the earthquake on government institutions and the corresponding challenges.

20.     The prior actions in this component represented critical steps for ensuring timely
production of Government accounts and their submission for external audits as well as re-
establishing internal control procedures in Haiti’s. They include:

       The CSC/CA has communicated to MEF the results of the external audit of the
        government accounts (October 2007 to September 2008);

       The MEF has submitted the 2008-09 central government accounts to the Supreme Audit
        Institution (CSC/CA); and

       The Ministry of Finance has adopted a revised action plan for 2010-2014 and a manual of
        internal control procedure for use by inspectors of IGF.

21.     By the end of this operation, it was expected that: the compliance of external audits
and Budget Review Law submission with the statutory timeframe would have been improved. In
particular, it was expected that (i) the 2009-10 government accounts would be submitted by the
MEF to the Court of Accounts, no more than eight months after the end of the FY2010; and (ii)
the results of the audits of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 government accounts would be
communicated by the Court of Accounts to the MEF by September 30, 2011. With regard to
internal audits, it was expected that IGF would have complied with the audit action plan
endorsed by the Ministry of Finance (2010-14), and audit reports would be disseminated to the
beneficiaries and competent authorities. The audit reports should include at least: (i) the
inventory of government and NGOs’ projects; (ii) audits of subsidies in the education sector and
the transfers by the MEF; (iii) analysis of audit reports issued by the Court of Accounts; and (iv)
audits of public accountants activities in the MEF.

  The Haitian government’s system of public expenditure controls, include administrative, jurisdictional,
and parliamentary oversight which falls under the sphere of the General Finance Inspectorate (IGF); the
Superior Court of Audits and Administrative Disputes or the Court of (CSC/CA); and the Parliament,
respectively

                                                   9
Component 3: Public Sector Governance: Anti-corruption and Public Procurement

22.     This component supported measures to: (i) advance transparency in public affairs through
strengthening the monitoring mechanisms of the declaration of assets; and (ii) reinforce
procurement regulation and transparency in procurement practices. The empirical evidence had
shown that during emergency and reconstruction processes, opportunities for corrupt practices
increase, especially in fragile environments, which requires the strengthening of measures to
fight corruption. In the case of Haiti, the oversight capacity of governance institutions including
the control and audit bodies and procurement regulations have been weakened, leaving the state
with limited capacity even though the country is equipped with multiple instruments to fight
corruption. In general, the effective implementation of anti-corruption measures has been slow
and difficult. The poor enforcement of the Declaration of Assets Law is particularly striking,
despite the fact that the Government has highlighted the need to ensure the effectiveness of this
law in its governance program presented in New York in March 2010.

23.      The earthquake caused significant damage to the procurement system. Following
the adoption of a Procurement Law in 2009 and subsequently the enactment of the first key
implementing decrees, it was expected that progress would continue at an accelerated pace as the
procurement regulatory body, the Commission Nationale de Marches Publics (CNMP) 6 , was
finalizing the rest of the implementing decrees and preparing their dissemination. However, as a
result of the earthquake, the office of the procurement regulatory body was destroyed and the
procurement units in line ministries were weakened. The equipment and data were damaged
following the collapse of ministries and other public buildings, and the procurement system had
been barely effective. Therefore, reinforcing procurement regulation and strengthening the
CNMP’s capacity was a priority for the country. During the preparation of the DPG, the CNMP
already had new offices and Bank technical assistance projects had been providing support to
make the CNMP operational through: (i) provision of equipment and furniture; and (ii) capacity
building support.

24.    Consistent with these objectives, the DPG prior actions under this component
included actions to:

(i)    Advance transparency in Public Affairs through enhanced enforcement of the
Declaration of Asset Law such as:

       The Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC) has submitted a progress report on the Asset
        Declaration Compliance, including specific recommendations for action, to the MEF, the
        Senate, and the Court of Accounts.




6
 The roles of the Commission National des Marchés Publics (CNMP) are, inter alia, to introduce
effective procurement control, strengthen capacity within line ministries, develop procurement
policy, draft procurement legislation, and standardize procurement procedures


                                                10
(ii)   Reinforce public procurement regulation and enhance transparency in procurement
practices through the following:

      The CNMP has restored its website containing information on procurement bids and
       contracts awarded;
      The recruitment of the new members of the CNMP has been advertized in local
       newspapers; and,
      The government has issued an instruction to Ministries and other public contracting
       authorities to clarify that the use of accelerated procurement procedures under the State
       of Emergency Law must receive prior authorization from the Prime Minister.


25.    By the end of the operation, it was expected that: (i) the anti-corruption unit (ULCC)
would have sent a report to the Court of Accounts showing that the compliance rate with the
Declaration of Assets Law of all the senior members of the Executive Branch has increased from
87 percent (as of May 2010) to 100 percent by September 2011; (ii) the Prime Minister would
have given prior authorization to all contracts awarded by invoking the Emergency Law’s
accelerated procedures; and (iii) compliance with the procurement code would have been
improved, as evidenced by a decrease in the share of non-competitive procurement in total
procurement, from 56 percent (as of 2008) to 45 percent by September 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Program Performance

26.     The grant was approved on August 5, 2010 and the additional financing of US$25 million
by the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF) was approved on August 10, 2010. Both operations
became effective on August 23, 2010. The operation builds on the economic governance reforms
started before the earthquake and is in line with the Government’s Action Plan and the short-
term governance program presented to the international community in March 2010. The
Government committed itself to take substantial actions prior to the approval of the operation,
which in fact complied as indicated in Table 2 below.

                            Prior Actions
To enhance transparency and monitoring of financial transfers in the              Completed
electricity sector:

1. The government strengthened the monitoring of payments to the
   electricity sector, as evidenced by the issue of a joint memorandum from
   the MEF and the MTPTC (under whose authority EDH is) describing:

        the procedures to be followed by MEF and EDH for payments of
         IPPs pursuant to the IPPs’ respective contracts under
         implementation
         MEF and EDH’s respective obligations in this procedure

2. The MEF has published on its website the monitoring mechanism table –
   consolidated by MTPTC – for the period from October 2009 through
   March 2010. At a minimum, the table includes updated monthly data on:

        payments made by the State to each IPP, as well as transfers to
         cover EDH fuel costs;
        payments made by EDH to each IPP;
        energy produced by each IPP;
        The amounts billed by each IPP during the period.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

27.     The political situation in Haiti following the tumultuous presidential election in
November 2009 proved to be a significant factor affecting the operation implementation.
The Presidential and Legislative Elections launched in November 2010 ended in May 2011 with
the installation of Michel Joseph Martelly as President. However, it was not before October 2011
that a new Government took office. Between November 2010 and October 2011, government
activities had been slowed down significantly. In addition, the Head of the project unit
implementation of the Bank Infrastructure and Institutions Recovery Emergency Project died in
the second semester of 2010, and his replacement took time. This project was designed to
provide much needed technical assistance activities to support key reforms under the Emergency
DPO, such as the collection of procurement data and the production of the audits of government
accounts by the Court of Accounts. The compound effect of these two factors has impacted
negatively on these two components.

2.3    Analytical Underpinnings

28.     The operation under review drew on a wide range of analytical work carried out by
the government and the Bank in recent years. Most notably, the overall design of the
operation was based on the government’s DSNCRP itself, which was developed through a
participatory process and reviewed in detail in the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) prepared by
the Bank and the Fund in September 2009. It also drew on Technical Notes prepared on key
issues of economic governance which received the financial support of the World Bank under the
First Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grant (EGTAG1) in 2005: (i) debt
management; (ii) anti-corruption; (iii) budget control systems; (iv) procurement; (v) budget
preparation and execution; and (vi) public human resources management. These notes have been
prepared in partnership with the government of Haiti and experts financed by the World Bank
under EGTAG1. They summarize, on each issue, the legal and institutional framework, the main
achievements and weaknesses, and the challenges and opportunities ahead.

29.     The PEMFAR and its follow-up action plan provided the technical basis for the
policy actions that were proposed under the public financial management and procurement
components. The review acknowledged progress made in strengthening fiscal discipline and
improving the efficiency of the public financial management (PFM) and procurement systems
over the period 2005-08. The study identified progress in budget preparation and execution and
in particular the improvements resulting from the implementation of the expenditure information
system SYSDEP. In the area of procurement, the establishment of the CNMP helped to
standardize tender documentation and improve the management of procurement processes. The
report identified as remaining challenges the budget’s limitation in terms of a forward-looking
perspective and poor link with sector policies; the lack of cash-flow planning and the weak
capacity of line ministries; the need to link the different information systems; and the opportunity
to further improve the PFM regulatory framework. Policy recommendations in the area of budget
preparation included further linking budget and policy planning, incorporating extra-budgetary
funds into the budget; and communicating expenditure ceilings to the ministries at the beginning
of the budget preparation process. In the area of budget execution and control, recommendations



                                                13
focused on accelerating recruitment of financial controllers, public accountants, and financial
inspectors, and continuing the process of reducing discretionary accounts.

30. The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) prepared by the Bank in 2006, which
identified poor economic governance as one of the main constraints to growth and poverty
reduction. The CEM highlighted the important advances to increase transparency and efficiency
in the use of public resources and external assistance. These included changes in the legal
framework for budget formulation and execution, the setting up of critical institutions and
agencies, and efforts at disseminating basic information. The report’s recommendations focused
on the need for full implementation of the new legal framework, and the capacity building
necessary to achieve the implementation especially with regards to revenue, expenditure and
human resource management. Gradually, coverage of the framework could then be extended to
offices handling financial management and planning functions in sector ministries. The findings
and recommendations of the CEM with regards to economic governance reform were
subsequently incorporated into the EGRO series and the Emergency DPG.

2.4    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.     Design. As in the first two budget operations, monitoring and evaluation arrangements
relied on the government with the aim of strengthening government capacity and institutions.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) was the agency responsible for coordination and
implementation of the activities and reforms under this operation as set out in the Letter of
Development Policy. Similarly, the MEF was in charge of reporting progress. The review of
goals of the reforms program supported by this operation is largely based on relevant indicators.
In parallel, collaborative monitoring has progressed among donors with the government’s
support in public sector and economic governance, and all governance-related areas including
transparency and the fight against corruption.

32.    The results framework included seven outcome indicators under three policy areas,
expected to be achieved by the end of September 2011. The outcomes were well designed and
measured. However, in one case, the data on procurement from line Ministries were not available
at Operation inception given that the procurement data management systems at the CNMP and
line ministries were damaged following the earthquake that destroyed the main administrative
buildings, therefore the timeframe for the procurement outcomes proved to be too optimistic.

33.     Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation, & Utilization. Bank staff monitored
the outcomes of the program carefully as the operation evolved. The reviews were largely
based on the monitoring indicators and the goals of the program. At the same time, the overall
status of the government’s program was monitored under the review of the joint-matrix of Haiti’s
partners to determine whether country conditions and the specific policy actions of the proposed
operation are met.

34.    The Bank monitored implementation through regular supervision missions as well
as through the presence in the field of a Bank economist and the preparation of progress
reports sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister. The progress reports and
aide-memoires regularly reminded and identified pending reform measures or bottlenecks,

                                               14
expected next steps and institutional responsibilities for follow-up (on both the Government and
Bank sides). A first Bank mission visited Haiti in September 2010, a few weeks after the
operation became effective. The mission reported that progress towards meeting the development
objective was not significant at that moment and that close monitoring and ongoing dialogue
with the client were expected to lead to progress. A second Bank supervision mission visited the
country in January 31- February 4, 2011 and found that overall, limited progress had been made
towards meeting the development objectives. The Bank supervision mission of May 18-27, 2011,
found that overall progress had been made towards achieving the operation's objectives. In
particular, efforts had been made in the areas of procurement and asset declarations for senior
state officials. Public Finance Management reforms were on track and the lagging reforms
included measures to enhance transparency in the management of public transfers in the
electricity sector. On the declaration of assets, the anti-corruption unit (ULCC) certified that all
Ministers and Secretaries of State from the out-going government were in compliance with this
legal requirement. A Bank Economic Mission that visited Haiti in August 2011 also met with
the authorities at MEF to review progress made in the implementation of measures under the
development policy operation prior to its closing at end-September. The mission identified
pending actions and problems needed to be addressed by the authorities and the Bank before the
closing of the operation such as, launching the bid to recruit the firm to provide accounting
support to the EDH to implement the financial model, and issuing the letter from the Prime
Minister’s office certifying that all the contracts under the emergency procedures have received
the PM’s prior approval, both of which were fulfilled by the closing date of the operation. The
last supervision mission that visited Haiti on September 22- 27, 2011 prepared a comprehensive
ISR and provided information on each indicator as detailed in Annex 1 of this report.

2.5 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

35.     The new Government has expressed its interest that the Bank continues to provide budget
support in a context of a DPO. The budget support operation has been included in the Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) for the period FY2012-2013. In fact, the Bank plans on delivering a series of
budget support operations starting in FY11-12 through FY13-14. Looking forward, this
operation will serve as a basis for future DPOs which will also seek to support measures that
favor a better reconstruction and building back.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

36.     The objectives of the DPG program remain as relevant to date as they were when
the operation was prepared. The objectives of the DPG continue to be a priority today. It
supported policy measures in areas deemed critical for continued progress in transparency of
budget transfers, economic governance, public financial management and procurement. The
DPG addresses short-term challenges after the earthquake but also aims to consolidate the gains
achieved under the previous operations still in need of significant reform efforts. Areas that
remain of interest in the current context include enhancing transparency of transfers in the
electricity sector given the need for ensuring adequate monitoring and oversight of public
resources and the increasing production on the part of the private sector, strengthening budget

                                                15
controls and audits, the need for enforcing the dispositions of the procurement Law and the
declaration of asset law. Haiti is highly vulnerable to external shocks. As the structural as well as
the temporary external conditions are problematic and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable
future, Haiti must use its resources more efficiently, including in the public sector, to become
more competitive and enhance economic growth .

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

37.    The Program Document of the Emergency DPG states that this Grant is a single-
tranche operation supporting the FY2009-10 budget, aimed at maintaining sound economic
governance in the post-earthquake period and strengthening the reforms started before the
earthquake. First, the operation supports the implementation of the Government Action Plan for
National Recovery and Development of Haiti presented to the international community in March
2010, aimed at re-building the country. Second, it supports the government’s program for
enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms, especially in view of the massive
pledges made by donors to support the reconstruction process. As stated in the program, the DPG
supported specific reforms expected to help strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks and
systems to enhance accountability and transparency in the context of reconstruction and beyond.
As such, the operation serves as a bridge toward a possible new series of budget support
operations.

38.     Annex 1 of this report details the status of the outcomes as of the closing of the
operation, and also lays out the key next steps taken by the Government, which highlight
the actions the government is implementing as part of its governance program. The key
next steps as described in the policy matrix do not necessarily form the indicative triggers for a
follow-on operation. Presenting the status of key steps helps understand the sequence of reforms
planned by the Government, the rationale for the choice of the prior actions, and its links with
the broad governance objectives in the medium term.

Objective 1: To enhance transparency and monitoring of financial transfers in the
electricity sector.

39.     As part of the effort to enhance transparency in the management of transfers, the
government strengthened the monitoring of payments to the electricity sector by issuing a
joint memorandum from the MEF and the MTPTC (under whose authority EDH operates)
describing the procedures to be followed by MEF and EDH for payments of IPPs pursuant to the
IPPs’ respective contracts under implementation. Meanwhile, as a prior action to the approval of
the operation, the MEF published on its website the monitoring mechanism table – consolidated
by MTPTC – for the period from October 2009 through March 2010 comprising: payments made
by the State to each IPP, as well as transfers to cover EDH fuel costs; payments made by EDH to
each IPP; energy produced by each IPP; and amounts billed by each IPP during the period. As a
follow-on action, all invoice payments by the MEF to the Independent Power Providers (IPP)
had to follow the rules described in the above mentioned joint memorandum.




                                                 16
40.      At the closing of the operation, the government and EDH succeeded in placing
enhanced controls on payments to IPPs, and furthermore, Bank staff noted compliance
with the Memorandum signed between the MEF and MTPTEC, under which monitoring
and analysis of invoices are now made at two levels. First, EDH analyzes the bill to ensure its
compliance with contractual terms and its relevance to meter readings. Then MTPTC proceeds
with a second layer of control before MEF proceeds with payment. It should be noted that the
verification has saved EDH an estimated US$10 million since January 2011. However, Bank
staff also noted that the controls are not systematized and are done on an ad hoc basis due to the
absence of designated units in charge of such controls, and the implementation of the MOUs.

41.     Another component of this objective was the requirement that the MEF had to
publish in its website the actual payments to IPPs, reconciled by the MTPTC and MEF
which was moderately satisfactory. The reform aimed at publishing monthly government
transfers to EDH through September 2011. Although at the time of the final supervision mission,
data for June and July 2011 were compiled at the MTPTC, they had not been published until
January 2012. Lack of systematized data analysis and communication between the three entities
due to the absence of designated responsible units and staff has caused such delay.

42.    Key Next Step. The Bank is providing technical assistance to EDH to strengthen the
transparency of financial flows in the electricity sector. This technical assistance includes a
component on the audit of the data of the monitoring mechanism. The terms of reference of the
technical assistance have been finalized and the bid has been launched.

The Transparency in Transfers Management component is therefore rated as moderately
satisfactory.

Objective 2: To reinstate budget controls and external and internal audit processes.

43.    With respect to public financial management, the government implemented key prior
actions aimed at re-establishing budget controls and auditing processes: (i) the CSC/CA
communicated to MEF the results of the external audit of the government accounts (October
2007 to September 2008); (ii) the MEF submitted the 2008-09 central government accounts to
the Supreme Audit Institution (CSC/CA); and (iii) the MEF adopted a revised action plan for
2010-2014 and a manual of internal control procedures for use by inspectors of IGF.

44.    Progress has been made, and the outcome indicators and its current status are as follows:

       1   Improved compliance of external audits and Budget Review Law submission within
           the statutory timeframe): (i) The MEF submitted to the Court of Accounts the 2009-10
           government accounts no more than 8 months after the end of the FY2010, in May
           2011(Met); (ii) The Court of Accounts communicates to the MEF the results of the
           audits of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 government accounts by September 30, 2011
           (Partially Met). The 2008-09 audit of government accounts were communicated to
           MEF by CSCCA at the beginning of Sept. 2011. With regards to the 2009-2010
           audits of government accounts, the CSCCA launched the verification activities in the
           field and is in the process of finalizing a preliminary audit report.

                                               17
       2   IGF activities comply with its Action Plan. Selected reports include: (i) the inventory
           of government and NGOs’ project (Met). The report was submitted in December
           2011; (ii) audits of subsidies in the education sector and transfers by the MEF (Met).
           Final reports have been distributed in October 2011; (iii) analysis of audit reports
           prepared by the Court of Accounts (Met). The CSCCA’s audit reports have been
           reviewed by IGF for follow-up with relevant entities; and (iv) audits of public
           accountants’ activities in the MEF (Met). Interim reports have been sent to Treasury
           and have been submitted to the directorates of MEF for transmission to the concerned
           entities to collect their comments towards the finalization of reports. The IGF is still
           awaiting feedback from the concerned parties.

45.     Key Next and Ongoing Steps. To sustain efforts aimed at fully restoring public
expenditure management control and effectiveness, the government had implemented activities
including: (i) adopting, and disseminating a procedural manual for the preparation and execution
of the budget. The manual is currently available at the MEF website; and (ii) starting deployment
of inspectors in line ministries to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of internal
audit reports completed by the IGF. To that end IGF expects to establish a plan with timeline
defined for each beneficiary in the finalized audits and a team will ensure follow-up of the
recommendations with the institution concerned.

This public financial management component is rated as moderately satisfactory.

Objective 3: To advance transparency in public affairs through enforcement of the
dispositions of the declaration of asset law.

46.    With respect to public sector governance management, understood as anti-corruption, the
Anti-Corruption unit (ULCC) has submitted a progress report on Asset Declaration Compliance,
to the MEF, the Senate and the Court of Accounts as a prior action towards increasing the
compliance rate with the Declaration of Assets Law of the members of the government
(executive branch), which in May 2010 was 87 and was expected to increase to 100 percent by of
September 30, 2011. ULCC has certified that all members of the government, that is, Ministers
members of the Cabinet have complied with this legal requirement (Met)

47.      Key Next and Ongoing Steps. The government has intensified efforts aimed at
strengthening the implementation of Declaration of Assets Law to fight corruption. First,
continues to send reminders to those who have not yet completed their Asset Declarations, but
this is beyond the scope of this operation as it concerns pubic officials other than the members of
the executive branch. Second, the Code of Ethics has been submitted to Parliament. The ULCC
held a meeting with Parliament in September 2011 to discuss the content of the Law and its
importance in the fight against corruption.

The enforcement of the dispositions of the declaration of Asset Law by all members of the
executive branch has been satisfactory.




                                                18
Objective 4: To reinforce procurement regulation and enhance transparency in
procurement practices.

48.     In relation to improving public governance through strengthening public
procurement, several prior actions have been taken such as: CNMP has restored its website
containing information on procurement bids and contracts awarded; it has recruited new
members for the CNMP; and, the Government has issued an instruction to Ministries and other
public contracting authorities to clarify that the use of accelerated procurement procedures under
the State of Emergency Law must receive prior authorization from the Prime Minister.
Notwithstanding these actions, the results expected by September 30, 2011 have not been fully
met. The status of the result indicators are as follows:

      1. The share of non-competitive procurement in total procurement has decreased from 56
         percent (as of 2008) to 45 percent. It is measured by the value of contracts awarded
         without competition as a percentage of all contracts that do not fall under the
         accelerated procedures invoked by the State of Emergency (Not Met). The data on
         procurement from line ministries were no available following the earthquake. The
         Government has recruited a consultant firm (Cardno) to support the CNMP with the data
         collection for 2008-09 and 2009-10. The firm completed the report in January 2012.
      2. The Prime Minister has given prior authorization to all contracts awarded based on the
         Emergency Law accelerated procedures (Met). A letter from the Prime Minister’s office
         to the Bank certified that all the contracts have received the PM’s prior authorization.

49.      Key Next and Ongoing Steps. Various actions toward making the Procurement Law
fully effective include the following: (i) the Government adopted ten pending implementing
decrees for the application of the Procurement Law which were signed by the Council of
Ministers before the departure of President Préval. These decrees have been published in the
Official Journal, although only after the closing date of the operation7; (ii) for FY2010-2011 five
institutions – the Port Authority (APN), the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Justice, the
Ministry of Education, and the Metropolitan Water Office (CAMEP) – have sent their annual
procurement plans to CNMP. According to CNMP, the quality of the plans needs improvement.
To that end, in January 2012, the Cabinet jointly with the CNMP organized a workshop to ensure
the submission of procurement plans and to clarify the procedures for implementation. This new
practice will help reduce waste and fraud and enhance the budget process.

This public procurement component is rated moderately satisfactory

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.   The objectives of the Emergency DPG remain relevant, and progress was made in
the implementation of key parts of the Program. In particular, these include the

    In addition to the four implementing decrees adopted in 2009
                                                 19
implementation of a framework to monitor the transfers to the IPPs and to EDH, including the
reconciliation of data by MTPTC and MEF, and the publication on the MEF’s website, albeit
with some delay, of data on payments to IPPs and actual payments. It is also important to
underline the progress made in reinstating budget controls by external and internal audit bodies,
respectively the CSCCA and the IGF, and in strengthening the monitoring mechanisms of the
declaration of assets. However, there were shortcomings in the achievement of other Program
objectives. As of September 2011, it has not been possible to measure if the share of non-
competitive procurement in total procurement has decreased from 56 percent (as of 2008) to 45
percent, due to lack of information.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There were no gender aspects in this operation, and given the short period covered by the
Program, it’s not possible to attribute any specific poverty impact to the DPG

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

51.      The Emergency DPG is contributing in various ways to strengthening institutions in
Haiti. First, the issue of a joint memorandum from the MEF and the MTPTEC to strengthen the
monitoring of payments to the electricity sector and implementing a framework to monitor the
transfers to the IPPs and EDH will help improve the performance and efficiency of public
resources and institutions. Second, the submission to the Court of Accounts of the government
accounts no more than 8 months after the end of the fiscal year; and the Court of Accounts
communicating MEF the results of the audits of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 government accounts
by September 30, 2011, would enhance transparency and efficiency in the public financial
management. Third, the 100 percent compliance rate with the Declaration of Assets Law of the
members of the government will help advance transparency in public affairs. Fourth, decreasing
the share of non-competitive procurement in total procurement will reinforce procurement
regulation and enhance transparency in procurement practices. However, institutional impacts
are still limited and challenges remains in this area. For instance, only 50% of the members of
the judiciary and 35% of the members of the legislative body have made their Asset Declaration
for FY2011-2011.

The Bank has not organized a survey or a workshop with stakeholders.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate

52.     Since the preparation and design of this Emergency Development Policy Operation, a
number of substantial risks were identified that could affect the medium and long-term success
of development outcomes. There were risks related to: macroeconomic framework stability;
political and security situation; natural disasters; and institutional capacity constraints, all of
                                                20
which are addressed below. However, the risks that development outcomes would not be
maintained are rated moderate as the Government has demonstrated commitment to the reform
program and the actions supported by the DPG have been embedded as part of a longer-standing
policy dialogue that has been carried out through various lending operations

53.     Macroeconomic Stability. The macroeconomic risks associated with the operation have
been abated as the government demonstrated ownership and a credible commitment to enhance
the efficiency of the domestic resources. The fiscal balance during the implementation of this
operation has been under control due to increasing revenues and efficient fiscal consolidation. In
fact, domestic revenues in 2011 were the highest Haiti has ever achieved (13.0% of GDP) thanks
to stronger tax administration and improved tax policy. In addition, the international community
has pledged to increase its aid in the form of budget support to supplement government resources.

54.     Political and Security Situation. Originally, the political and security risks were related
to the institutional void created by the postponement of the legislative election, and the difficulty
in managing the organization of the legislative and presidential elections. After a tumultuous
process, the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections launched in November 2010 ended with a
Presidential victory for Michel Martelly in May 2011, while the opposition Party won most seats
in the Parliament, forcing a government of “cohabitation? The former Government team, in mid
October 2011, handed over to the new cabinet team after a transition period of five months.
However, political uncertainty remains a concern. The political climate remains contentious and
the current situation raises fears that further political gridlock could hamper reconstruction
activities in 2012. Despite the peaceful transition, President Martelly’s first months in office
have been marred by: (i) delays in naming a Prime Minister, which ended after a five-month long
political vacuum, and had slowed down the recovery process significantly; (ii) a stalled
constitutional reform effort; (iii) a recently-revealed and open conflict between the President and
the Prime Minister, and; (iv) a controversy with Parliament after the arrest of a Deputy.8 The
arrest of a lawmaker in service further strained the already difficult relationship between the
Executive Branch and Parliament. Meanwhile, a Senate commission is investigating the
nationality of thirty-nine members of the government including the President.

55.     Natural Disaster Risk. Natural disaster risks are reflected in the country’s exposure to
natural disasters, including potential serious after-shocks as well as hurricanes and flash floods.
However, support from the Bank and other donors in the area of disaster management had been a
mitigating factor for natural disaster risks

56.    Institutional Capacity Constraints. The risks related to weak capacity reflect capacity
constraints to prepare, implement, and oversee reforms. These could jeopardize the government’s

  Since his swearing-in, President Martelly faced opposition from the new Parliament over the
appointment of a Prime Minister. On June 21, 2011, the Chamber of Deputies formally rejected the
candidacy of his Prime Minister-designate, Daniel-Gérard Rouzier. The President’s subsequent choice,
Bernard Gousse, was also rejected on August 2, 2011, following a heated debate in the Senate.

efforts and undermine the expected impact of the Emergency DPG. To reduce the risk posed by
weak institutional capacity, the operation focused on sustaining government reforms that have
started generating positive results. Finally, several technical assistance programs supporting
government capacity, including Bank technical assistance, are being implemented and
particularly the Bank’s Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery project in the
ongoing portfolio.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

57.     While the Emergency Development Policy Operation was not a continuation of the
EGRO series, it used some of its critical triggers. The areas of focus do not differ significantly
from those addressed in the previous operation (EGRO III) to ensure continuity. The operation
also paid attention to issues where there has been government’s strong buy-in. Thus, the areas of
focus included the strengthening of budget controls and audits, the establishment of transparency
in the management of transfers in the electricity sector, and procurement. These areas were also
aligned with the governance program announced and presented by the government in New York,
in March 2010, which was strongly supported by Haiti’s partners.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

58.     Supervision missions regularly visited Haiti and provided assistance to the
Government to take the required actions towards the expected outcomes by end September
2011. Supervision took place through the presence in the field of a Bank Economist and frequent
missions of the operation’s task team leader as well as the preparation of several aides-memoires
and follow-up notes sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister to permanently
emphasize the pending actions, bottlenecks and next steps to follow. The supervision and
monitoring mechanism relied on frequent and regular reviews of reform implementation status.
The last supervision mission, which visited Haiti from the 22 to the 27 of September, 2011
discussed the status of the Emergency DPG and agreed with the Government on the closure of
the operation taking place on September 30, 2011. As mentioned before, substantial progress has
been made in implementing the reforms supported by the operation. Some key actions remain to
be taken to ensure the objectives of the Operation are fully met. It was expected that by the time
of the completion of the Implementation Completion and Results Report, most of these pending
or lagging activities would be completed.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The Government had full
ownership of the DPG program and remained committed to its implementation, despite the fact
that the implementation capacity had been negatively affected by the political situation, which
slowed significantly the pace of implementation of reforms. Moreover, in spite of the
challenging political and security situation during an election year the Government made
important efforts to accomplish all the reforms supported by this operation. However, as
mentioned above there were shortcomings in the implementation of other elements of the DPG.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.     The MEF was the principal executing agency and was responsible for the overall
coordination of the operation as set out in the Letter of Development Policy. Similarly, the
MEF was in charge of reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned
entities, including the MTPTC, EDH, CNMP and CSCCA. Although delays were encountered in
the implementation of the DPG-supported program, the staff in the MEF continued monitoring
and coordination of the program with the support of Bank Staff. They kept providing leadership
to address bottlenecks or pending problems, and ensuring attention to the most complex issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     As described above, substantial progress was made in implementation of key parts
of the Program. However, there were shortcomings in meeting the targets of some outcome
indicators due to several constraints and weak implementation capacity. At the same time,
Government is staying the course in implementing the Program components, and it has restated
its intention to achieve its Development Objectives in full. Overall, the Government's reform
program was well focused but had been implemented under extremely difficult circumstances,
despite identification of the technical constraints and technical assistance in these areas. The
fragile political and security situation and the impact of the earthquake and its aftermaths also
played a role in these shortcomings.

62.     In the period of the implementation of the Emergency DPG program the
macroeconomic situation improved faster than anticipated. The progress made reflects the
authorities’ efforts to quickly restore state institutions while implementing prudent
macroeconomic policies and the sizeable budget support from donors. Macroeconomic stability
was restored and Haiti is on track with the IMF supported Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
approved on July 21, 2010 and debt stock relief for under the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust
Fund (PCDR). The program has been on track despite the difficult post-earthquake environment
and delays in the electoral agenda. The IMF just completed in March 2012 satisfactory second
and third reviews of its ECF programs.

6.     Lessons Learned

63.    In small countries, policy based programs need to be relatively simple and
straightforward, in particular in a country with high risk of occurrence of major natural
disasters such as Haiti. The rationale for a single-tranche operation was supported by the
possible risks affecting the operation, the period required by the Government to implement the
reforms, the need to test the incoming Government's sustained commitment to the reform
program, and the knowledge that implementation capacity is not strong. Thus it has been useful
to have a noncomplex and straightforward program that supported reform implementation.

64.     The policy actions supported by this operation reflect: On the one hand the
recognition of the difficult environment from which Haiti had only recently emerged after the
devastating earthquake which struck the country on January 12, 2010, significantly worsening
the poverty and living conditions of the population and exacerbating the country’s development
challenges; and on the other hand, the progress made over the past years with the support of the
preceding economic governance reform operations. However, institutional building and
strengthening of legal and regulatory frameworks continue to be key factors underpinning budget
support operations to ensure proper management of aid inflows.

65.     Countries that have experienced major natural disasters need strong institutional
support to back up critical reforms aimed at restoring institutional functions as fast as
possible. Progress in public financial management, such as budget control and auditing processes,
and procurement procedures have benefited from technical assistance, without which it would
have been difficult to make headways. This is a lesson drawn from experience in every country
that has suffered natural disasters.

66.     The Program Policy Matrix needs to be concise, with few measures and outcome
indicators that are clearly defined and deemed within the control of the government with
strong support from donors. Such an approach requires prioritizing reforms within a
reasonable timeframe based on agreed prior actions and targets between the Government and
donors. It also requires sustained dialogue within a common framework. Drawing from that
lesson, this operation was prepared in consultation with the donor community. In effect, a joint-
mission of donors involved in budget support took place in May 2010 to coordinate the policy
actions underpinning the government’s reform program and budget support operations in the
aftermath of the earthquake.

Annex 3. Governance Program of the Government of Haiti

Introduction
5.1.     The January 12, 2010 earthquake in no way shook the determination of the Haitian
government to continue its quest to build a State that aspires to and demonstrates the highest
degree of transparency and accountability in managing the funds entrusted to it by taxpayers and
its international financial partners.

5.2.    This note is aimed at reaffirming the commitment of the Haitian government to manage
public resources properly and apply the highest standards of transparency and accountability to
the use of these resources during this critical phase of reconstruction of the national economy
and sweeping reform of the Haitian society.

5.3.    The note is composed of two parts. The first part takes stock of the significant strides
made in the area of economic governance prior to the January 12 earthquake, and the second lists
the activities that the government pledges to undertake to build on and even surpass the gains
made in the past.

I.   Progress Made Prior to the Earthquake

5.4.    Significant progress was made with the implementation of economic governance
measures in the six years preceding the January 12 earthquake. This progress relates, in
particular, to budget preparation, budget execution monitoring, and internal and external auditing
of public expenditure.

5.5.     The law on the preparation and execution of budget laws has been adopted, providing,
inter alia, a budget preparation timetable. Budget preparation has been strengthened through the
implementation of a consultative process between the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)
and the sectoral ministries, as well as coordination between the Ministry of Planning and
External Cooperation (MPCE) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, with a view to better
linkage of investment expenditure and current expenditure. The various civil society sectors
have been included in the drafting process and have been informed of budget choices. For
several years, the draft budget has been submitted to Parliament in a timely manner. Measures
have been adopted with a view to making the budget available to the public on the MEF’s
website, via pamphlets, and in the print media.

5.6.    The public expenditure oversight systems have been strengthened by the establishment
and commencement of operations of the Inspectorate General of Finance [Inspection Générale
de Finances IGF]. In addition, public accountants and financial comptrollers have been assigned
to all ministries and government agencies and current account use has been reduced from 60
percent of current expenditure, excluding salaries, in 2004 to the historic level of 3 percent in
2009. SYSDEP and SYSGEP, two public expenditure automated management systems, are used
on a regular basis to ensure close and integrated management of current and investment
expenditure. Budget execution reports, prepared on a periodic basis in accordance with
international accounting standards, are published monthly and annually. Since 2005, national
revenue accounts have been prepared in fewer than eight months after the end of the fiscal year

                                               30
and transmitted for the opinion of the Superior Court of Auditors and Administrative Law
Disputes [Cour Supérieure des Comptes et du Contentieux Administratif CSCCA] prior to
submission to Parliament.

5.7.    In the area of revenue, ongoing efforts to improve the management of the tax and
customs administrations facilitated an increase in taxes to 11.2 percent in 2009 compared to an
average of 10 percent over the past decade. A new customs code has been approved by the
Chamber of Deputies. The process of drafting a tax code with a view to aligning it with regional
standards has started. Sydonia World has been installed in the main customs offices with the
aim of enhancing their effectiveness and reducing cases of fraud and under billing. At the same
time, the mandate of the SGS, the company responsible for inspecting merchandise prior to
loading, has been expanded in provincial customs offices in order to help ensure effective
management of the flow of merchandise and revenue collection.

5.8.   A National Public Procurement Commission [Commission Nationale des Marchés Public
CNMP] has been established to better regulate and normalize public procurement procedures and
help build capacity in the area of the procurement of goods and services in sectoral ministries.
This entity, even more so than the establishment of the legal framework, has facilitated some
improvement in procurement practices, as a result of the various training and dissemination
sessions organized. Available statistics indicate that the share of procurement not subject to
bidding relative to total government procurement fell from 85 percent in 2004 to 56 percent in
2008. In addition, a few months prior to the earthquake, an important step was taken with the
adoption by Parliament in June 2009 of the new procurement law. Four important implementing
decisions have been signed and published.

5.9.   The establishment of the Anti-Corruption Unit [Unité de Lutte contre la Corruption
ULCC] has contributed greatly to raising awareness among government employees and the
general population of the costs and risks associated with corruption and the ways and means of
preventing it.

5.10. After adoption of the law on asset disclosure, it was noted that a significant majority of
government employees complied with the provisions of this law. After going through their
disclosure statements, a report was submitted by the ULCC to the CSCCA and the Anti-
Corruption Commissions of both chambers.

II. Actions to be Taken to Preserve and Strengthen the Progress Made in the Area of
Economic Governance

5.11. The government is cognizant of the importance accorded by the Haitian people and
Haiti’s international financial partners to the proper use of public funds, transparency, and
accountability in the management of resources provided to the government for Haiti’s
reconstruction and development. During the March 16-17 technical meeting held in the
Dominican Republic, the government, through its representatives, reiterated the importance to be
accorded to sound and transparent management of the resources that will be mobilized through
Haiti’s taxpayers and partners.



                                              31
5.12. Consequently, in the post-earthquake period, the government is resolute in its desire to
preserve and even build upon the gains made in the area of economic governance. Although the
earthquake dealt a severe blow to key institutions and logistical resources in place prior to
January 12, the government quickly focused on salvaging the main equipment and servers that
were not completely destroyed and mobilized assistance from its chief partners to get pre-
earthquake management and oversight systems up and running again.

5.13.    The Haitian government is taking the following actions:
