                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to support enhanced accountability and transparency in the management of public resources in the context of the
                         reconstruction. The operation supports the government's capacity to manage public resources efficiently and transparently. More specifically, the operation
                         supports the following measures: (i) increasing transparency in budget transfers to the electricity sector; (ii) reinstating budget controls and external and
                         internal audit processes; (iii) improving enforcement of the Law on Declaration of Assets; and (iv) reinforcing public procurement regulation and enhancing
                         transparency in procurement practices.

                         Overall, substantial progress has been made in implementing the reforms supported by the Emergency DPO. Some key actions remain to be taken to ensure the objectives of the
                         Operation are fully met. Based on the government's action plan in these areas, it is expected that by the time of the completion of the Implementation Completion Report, most of
                         these pending or lagging activities would be completed.
