                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to support enhanced accountability and transparency in the management of public resources in the context of the
                         reconstruction. The operation supports the government's capacity to manage public resources efficiently and transparently. More specifically, the operation
                         supports the following measures: (i) increasing transparency in budget transfers to the electricity sector; (ii) reinstating budget controls and external and
                         internal audit processes; (iii) improving enforcement of the Law on Declaration of Assets; and (iv) reinforcing public procurement regulation and enhancing
                         transparency in procurement practices.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, limited progress has been made towards meeting the development objective. Lagging areas include: (i) the comprehensiveness and regularity of the publication of data on
                         electricity transfers; (ii) compliance with the Declaration of Assets Law; (iii) and procurement.

                         Of the seven indicators used to track the progress towards the DO, five are on track and data are not yet available to make an assessment on the two others. Close monitoring and
                         ongoing dialogue with the client are expected to lead to progress.
