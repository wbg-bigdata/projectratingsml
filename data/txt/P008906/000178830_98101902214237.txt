INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOI1MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR THE ANTALYA FOREST UTILIZATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$40.0 million to help
finance a project for (a) the development of modern forest management practices
in the Antalya forests, (b) the construction of an integrated saw mill and pulp
and paper mill by the State Pulp and Paper Enterprise (SEKA) near Antalva, and
(c) further forest industries sector studies. The loan would have a term of
16 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
Part of the proceeds of the loan ($29.9 million) would be relent through the
State Investment Bank (SIB) to SEKA and its Antalya Establishment for the in-
dustrial part of the project on the same terms as the Bank loan, plus a fee
of 1-3/4 percent per annum on the outstanding amount, bringing the cost of
this portion of the loan to SEKA and the Establishment to 9 percent per annum.
The loan would be made jointly with a $24.4 million loan from the European
Investment Bank (EIB). The EIB loan would have a term of 30 vears, including
8 years of grace, with interest at 4-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - TIIE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Developments and Prospects
of Turkev" dated September 18, 1972, was distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors (R 72-236). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I. A basic
economic mission visited Turkey in April/May 1973 and the report will be
distributed to the Executive Directors in early 1974. Some preliminary
conclusions of the mission have been incorporated below.
3.        Following a long period of stability in Turkey during the 1960s,
internal political tensions appeared at the beginning of the present decade.
Student disturbances and unrest among workers occurred in 1970 and early
1971 and since March 1971, when the armed forces called for the resignation
of the Demirel cabinet and for the implementation of the land, tax, educa-
tional, administrative and other reforms prescribed by the 1961 Constitution,
there have been four Government changes. The "above-party" and reformist
Government formed under Prime Mlinister Erim in March 1971 introduced several
reform bills in Parliament. But the tensions between the armed forces and
the political parties and opposition from Parliament to some of the reform
proposals and administration changes have led to successive coalition Govern-
ments with increasing political party representation. The continued political
uncertainties have meant that although law and order were largely restored,
planned reforms have on the whole not progressed very far. The underlying
tensions came to the fore in March 1973 in connection with the end of the
term of the President of the Republic and the election of a new president.
After some delay, agreement was reached and former Admiral Fahri Koruturk
was elected President in April 1973. A new Government under Prime Minister



- 2 -
Talu was then formed, xjhichl announced its intention to speed up the process
of legislating reforns and Drepare for national elections, which took place
in October 1973. The Republican People's Party under Mr. Ecevit gained the
largest number of seats but failed to get an absolute majority. Discussions
are now being held to explore the formation of a coalition government.
4.         While long-term economic policy issues have recentlv become one of
the main causes of political tensions, growth in gross national product in the
last decade has been high and continuous, aver-aging about 6.9% per year in
the period 1962-72.   In the same period, gross investment increased substan-
tially, with its share in GNP rising from 15% to 20%.     Although total consump-
tion increased considerably, gross national savings increased at a much faster
rate, their share in GNP rising from 11% to 19%.     Iiowever, since 1970, in spite
of a big jump in workers' remittances, the share of gross national savings h1as
not risen substantially due to relatively poor public savings, and the share of
investment also increased more slowly due to pressure on public resources
(paragraph 7).
5.        The main growth sectors in the last decade have been industry, power,
transport and construction. This reflected the development strategy during
the first and second five-year plans (1962-67, 1968-72), which gave highest
priority to industrialization.    Industrial output grew by about 10% per annum
with textiles, machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals providing the
main impetus. But this rapid growth, mainly to meet domestic demand and
replace imports, was insulated from foreign competition, which led to high-
cost industrial production. Other rapidly growing sectors were trade and
financial services. Agricultural production had a tren(d growth rate of about
3.5% per annum, with fluctuations from year to year depending on weather
conditions. As a result of the relative growt:h rates, the share of industrv
in GDP rose to 23% in 1972 and that of agriculture dropped to 28%', compareci
to 17% and 39% respectively in 1962.    Growth in the last two years has heen
above average. In 1971, GNP increased by 10 percent in real terms, with
value added in agriculture increasing by more than 11%, thanks largely to
an excellent harvest, a sharp rise in workers' remittances and continued
industrial growth. In 1972, GNP increased by 7.7%, with value added in
agriculture not increasing over the 1971 level, but with a 12% growth in
industry, fast growth in transport, construction and trade and another
sharp rise in workers' remittances.
6.        The balance of payments situation was characterized in 1967-70 by
increasing trade deficits, and a strict svstem of import controls leading
to delays and shortages of essential imports and, consequently, to under-
utilization of production capacitv. The overvalued official exchange rate
was changed in August 1970 from TL 9 to TL 15 per US$, revised to TL 14 in
December 1971 and has remained at TL 14 after the February 1973 dollar
devaluation. This, together with associated stabilization measures, rising
world demand and prices and a rapid rise in workers' remittances (from $140
million in 1969 to $740 million in 1972) helped to improve the situation
dramatically. Commoditv exports increased by about 23% per annum in 1971
and 1972, due to agricultural exports (mainly cotton, tobacco, hazelnuts,
raisins and fruits and vegetables) increasing by about 22% per annum and



- 3 -
industrial exports by an unprecedented 55%, The large increases in Industrial
exports were in food and beverages, text!les, hides and leather products and
petroleum products.   The improved foreign exchange position also led to a high
import growth of 28% per annum, mainly in investment goods and raw materials
(machinery and equipment, transport, steel and other metals, chemicals and
fertilizers),  Tourism receipts also doubled between 1970 and 1972.    The
improvement in the balance of payments continued into 1973 with exports and
imports in the first half of the year increasing by 44% and 32% respectively
over the first half of 1972.   Workers' remittances are expected to have been
about $1 billion in 1973.   The overall result has been a continuing increase
in gross official foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $241 billion at
the end of August 1973.   Net fereign aose;s, which were negative ifn 1966-68,
had risen to over $900 million in July 1973, ie. about 6 months of imports.
One of the contributory factors to the rising foreign exchange reserv-es has
been the inflow of 'hot' money with conrertible lira accounts rising from
$70 million at the end of 1970 to $480 million in April 1973.
7,        The budgetary situation has been dominated in the last decade by
the rapid growth of public expenditures, Although tax revenues have grown
faster than GNP, their share rising from 12.9% in 1962 to 17.9% of GNP in
1972, the increases in tax revenues ha-e been more than offset by the rise
in current expenditures and transfers, The overall budget deficit has grown
and was particularly large in 1971 when the full impact on current expendi-
tures of public salary increases under the 1970 Personnel Reform Law was felt.
The Treasury had to have growing recourse to the Central Bank for short-ternm
adrances and to other short-term borrowing. The difficulties facing public
mobilization of resources led to public investment expenditures falling short
of targets, and to an actual decline in public fixed investment in real terms
in 1971.  In 1972, the need for Central Bank financing of the Treasury declined
as a result of a strict control of current expenditure and a sharp increase
in the sale of Government bonds to TL 4 billion (0.8 billion in 1971). Public
3Cvestment also recovered, increasing by 19% over 1971.
8.        The overall f,.nancial results of the more than 100 State Economic
Enterprises (SEEs) have been consistentlv poor, but there are sharp differ-
ences among SEEs, with railways and coal being the major losers and manufac-
t^oring showing improving profits.  The SEEs now account for about 20'% of the
.fred investment in the economy and about 10% of value-added; however, in
eac1a year since 1966 a quarter of the 28 major producing SEEs on average
hx-re lost money,  Since 1969 the average rate of return on investment for the
28 largest producing SEEs has been less than 3% despite subsidized interest
rates avieraging about 4%. The low profits of the SEEs have necessitated in-
creasing budgetary transfers, which amounted to TL 3.5 billion in 1971 and
over TL 6 billion in 1972. The railways have been by far the biggest loser,
although the measures agreed upon in connection with Loan 893-TU have begun
to lead to improvement in their financial situation.
9.        In the period 1967-70, while available resources increased, a more
rapid growth of expenditures fueled by fa3t monetary expansion led to infla-
tionary pressures in the economy, with the GNP deflator increasing by about
6% per annur.. Inflationary- pressures have been particularly strong in the



- 4 -
last two vears, with the GNP deflator increasing by 18% and 14% in 1971 and
1972 respectively. Excess demand has been fueled in this period by accumula-
tion of foreign exchange reserves, due to rapidly rising workers' remittances
and convertible lira accounts; substantial deficit financing of the public
sector, mainlv to finance the Treasury and agricultural commodity purchases
in 1971, and rising private investment demand. At the same time, prices of
imported goods have risen as a result of the devaluation, depreciation of the
lira and rising world export prices and, furthermore, the prices of SEE pro-
ducts were raised in 1971 and agricultural support purchases have been sub-
stantiallv raised over the last two years. In these circumstances, effective
demand management should be a major concern of economic policy. Policies will
be needed to improve mobilization of resources by the public sector to finance
growing public investments. It would be essential to develop the capital
market in Turkey to supplement existing sources of long-term domestic borrow-
ing. Proposals for a capital market bill are now being considered. In addi-
tion, revisions in the interest rate structure to ensure a reasonable real
rate of return would be needed to encourage private savings. Further liberal-
ization of imports to improve the competitiveness of domestic industry and
reduce the inflationary growth of foreign exchange reserves would also be
necessary.
10.       The emplovment situation is also a matter of growing concern.     The
development strategy has emphasized the growth of output and labor productiv-
icv rather than employment. As a result, the labor surplus, including esti-
mates of labor surplus in agriculture rose from about 1 million in 1962 to
..6 million in 1972, i.e., about 11% of the labor force. Migration has
so far greatly eased the pressure on employment. Between 1965 and 1972, net
emigration amounted to about 400,000 and was expected to be about 70,000 per
vear during the Third Plan. The Third Plan continues to emphasize investment
in capital intensive industries and projects a growth in non-agricultural
labor surplus by aniother 300,000 by 1977.   With the added effect of a slow-
dow)n in EuroDe on employment of Turkish workers (para 14), unemployment should
ae a .ador concern of economic policy.    Speedy implementation of land reform
an.d integra,ed ruraL development programs would help to reduce the migration
:roxo cura. to urban areas. In addition, labor intensive methods need special
cTph3SiS in the choic-e of projects.  However, even with these measures and
frster growth chan p_anned in construction and services, urban unemployment
Is iirelv to remain a serious problem.
The Prospects for continued high economic growth are good.    The
;!;rc A ;- (1Qi _3-77) development strategy constitutes the first phase of a
io.ng-t.err.sti:azegy for the period 1973-95, the ultinate objective of which is
< raLse 1url i sh standards of living to those of It-aly in 1970, through fast
induszrialization and decreasing dependenace on external resources. The Third
Plan targets are an 8% GDP growth rate, 10.7%o fixed investment growth rate
(TL 280 billion in constant prices over the Plan period, i.e., an average
of aDout $4 billion per year), a marginal savings ratio of 38% on national
savings (compared with about 18% in the Second Plan), commodity imports and
exports growing at 9.4% and 7.1% respectively and a decline in gross inflows
of official external assistance to $130 million in 1977 (compared with over
$300 million in 1972). Workers' remittances are estimated at $600 million
at constant prices in 1977.



12.       A detailed analysis of these tf.rgets will be presented in the basic
eeonoxc l  report  The p7eliminar -y  nclusi~ns are that, though the prospects
for a growth rate of 7% are g-eod, thE. PlFn projections seem to underestimate
both the difficulty of raising thn savings level and that of balancing the
external account at a reduced level of   xtenrrial assistance.
13,       Most of the increase in national savings in the Plan is expected
to come from the public sector (68%) throtugh a large increase in tax revenues
representing 31% of GNP increase and, SEE curpluses increasing by 33% per year.
With the past performance of SEEs and delay7s in implementing reform, the
expected growth in their surplus is not feasible. It will also be difficult
to raise tax revenues to- tie extent impliped -y the Plan but there is scope
for a smaller increase if vigorous policies are pursued, e.g., further impro.'e-
ments in tax administration and effecti-ve collection now under way, widening
the tax net to cover agricultural incomes, lncreases in the rates of property
taxation, introduction of a value added tax and liberalization of imports to
offset tax losses due to import stibstitu.tion and reductions of custom duties
under the EEC agreement. The problem of domestic resource mobilization by
the public sector is therefore likely to remain a constraint in the growth of
public investment and aDart from improved SEE performance, higher external
borrowing and policies to increase long-term domestic borrowing from the
prilvaZe sector would be inecessary to achieve the ambitious investment targets.
14,       On the external side. the Plan projections have been overtaken by
events and commodity imports and exports in 1973 are likely to have been at
about the level projected for 19,77.  Workerst remittances in 1972 were already
higher than the 1977 target. However, their future was made uncertain by the
decision of the Federal Gernan Government in November to temporarily prohibit
further entry of foreign wtorkers from non-EEC countries because of the energy
crisis. It remains to be seen what course this policy will take over the
I.onger run. The emphasis on capital intensive industrial development and the
rise in the prices of imported fuel and raw materials will require a faster
import growth rate, especially since the import regime is likely to be more
liberal than in the past. Exports, pprticularly of industrial commodities,
should continue to show good growth unless inflation continues at high rates,
which would erode the competitive advantage gained as a result of the 1970
devaluation and the subsequent depreciation of the lira with the dollar vis-
a-vis Turkey's main trading partners in Europe, Gross official external in-
flows may be of the order of $400 million a year.
15.       For the longer term, the continued political uncertainties have
meant that planned reforms, e.g., tax, educational and SEEs, have on the
whole not progressed very far. Administrative reform of the SEEs, upgrading
their executive and labor skills and better pricing policies still need to
be achieved, although administrative reform of SEEs is proceeding slowly on a
case-by-case basis in connection with Bank loans. This is especially important
to prepare Turkish industry for competition that will arise from the EEC. A
land reform bill was passed in June 1973, but only the large holdings wi51
be subject to expropriation, and the existing land holding situation in
Turkey is not clear because title to much of the land has not been registered
and the cadastral survey is proceeding slowly. Other problems in agriculture



- 6 -
are that the Anatolian plateau and the Eastern part of Turkey are considerably
less developed than the coastal regions. Greater provision of credit to
farmers for productive purposes is needed and there is a need to modify price
support and other policies to divert resources from surplus crops, e.g., tea
and tobacco.
16.       Total external debt outstanding and disbursed was $2.5 billion at
the end of 1972, of which all but 3 percent is public or publicly guarznteed.
The share of the Bank Group in total debt outstanding was 8.3% in 1972 and is
expected to rise; the precise extent will depend considerably on the future
level of workers' remittances. The average terms of new credits have been
hardening in recent years and this trend is expected to continue. Of the
total gross official external assistance of about $380 million in 1972, the
Consortium members provided an estimated $220 million.    Of this about $58
million came from the United States, $44 million from the Federal Republic of
Germany, $35 million from the Bank Group, $27 million from the European Monetary
Agreement (EMA) and $22 million from the United Kingdom. The USSR dSsbursed
$113 million. As a result of successive debt reschedulings and other arrange-
ments for debt relief together with substantially increased workerst' remittances,
the debt service ratio fell considerably from 24% in 1964 to an estimated 10%
of total foreign exchange earnings in 1972. However, since the improvements in
the balance of pavments have occurred recently, and have been dependent to a
considerable degree on workers' remittances, Turkey should continue to exercise
great care in its external debt management, including restraint in its resort
to suppliers' credit financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
17.       During the lengthy period of chronic balance of payments difficul-
ties before the 1970 stabilization program and devaluation of the Turkish lira,
Bank lending was only intermittent. Since then, the rapid improvement in the
balance of payments and in creditworthiness stimulated by these actions has
made possible a large increase and continuity in Bank/IDA lending, which
in FY 71, FY72 and FY73 amounted to $114 million, $173.3 million, and $175
million respectively.   In these three fiscal years sixteen lending operations
were carried out, of which five were in agriculture, four in industry (includ-
ing DFCs), three in power and the rest in urban development, transportation,
an, :c-ational education.   Agriculture accounted for 30% of the funds lent
and industrv and DFCs for nearly 40%. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31, 1973, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Implementation of projects in
our private sector has been satisfactory; on the other hand, projects in the
future sector - especially those breaking new grcound in agriculture - have
been seriously affected by political instability and the resulting admiinistra-
tive problems, and disbursements have been much slower than expected. A com-
prehensive review of the problems besetting these projects will be proposed to
the Government as soon as a new cabinet is formed.



-7 -
1 8.      In view of the sastained improl7ement in the balance of payments
situation, no further IDA lending in rontemplated.   Bank lending is being
increasingly directed to support of Turkish efforts: (a) to improve lagging
public sector saving where financial and management reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs) remains the key problem; and (b) to further improve
distribution of income and living standards in an economy entering its seco1nd
decade of roughly 7% yearly growth, i.e., to promote better employment policies,
more concerted rural development efforts, and better urban planning. Since the
strengthened balance of payments position rests in good measure on workers'
remittances, future lending will also be aimed, as opportunities arise, at
helping Turkey to make key structural changes to diversify long-term capacity
to earn foreign exchange, for example, in tourism, if the Government decides
to mount a greater effort in this sector to complement and support private
initiatives, which have already begun to stimulate increases in badly lagging
earnings from this source. As a first step in this latter direction a Bank
tourism project identification mission visited Turkey in December 1973.
19.       While the focus of Bank lending is on supporting the institutional
and structural changes noted above, continuation of recent levels of lending
is also important at least for an interim period until the longer term
stability of Turkey's external earning capacity is better established. As
discussed in Part I, Turkev's Third Plan goals of an 8% growth rate and
increasing competitiveness with the EEC in preparation for eventual full
membership require further import liberalization and higher external borrow-
ing in the near term.
20.       In pursuit of the two broad objectives of improved public sector
saving and better distribution of welfare outlined in paragraph 18 above, it
is planned to continue concentrating the bulk of Bank lending (a) in industry
(including mining and DFCs), where financial and management strengthening
of SEEs is the key task, and (b) in aRriculture, where rural development,
employment, and institution building are being encouraged. This core of
the program will be supplemented by repeater loans for railways and selected
loans for power (which also center on financial reform of state enterprises),
follow-up lending for urban development in Istanbul and possibly in Izmir in
support of the second objective, and potentially by lending in tourism. Bank
lendlng has thus far been geographically focused mainly in the Istanbul region,
with emphasis on urban development and industrial finance, and in the Cukurova
region around Adana on the southern coast, with emphasis on power, irrigation
and fruit and vegetables. This pattern is likely to broaden in pursuit of the
second objective, with wider lending in the Anatolian plateau and eastern
Turkev in response to the Government's efforts to widen the geographic base
of development, discourage too rapid urban migration, and improve the distri-
bution of income. Continued selective lending to the Turkish Industrial
Development Bank (TSKB) is also contemplated, with emphasis being placed on
encouraging TSKB to broaden its private sources of capital and to sten up
its efforts to finance private investment in the poorer regions of Turkey.
21.       With regard to public sector reforms, past Bank lending for power
over the course of several years helped bring about a comprehensive reorganiza-
tion of the power sector including the creation of the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK). This year proposed Bank participation in a financing package
for the Elbistan lignite mine and power plant in east central Turkey should



further help TEK to achieve it-s long-term reform objectives and establish
a Bank working relationship with the Turkish CoaL Authority (TKI). The
proposed Antalva Forest Utilization loan aims to strengthen the State Pulp
and Paper Enterprise (SEYA) in its overall investment planning as well as
to promote effective financial management in the proposed new mill subsidiary
at Antalya. In addition, the State Investment Bank, the Government's main
lending institution for SEEs, will on-lend that portion of the Bank's loan to
the Government that is for financing of the industrial part of the project.
As a follow-up to this relationship with SIB, the possibility of an industrial
credit loan to SIB for public sector industrial enterprises is being explored
for late FY74 or early FY75. The Bank is also considering a loan in FY75 to
a public sector project for iron ore mine expansion and pelletizing at Divrigi
in east central Turkey, which will be complementary to the Erdemir Steel Expan-
sion (817-TU) and to modernization of the Railways (893-TU), which are heavily
engaged in ore traffic.   Divrigi and Elbistan also represent greater geo-
graphic dispersion into lower income regions.
22.       The Bank's main effort in support of the distribution objective
is the twin strategy of promoting rural alternatives to urban migration and
improving urban development. As a beginning in rural development, the Bank
approved a credit in FY72 for the Second Livestock Project, which focuses on
fodder cropping and breeding, raising and fattening of animals in Eastern and
Central Anatolia. For FY75 the Government is preparing an integrated Rural
Development Project in rainfed areas of central Turkey. The Forestry part of
the proposed Antalya Forest Utilization Project should also make a significant
contribution to rural emplovment through expanded cutting, reforestation and
afforestation. Future lending for forest village development is also contem-
plated. In urban development the Bank lent for Istanbtul Water Supply and
Urban Studies in FY72 and for Istanbul Power Distribution in FY73. Further
lending in support otf better planning and coordination of development in
Greater Istanbul and possibly in other cities is anticipated, should the
institutional ohiectives underpinning earlier projects in Istanbul be satis-
factorilv attained.
23.       As a resillt of the expanded menmbership of the Common Market and
some leveling off£ of bilaterpl aid, the EIB has become along with the Bank
Turkev's major source of external finance on non-commercial terms.     The Bank
has developed informal cooperation with EIB in the past, for example, in
relarAd but not formally parallel lending last year to the Turkish Railways
and to ?he Tfurkish Industrial Development F,an'; (TSKB). The proposed Antalya
Foresr Utilization Loan represents a further step into formal joint financing
with EIB and we anticipate continuing a close partnership in the proposed
Elbistan Lignite Power Project later this year and in other future large-scale
projects as appropriate.
24.       The Railways and Antalva Forest Utilization Projects also exemplify
the Bank's continuing collaboration with 1UNDP. In both projects UNIDP financed
the feasibilitv study for which the Bank acted as executing agency with the
hejp of outside consultants.   In addition, LiNDP is financing further railway
technical assistance studies which form an integral part of the implementation
of the project.   In 1973 UNDI financed a stuidy of forest industries in the
tfarmara region of Turkev to help define a larger study recotmmended for inclusion



- 9 -
in the proposed Antalya Forest Utilization Project. The Bank is also colla-
borating with UJNDP and FAO in the preparation of the Rural Development Project
noted above, and collaboration is anticipated on other projects in the future.
25.       IFC has been active in Turkey, having participated in industrial
investments for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminum. Total commit-
ments so far amount to about $40 million. IFC is currently investigating new
investment opportunities in various sectors, including special steel.
PART III - THE FORESTRY AND PAPER SECTOR IN TURKEY
26.       Turkey's forests follow Finland's, Sweden's, and Spain's in size in
Europe, but they only yield one-sixth as much wood per hectare and contribute
about one-third as much to GDP as the two nordic countries. The poor yield
results mainly from obsolete forest management, which overstresses conservation
and neglects production. Trees tend to outlive their period of rapid growth
and often die unharvested. In contrast, modern management calls for cutting
at the end of the period of rapid growth and replanting immediately with im-
proved varieties to achieve a greater yield of wood per hectare of land.
As a result, forest-based industries have remained predominantly small scale,
scattered, and rather high cost; paper products and even pulp logs on occa-
sion have had to be imported; and the forest population remains one of the
poorest segments of Turkish society.
27.       Manufacture of pulp and paper in Turkey is heavily concentrated in
the hands of the State Pulp and Paper Enterprise (SEKA). Limited to one old
plant in Izmit for many years, SEKA has recently set up three new small plants
as subsidiary establishments and is planning further new investments and ex-
pansions in addition to the proposed mill at Antalya. SEKA's new mills have
been hampered during start-up by technical, financial, and staffing problems,
but are now generally running well although still incurring a net loss as a
group because of continued start-up problems at the Dalaman plant, which is
the last of the new mills to be constructed.
28.       Recognizing the need to improve forest management and to plan ade-
quate investments to meet the expected rapid increase in demand for paper, the
Government, which owns all of Turkey's natural forests, obtained UNDP assist-
ance for a number of studies of its forest resources. The Antalya forests
were subjected to a particularly rigorous study which demonstrated the feas-
ibility of the proposed project as now defined. The Bank became executing
agent of this study and engaged a Canadian Consultant firm to carry it out.
Modern approaches to forest development and investment planning have gained
much wider acceptance in Turkey. The proposed Antalya project is the first
Turkish attempt at large-scale integrated forest development and wood util-
ization.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of Antalya Forest Utilization Project Turkey",
Report No. 240a-TU, dated December 17, 1973, which is being distributed
separatelv. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
30.       The proposed project was appraised in April 1973 and missions visited
the country apain in June and July 1973 to follow up the appraisal. Negotia-
tions were held in October in Washington. The Turkish delegation was headed
by Mr, Muammer Akinci, Chief Economic and Financial Counselor of the Turkish
Embassy in Washington.
31.       General.  The project consists of a forestry development program,
an integrated sawmill and pulp and paper mill, and forest industries feasi-
bility studies.  The forestry part provides for a comprehensive program in
the Antalva region to introduce new forest management svstems and to increase
log production from 300,000 m3/year currently to 800,000 m3/year by 1979,
the year of start-up of the proposed mill. A large reforestation and affor-
estation program of 11,000 hectares per year is included. Present labor-
intensive methods of log prodluction will be maintained. The integrated mill,
to be located a few kilometers from the Mediterranean Coast 100 km east of
Antalva, will include a moderately mechanized sawmill capable of annually
converting about 340,000 m3 of logs into 180,000 m3 of sawnwood; a pulp mill
capable of annually processing 472,000 m   of pu:Lp logs and 142,000 m3 of saw-
mill residues into 147,000 bone-dry tons of unbleached kraft pulp; and a paper
mill with an annual capacity to produce either 155,000 tons of kraft linerboard
or 90,000 tons of sackkraft, or varying amounts of both. A townsite including
housing and other amenities for key employees is also included. Substantial
training is proposed for both the forestry program and the mill.
32.       The details of the feasibility studies are still being defined, but
a large program of work estimated to cost some $2.5 to $3.5 million is fore-
seen to prepare for massive investments anticipated as necessary in the next
5-10 years to keep pace with T'urkey's demand for forest products. An amount
of S2.0 million for such studies is incltuded in the project, of which $0.4
million is proposed for Bank financing, $1.1 million for financing by EIB,
an-' 5(0.5 million in local cost financing by the Government. It is anticipated
that the Government will finance the remainder of the studies from its own
resources and from funds it rnay obtain from UNDP.
33.       Ecology and Tourism.  To minimize the mill's effects on the environ-
ment in an area of natural beautv and growing tourist interest, the project
includes comprehensive provisions for the most advanced available control and
treatment of gaseous and liquid effluents. The problem of heavy truck traffic
in the area adjacent to the mill will be studied and the Government intends
to provide for suitable highway improvements or other suitable measures out-
side the nroject to accommodate traffic satisfactorily. In addition, the
Government made a careftul review of alternative sites for the mill and elimi-
nated the lowest-cost site, which was on the beach near a proposed tourism



development close to the ruins of ancient Side, in favor of a site more re-
mote from Side and the beach. A protocol was also agree(d upon by the minis-
tries concerned to prohibit further industrial development in the area of the
mill.
34.       The Market.   The sawrmiill's full capacity of 182,000 m3 would be
reached in 1979 btut would represent only 45% of the annual increase in
consumption anticipated by then in the mill's marketing area of central and
western Turkey. Since there is no other known major expansion of sawn-
wood capacitv in the marketing area, no difficultv is foreseen in selling
the mill's total output.   The Antalya Establishment will prepare a detailed
marketing and distribution plan. Stimulated by export packaging and high-
value domestic consumer goods trade, demand for linerboard is expected to
grow by 12-15% per year and reach 64-79,000 tons in 1981, when the paper mill
would reach full capacitv, and 75-97,000 tons in 1983. Demand for sackkraft,
largely from the.cement industrv, is projected to rise by 9-12% per year and
reach 84-97,000 tons in 1979 and 121-141,000 tons in 1983.     At the higher
growth rate of demand, there would be a shortfall in national prodtuction even
in Antalva's first year at full capacity; at the lower growth rate, a sack-
kraft shortfall would occur in the early l98Os.
35.       Project Costs and Financial Plan.    The following table summarizes
the estimated project costs:

Total cost                 68.0     102.1      170.1
The estimates provide for 10% physical contingencv in forestry and 8% for the
mill, and for price escalation of 10% per vear for local costs and 8% per vear
for foreign costs for both forestry and mill. Foreign equipment for the mill,
but not for forestry investment, is exempt from import duties. As noted in
paragraph 32, the cost estimate for studies is subject to further review.
36.       The following table summarizes the anticipated sources of financing

It is proposed that the Bank and the European Investment liank (EIi) finance
all foreign exchange costs of the nroject except workinp car)ital of S°.1 mil-
lion for the forestry part and $0.6 million for the mill.    The Bank would also
finance $5.2 million of interest during construction on the mill portion of
the Bank loan.   (Interest during construction on the EIB loan would be met by
the Government since EIB is not authorized to finance such interest).    The
Bank loan would be for 16 years including 5 years' grace, at 7.25 percent
p.a. interest; the EIB loan of $24.4 million for the forestry and mill parts
of the project would be for 30 years including 8 years' grace, at 4.5 percent
p.a. interest; in addition, EIB woulld allocate from an earlier loan, financing
feasibility studies, $1.1 million to meet EIB's share of the studies part of
the project.  The Bank and EIB loans would be made to the Government wlhicl
would relend the portion inten(ded for the industrial part of the project
(p29.9 million of the Bank loan and $21.0 million of the EIB loan) throughi
SIB to SEKA and the Antalya Establishvent for a term of 16 years, including
5 years' grace, and interest at 7.25 percent p.a.; SEKA and the Establishment
will also pay a fee of 1.75 percent p.a. to SIB which will retain 1 pcrcent
for itself and pass the remaining 0.75 percent p.a. to the Government. The
foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. Funds under both
loans for the forestry part of the project would be allocated by the Govern-
ment to the General Directorate of Forestry.
37.       Procurement.   Goods financed by the loan would be procured under
the Bank Group's normal procedures for international competitive bidding,
including the provision of a margin of preference for local manufacturers
for hid comparison purposes of 15% or the applicable duty, whichever is lower.
Procuirement arrangements will be on a joint basis with EIB. The bidding will
be phased, with the long-delivery, higher-priced major items -- notably the
pulp and paper plant -- being put to tender first, up to the limit of the Bank
loan. lWinning bidders from the European Community would be paid with ;IB
funds, others with Bank funds. The EIB loan wilL], be available for procurement
in the Six founder members rather than the Nine since ratification of the



-- 13 
entry of the new members has not been completed. As bidding proceeds -
should it become evident that EIBts loan could not be fully utilized during
the first phase, then in the second phase certain goods would be restricted
to bidding within the Six only, to make sure that all EIB funds will be
utilized. Cost penalties, if any, on account of such restrictive bidding
should be minor, since there would still be adequate competition among Commu-
nity suppliers. Agreement has been reached between the Bank and EIB on pro-
cedures for cooperation on the handling of bidding, disbursements and super-
vision.
38.       Disbursements.  The Bank loan would be used to finance 100% of
foreign expenditures for imported equipment, 100% of ex-factory price for
locally manufactured equipment awarded under international competitive
bidding, 100% of foreign expenditures for foreign consultant services, and
100% of total expenditures for local consultants and for interest during
construction on the Bank loan. The Bank loan would provide for up to $900,000
in retroactive financing, primarily to cover costs incurred under the consullt-
ant contract for the industrial part of the project.
39.       Project Implementation.  The forestry part of the project will be
implemented by the Antalya Forestry Division of the General Directorate of
Forestry. To assist the Division in preparing long-term and operational
forestrv development plans, a Project Implementation Team will be formed,
including 4-6 experienced Turkish foresters and two foreign consultants.
Implementation of the mill project will be directed by the project and gen-
eral manager of the Establishment, who is responsible to an administrative
committee under the chairmanship of the General Manager of SEKA. The project
manager will be assisted by consultants and execution will follow a critical
path schedule. The consultants will have primary responsibility for detailed
design, procurement, and supervision of the construction contractors. Also
within the contract about 20 expatriates will provide operational assistance
and training until about six months after start-up. The studies will be
implemented by the government utilizing foreign consultants.
40.       Role of State Investment Bank (SIB).   The use of SIB as a finan-
cing channel between the Government and The Antalya Mill Establishment for
Bank and EIB lending adds an administrative complication to the project but
serves two useful purposes. First, SIB is the colender of local funds and
therefore can provide a single channel for all loan funds to the Establish-
ment. Second, the experience is helping to establish an initial working rela-
tionship between SIB and the Bank in preparation for industrial credit lending
to SIB being explored for later this year or in early FY75. SIB plans to
strengthen its disbursement operations and will provide separate treatment
for the proceeds of Bank lending in its accounts and reporting. A subsidiary
loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank will be entered into by the Gov-
ernment,, SIB, and SEKA and the Establishment.
41.       Financial Performance.  The forestry part of the project is on a
strong financial footing since wood prices are established at levels well
above direct production costs. Even on the conservative assumption of con-
stant selling prices, the Antalya Forestry Division will have cash deficits



- 14 -
as a result of the project build-up onlv from 1974 through 1976. Thereafter,
a substantial cash surplus is projected, adequate to cover replacement invest-
ments and result in net contributions to Ankara headquarters. In 1972 unit
costs of production were estimated at $18/m3, which compares favorably with
costs in other countries. The incremental financial return of the forestry
part of the project is 24%.
42.       The cost/revenue relationships of the mill enterprise can also be
considered conservative and indicative of the long-term projections. Future
wood supply is based on a long-term contract between SEKA on behalf of the
Establishment and the General Directorate of Forestry. This contract was
discussed with the Bank and EIB and found to be acceptable. Based on the
contract, sawlog prices will be adjusted semi-annually according to average
auction prices. Pulplog prices will be determined by costs; currently they
compare well with pulplog prices in other parts of the world. If future in-
creases in wood prices bring undue hardship to t'he Establishment, it will
seek adjustments. Paper prices are set by SEKA and the Government; the
assumed paper prices were unchanged from mid-1971 until October 1973, when
the linerboard price was increased by 25%. Linerboard and sackkraft prices
in Turkey are higher (about 50% and 5% respectively) than present world
market prices, primarily because of high transfer payments (direct taxes
on inputs alone account for about 25% of the paper price) contained in the
operating costs.
43.       Financial projections are based on the conservative assumption
that the sawmill will start operations in 1976 and the pulp- and papermill
in 1978, allowing for a 4-year construction period for the pulp- and paper-
mill. The initial debt/equity ratio of 60:40 drops slightly during the
first two operating years because of start-up losses but improves rapidly
from 1979 onwards when repaymnents of loans start. The debt service cover-
age would be 1.1 in the first operating year, increasing thereafter and
levelling off at about 1.6 in subsequent years. Given the capital-intensity
of tihe mill, the profit break-even point during the initial years will be at
about 80 percent capacity utilization, decreasing rapidly thereafter.
44.       'ased on the principal price projection, the financial rate of
return of the mill oart of the project is estimated at 15.0% before taxes
and 13.5% after taxes.
Financial Assurances.   During negotiations assurances were obtained
that the G-overnmnent will provide local cost budget allocations and equity
financing, cover the foreign exchange portion of working capital and interest
during construction owed to EIB, provide equity financing as needed to main-
tain the mill's debt-equity ratio at 60-40, and meet any possible project cost
overruns  through completion.   The SIB loan of $32.8 million equivalent in
local financing for the Antalya Establishment will be for 15 years including
5 years' grace and at SIB's normal interest rate of 10-1/2%. The government
has agreed to provide any additional funds necessary to enable the Establish-
ment to have a working capital ratio of 1.3:1 at the completion of the Project.



46.       In order to protect the Establishment from possible unfavorable
relationships between prices set by Government authorities for the Establish-
ment's supplies and those set for its products, and to permit it to maintain
a sound financial condition, satisfactory assurances were obtained from the
Government of its intention to enable the Establishment to operate on a sound
commercial basis. The Establishment is asked to maintain a minimum working
capital ratio of 1.1:1, and the Government has agreed to help iit do so, if
necessary, by making available loans or by other suitable means in consultation
with the Bank. SEKA, as 100% owner of the mill, has agreed not to withdraw
funds from the Establishment if by doing so its working capital ratio would
fall below 1.3:1.
47.       Economic Benefits.   The economic rate of return of the combined
forestry and mill parts of the project is estimated at 14 percent. In ad-
dition, external economies include training and stabilizing a labor force
of about 4,000 in the forestry part and about 850 in the mill part of the
project, and providing a more reliable supply of unfinished wood to 440
small sawmills. Net annual foreign exchange savings resulting from the
project are estimated at about $25 million compared to the total invest-
ment cost of $170.1 million.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement between the Bank, SEKA, and The Antalya Establish-
ment, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for industrial
projects. The draft agreements and the EIB loan document contain coordinated
provisions regarding effectiveness and default.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln No. 568 Keban Transmission Lines Project; US$25.0 Million Loan of October
31, 1968.  Closing Date:  March 29, 1974.   Progress on this project was in-
terrupted for about a year in 1970/71 by a dispute between the Turkish Elec-
tricity Authority (TEK) and the principal contractor concerning payment of
the increased cost of the project, following the devaluation of the Turkish
lira. This matter has been put to arbitration and TEK is now carrying out
construction using its own staff. Subsequently, delays on delivery dates
for project equipment led to the extension of the original closing for the
loan to March 29, 1974. Since the earliest date for power operation (two
units) of the Keban dam is likely to be postponed to 1974-75, the timing for
the completion of the project is acceptable.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 587/143 Second Seyhan Irrigation Project: US$12 million
loan and US$12 million credit of February 20, 1969. Closing Date: June 30,
1975. The project is making satisfactory progress and should be completed
on time. Yields of wheat and seed cotton, the principal crops, reached re-
cord levels in 1971/72. A large part of this success can be attributed to
the efficient working of the project extension service which was set up for
the first time in Turkey to integrate the various extension service activi-
ties in the project area under a full time extension service manager with
sole responsibility for the project. Coordination of irrigation and drain-
age works, on-farm development and the extension service has been achieved
by a project coordinating committee representing the concerned Government
agencies.
Ln. Nos. 589, 713 and 873 TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey):
US$25 million loan of March 12, 1969, US$40 million loan of November 27,
1970 and US$40 million loan of December 28, 1972.   Closing Dates:   April 30,
i974, June 30, 1975 and December 31, 1976 respectively. Since the first
Bank loan was made in 1950, a satisfactory relationship has been developed
with TSKB. These loans when fully disbursed would bring total Bank Group
lending to TSKB to $168 million. The standard of TSKB appraisal work is
consistently high and sub-projects submitted for Bank approval are well
prepared. Progress is being made towards more regionally even distribution
of investments.
Cr. No. 236 First Livestock Project: US$4.5 million credit of February 22,
1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1975. Implementation of this project was
delayed initially by difficulties encountered by the Turkish authorities
in fulfilling some of the effectiveness conditions under the Credit Agree-
ment and by administrative problems in hiring the necessary staff for the
project unit. These delays were largely due to the absence, following a
reorganization of the Turkish Government administration in March 1971, of
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project executions.

an effective coordinating link between the various ministries concerned with
the project and between the Government and the B-ank Group. Steps have been
taken to correct this deficiency and progress on the project is now satis-
factory.
Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$13.5 million loan of June 9, 1971. Closing
Date: September 30, 1976. The execution of the project has progressed slowly,
due to the weakness of the Project Unit and lack of communication between the
Project Unit and the Government. As a result, the project is over a year be-
hind schedule for civil works and five months for equipment procurement. A
recent supervision mission provided assistance in preparing archil:ectural
briefs and has submitted several suggestions to strengthen the Project Unit,
streamline its operations and ensure that specialists' assistance is avail-
able as and when required to expedite its work. Until now no disbursement
applications have been made. A cost overrun of about 30 percent is expected
for civil works for the Management Institute and the six Adult Training Cen-
ters included in the project.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Export Project: US$10 million
loan and US$15 million credit of June 22, 1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
This project was also delayed by difficulties in meeting some of the effec-
tiveness conditions by the due date for tihe reasons noted under Cr. 236 above.
Although it is expected that the project should catch up on the time lost, the
Agricultural Credit Survey, which is included for financing under the project,
will be delayed beyond the forecast date.
Ln. No. 763 TEK Power Transmission Project: US$24 million loan of June 22,
1971. Closing Date: IMarch 31, 1975. Implementation of this project has
been delayed by shortage of staff. First contracts were awarded early in
1972 and work is now progressing according to the revised schedule. Prob-
lems ir meeting the financial covenants are under discussion.
Ln. No 775 Fourth Cukurova Power Project:   US$7 million loan of June 30, 1971.
Closing Date: Mareht 31, 1975.   In part an extension of Ln. 623, this project
is still in thie initial stage.  Major contracts 1have been awarded and work is
proceecin,;, on sc.hedut-e.  Estimated combined foreign exchange cost of the Third
and Fourtth Cukurova projects hais increased by about $1 million principally due
to currency exchange variations.   Cukurova is producing new cost estimates for
i3.:s review.
.r. No. 981 Trrigation Rehabilization Project:   65$18 million credit of
JanuaL    25 '1972.  Cosing Date:  June 30, 1977.   Preparation of specifica-
tion and bidding documents and the respective worK programs of the Government
agencies responsible for project implementation are in hand to enable work to
commence on schedule in 1973. Appointment of consultants for on-farm develop-
ment is taking longer than anticipated but should not hinder progress.
Ln. No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion Project:   US$76 mnillion loan of April 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Project is about 6 months behind
schedule and procurement, after early difficulties due to coordination prob-
lems between Company and its engineers, is now progressing satisfactorily.



ANNEX II

Company has changed project scope somewhat and is now preparing new cost
estimates for review with Bank and other lenders.
Ln. NO. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project: US$37 million loan of June 30,
1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977. This loan was made effective on Jan-
uary 5, 1973 after some delays. Considerable progress has been made in the
selection of the consultants and some of the works are in progress.
Cr. No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development Project: US$2.3 million credit of
June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977. This credit was made effec-
tive on January 5, 1973, following some delays due to the required actions
for effectiveness under Ln. 844, Istanbul Water Supply, to which effective-
ness of this project was linked. There has been considerable progress to-
wards the selection of consultants although implementation will be delayed
slightly due to the complexity of the necessary arrangements.
Ln. No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) Project: US$24 million loan
of June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1976. This project was declared
effective on October 6, 1972. Progress in implementation is close to schedule
sinice the Borrower increased the size of the project with the Bank's agreement.
Cr. No. 330 Second Livestock Project: US$16 million credit of September 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1976. There is delay in setting up the
project's organization mainly because of lack of action by the IMinistry of
Finance on the project's personnel budget submitted to it for approval.
Technical Assistance Project - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK):     US$1.9
million grant of August 20, 1967. Technical assistance contracts were termi-
nated in November-December 1972. Achievement, though short of target in some
respects, is generally satisfactory and TEF, now has a much improved account-
ng, budgeting and financial reporting, system. The consultants' report con-
cerning organization strucrure is under examination bv TEK.
