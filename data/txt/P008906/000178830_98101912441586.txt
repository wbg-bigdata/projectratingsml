PLACE GF ANTALYA PROJECT IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF TURKEY 'S FOREST
Background
Although 'Turkey's forests are amoong the largest in Europe - with
an estimated 19.2 million ha, they are in fourth place after Spain (26.7 million
ha), Sweden (23.4 million ha) and Finland (21.7 million ha) - they continue
to be managed, as they 'have been for the past century, for conservation
rather than production goals. The annual cut of commercial wood from the
Turkish forests in 1970 amounted to 0.22 m3/ha, whereas in Spain, Sweden
ar,d Finland it was 0.3 m3/ha, 2,4 m3/ha and 1.7 m3/ha respectively, even
though growth rates in the Scandinavian countries tend to be lower. 1/
Turkish forestry officials reinforce the conservationist tradition
by administering both the economic and social life of persons living in
forest areas. Reasons why the forest system is reluctant to change its
administration and management are:
- Forest dweller's rights to grazing
- Forest products and material assistance
are guaranteed by law - even, in part,
by the constitution
- Forest dwellers make up over 35% of the
population (some 13 million).
Turkey has 15,000 small, weak and scattered separate forest indus-
try establishments. A few new plants including three pulp and paper plants
use up-to-date technology and produce quality products which meet world
standards. Yet, the mills are too small by world standards and will have
difficulty in meeting foreign competition. Secondly, the new mills lack
positive control over wood supplies.
In order to achieve economies in production costs it has now
become essential to buiLd plants with higher outputs. The average size of
particle board plants establ.ished in Turkey since 1970 has been 14,000 tons
of product capacity while each of the pulip and paper plawnts are of Ness than
100,000 tons of paper and paperboarc6 capac_ty per annunm. .  n. contrasts new
particle board mills ara beinz, built in Europe and iNorth America of 100,000
tons to 250,000 tons per anmim.  Similarly, most new pulp and paper mills
are in the range of 200,000 to 350,000 tons per year.
1 /     m3 Gt wood refers to solid measure uncer bark throughout the report
unless otherzwise noted.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
The small size of forest-based industrial plants is due mainly to:
- A lack of guaranteed raw material supply
- A lack of capital
- A lack of foreign competition
Previously, the high prices of wood in Turkey as compared with world
prices of wood were a major concern. Wood prices were loaded with "'social
c:, )ss" because the Ministry of Forestry had to install infrastructure (roads,
co r,uancations) in non-productive forest areas. This situation is not so
serious today, and wood prices are not burdened with high costs, but prices
rema,in high in view of the strong demand and limited supply (see also
Chapter 8).
The need for change is importantly emphasized in looking at the
mirzor contribution of forestry to the economy. In 1972, the forestty sector
con$ributed about TL 5,700 million or 3.7% to GN'P._J About 20% of the net
value of production was unprocessed, a further 54% was processed and the
rema.nder was converted into paper products. The net values of production
are estimated as follows:

ln the I950's, USA.ID missions begarn identifying the changes necessary
e Antalya forest region and other forestry sectOrs, Jn order to encoar-
age development.  These were substantiated and furthered by UND?/FAO projects
_r. the '6%Cs and the Bank missions in the '70's.

ANNEX 2
Page 3
From 1961 to 1965, the UNDP/FAO "Pre-Investment Survey of the Antalya
Region" included a survey and inventory of the Antalya/Isparta forests. it
identified a forest industrial project capable of producing 50,000 m3 of
sawnwood and 100,000 tons of kraft pulp annually, and recommended a more
rational approach to forest management, clear felling and reforestation.
In 1969, a Finnish firm of forest industrial consuItants .
(Jaako Poyry and Co.) did a pre-Investment study on f"orestry and forest
industries development in the Antalya area.  Based on a given wood susply of
one amiLlion m3 year, the consultants concluded that a feasibility study was
needed on a complex producing 100,000 tons/a of kraft liner, 100,000 tons/'a
of kraft sack and wrapping paper and 150,000 m3/a of sawnwood situated near
Manavgat on the Antalya coast.
Bank Role
The Bank became involved in the Antalya Project first by preparing
detailed worklists for forestry activities whnen the FAO/I3RD cooperative pro-
gram began project preparation work in 1969. This was after completion of
the Poyry feasibility report which was later termed invalid because no de-
tailed worklists were contained in the terms of reference,
Despite follow-up work, several factors preceding 1969, a main
one being major organizational changes going on in SEKA and the Ministry of
Forestry, were detrimental to any progress in forestry work.
- The Ministry of Forestry saw no need for the
work (but assurances for only 600,000 m3/yr
were given)
-  SEKA felt Poyry study was sufficient
- Lack of coordination as observed by two
Bank missions in 1971, who came in response
to Government requests for Bank financing.
The second Bank mission revealed past errors and was the pivot
upon which a fresh, realistic approach was made. To help solve one of the
largest problems, lack of coordination, a Turkish Project Preparation Team
comprised of staff seconded from both SEKA and the Ministry of Forestry
was set up to rework the feasibility study, with the widest terms of refer-
ence. The insistence was that the 'Turkish Team be solidly backed up by a
team of foreign experts from a company well reputed for its work in inte-
grated forest utilization projects. An initial resistance was turned into
enthusiasm when the Turkish Team went to W.iqshington to discuss its terms of
reference and then visited modern forestry operations in British Columbia,
It was made clear how obsolete Turkey's systems were.



AUTNEX 2
Page 4
The Teamn persuaded the Government to apply for UNDP financing for
the consultants and insisted that the Bank be the executing agency.  By
ciexplanation of the role of the new study, especially by showing the
-.ee of- ±e:al of its terms of reference, tTNDP and FAO changed from re-
faSe to enthusiastic support.  As a result, high level technical staff
L<r5rz Don a8ncies have beer. closely inivolved, and givern valuable advice,
as a." stages of the study.
Lnvitaziona to suin:lt proposals were sent to four major cons-alting
c<vpan'es ~n YMovember 1971  and by April 1972, Sandwell and Company of Van-
CoUVe-r  Canada had been appointed and its field team was in operation.
rLn the ter-ms of reference, careful attention was paid to the
administration of the study as well as ensuring that all technical and economic
areas were covered.  Three review meet4.ngs during the work. assured agreement of
the Government and the Bank at each major stage at which techno-economie para-
ieters would be identified and fixed.
The procedure worked very well, the result being that the project
is now thoroughly prepared and underway. At the same time, a major change
in institutional framework is being introduced - gently but firmly - to
ensure that SEKA and the Ministry of Forestry are jointly cooperating in
necessary activities at least at the working level.
Definition of Project Parameters
The investigations of the technical and economical. parameters of
the project proceeded on three parallel paths.
1.   The forest resource and inventory was thoroughly
researched to find what size and type of industry
it could support.
2.   The market needs were studied to find the national
needs and the place for the products that could be
made from the forest.
3.   The existing infrastructure and cost levels were
found to get a feel for the type, size and loca-
tion of industrial plants.
Durirg the first review meeting, the bas_c alterratives of wood
supply for new industrZai use were agreed upon and defined as follows:



AININ EX 2
Page 5
Case I
The wood supply would consist of the Annual Allowable Cut 1/ (AAC) from
Antalya plus additional wood from Isparta, with all the present sales of
wood both within Antalya and out of Antalya to be continued at the present
level.
Case II
The Antalya region wood supply would be the same as Case T but statutory
sales of wood would be allowed.
Case III
The wood supply, sawdust plus supplemental wood chips would be the same as
Case II and could come from new sawmills planned for the Adana/Mersin area.
Some 200,000 m3/yr of pVlpable fibre was estimated to be available from this
source.
Case IV
The wood supply would be the same as Case III reduced by allowing present
sales of wood within the Antalya region to continue. Export of wood from
the region would be discontinued.
In all the above mentioned cases, the statutory suppl y of wood to
forest villagers would be provided. For each case the log production was
based on an AAC for-Antalya of 710,000 m3/yr. The volume of logs produced
in each case was as follows:

Case IV re;,oresents the most reasonable approach to wood supplies
$or zihe project but even Case I - the minimum wood supply for new industrial
s- and Case III - the maximum - were retained for further comparative
D½oate over the AAC showed assumptions were conse-uvari-ve but were
a_. -hat Sanlwdel' and tae Ministry of Forestry could stand behind profession-
a~;y,y  The main limit to a higher estimate was Lack of adequate yield and
*,*row   daata, vicihch meant a more conservative than usual estimate of future
yields from newly foresced areas.  However, one opinion was that thre AC  could
be as much as the I million m3/yr used by Poyry, but that such a figure could
not be con:f1imed for at least 10 - 15 years when data from sample plots would
be avaUabe,  For industrial planning purposes tne lower figure of some
710,000 m3/yr should be used.
In the meantime, products to De produced from Antalya were quickly
narrowed to unbleached kraft paper products and sawn lumber.  Bleached paper
and newsprint were well planned for in existing or plarnned SEKA plants,
wnereas a shortfall for kraft papers like linerboard and sackkraft would
eventuate if capacity was not introduced soon. Plywood was not considered
sinrce there are practically no peeler logs in the Antalya inventory.  Particle
board wa:s omitted because there was already sufficient capacity instalied
or planne& and because there are technical difficulties producing it fromn
Pinus Brutia.
Knoowledge of the conversion for log to pulp or sawnlumber was suffi-
ciently developed to enable rough estimates to be made of the production rate
for the identified market products as follows:

I-L.L       69(0,000        203,000         135,000   or 110,000          345,00i.
-V          590,000         200,000         122,000   or 1,0 O          295,000
Eight dift e ez: 3Ia-nt sites had been. i.dentified (see deta'is in
CGap>ser 6) and the review meetings decided that detailed comparative analyses
shoau'd be done on the four basic cases a'±lowing for the following additional
varzazioh-s:



A NNEX 2
Page 7
(a) Different plant locations, including the possibility
of separating the sawmill from the pulp and paper mill.
(b)  Reducing the saw mill output to increase the pulp
plant size.
(c)  If no pulp mill is feasible, to consider the export
of chips from Antalya to an existing SEKA mill.
Costs and benefits would be developed and financial and economic
rates of return for eachn case would be calculated with comparative accuracy.
On this basis, the next review meeting hoped to decide on the one case out
of Sandwell's 29 meriting detailed studies as THE Project.
The two main choices for plant site narrowed to Manavgat and Antalya.
There were considerable problems with water suppliy at the latter but it was
considered for comparative purposes if nothing else. The possibility of one
or more smaller sawmills remote from the central mill was also considered.
Comparative estimates for production, costs, income and rates o&
return are shown in Table 2 on rough basis> but are accurate enough for inter-
case comparison. The results were differentiated enough to guide the final
choice of the "best case". They showed that:
Integrated sawmill/pulp and paper mills were
financially and economically viable.
= Sawmills with chip production were not financially
viable although by a Quirk of the present system
of price levels in Turkey showed extraordinary high
economic returns. 1/
= There was not much economic or financial difference
between cases where all activities were centralized
and those with remote sawmills, nor between plants
in Antalya or Manavgat. On the other hand, there
were clear technical and administrative reasons for
locating at Manavgar and for centralizing all
activities.
-  The grea_er the volume of wood processed the better
the return.
} X   Th.e anomaly is due to the fact that sawn lumber is priced generally at
about world muarket prices, Wnile paper has about twice the world market
price.  A saw miliL would only have a financial income equal to its eco-
naom-c income, but mts fica cial costs aere much higher than its economic
sot because of high tax levels in cost inputs.

The meeting was therefore able to outline the final case as follows:
- The Case IV wood supply would be used to maximize
production level but not to eliminate present wood
sales in the Antalya region.
-  The Manavgat site, with centralized facilities, was
chosen but a comparison of equal accuracy would be
made in moving to an inland site at Manavgat.
Two products situations would be studied - the first
with linerboard the only paper product and the second
with 1/3 of the paper production as sackkraft. In both
cases lumber would also be produced.
As work on the final case progressed, Sandwell and SEKA dug into the
finer details of market demand and wood availability and soon uncovered that
undue emphasis was placed on linerboard and lumber production. Sackkraft, they
found, would be in heavy demand in the near future, a-nd the expansion of Cay-
cuma would not be started for sometime. Moreover, the sawmill capacity was
enormous - nearly eight times bigger than the then biggest sawmill in Turkey.
SEKA felt the mill's paper capacity should therefore be increased, its lumber
capacity decreased, and adequate supplies of sackkraft should be made available.
At this time, one further complication crept in as doubts began
to mount over the viability of SEKA's bleached pulp project at Balikesir.
Severe criticism by the UNDP/FAO team forced a re-examination of thrie project
and showed that - besides a number of other detrimental factors - there would
be almost unsurmountable difficulties in effluent disposal to modern standards.
If the Balikesir mill could produce unbleached products the problem would not
be so severe. In this case, the Antalya mill should be switched to bleached
grades. They decided to examine this possibility. SEKA commissioned Sandwell
independently of the UNDP/IBRD project to produce comparative profitability
figures for bleached versus unbleached production at Antalya.
Sandwell undertook the assignment but pointed out that they could
not vouch for the production levels set by SEKA for the bleached case (which
would produce pulp as well as paper). The key result of the comparison is
given in Table 3.

The results show there is little to choose between the bleached
and unbleached cases, on the basis of profitability. There are, however,
overwhelming arguments that disfavor the bleached case:
-  The Antalya project would be delayed by up to one
year while thorough market studies on bleached
pulp and paper were made.
- The source of short fibre furnish was also
assessed (SEKA had said the reed and straw mill
proposed for Afyon would be used) and the source
of new unbleached capacity was defined.
- It was by no means sure these two latter points
would be satisfactorily settled.
- A bleached mill in Antalya would have a more serious
effluent disposal problem than an unbleached mill
and might not be compatible with proposed tourism
development.
For these and other reasons, the bleached case was therefore dropped
for Antalya. Bleached products would still be needed of course and their
source of supply will be studied in a major study of the Marmara region 'see
Annex 6).  In the meantime, an Antalya, attention was focused on the
production levels for a plant producing lumber, sackkraft and linerboard.
First, the sawmill capacity was set to process some 300,000 m 3/yr
of logs using only the best sawlogs (minimum 20 cm top diameter), thereby
getting a higher recovery (and higher profit) than if all sawlogs were used.
It would also reduce investment cost but not preclude the possibility of 3an
expansion later if more wood becomes available. A capacity of 182,000 m /yr
of lumber production appeared the most suitable.
Next, the linerboard and sackkraft capacities were set to satisfy
the following criteria:
- The wood available to the project should
be fully utilized.
-  The paper would be produced by alternate
runs on a single paper machine.
The two criteria showed that running on linerboard only, the mill
could produce 155,000 TPA, and on sackkraft only 90,000 TPA. Production
schedules were then established, aimed rirst at satisfying the more urgent
demand for sackkraft. However, once linerboard was produced, in no subse-
quent year would the production be less than in a former year (i.e., con-
vertors who set themselves up would be assured of supplies).

The production plan shows that additional sackkraft capacity would
be needed in the nation by 1986. It should be realized, however, that pla7ns
of this nature can only be indicative and that new facts are always arising.
For instance, the nation is not forced to install new sackkraft capacity in
1986 - then it might find it more convenient and economical to invest in
facilities fcr bulk handling of cement thus actually leveling or even de-
creasing sackkraft demand (it is indeed recommended that this alternative
be seriously studied).
The key point is that with a multipurpose paper machine "With back-
up pulp-making facilities), the Antalya mill will be able to handle most
situations that develop.  It will certa-ialy give enough capacity for the next
8 years so that proper planning o$f  uture capacity for unbleached kraZt papers
can be done.
On this basis, the Sandwel proposals for plant capacity, product
type, production schedule and general plant type were accepted and approved
at the final major policy review meeting, which included Government repre-
sentatives at the end of the study in January 1973.  It is on these proposals
too - with minor revisions - that this appraisal report is based.

INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND
The two operating institutions in the forestry sector are the
Turkish State Pulp and Paper Enterprise (Seluloz ve Ka-it - SEKA) and the
Ministry of Forestry. In this Chapter the two institutions are described
in detail and conclusions are drawn on how they will be affected by the
Antalya Project. A change in their usual method of coordination is also
described.
A.   Ministry of Forestry
History and Organization
Forestry is an old, established sector of the Turkish economy. In
1868, a decree was promulgated to ensure conservation of the forests. Villagers
had, for generations, cut wood in the communal forests to cover their needs,
but toward the end of the Ottoman Empire the control of the State over its
forestry waned. This led to excessive cutting and grazing and a general
degeneration of the country's forest resources. In 1937, the Forestry Depart-
ment was charged with control of the felling and marketing of logs. In 1944,
all privately owned forest land in excess of 5 ha was nationalized. In
1956, the law was modified to include all forested land in excess of 3 ha.
To compensate the forest villagers for this loss of income, the law obliged
the state to provide them with their needs in fuelwood and industrial wood
at 1/10 of the auction "reserve prices".
The Government established a General Directorate of Forestry in
1957 under the Ministry of Agriculture which was charged with: (a) the
preservation of the national forests; (b) increasing yields through manage-
ment and development; (c) planting trees; and (d) educating personnel.
In 1969, forest administration was transferred to a new Ministry
of Forests with four general Directorates:
(a) Forestry;
(b) Erosion Control and Reforestation;
(c) Forest Villages; and
(d) Forest Products and Industries.
The General Directorate of Forestry (GDF) with over 27,000 permanent
employees is one of the largest Government agencies and is responsible for all
forestry operations and for financing. Its headquarters consist of 26 depart-



ANNEX 3
Page 2
men-s grouped into seven divisions. A majority of the Ministry's staff is
,ioyed in the field.  Administration, however, is highly centralized, and
p- rcticaily all decisions are made in Ankara.
In mountainous, remote areas, the district forester is often the
goverm=ent officer in touch with the people.  Sections, groups or
eSvresantatives of other general directorates may also be located in the
reonl.  ^,The senior representative maintains close liaison with regional
Oczf:icials 'ut he reports to his respective office in Ankara.
The MF employs over 1,500 forest officers.  Over 700 of these are
C raduates of the Forestry Faculty of Istanbul University. Nearly 100 have
post-graduate degrees from overseas universities. The junior professional
officers are graduates of the Turkish Forest Training Schools. A large
proportion of staff have considerable professional competence, but training
is often outdated. The service is well provisioned with officers and office
staff as well as with staff housing. Lack of vehicles is a constraint to the
operational efficiency of field staff.
For administrative purposes, Turkey is divided into 24 forest
Regions (basmudurluk). Each of these is divided into Divisions (isletme)
and Ranger Districts (bolge). There are 183 of the former and 1,178 of
the latter. Each "bolge" is subdivided into several "Iseries`, each with
an area between 3,000 and 6,000 ha. These are the basic units of manage-
ment of the Turkish Forests.
There is also a Forest Research Institute in Ankara and a Poplar
Research Institute in lzmit, as well as field stations.
Region
The headquarters of a typical region like Antalya comprises the
following sections:
Accounting                          Roads
Personnel                           Legal
Production Coordination             Forest Production
Maintenance Workshops               Research and Pathology
Training                            Forest Management
In. addition to a research station, representatives of the GD of
Forest VilLage Relations and a group of the GD of Afforestation and Erosion
Control are located in Antalya. A MF state box plant is also located in
zha region.
The region -Is subdivided into 14 divisions. The divisions are
further divzced into 75 districts.  Two of the divisions are small in area,
-Itensively managed and intended to act as pilot areas.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Division Organization
The Division is the responsible administrative unit for all routine
forest operations. All direct accounting, production, silviculture, road
construction and maintenance, forest protection, reforestation and other
work is directly controlled by division staff.  The division staff includes
accounting, forestry, log depot and supervisory groups.  1gletme offices
are located in subprovince towns which usually have reasonable facilities.
Planning, equipment repair, insect and pathology protectioa and road en-
gineering are not normally included in the isletme activities.
District Organization
Each isletme has several bolge or ranger districts supervised by
resident forest rangers who are responsible for all routine silviculture,
protection and production activities within their area. Forest guards
and a bolge clerk comprise the bolge staff. Bolge offices are located
in forest villages, where often community facilities are minimal.
Planning
The GDF's Forest Management branch's basic planning of all forest
activities at 10 year intervals is done in Ankara. Other similar plans
are developed by relevant GDF divisions.
After annual targets are provided by the GDF, the basmudurluk and
isletme staff prepare budgets for the work required to implement the plans
and achieve production objectives.  These are subjected for approval to
the GDF in Ankara. Activities requiring subsidization must be consolidated
on a national level. Each isletme is then responsible for achieving budget
objectives.
In essence, the two plans which now control all regional and isletme
activities are the 10-year Forest Management Plans and the Annual Budgets.
Supplementary road development and equipment maintenance planning are done
by the GDF headquarters. Annual detailed plans are done Dy the regional
staff according to directions from the GDF.
Forest Management
Until 1963, forests wAere arnge  or a district basis.  Selection
felling was applied to all species, and yiJ,~ds were based on rotations
varying between 100 and 200 years.  In 1963, a new management planning phase
was initiated. The new system is based on sustaining production on saall
un4ts (or series) of 3,Ou  - 5,000 haa.  1ong rotations (8C - 150 years) are
still used for yield calculations although 70% of the forest is already



ANNEX 3
Page 4
m'atu-ei or overmature, and the annual increment is negligible. Fifty percent
.1'U tI'se yield still derives from thinnings and selection felling. For the
Z.1 n.al cut a strip-shelter wood system is used. The system is expensive and
w.  neer harvest the overmature stock.  Natural regeneration is rarely
-ueeesfaul and eventually replanting has to be done after expensive removal
o-'~ iaGligL> £eacies.
Consu7zants aud international agencies have, for some t±ne, re-
com;iaen.zde  -naz -mature and overmature growing stock should be liquidated
ove- a period of say 50 years; that clear felling where appropriate be
pr-acticed; that management be reorganized on a isletme basis; and that cut
over areas be replanted iumediately.  The MF favor this approach in the
A.ntalya basmutdurluk (see aLso Annex 4) and has indicated that these measures,
if- shon to be appropriate, will be adopted in other basmudurluks.
Forest Industries Controlled by MF
Of t1he 5,200 sawmills in Turkey, 14 owned by the State and operated
by the MF, are larger than nonmal units.
The 14 State operated sawmills, mostly around the Black Sea area,
accounted for about 7% of the total output of sawnwood in 1968 and employed
about 3,000 workers. All but one of the sawmills operate only one shift and
consequently have a low lumber yield. Most are medium sized (log input
capacities of between 10,000 and 40,000 m3per year). One has a log capacity
of 80,000 m3.  The oldest of these mills was erected in 1940 and the most
modern in 1957. Three have already been modernized and converted from gang
mills to band mills with modern drying kilns; another three are in the process
of being modernized. Once modernization is completed, the capacity of log
input per shift will increase from 259,000 m3 to 460,000 m3.
None of the sawmills are integrated with other forest industries
to permit rational utilization of sawmill waste. The annual productivity
per man in the State sawmills is only about 62 m3.  A normal figure for
modern banddmills should be in excess 3of 100 m3;  the corresponding figure
for modern gang mills is about 170 m .
Here are some reasons for low productivity in the State Mills.
- Poor quality of raw material (mills sometimes get
auctiron logs which cn did not fetch the reserve price)
- Excess staff and labor
- High turnover of managers and technicians



ANNEX 3
Page 5
The State sawmills' production is marketed through auctions at
which quantities that average 1,000 m3 are sold in lots of about 50 to
100 m3. In spite of a somewhat cumbersome administrative procedure, the
output Is easily sold. This is because of stricter quality control than in
the small private mills and air drying of sawnwood for longer periods.
Production
During the first and second of the Governments' five year pians,
production and sales of industrial roundwood rose from a level of Just
over 1 million m3 in 1961 to 5.6 million m3 in 1972. During the same period,
fuelwood production is astimated to have r'.se.n from 8 million to 10 million m3.
Total production increased annually by 7% between 1963 and 1967 and 5.3%
between 1968 and 1972. The Government's projections for the third five year
plan anticipate a growth in domestic demand for industrial roundwood of 6.6%
annually and a slight fall in the demand for fuelwood. The forecasted
national requirements are as follows:
1977       1982       1978       1995
--millions of m;--
Industrial roundwood              10.1        14.1       18.3       28.0
Fuelwood                            9.1        8.4        7.8        6.9
Total              19.2       22.5       26.1       34.9 1/
The Annual Allowable sut of industrial roundwood in 1982 is expected
to be in excess of 14 million m  or over twice the present cut.  Since fuel-
wood consumption already exceeds the level permitted by the Ministry of Forests'
current management plans and since the projected requirements of industrial
roundwood are greater than the net Allowable Annual Cut of 9 million m3 by
1977, urgent consideration must be given to the adoption of more productive
forest management systems and a speeding up of the afforestation program.
Budget and Finance
The budget and financial arrangements for the activities within the
Ministry of Forests can be divided into three categories, the Ministry of
Forests budget, the "Annex Budget" and the "'Revolving Fund". Considering
all three budgets together, of which the Revolving Fund is by far the
largest, the Ministry of Forests has been contributing to the national bud-
get in the past years, particularly in the formx of corporation taxes and pay-
ments to the export fund.  The budget amournts for these contributions have
been as follows (actual amounts in 1972 and 1973 are expected to be much
higher):
1/   This would imply a yield of some 1.8 r3/'ha from the present forested
area - i.e., about the same as the present yield in Finland.

1971      129
1972      124
1973      227
These amounts represent net contributions except in 1972 and 1973
when small allocations from the national budget have taken place (1972:  TL
3 million; 1973: TL 20 million) to cover the relatively unimportant budget
of the Ministry of Forests itself, which was separated from the Ministry of
Agriculture in 1971.
In addition to the payments of these taxes, the Ministry of Forests
operations have generated sufficient funds for investment expenditures of
about TL 400 million in 1972 and TL 500 million in 1973; however, part of
these investments are of a maintenance character (reforestation, road mainte-
nance, nursery). Additionally, almost TL 600 million equity have been accumu-
lated in the past 30 years. The Ministry of Forests also prepares financial
statements; comparable to corporations. The last available, 1970, shows a
net profit after taxes of TL 137 million which substantially exceeds the bud-
geted cash surplus for that year.  Given the strong cash generation, MF
has presently no outstanding loan obligations. A foreign loan from the Export-
Import Bank which was granted in earlier years has been repaid.
Foreign loans passed on by the Ministry of Finance are shown in
the Revolving Fund as income when they are taken down and the respective in-
vestments are included in the investment expenditures. Interest payments
and repayments of the loan are shown in the Revolving Fund as expenditures.
In the financial statements, outstanding loan amounts are shown as liabilities
and interest payments as expenses.
The three different budgets within the Ministry of Forests and its
financial statements have been summarized as well as presented in detail
below:
(a)  Ministry of Forests - The budget of the Ministry of Forestry
itself. Due to the set-up of organizations this budget is
relatively unimportant because it covers just the personnel
costs of the ministry itself. fn 1973 the budget amounts to
TL 20 million which is covered through the national budget.
(b)  Annex Budget - The Annex Budget provides for forest activities
which are of general and national nature and therefore not directly
allocable to the forest operations of an individual forestry
district. However, it is financed through the forest operations
of the various districts. The General Directorate of Forests
is in charge of the Annex Budget activities.



ALNMX 3
Page 7
(c) Revolving Fund - All forest activities related to production
are covered in the Revolving Fund. Therefore, it is by far
the largest budget within the Ministry of Forests. The
General Directorate of Forests is also in charge of the overall
coordination of the revolving fund whereby detailed execution
of the Revolving Fund activities takes place in the individual
Forestry Districts.
A detailed break-down of the different budgets is given below.
1.   Ministr): of Forests
The separate Ministry of Forests budget has only been established in
1971. Before that it vias part of the Ministry of Agriculture budget and no
separate amounts were specified. The budget of the Ministry of Forestry it-
self is relatively unimportant; it amounted to TL 3 million in 1972 and
TL 20 million in 1973. The budget is part of the overa'Ll Government budget
and has to be approved by the Parliament. Tne increase of the budget in 1973
is due to some shifting from expenditures from the Anriex Budget to the
Ministry of Forests Budget.
2.   Annex Budget
The Armex Budget provides for activities which are of a general
nature and not directly allocable to forest operations of an individual
forestry district. It has been financed from surpluses of the forestry
operations which are covered under the Revolving Fund. The annual amounts
of the Amex Budget and the contribution components from the RL-volving Fund
are shown below:

The total revenues and expenditures shown above do not exactly correspond
because the fiscal years for the Annex Budget and the Revolving Fund differ.
The FY for revenues originating from Revolving Fund is December 31 and for
the expenditures from Annex Budget it is March 31. However, in the past
any deficit in the Annex Budget has been covered by the Revolving Fund.

The Annex Budget is prepared by the GDF Annex Budget Division.  In-
vestments are coordinated with SPO. Then it is passed on to the Ministry
of Finance and submitted to the Parliament for final approval.
3.   Revolving Fund
All activities directly related to forestry operations are covered
by the Revolving Fund. The estimates for the annual budget are prepared by
the GDF Revolving Fund Budget Commission in close cooperation with the
operational units (Isletme, Basmudurluk, Bolge). Thereafter the estimates
are reviewed by the Technical Board of GDF and then it is passed on to the
Ministry of Forests for final approval.  Though the revolving fund activities
are prepared in a budget form, retroactively, consolidated profit and loss as
well as balance sheet statements , comparab-le to industrial companies are
prepared. For purposes of comparison, subsequently the budget figures have
been used;  the last available actual figures in the form of financial state-
ments for 1970 are presented thereafter.  Tn these statements, for example,
some of the investments are capitalized.
The budgeted revenues of the RF and its composition are shown as
follows:

AMbout 50% of the fuelwood is sold to people Living in forest
villages at an average and nominal price of TL 0.20/stere ex forest.  This
is a legal obligation and the annual limit for a family of 6 persons are 6
steres. The remaining portion of the fuelwood has been sold at about
TL 37/stere in 1972.
Also about 500,000 m3 roundwood is sold to villagers at an average
price of TL 83/m3 ex depot.

The stumpage fee is fully transfered to the Annex Budget.  The Corporation
Tax amounts to 35% and is based on the expected taxable income; it is paid
to the Ministry of Finance. Payments to the national export fund of 6% of
the sales have to be made; fuelwood sales and sales to SEKA are excluded.
Recently, the rate has been reduced to 3%. The difference shown above is
a budgeted difference. As mentioned above, actual figures are also prepared
on a profit and loss basis and show a net profit of TL 137 million for 1970.
Any deficits or surpluses of the RF budget are covered or added to
the accumulated equity of the RF which amounted at December 31, 1970 to almost
600 million TL (see balance sheet on next page).

The MY too is in a period of transition as it passes from being
an nstitiution dominated by the goal of preserving the forest estate to one
p-3esed on all sides to increase the availability of woods It is perhaps better
D r,are tjiaL SEKA to face the transition -roam the viewpoint of good technical
lacilities (forest infrastructure) and good technical staff dispersed throughout
t.-,e nation.
It is however hampered by conservative staff in the administrative
anid policy-making positions not yet attuned to the needed changes.  Moreover,
ts..e wtidespread influence of the MP, and the political sensitivities raised
whe-, change (any change) is mentioned, inhibits the MF staff even more.
New directions have again, as in the case of SEKA, been introduced
i- the Antalya Project (see below) which should augur well for future long term
improvements as long as they are firmly applied and reinforced as the project
is implemented.
B.   SEKA
History and Organization
SEFA was established in 1934 with its plant and head office in
Izmit. It is organized as a State Economic Enterprise under Law 440. SEKA
is -ully Government owned with an authorized share capital of TL 1 billion
of which about TL 500 million are paid in. At present, SEKA is the only
major pulp and paper producer in Turkey with a total pulping capacity of
about 325,000 tons per year. Until the mid '60's, Izmit was the only SEKA
plant and it produced various kinds of pulp, paper and chemicals based on
wood and straw and principal raw materials. At that time three additional
plants (Caycuma, Aksu and Dalaman) were built and SEKA is considering
three new projects - Antaiya, Balikesir and Afyon).  The plants, the products
they produce, their capacity, raw materials and staffing are given in Table 5.
Comments on Facilities
The Izmit Plant has considerable obsolete and inefficient equipment.
Its total capacity is i20,00O t/yr of paper and it has 12 paper machines since
the pl-ant produces a wide variety of papers and different machines are neces-
sary.  The paper making equipment is generally in good mechanical and operating
condition.  'I'ere is no reason to suggest that it should all be scrapped.
T'he pulp making equipment is obsolete and produces harmful liquid and gaseous
effluents,



ANNEX 3
Page 15
The plant was built when Iznit was small. Now the plant is in a
booming industrial center. Its degrading effect on the environment must
therefore be a big factor in considering changes in the facilities.
The three modern mills of SEKA, undersized by modern standards,
have efficient and technically up-to-date equipment. The Caycuma and
Dalaman mills, however, are badly situated with respect to available raw
material and product type.
Caycuma produces industrial papers such as sackkraft and linerboard,
yet it is located in a forest region (basmudurluk) of hardwoods (good for
writing paper). Dalaman which produces printing and writing paper has forest
resources of pine that are better suited to the industrial papers produced
at Caycuma. This anomaly must be taken as a fait accompli and future ex-
pansions or modifications to these plants must try to ameliorate the situation
as much as possible.

Caycuma and Aksu have reached design capacity and efficiency.
Dalman started in 1972 and is experiencing technical difficulties due to poor
equipment performance. SEKA feels it will overcome this within the next 12
to 24 months. In the meantime Dalaman will reach at least 40% of the capa-
city.
The Balikesir project has been temporarily shelved as discussed in
Annex 2.  Its role will be assessed in the future studies and is also
discussed in detail in Annex 6.
The Afyon project is to produce bleached pulp from reeds. It does
not appear to be a sound pulp making idea, given the availability of wood in
Turkey. There are social problems in the Afyon area, due to the political
decision to stop poppy growing and a program of alternative employment is
connected with the Government's plan for the region - thus the reluctance to
accept criticism for the Afyon project in contrast to the Balikesir project.
Further into the future, SEKA realizes that it will have other
major projects (some are discussed in Annex 6), and it would not be
surprising if investments of $500 million or more were needed in the next
decade.
SEKA Management and Staff
SEKA's six-member Board has one representative from the Ministry
of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Technology and Labor. It also has
three members of SEKA's top management. The Board functions as a policy-
making and controlling body as well as a liaison and coordinating group
between SEKA and the Government. The influence of GOT on finance and ex-
pansion planning is felt strongly in the Company's management. The Organiza-
tion Chart is given in Figure 1.
The Managing Director and Chairman of the Board has been Aziz Gumus.
He has had extensive managerial experience and is effectively managing the
company's operations. The other members are:
Ibrahim Aldemir           Assistant Manager (Administrative)
Nahit Avci                Assistant Manager (Technical)
Hicri Sezen               Representative of Ministry of Finance
Hilmi Onat                Representative of Ministry of Industry and
Technology
Halit Cansever            Representative of Laborers.
As a State Economic Enterprise, SEKA's salaries are equal to civil
service salaries based on the Personnel Law.

It is difficult for industrial enterprises in the public sector to
attract or to retain capable and trained staff, particularly in middle and
upper management. Considering these difficulties and the substantial ex-
pansion program SEKA has been undertaking since 1965, has strained SEKA's
resources, particularly in the middle management level, and has resulted in
frequent changes in positions. Changes in the restrictive Personnel Law
to enable State Economic Enterprises to determine compensation for middle
and upper management on a competitive basis would be highly desirable, parti-
cularly for rapidly expanding enterprises such as SEKA. It is well recognized
that such a change would have wide implications on the Turkish economy which
would have to be considered.
SEKA employs about 9,000 people. This is high, even taking into
account this figure includes operating personnel and ancillary employment
for Company-operated schools, hospitals and townships. Quality and quantity
of staff will play an ever increasing role in SEKA's future.
Financial Analysis of SEKA - Past and Future
Historical and projected financial statements have been prepared
by SEKA through 1978 which is the starting date of commercial production
of the proposed project. Due to the differences in accounting systems these
statements had to be revised.
Operations and Income Statements
Income Statements are shown in detail in Tables 6,7, and 8. They
indicate that while SEKA was only operating the almost fully depreciated
plant at Izmit, it obtained reasonable levels of profit reaching TL 117 million
before taxes in 1969. SEKA's past earnings to 1972 were also to a large
extent the result of duty free imported paper sold at domestic market prices.
After many delays and cost overruns, Caycuma and Aksu are expected
to reach full capacity utilization this year. The large Dalaman plant with
its major operating problems has an expected capacity utilization of about
50% in its second year of operation. In 1972, Dalaman lost about TL 180
million which more than offset the earnings of TL 143 million at Izmit. In
1972 on a consolidated basis, SEKA lost TL 53 million before and TL 96
million after taxes since according to Turkish tax laws, earnings and losses
cannot be consolidated for tax purposes since each establishment is considered
as a different legal and fiscal entity.
In the current year some improvement in operations is expected in
most of SEKA's plants but Dalaman as the most important plant will probably
not show substantial improvement until 1974. Once the operating difficulties
at Dalaman have been overcome, SEKA's financial performance should improve
rapidly to a satisfactory level.

1/  Since revised forecasted income statements have not been received, only abbreviated cash flow statements
are presented.   For this purpose income in 1973 and 1974 has been adjusted to reflect the further 1 year
delay in satisfactory performance of the Dalaman plant.   Net Income before Taxes in 1973 has been assumed 0,
reflecting some improvement as compared to 1972 (see production forecast table);  1974 income figures

ANNEX 3
Page 22
Financial Situation
As for most of the enterprises in Turkey, SEKA's equity portion
is small (see Balance Sheet - Table 8). As of year end 1971, the debt/
equity ratio amounted to 75:25 after a substantial increase in equity in
1971. Half of the long-term debt of about TL 1,800 million originated
from the State Investment Bank and the other half from foreign sources.
For the Caycuma and Dalaman projects, most of the foreign loans were granted
by the European Investment Bank. The current ratio of SEKA has been about
1.1:1 during the past years. The debt/service coverage (including taxes on
income) was low in 1972 and will be low for the next two years mainly
as a result of the operating difficulties of the new plants.
SEKA's financial situation although less than satisfactory is
considered acceptable for a Bank operation, given the Government ownership
and its influence in investments and operations, as well as the established
financing mechanism through SIB.
Conclusion
SEKA is in a period of transition. From being a one plant, over-
staffed organization with inefficient and obsolete equipment, it has moved
rapidly into the modern -era with its three new plants. They all have their
difficulties some of which, like size and location, are there to stay. Now
SEKA faces a future where capacity expansion will be the order of the day.
Its resources will be stretched to the utmost. Experienced staff
who are willing to move to new locations will be hard to find at the low
salary levels. The limited financial resources will mean constant inter-
vention by the owner - the State.
Clearly SEKA will need major modifications of its systems and
organization to deal with its new situation. The attraction of good personnel
will remain a chronic difficulty until the salary structure is changed. While
this will not be tackled specifically, it is expected that new directions will
be introduced by the Antalya Project (see Chapter 11) but they will only be
the start of what will have to be a constant renewal effort.

C.   Organization of the Sawmill Industry
About 90% of the domestic market needs are met by private sector
mills and the balance of State mills operated by the Ministry of Forestry.
Sawnwood production facilities in the private sector are usually
owned and operated by family concerns. There are over 5,000 private sawmills
with a productive capacity of about six million m3/A of roundwood. This repre-
sents an average mill size of about 1,200 m3/A, with only two mills having a
capacity exceeding 20,000 m3 per year.
Most of the private sector mills are of unsophisticated design and
their operations are housed in buildings of light and cheap construction
usually with dirt floors, open sides and poor lighting. The principal equip-
ment component is a band headsaw of small capacity.  The carriage on which
the log is fed to the saw is usually manually operated including the energy
needed to feed the log to the saw. A simple resaw is the second item of equip-
ment used to trim and resaw cants to boards and dimension stock as required.
Prices for equipment are relatively low, and investment of 50,000 to 100,000 TL
would be required to equip a small mill of 5,000 m3 annual roundwood input.
The private sector wood industries are generally located near
centers of consumption, e.g., Ankara and Istanbul, whereas in developed
countries this is not usually the case. Economic justification for this
is that there is high value in wood by-products (sawdust for fuel, sawlogs
trimmed on 3 sides and used for squatter housing, fences, etc.)
Private sawmills purchase logs at public auctiois held at receiving
depots. The Ministry of Forestry sets a minimum bid price. In addition to
the bid price, the successful buyer must pay the various State, Provincial
and local taxes which amount to 24% of the purchase price.
Small private sawmills are labor intensive because of high costs
of equipment and logs. Recovery rates, volume of lumber sold in relation to
volume to logs purchased, were reported to be in the order of a perhaps
overstated high of 70 to 75%. In general, sawnwood quality in public sector
mills is above the private sector. Average prices received are higher. Re-
coveries are lower, about 65% versus the 70-75% figure for the private
sector. This is attributable to the full dimension cutting practices and
a greater concentration on grade.
Manufacturing costs in public mills are estimated at two to three
times higher than in the private sector. This is due to:



AbNNEX 3
Page 26
- nominal recovery rates
- higher wage scales
- higher overhead costs
Parts of these costs are recovered in higher selling prices. Log
cost dominates in total production cost. In normal times it is between 80 and
90% of all conversion costs.
The small private owner-manager usually handles sales activities as
incidental to his general management functions.
A large segment of private sector mills old and using low cost
equipment, are cottage industry. They often operate on an intermittent basis
depending upon log supplies, local market needs, prices and weather conditions.
Other mills are integrated with joinery factories and are geared to their
needs. Other mills are custom operators and provide only a sawing service
to customers at a "per cubic meter" price. Customers provide the logs.
There are no mandatory sawnwood grading rules as in State operations.
This is part of the reason why most sales are made at mill sites. Some of
the large private mills have adopted grading procedures. Grades and the
finishing of joinery grades is carried out in the joinery plants. Kiln
drying is not common, though at least one moderately large private sector
mill has it.
The moisture content of shipped sawnwood is not given much attention,
and varies largely due to market conditions. The long period during which logs
and sawnwood are in storage between time of log harvesting and of sawnwood sales
allows the wood to approach air-dry conditions. When markets are strong this
natural control does not exist.
Institution-building aspects of the Project
From the beginning of project identification, the Government insisted
that a branch of the Ministry of Forestry would operate the forestry part,
and that a subsidiary of SEKA, the pulp and paper part.  The international
institutions resisted this concept because of the importance they attached to
the project parts being fully integrated, while noting the difficulty of
coordinating SEKA and the Ministry of Forestry, two semi-autonomous agencies.



ANNEX 3
Page 27
The international institutions felt these problems would be overcome
if a new private pulp and paper company was formed with possible concessionary
rights to logging in the Antalya forests. A competitive spur to the existing
system they thought would force a change in obsolete ways.
The Government despite this pressure and a recognition of failure
stuck to its insistence that improvement be mainly from within. Foreign
participation in the equity and permanent management of the operation was
refused outright. The Government argued SEKA and the Ministry of Forestry
were vital. Unfair competition to them (as would be the case of a company
not bound by the Civil Service Code for salary levels as was SEKA) could not
be supported.
These were felt to be convincing arguments, which became more
apparent as the feasibility study progressed and the inherent - if hidden -
ability of SEKA and the Ministry of Forestry staff became apparent.

THE FORESTRY PROJECT
Introduction
This chapter deals with the forestry aspects of the Antalya Forest
Util:Lzation Project. The first part reviews the Antalya basmudurluk resource
base: the species grown, extent of forested area, standing volumes, log
quality and the quantity of wood that can be cut annually without reducing
the wood capital. This is followed by a discussion on the way the forest
will be mamaged to achieve by 1979 a felling programme of 790,000 m3 annually
using clear felling techniques and replacement with improved, man-made
plantations. The third section examines the future demand for wood grown in
Antalya, and indicates the additional amounts that will be required from the
Isparta, Adana and Mersin basmudurluks to satisfy SEKA's requirements. The
method of logging and transportation is also described. Finally the Annex
deals with organization and management, manpower requirements and method of
implementation. In Annexes 10 and 13 capital and operational costs are dealt
with in detail.
Investment needs for the forestry project from 1973-77 are TL 281
million with a foreign exchange component of US$8.0 million. During this
period forestry project operations would comprise the:
-    construction of some 2,000 km of forest roads and a bridge;
-    maintenance of some 25,000 km of forest roads;
-    planting of over 38,000 ha of cut-over or degraded forest;
-    production of 2.21 million m3 of logs, 4.6 million steres
of fuelwood and 5,560 tons of resin, and
-    protection of the forest estate from fire, disease and erosion.
Forest Resources of the Antalya Basmudurluk
Species
The forests are formed by coniferous species occuring in pure stands.
However, some mixed coniferous stands do exist in relatively inaccessible
locations at high elevations.  Neither of the hardwood species (2uercus so,:)
or Plantanus orientalis) occur in significant quantities or are of commercial
importance.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Pinus brutia (kilzilcam) is the most important species found from
sea level to 1,100 m asl. The other major commercial species in declining
order of occurrence are Pinus nigra (karacam), Abies cilicia (goknar), and
:luni2erus sDp. (ardic). These are all found at higher elevations and generally
orm pure stands.  Two other conifers, Pinus pinea (fistikcam) and Cypressus
s_mpervirens var horizontalis (servic) also grow in small areas but are of
minor commercial importance.

The total net productive area as of 1971 is estimated at 472,000 ha.  This can
eventually be raised to 560,000 ha by the afforestation of some 88,000 or poor,
*aegraded scrub land. All areas with slopes of 60% grade and greater are con-
sidered inaccessible For logging by present and proposed methods. Also classi-
fied as non-oroductive are:  rocky areas that would be difficult to regenerate;
nonr-loggable zones within the national parks and also a strip of-forest 100 m
wide on both sides of main highways; and, all land that has a crown cover of
less than 10% as measured on aerial photographs.

This data shows that the Antalya forests are characterized by over-
*maaturity and understocking.  At the proposed rotation ages, 73% of the forest
"Dy area) is overmature. Furthermore, only 10% of the good forest has a crown
cover greater than 71%. In view of this situation, a major change in manage-
amezt practice is necessary for the forests to be brought to a healthy and
ully productive condition. It will be necessary to licuidate all overmature
stands as soon as possible and to replace them with healthy, productive, well-
spaced, fully stocked stands.
rarnding Volume
The estimated net standing merchantable volume of coniferus species
in 1971 on the 472,000 ha of productive forest was about 30 million M3 1/. The
volumes shown below by species and age classes were derived from the 1964
inventory and allow for areas that have been logged and others that have been
planted since the decay and loss due to fire, breakage and increment.

These unit volumes are about half what they would be in well stocked stands of
the same species grown under similar soil and climatic conditions.  One of the
objectives of this project is to improve the stocking and improve yields.
In addition to logs, fuelwood is produced in the region from the
following sources:
-    Stem and branchwood cut in good forests not used for industrial
purposes less than 5 cm top diameter.
-    All deciduous species felled in the good forests areas during
logging operations.
-    Total over bark volume of poor forests that are cleared for
afforestation.

under bark of 10 cm.
/4   Logs between 0.5 and 1.2 m; in length and with a minimum top diameter
under bark between 8 cn and 10 cm.
This shows that there is a good proporation of sawlogs but insufficient logs
of plywood quality to consider the establishment of a plywood factory as part
of the industrial complex.
Allowable Annual Cut (AAC) 1/
One of the most important requirements for the calculation of
Allowable Annual Cut is a sound prediction of growth and yield. This data
is usually obtained through a system of permanent sample plots. At present
no such plots exist in Antalya and will have to be established in order to
prepare a better prediction of AAC in the future. In the absence of this
information, the following data taken from temporary sample plots was used
to calculate AAC for P. brutia and P. nigra assuming average growing sites.
|   Tne maximum annual amount of wood which may be harvested from a given
area on. the basis of sustained yield (equal or increasing yields in
perpetuity).

This demonstrates the declining growth rates with age and shows that P. nigr
should be grown or. a longer rotation than P. brutia.  At the rotations shown
above the mean annual increment for P. brutia and P. nigra are 1.9 and
1.6 m3/ha/year respectively. Improved selection and silvicultural treatment
should be able to increase these by at least 25%.
For cedrus, abies and juniperus respective mean annual increments
of 0.90, 0.78 and 0.28 m3/ha/yr were used assuming a 100 year rotation for
each.
The base year used for calculating AAC is 1979 as the industrial
project would be fully operational by then. The AAC was calculated for the
basmurduluk for all species and the results were reduced by 5% to allow for
contingencies. The details are shown on the next page.

The calculations have purposely been done on a conservative basis
and it is probable that the AAC can be increased significantly once more
reliable data becomes available. Sandwell's suggestions that future cal-
culations of AAC should be done for each isletme rather than for each series
(as is now done) will be fully investigated by the MOF when the 1973/74
inventory has been computed. The consultants approach is sound.
The composition of AAC by log product percentages by species and
source is expected to be as follows:

Future Inventories
The first major forest inventory of Antalya was carried out in 1964
and was designed to obtain gross overbark volumes. A second major re-inven-
tory for the area is scheduled for 1973/74, and is designed to determine net
merchantable under bark volumes. In addition, it will define industrial log
products in terms of dimension and quality. The new forest management plans
to be prepared by the implementation team will be based on the new inventory
data.
Forest Management
Present System
In 1964, the Uniform Shelterwood System 1/ was introduced and the
region divided into 203 series. Eacn has its own management plan and is
managed as a separate entity. The AAC is calculated for each series
separately, and the age class method of management is stipulated. This
method requires that the oldest age classes must be cut first. The present

ANNEX 4
Page 9
system of management has no basic requirements and neither is met in Antalya.
There should be an even distribution of age classes in each series and road
access to all 203 series. By 1971, only 86 series had been logged. Further-
more, the annual cut included not only final regeneration fellings (60%) but
also "thinnings" (40%) from large overmature forests. The practice of thinn-
ing overmature stands is of questionable silvicultural value as the growth
response of remaining trees will be slight. Very little flexibility is
provided on this approach to forest management.
It has been recent practice to rely on natural regeneration of
the forests. This method has not been very successful, particularly with
P. brutia which demands plenty of light. Many of the regeneration blocks
have failed to regenerate and now have to be planted. Valuable time has
been lost between felling and re-stocking adding to the length of the rota-
tion and increasing the cost of establishment because of heavy undergrowth
development. Where natural regeneration is successful it is in any case
usually necessary to plant up to about 20% of the area.
Proposed Approach
The following principles of forest management were recommended as
a basis for implementation by the Consultants. These principles are fully
supported by the Bank and have been accepted by the MF.
-    to manage the forest on a sustained yield basis;
-    to maximixe yield by setting a rotation age for each species
such that the optimum production of net merchantable under
bark volume per unit area is achieved;
-    to achieve the objective of optimum productivity for all
forest land through liquidation, as soon as possible, of
all overmature or understocked stands, consistent with the
sustained yield constraint, and through immediate restocking
of cut-over areas with young, healthy seedlings;
-    to exclude from production those areas of forest set aside
for National Parks and roadside amenity belts or in which
successful regeneration cannot be assured;
-    to maintain the existing forested area through increased
measures of protection;
-    to expand the productive forest area by recovery of abandoned
encroached lands and by afforesting open and degraded
forest areas;
-    to distribute forest operations as widely as necessary through-
out the region to meet the needs of the forest population;



ANNEX 4
Page 10
-    to draw the balance between economic and ecological conservation
in managing the forests;. and
to introduce gradually any shift in management philosophy
necessary to achieve the principles.
Cut over areas will be reforested by:
(a)  Natural regeneration in the high elevation P. brutia and P. nigra
areas;
(b)  Seedin  in the rocky P. brutia and Cedrus areas; and
(c) Planting in the remaining areas which will form the bulk
of the reforestation program.
Afforestation
Unlike final felling and reforestation, afforestation in Turkey is
the responsibility of the General Directorate of Afforestation and Erosion
Control (GDA). The GDA operates within the forest estate on areas with 10%
or less crown cover including the maquis areas. In Antalya the total area of
degraded forest and other areas, within which.the,GDA may operate, is some
688,000 ha,  The preliminary investigation indicated that of this 88,000 ha
is potentially plantable land. Incendiarism is still common in the region
done by irate villagers to new plantations, particularly in higniy populated
areas where there is conflict of ownership and crop and pressure for grazing
land. The GDA has eliminated those areas where such danger exists.
The potential for expansion of the productive forest area through
afforestation has enabled an increase in the AAC. The increasing contribu-
tion of thinning yields.to the AAC towards the end of the rotation permits
an earlier liquidation of the overmature forest areas. There are, however,
some limitations to the extent of early afforestation. If a continuing
sustained yield, either at the present or an increased level, is to be assured,
steps must be taken to balance the distribution of age classes in the second
rotation. The present overmature and understocked nature of the forest necessi-
tates fairly extensive logging for a given volume of wood; however as these
forests are liquidated and the proportion 'of younger stands to be logged in-
creases, the required logging area will decrease.
The GDA would like .to increase the annual afforestation for Antalya
to as high as 10,000 ha/A. However, the present annual reforestation area is
over 4,000 ha and in 1978 will be over 9,000 ha. At full AAC production, this
will go as high as 9,500 ha. An additional 10,000 ha of afforestation would
put the regeneration program beyond the physical capabilities of the regional
staff even if recruitment and training were instituted immediately.
Details of the annual areas to be regenerated (reforestation alid
afforestation) are given in Table 15.  It should be possible to build up to a
program of 1 ,000 ha a year from 1978 onwards but it is a large program by any
standards.



ANNEX 4
Page 11
Thinning
The practice of supplying 40% of the AAC from thinning overmature
stands will be stopped as the silvicultural response is usually not worth the
effort. Instead, thinning will be done in the natural stands less than 40
years old where stocking control is very important to proper development.
Details of the annual areas to be thinned are contained in Table 15.
Nurseries
There are 7 permanent nurseries within the region. Locations, sizes,
capacities and main species raised are shown below:

The area of nurseries in Antalya will be expanded to provide for the regions
reforestation and afforestation program. The creation of further large
nurseries will be avoided and instead smaller, less permanent nurseries will
be established throughout the region, closer to the various planting sites.
Forest Protection
The forests have to be protected from fire, encroachment, erosion,
insect and disease. This work is carried out by isletme and bolge staff.
Regular forest and plantation guard patrols are maintained for this purpose.
Fire. Most of the destructive forest fires in Antalya take place
at lower elevations in P. brutia stands. Forest fires tend to induce heavy
undergrowth development of marquis vegetation which is excellent for grazing.
These areas of destructive fires recorded over the past few years range from
about 150 ha in 1966 to 2,800 ha in 1969. The total area effected from
1964-71 was over 8,500 ha. The fire danger season extends for 5 months from



ANNEX 4
Page 12
May to October. During this period 47 look-out points are manned 24 hours a
day and are connected by radio and/or telephone to ranger, isletme and/or
basmudurIuk HQ. Three new look-out points will be built during the project
implementation. Stand-by crews will be provided with a radio equipped jeep
pick-up truck. Portable fiberglass water tanks, of about 650 to 900 liter
caapcity, and gasoline motor pump units, capable of being mounted on the back
of a pick-up truck, will be obtained for each district to facilitate fire
suppression.
There are relatively few firebreaks established in the indigenous
forest. It is the policy to create and maintain clean-weeded 10 m wide
firebreaks in new plantation areas at the boundaries of each compartment.
This practice will be continued. In addition, pruning of lower branches to
a height of 2 meters will be done at the edges of all firebreaks and roadsides
in stands 15 years and older as a fire prevention measure. Pruning will be
done on trees for 10 m into the stand on each side of the break or road.
Pruning will be carried out at the sides of all new roads whether in planta-
tions or indigenous forest. It is particularly important in the younger
stands. All firebreaks are to be weeded once a year prior to the dry season
and before grass seeding takes place. Stand-by crews will be able to cope
with all of the pruning work and some of the firebreak cultivation. Details
of the area of firebreak tending are included in Table 16.
As the main cause of fires in incendiarism, immediate short term
protection improvement involves increased patrolling of the forest, parti-
cularly in known high hazard areas. However, it is anticipated that the
development of the project will provide more work on a regular basis for
the villagers, inject more money into their economy and provide an opportunity
to improve their subsistence level of agriculture. Part of this improvement
should be a reduction in the numbers of the present poor variety of goats
with a change to a more productive species. The resultant reduction in
demand for grazing land and improved local economic conditions should signi-
ficantly reduce the problem of incendiarism.
Encroachment. During the period 1964-71, the recorded area of
illegal encroachment of forest land amounted to some 2,300 ha. The actual area
may well have been larger. The immediate answer to the problem lies in more
effective patrols. Concurrently, the local people will be made aware of the
importance of the forest. This can be achieved only through improved liaison
with the people by local forest staff.
Apart from preventing further losses, every effort will be made to
reclaim land abandoned by farmers. Such land, having been cultivated for
years, is ideally suited for natural or artificial regeneration since it is
free of persistent woody vegetation. These areas are to he fenced and actively
managed for forest uses as soon as they become available.



ANNEX 4
Page 13
Insects and Disease. Damage from insects and fungi is not a ser-
ious problem in Antalya, however, there is an insect control unit in the
region with adequate staff to spray some 10,000 ha/year. As a proportion of
logs will be delivered to the mill with bark on there will be a need to monitor
the bark beetle population. No problems should arise if the bark is removed
within 6 weeks of felliing.  In the event of a major epidemic (there has onl'j
been one in Turkey in the Black Sea region), a reserve fund is held centrally
in Ankara to provide for emergency control measures.
Soil Conservation and Erosion Control. The run-off effect, after
precipitation, particularly in areas of intensive agricultural activity at
higher elevations, can be serious in terms of erosion. Soil engineering
will be undertaken wherever necessary in forestry operations. The need for
conservation measures exist in most areas where felling takes place, even
where natural regeneration and seeding are to be used. it is estimated that
in 1% of operating areas, special measures, over and above normal soil
engineering, will be necessary to prevent gully erosion. Details of areas
involved are included in Table 16.
Forest Research
There is pressing need to expand research activities in Antalya to
support this project. In particular, the following topics are to be given
high priority during project implementation.
-    tree breeding - the establishment of seedling or clonal seed
orchards on a national level to obtain genetically improved
planting stock;
-    nursery trials - improvement in techniques;
-    seed handling technology;
-    site classification;
-    establishment trials - land preparation and subsequent
cultivation and planting replacement;
-    species trials - particularly exotics such as
Pinus pinaster, P. radiata, Eucalyptus camaidulensis,
tereticornis, grandis and glubulus;
-    provenance trials;
-    thinning trials;
-    fertilizat ? on trials;
-    growth and yield studies; and
-    log production studies,

To meet the increased work load, the research staff in Antalya will
be expanded from 8 to 17 professionals with technical support also provided.
The future establishment is given below. Bracketed figures indicate

In addition to an increase in staff and services, the area of
forest directly under research management are to be extended to provide
areas typical of all major forest cover types in the basmudurluk.
The intended expansion in research activities is very much needed
in Antalya and it should be possible for seventeen professionals to handle
the program adequately.
Demand for Forest Products
Present Demand
As noted earlier, the forest legislation of Turkey provides that
all villagers living within 10 km of the forests have the right to certain
volumes of forest products for their own or community use. In addition,
there is provision for the supply of logs for building purposes in the event
of a disaster, e.g. an earthquake. The MF also retains certain forest



ALXNEX 4
Page 15
products for official use in forestry activities. All such demands on the
forest have priority and are provided at special low prices. These priority
demands are referred to as Statutory Requirements.
Within the Antalya basmu,1urluks there are over 450 small sawmills
(including joinery shops) and wooden box plants which purchase required log
supplies at the MOF log auctions. The state operates one sizeable box plant
at Antalya which is supplied with logs through an agreement. The manufactur-
ing facilities provide for regional needs of construction lumber and wooden
boxes. While individually the plants are not of significant size, collectivell
they provide employment for many people and also meet specific local needs.
The log demands for this sector of the regional economy are referred to as
"Regional Requirements."
Of the industrial log volume, 55% is sold to other basmudurluks.
Included in these sales are mine props and railway ties for use by state
enterprises elsewhere in Turkey. The logs that are shipped outside the
region in unmanufactured form are referred to as "Sales to Other Regions."
Sales to state organizations are arranged through agreements with the General
Directorate of Forestry in Ankara and sales for privately owned manufacturing
plants are made through MF public auctions.
The recorded sales of logs from Antalya in 1971 are shown on the
next page.

As with industrial logs, statutory requirements for fuelwood have definite
priority over regional demands. Very little fuelwood is sold outside the
region.
The only other significant forest product produced in Antalya is
resin from P. brutia. In 1971, SEKA, the major purchaser, bought 95% of
sales which totalled just over 1,000 tons.
Future Demand
Logs. Log usage in Antalya is expected to develop as follows:
-    Statutory requirements - provision has been made for an
increase to 80,000 m'/year or over double present demand.
This is generous and should more than adequately cover
disasters and villagers rights.
-    While basmudurluk demands for sawnwood products will increase,
this demand would be satisfied by the inclusion of a sawmill
in the proposed SEKA project. Log volumes to existing
customers is therefore assumed to remain unchanged.
-    The sale of logs outside the basmudurluk could be discontinued
provided facilities exist to use the logs within the region.
On this basis, the industrial log requirements to existing
consumers in Antalya will be:

Wood avai1ability for industrial planning purposes was based on the second
decade as this period reflects the impact of an active forest thinning
program.
In addition to the above, the MF has agreed to sunply up to
200,000 m3 of wood from the Adana/Mersin Regions east of Antalya. Since
in the long run this raw material supply would comprise sawmill residuals
rathrer than logs, it is necessary to look on the Adana/Mersin supply as
pulpwood. Details of requirements from this source are contained in Table
14.  T:hey start in 1980 at 43,000 m3,  rise to 196,000 m3 in 1988 and are
maintained at that level. As indicated below the current demand for logs
in the Adana-Mersin basmudurluks is well below the available annual cut.

This shows there would be no difficulty in supplying up to
200,000 m3 annually from the areas, however, a resource utilization study
on the same lines in the Antalya project is required to confirm quantities
and the form in which wood is supplied (i.e., logs or chipped sawmill
waste from new sawmills established in the area.)
SEKA's Requirements
At full capacity the sawmill will require a scaled l/ log volume
input of 307,000 m3 of logs greater than 20 cm top diameter. This is equi-
valent to about 340,000 m3 true log volume measurement used by sawmillers to
record input.  Pulpwood inputs are recorded in scaled volume.  In 1978, the
pulpmill will require 120,000 m3.  This builds up gradually to 472,000 m3
in 1990 and is thereafter maintained at that level.
Sales outside the region. The balance remaining for sales outside
the region are as follows:
I/   The Turkish systen of measurement which allows for an automatic reduction
in mid log diameter to provide for shrinkage. A conversion factor of
1.1072 is used to convert scaled volume to true volume.

If, as suggested by the MF, Antalya is required to supply the mining areas of
Turkey with 55,000 m3 of pit props a year this can easily be done to 1988.
Thereafter there might be difficulties but these will probably be overcome by
the expected increase in allowable annual cut once new management plans have
been prepared.
Details of log production and sales to the region, SEKA and outside
the region from all sources (Antalya, Isparta, Adana and Mersin) are shown
in Table 15.
Forest Production
Logging and Transportation
Felling. The felling is presently a manual operation (hand saws
and axes) with few power chain saws in use. Similarly limbing and cutting
into log lengths is carried out manually. The maximum length of SEKA's
sawlogs will be 5 m as the skidding and transportation facilities discussed
below would not be able to cope with longer logs. Pulpwood will be cut to
1 meter lengths. Wide scale use of power saws would increase productivity
by some 20%, reduce the work effort and eventually provide increased income
to the workers. Provision is made in the project for the purchase of power
saws for sale to individuals. Facilities for maintenance and repair will
be provided by the GDF or Cooperatives. Other alternative mechanical felling
methods are deemed impractical because of terrain limitations.
Barking. Logs are currently barked in the forest with hand tools
prior to skidding. This reduced the damage by bark beetles and borers to a
minimum and is cheaper than on-site mechanical systems. However, if labor
becomes scarce, it will be necessary for a portion of the production to be
barked by SEKA at mill and provisions are being made to handle this eventua-
lity. Logs transported to log depots for public sale will continue to be
debarked manually in the forest.



ANNEX 4
Page 20
Skidding. Skidding or delivery of logs to roadside is accomplished
by mmue and oxen. If the terrain prohibits animals then logs are manhandled or
tahro-m or pushed to roadside. Mechanical skidding methods using wheeled or tracked
type surface vehicles and cable systems will not be used except on a pilot
basis to gain experience and train machine operators. Terrain obstacles
and steep slopes restrict the potential use of surface vehicles to a few
forest areas, and low stand volumes/ha plus small operating blocks would
require frequent relocation of a cable system resulting in high set-up and
moving costs.
Transportation. Logs for public sale are transported from roadside
to forest depots wnere they are sorted, stored and sold. Virtually all log
transport takes place in 3-5 ton trucks (average load 12.5 m3) which for the
most part are privately owned.  Loading and unloading are both manual opera-
tions carried out by men hired by the truck driver.  In view of the manual
nature of the work, employment in the transportation operation is high and,
at the present time in Antalya, is estimated to involve in the order of
7,000 people on a part-time basis. Road improvements and more powerful trucks
will improve transportation costs and improvements will be made in loading
techniques. However, the use of special machines for loading is not at
present deemed to be economic. Sawlogs required by SEKA will be collected
from log depots barked or unbarked. Pulpwood will be stacked by species at
roadside by the MF. Responsibility for transportation to mill site of
sawlogs and pulpwood will be SEKA's.  At full production there will be one
log truck arriving at SEKA's mill site every 3 minutes. Improvements in the
state highways will be required to cope with this volume.  The remaining log
production will continue to be transported to log depots at the MF's cost.
Transportation of fuelwood is presently the buyer's responsibility. The MF
has fuelwood piled at roadside, and sells it at that point.
Most logging work is done by some form of a sub-contract or job
basis. Labor input records are practically non-existant. Based on produc-
tivity data and assuming an individual works between 75 and 138 days annually,
it is estimated that about 7,400 are employed annually on log production
work.
Thus, the logging and construction activities will continue to be
labor intensive. However, it is anticipated that this will change gradually
as younger villagers enter the labor force and wages increase.
The importance of competent field supervisors who are thoroughly
familiar with production methods and techniques must be emphasized. The
successful development of a skilled labor force and implementation of improved
techniques is a continuous activity in which the field supervisors play a key
role.

Careful detailed planning and scheduling are essential to make
maximum use of equipment and to provide year round employment for skilled
machine operators and production workers. This will also assist in the
development of a skilled labor force and contribute to more efficient
operations.
Log Depots
The system of public auction works well with the exception that
it requires storage of logs for long periods with subsequent loss in grade.
Within the Antalya basmudurluk there are 29 log depots, distributed among
the 14 isletmes. Each depot handles only logs produced in the isletme. The
number per isletme varies from I to 5. All main depots are located at
points on or near good highways so they are readily accessible for subsequent
transport. Steps to reduce the number of depots will be taken once the quan-
tity of logs sold directly has increased.
Roadside and depot log inventories will fluctuate during the year
and also vary from year to year. However, recent year-end inventories
represent between 3 and 6 months supply.
Roads
Roads are built to a single standard and only those sections in
use are maintained. By machine, construction costs are about TL 31,000/km;
by hand, TL 51,000/km. Road construction methods are generally satisfactory.
In the future, roads will be constructed to two standards: main haul roads
and feeder roads. According to the following specifications:
Main Roads    Feeder Roads
Width of running surface                            4.0 m         3.5 m
Maximum favorable grade                              12 %          12 %
Maximum adverse grade                                 6 %           6 %
Minimum curve radius                                 20 m          15 m
These will allow loaded trucks speeds of             25 km/hr      15 km/hr
By 1979, 475 km of main. roads and a bridge over the Koprucay River will be
constructed and paid for out of the capital budget. Secondary roads paid
for out of operating expenses are required at a rate of some 300 km/year.
Details of distances required are contained in Table 15. A substantial
road maintenance program starting with some 4,000 km in 1973 and building
up to over 10,000 km annually by 1991 will also be undertaken. The quality
of maintenance will be improved.



ANNEX 4
Page 22
To carry out this program, substantial additional equipment as
well as replacement equipment (including spare parts for both) is required.
At a total cost over 5 years (1973-77) of TL 75 million, it is the largest
single item in the forestry project's capital cost requirement.
No difficulties are expected in being able to achieve this road
construction and maintenance program since the basmudurluk is already able
to construct 300 km annually with out of date and insufficient equipment.
Feeder road construction costs in other parts of the world vary between
TL 14,000 and TL 84,000 per km thus Turkish costs are very competitive.
Other Facilities
Some additional office space, housing, equipment and maintenance
shops and other miscellaneous buildings will be built and have been included
in domestic capital costs.   Forest guards' housing has been treated as an
operational cost.
Buildings. The Central Workshops in Antalya are well run and can
undertake practically all the major equipment repairs required. However,
further equipment will be obtained through the project to enable workshops
to handle all the additional machinery being purchased. Eight mobile,
repair pick-ups will be purchased for operation in the Divisions.
Powersaw supply and repair shops could be incorporated into the
isletme shop structure or handled on a private basis.  The additions,
expansions and modifications shown below will adequately cover requirements
for construction during the project.

Communications System
A complete revamping of the present communications system is
necessary. This will require the purchase of some 260 radio units by 1977.
Where technical obsolescence or machine availability are important
factors, a regular replacement program is essential. This would include
production, road building and personnel transport equipment. All units
which have exceeded reasonable use or age limits will be realaced. The main
items of equipment (additional and replacements) to be purchased through the
project from 1973 - 1977 are listed below:

* Number of workers based on 270 man days/year.
Detailed estimates of manpower requirements were prepared by the consultants
and the summary figures shown above, bearing in mind the work program, are
thought to reflect needs satisfactorily. By 1979 the forestry project will
provide full time employment for an additional 4,300 persons in the Antalya
Forest basmudurluk. The most significant increase in labor requirements is
the skilled category. The organization of a training program to ensure the
present workers fill this need will be one of the main tasks of the project
implementation team to be described later. About 11,000 man-years of labor
will be required at full production. However, the actual number employed
will be in the order of 15,000 as many workers will only work on a part-time
basis. Production operators can be scheduled on a year round basis whereas
forestry work, and particularly tree planting, is more seasonal.
Salaries
Salary levels are based on formal training, number of years service
and to some degree, level of responsibility. Fringe benefits apply to all
salaried employees. Gross income including fringe benefits and supplements
range from TL 8,000/year (US$570) for a laborer to TL 105,000/year (US$7,500)
for the regional Director.



ANNEX 4
Page 26
Forest Service Staff salaries are generally substantially below
tnose paid by the private sector to persons bearing similar responsibilities.
Steps to improve this situation will be required in the future.
Labor Rates
There are three categories of workers recognized in the wage
structure applicable to forest operations:
Forestry
Daily paid workers             Production
Permanent              casual         laborers

/year    nT 14,000 (at 270

These wages are very low by European standards and are bound to rise in the
future as demand for labor in Antalya rises.
Piecework rates paid to production workers in 1972 are shown below:

Collectors                                                       1.1
These rates are such that manual log production operations are a lot cheaper
than the mechanical methods which have become common practice in other parts
of Europe and the developed world. The remarks made under wages are equally
applicable to piecework rates.
Truck hauling rates include all related labor costs plus loading
and unloading components. Comparable hauling rates excluding loading and
unloading for distance and type of roads are shown on the following page.

These rates are very reasonable compared to those prevailing in Southern
European countries.
Proposed Organization
The basic system of basmudurluks, isletmes and bolge organizations
described in Annex 3 permits rational, practical forest development and no
change in this structure is required. However, realignment of functions
within these units and some rationalization of unit areas and boundaries
were recommended by the Consultants and are currently being considered by
the MOF.  The specific changes proposed by Sandwell listed below will be
reviewed during implementation.
-    reduce isletmes from 14 to 9;
- - retain two example (Ornek) isletmes for pilot operations,
but hand over management and planning to the research group,
(routine production, road construction and maintenance, etc.
would be taken over by the appropriate adjacent regular
isletmes);
-    Reduce bolges from 75 to 36;
-    establish a major production group in both basmudurluk and
isletme organizations. All production activities would be
undertaken by the isletme production staff - none by the
bolge staff;
-    establish major forest management and silviculture groups in
both regional and Isletme organizations. All forest management
work would be undertaken by the enlarged bolges;



ANNEX 4
Page 29
-    join all accounting, statistical and other support activities
into major administration groups at basmudurluk and isletme
level (these groups would undertake all routine administrative
office procedures and reduce the paper work burden that all
senior officers now have to handle, thereby permitting the
skilled axperienced responsible forest officers to devote more
time on supervision control and ?launing);
-    establish a regional planning team to coordinate plans prepared
by specialist sections, develop rational practical plans for
the region and provide liaison with the MF and GDF planning
teams in Ankara; and
introduce control systems including cost accounting, production
and forestry activity statistics, equipment utilization and cost
analysis and labor use amd productivity records.
The appraisal mission agrees with the proposals put forth by the
consultants but realizes the need to be flexible on the actual number of
organizational units finally selected.
Proposed organization charts for the basmudurluks, isletmes and
bolges are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.

Implementation
At the implementation of this plan requires a substantial amount
of work in addition to that required to conduct normal operations, a
Turkish Implementation Team will be established. The team will require two
experienced senior foresters responsible for silvicultur.al and forest
production activities, respectively, plus supporting staff.  Total man month
requirements including support staff are estimated to be 630 over a 6 year
period.  Vehicles, office space and equipment will be provided for the team.
To assist the Turkish Team and zo provide additional breadth of
experience will require the services of a foreign forestry consultancy team,,
preferably from Forestal. Three Consultantss are required intermittently over
6 years for a total of some 100 man months; one covering production and
administration and the others silviculture and forest management.  They would
be assisted from time to time by specialists for an estimated 15 man months.
Shown below is the estimated domestic and foreign costs required
from 1973-79 to cover the expenses of the combined Turkish-Consultants
Implementation Team.  Provisions will be made by the project for financing
the first 5 years expenses.

Sandwell has prepared a detailed draf t contract which includes all
aspects of the work to be undertaken by the Implementation team.  It includes
the:



ANNEX 4
Page 34
agreement;
description of the project;
terms of reference;
work programme for joint project team;
role of consultant;
time schedule;
composition and qualifications of project team; and
outline of equipment procurement procedure.
The implementation team will be concerned with the three levels of
planning prescribed below:
Planning Level           Term Period    Relative Scope of Planning Detail
1. Management Plan       Long term -      For whole basmudurluks.  State
20 years               principles, policies.  Defines
broad objectives or targets.
2. Development and       Short term -           Moderate detail of how objectives
Operating Plans       5 years                are to be achieved.  Prepared for
each isletme.
3. Annual Development   1 year             Specific detail with precise
and Operating Plan                     operating instructions for each
isletme and bolge.
Levels 2 and 3 include both operating and development plans; the former deals
with forestry objectives and quantitative production targets, the latter
covers all aspects of those supporting operations, such as road building and
maintenance necessary to achieve the forestry objectives.
This would do away with the present practice of producing a
management plan for each of 203 series in the basmudurluk but would not mean
a change in the number of series. These are basic units of management and
statistical information and must be preserved.



ANNEX 4
Page 35
The proposed 1973 re-inventory provides an excellent opportunity
to establish a very sound basis for planning. Detailed preparation of new
management plans will be delayed until the 1973 results are available. In
the meantime, a synthesis of the information contained in Consultant's
report should be adequate for interim planning.
(A detailed wood supply contract is currently being drawn up in
Turkey between MF, the supplier and SEKA, the user on the lines described
in Annex 3).
Preparation for this project by the Antalya Basmudurluk Staff is
already well in hand and there is an awareness of the changes needed in
forest management, silviculture, logging and administration of the forest
estate to achieve the objective of establishing a fully integrated industrial
complex based on the optimum use of Antalya's wood resources. Change will
have to be based on sound principles, study and careful implementation as
the project develops and needs become more apparent. The key to the project
is the creation of the Turkey-Consultants Implementation Team which will be
operating by mid-1974.

/I  Logs from Isparta are inmouded it  project sale- eves though they come from outside the Antalya project area.
/2  Only logs > 20 em top diameter.
L3 Includes: pulplogs, short sawlogs, < 20 cm top diameter sawlogs. "Pulpwsood"(other than that sold to DERA for pulp production) sold in and outside the region wonld be seed as sawlogs, transmission poles,
mtne props and amall poles.
L   Indicates the quantities of pulpwood required from the Adans-Mersin conser-ancies to make up the shortfall required by SEKA.  Although isitielly this will be supplied in r.uodwood form (50X sawlogs and 50X
pulplogs), later on in the project it is expected thiE  wosid be in the form of chips.
L2  Secludes statutory sales (sawlogs sold to villagers) of 80,000 m3/year and 99,000 m3/year other regional commitments (existing sawmills, box plasts etc.).                                      
/6  Shows the increases and decreases in log inventory volumes which cancel each other out by 1990.                                                                                                                                             w 
Li Does not include the  sales of pulpwood to SERA from the Adna-Uersin  onservancies.  
/8  Maximum anual allowable cut (AAC) of 790,000 a (r) under bark to 5 cm top diameter is achieved in 1979 and assumed to be maintained at that level thereafter.  Reassement after the reinventory in 1973 and
prodactios of new management plans by the project implementation team is expected to result in a higher AAC.  If this happens there will be no need to import wood from Isparta and the quantities of pulpwood
from Adana-Mersin could be reduced.
12  This -slume is e-peeted tn come from the Isparta fornsts adjacent to the Antalya consercancy.
L1°  Assumed that production and sales would be the same as 1990.

THE INDUSTRIAL PROJECT
Introduction
The intensive industrial utilization of the lightly-utilized
forests of the Antalya region has been the subject of study for many years.
Tnis previous work led to a UNDP-financed detailed feasibility study in 1972
and early 1973 of such utilization by Sandwell and Company, Ltd., Consulting
Engineers of Vancouver, Canada.  Sandwell was chosen for this work on the
basis of previous experi.ence and performance in similar detailed studies in
many parts of the world.
SEKA, on its part, has been seeking a basis for the establishment
of a truly integrated forest industries complex, which it does not enjoy at
its existing four pulp and paper mills. These mills must obtain pulpwood
from wherever in Turkey it may be available, and at times they must resort
to pulpwood imports in order to maintain operations.
This would be the first plant in Turkey to utilize the well-esta-
blished principle of forest industries integration at a single site, with
the resulting economy of utilizing the residues of mechanical wood process-
ing (sawnwood, veneer, plywood) in the manufacture of woodpulp and paper.
The principle also permits the determination at the point of entry of the
best use to be made of each log or part thereof. Only the higher grades of
sawnwood normally command a satisfactory price, so that low-grade logs are
more economically converted to woodpulp and paper. The Plant would contain
a sawmill, a pulp mill and a paper mill. The suggested Plant Layout is shown
at the end of this Annex (World Bank 7848). A process flow diagram is also
shown there (World Bank 7847).
Suitability of Wood Species
As noted in Annex 4, over 80% of the wood supply consists of pinus
brutia, a pine native to Antalya. There are four minor species that are also
coniferous. There are no significant broadleaves species in Antalya.
Pinus brutia, in the realm of sawnwood, is suitable only for con-
struction lumber. It suffers from brittleness, poor nailing characteristics,
warping, it contains many knots, and it bleeds pitch. Nonetheless, it is
widely used in Turkey, air-dried, in construction. Warping and pitch bleed-
ing might be solved by proper kiln drying as has been done with similar
southern United States pines, although kilr. drying is not included in the
project. Lebanon cedar (6% of the volume) is already well accepted in
joinery and furaiture manufacture.
There are insufficient logs of adequate quality and diameter to
consider veneer and plywood manufacture.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
3roadly speaking, kraft pulps produced from coniferous species
fall into two strength qualify classifications. The first of these,
t.ypifled by Scandanavian pulps, are high in bursting and tensile strength
but somewhat low in tearing strength. The second, typified by Douglas fir
plps from the west coast of North America, are low in bursting and tensile
s5trengt  but high in tearing strength.  Laboratory tests indicate that pirus
br-ia --would falA into the latter category.  This raises doubts about the
sui-,ability of pinus brutia in the manufacture of sackkraft meeting inter-
national spec-ifications.  Such paper has rigorous strength requirements;
othe7wise the sacks have a high incidence of breakage in use.  It is under-
stood, however, that SEKA does not intend to -^oroduce sack paper meeting
interrational specifications, and intends to make up any strength deficiencies
by using more paper in each sack than would be required with first-quality
sackkraft.  This practice is also followed by some Southern United States
paper manufacturers that have their own sack plants; the pines grown in the
area tend to have strength problems similar to that of pinus brutia.
Strength requirements for linerboard are less rigorous than for
sacjkkraft. No problems are expected in meeting linerboard specifications
utilizing pinus brutia.
TEhe minor species are so small a part of the pulpwood supply that
they are not expected to have any significant effect upon the papermaking
characteristics of the pulp produced.
Description of Sawmill
The design and operating concepts incorporated in the proposed
sawmill are based on an analysis of the available resources, the logistics
of log supply, the requirements of the sawnwood market and the manufactur-
ing standards applicable in the market. The sawmill capacity 1/ was esta-
blished by limiting it to process only those logs of sawlog quality exceed-
ing 20 cn top diameter and 2.50 to 5.0 meters in length. The current
practice in small sawmills in Turkey of recovering small sections of short
length lumber from slabs and edgings would not be followed because of the
relatively low sales value and high manufacturing costs of such small
sections. The slabs and edgings would be chipped for use as pulpwood,
which is considered to be a higher order of utilization.
Sawlogs over 88 cm in diameter would be hand-barked in the woods.
Sawlogs would be bucked to a maximum length of 5.0 meters in the woods.
Bucking of logs at the sawmill would be preferred in order to realize the
hignLest possible sales return and would be examined in the future.  Sawlogs
would be sorted in the forest by species and be delivered by trucks equipped
wi t  bunks to permit unlioading at the sawmill by front end loader.  All
sawlogs would be weighed at the log yard entrance and random samples would

Output: t82,000 m3/yr



ANINEX 5
Page 3
be scaled to develop a weight-log volume relationship for receiving, sawmill
production and accounting purposes. Logs would be segregated by species
and inito two diameter classifications in order to minimize subsequent
sawnwood sorting and permit more efficient sawmill and sales operations.
Stored logs would be protected against checking, staining, insect damage
and fire by a system of irrigation type sprinklers. An inventory of up
to three months sawlogs in the mill yard would be provided to average out
short term supply fluctuations which could limit the log supply during these
periods of the year when road conditions or competition from other industries
for truck transport could restrict delivery.
Sawlogs 88 cm and smaller in diameter would be fed through a
mechanical debarker as the first processing step. Bark would be hogged and
fed to the power boiler as fuel.  The primary breakdown equipment best
suited to the available log supply would be a conventional bandmill and
carriage in order to maximize recovery of grade and volume. Since the
annual sawlog volume allocated for lumber manufacture can be processed by
a single bandmill and carriage headrig, adequately supported by secondary
breakdown and remanufacturing capacity, this basic equipment arrangement
best suits the project requirements.
The single-cut bandmill and no-man carriage headrig would be followed
by a Quad Bandmill equipped with line bar and hold down rolls, a double feed
bed horizontal resaw, two resaws, two adjustable pre-set four saw edgers,
and a selective automatic trimmer.
The sawmill would process one species at a time, and the sawnwood,
small timbers, and flitches produced would be manually sorted by thickness
and length, and in certain instances by moisture content and grade, into
piles made ready for air drying by the interleaving of strips of wood.
Completed loads of sawnwood would be taken by fork lift to the air-drying
yard, where they would be suitably oriented to the prevailing wind to provide
the best drying conditions. The loads would be lock piled three loads high
by six loads wide and covered to restrain the top layers of sawnwood as well
as to protect the top of the loads from direct exposure to the sun.
Air dry loads of sawnwood would be drawn from storage as called for
by sales requirements and delivered by fork lift to the dry sorter plant.
There the sawnwood would be defect-trimmed, graded, marked, double end
trimmed and sorted by final grade and length into loads ready for shipment
by truck or temporary storage in the sales storage area, where it would be
protected against the weather by covers similar to those described above.
Description of Pulpwood Preparation
The pulpwood storage yard would be adequate to store a three months
supply to insure a wood supply during those periods of the year when road con-
ditions or competition from seasonal industries for truck transport limits



ANNEX 5
Page 4
deliveries.  All pulpwood would be weighed at the log yard entrance and
random samples would be scaled to develop a weight-volume relationship for
receiving, wood chip production and accounting purposes. Pulpwood would
normally be delivered bark-on in one meter lengths, 8 cm and larger in
dianeter segregated by species, and stored in ranked piles in the yard.
The wood preparation plant would be sized to process up to
!t7?9inn r!3/A of pulpwood as reouired when the plant produces Kraft liner-
board at design capacity.
To the extent possible, the wood preparation plant's infeed
conveyor would be filled directly from incoming trucks to minimize handling
costs. The minor species would be fed separately from pinus brutia. Bark
would be removed in the same mechanical debarker used for the sawmill. Pro-
vision would be made for the offside bandsaw breakdown of pulpwood larger
in diameter than the chipper can handle. A metal detector would be provided
before the chipper for protection against imbedded metal in the pulpwood.
Chips would be conveyed pneumatically to paved open storage and reclaim
areas which would permit the segregated storage of pinus brutia chips, minor
species chips, and sawdust for a maximum of one month. The storage piles
would permit effective rotation of inventory in order to minimize chip
deterioration. Provision would be made so that a controlled blend of 79%
pinus brutia chips, 15% minor species chips, and 6% mixed species sawdust
could be withdrawn from storage. This blend of chips and sawdust would then
be screened to remove oversize chips, reduce the size of these chips, and
returni them to the system. This final blend is then ready for conveying
to a surge bin in the pulp mill.
Description of Pulp Mill
The process to be used would be the standard kraft (also called
sulpiiate) process with a complete chemical recovery system. This process
would provide maximum pulp strength properties for the paper and board to
be made, together with the economies and pollution abatement aspects of
chemical recovery. The mill which is described here has been designed to
allow the production of pulp for either linerboard or sackkraft. When
producing pulp for linerboard, two grades would be made: a high yield I/
(53%) base stock and a normal yield (47%) top stock. For sackkraft only
normal yield pulp, similar to top stock, would be produced. The pulp mill
would have a nominal capacity of 470 air-dry tons per day. This is below the
size of modern large pulp mills which oftern have single-line capacities of
750 to 1,000 tons per dayI, but it is still considered an economically sized
unit. Above 500 tons per day, the marginal benefits from economy of scale
drop off considerably.

a bone-dry weight basis.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
Modern mills have a choice of batch or continuous digesters in
which to cook wood by the kraft processes. Within these two major groups,
there are also a number of equipment variations.  The choice of batch or
continuous digesters for modern mills remains a subject of much discussion
and controversy as both methods have advantages and disadvantages specific
to each mill.
The consulting engineer has recommended the use of batch digesters
as being most appropriate for this project. In recent years, about as many
large new pulp mills have been built using batch as continuous digesters.
The choice can be again reviewed at the design development stage.
It is proposed to use six unlined carbon steel digesters, each with
a volume of 135 cubic meters. External cooking liquor circulation and in-
direct liquor heating would be utilized. A complete cooking cycle would
require four hours in each digester. Separate blow tanks would be provided
for high yield and normal yield pulp. The blow lines would be arranged so
that any digester could be blown to either blow tank.
The pulp washing and screening system would consist of two lines,
a large one for base stock and a small one for top stock. Base stock
would pass from the base stock blow tank through a certrifugal precleaner
to remove rocks and tramp metal, and then through double disc refiners to
defiber the partially cooked high-yield pulp. The refined base stock
would then be pumped through two stages of hot stock pressure screens. The
screen rejects (knots and fiber bundles) would be disc refined in separate
equipment and returned to the base stock blow tank. The screened pulp
would flow to a 4 - stage counter-current vacuum washing system. Washed
pulp would be pumped to a high density storage tank.
Top stock pulp would be pumped to a knotter, then on to a 3-stage
countercurrent washing system, followed by a single-stage screening system,
a vacuum thickener and a high density storage tank. Rejects from the
knotters and screens would be sent to the base stock refiners.
When the mill is to produce pulp for sackkraft, the entire produc-
tion, although reduced (283 vs. 477 TPD of paper) would be in normal yield
pulp. The base stock washing and screening system would be mofified to a
system similar to the small top stock line. This would necessitate a shut-
down of this part of the plant during changeover. The paper mill, however,
would have to shut down only while the base stock pulp remaining was Cleaned
out of the system so that there would be no contamination with base stock
during startup or multiwall sack paper.
Two by-products would be recovered in the pulp mill: turpentine
and sulphate soap. Turpentine would be condensed from the vapors relieved
during the early part of each digester cook. Sulphate soap would be
separated by floatation from the residual cooking ("black") liquor during



ANNEX 5
Page 6
the evaporation process prior to chemical recovery. Sulphate soap is often
converted to crude tall oil at the pulp mill, but in this case would be
sold as soap. Tall oil is the principal raw material for a variety of
natural resins used in paint and paper manufacture.
Waste heat from the digester blow system would also be recovered.
The hot water so produced would be used for pulp washing.
The black liquor recovered in the pulp washing operation would
first be concentrated in multiple effect evaporators and forced-circulation
concentrators to a solids level of 65%. This heavy hot black liquor would
be burned in a chemical recovery furnace, from which the molten chemicals
are drawn off the bottom and dissolved in weak wash liquor from the caustic-
izing plant to form green liquor. The gases from the recovery furnace are
passed through a waste heat boiler and economizer, and an electrostatic
precipitator to recover particulate matter, which is recycled.
The green liquor would be recausticized with lime to white liquor
for cooking. Lime sludge from the recausticizing system would be fed to
a rotary kiln to be calcined for re-use. Lime dust would be recovered
from the kiln flue gas by a venturi scrubber and recycled.
The collection and treatment of malodorous gases, other air pollu-
tants and water pollutants from the pulp mill would be practiced extensively
in order to minimize the effect upon the environment (See Annex 8).
Description of Paper Mill
Linerboard or sackkraft would be produced on a single paper machine
and ancilliary equipment, although the machine would be designed primarily
for linerboard manufacture. The machine will be economically sized at 450
TPD - although linerboard machines of up to to 1,400 TPD are in use. Base
stock (80% of the furnish) would be refined in 5 double disk refiners with
800 hp installed on each. Refined base stock would be pumped through
pressure screens and a centrifugal cleaner to the primary headbox of the
sheet former ("fourdrinier"), where it becomes the bottom layer of the
finished linerboard. The top stock (20% of the furnish) would be similarly
but more thoroughly refined in 3 similar double disc refiners, 3 stages of
centrifugal cleaners and through the secondary headbox about half way down
the fourdrinier where it becomes the top layer of the finished linerboard.
The top stock is prepared so that it will provide a better and brighter
printing surface than the coarser, darker base stock could provide for the
corrugated containers to be made from the linerboard.
When producing multiwall sack paper, the paper machine would
utilize elements of both the base stock and top stock systems, but all the
stock would be fed through the primary headbox onto the paper machine.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
The paper machine would have all the proven modern features avail-
able, and would have a finished paper width of 6.4 meters and a maximum de-
sign speed of 600 mpm. It would have two features not found on all liner-
board machines: a breaker stack and a size press. The breaker stack would
densify the linerboard, thereby improving its stiffness and minimizing the
rough surface effects inherent in using a coarse fiber.  The size press
would apply a surface sizing, essentially a prepared starch solution, which
would in effect "glue down" the coarse fibers that would otherwise protrude
from the sheet and interfere with good printing results.
In the most common roll sizes, three rolls of linerboard or six
rolls of multiwall sack paper would be produced across the paper machine.
Waste paper generated during paper making and finishing operations would be
recycled through the base stock system.
As the Antalya region is favored by a warm climate, outdoor-type
construction would be used to achieve economies in structural costs, and
to the extent considered practical, process equipment and storage tanks would
be located outside of buildings. This would apply to the digesters, evapo-
rators, lime kiln, recausticizing equipment, and virtually all pulp and liquor
storage tanks.
Main process buildings would be constructed with reinforced con-
crete floors, reinforced concrete frames, steel roof trusses, and walls of
asbestos cement panels or bricks. Roofs would be pre-cast concrete decks
with built-up asphalt and gravel roofing.
Ground drilling investigations indicate the need for pile found-
ations to support the heavier plant machinery. All other foundations would
consist of spread footings.
As noted elsewhere, all transport (except for fuel oil) would be
by truck during the initial years of operation of the plant. Fuel oil
would be delivered by tankship to an offshore underwater pipeline terminal.
It has been estimated that by 1986 there will be sufficient wood coming
from Adana-Mersin to justify the full time use of a tug and barge. Further
barge traffic could be developed in finished products to Istanbul, Izmir and
other port cities. A barge dock complete with rock breakwater would be
provided at that time.
A townsite would be provided to house key people and other social
infrastructure. Top management would be provided five houses of 150 square
meters each; middle management and other professional staff, 35 houses at
100 square meters; for key operating personnel, 137 houses at 70 square
meters; a 1,000 square meter guest house; and a recreation complex, commissary,
school and mosque.

Employment
The proposed sawmill and pulp and paper mill would employ some
850 people requiring a wide range of skills as shown in the following
table.

Unskilled and Semi-skilled              317                217           534
Total                                   554               303            857
For the purpose of the table, those personnel who provide general
services to both the pulp and paper mill and to the sawmill have been
included in the pulp and paper mill group.
The Management and Supervisory group would normally all be hired
from existing pulp, paper, and sawmills, or other industries employing
similar and closely related skills. For example, the Pulp Mill Superinten-
dent must have specific experience in the industry either as a Pulp Mill
Superintendent or senior experienced foreman in another mill. The Traffic
Manager, on the other hand, need not have direct pulp mill experience,
providing his experience in traffic management in some other industry is
sufficiently broad.
The other technical and professional group should, to some extent,
be drawn from people with direct pulp and paper or sawmill experience. For
example, included in this group are four engineers, of which at least two
should preferably have direct pulp and paper experience. On the other hand,
the staff doctor and nurse, could obviously be drawn from general practice.
The majority of the skilled operator group will have direct exper-
ience in their jobs elsewhere in the industry.
The skilled tradesmen group requires less actual industry experience,
as in most instances their trade skills are transferable. However, the trades
foremen which are included in the group will have direct industry experience
in order to be able to cope with special maintenance problems encountered
in pulp, paper and sawmills.

ANNEX 5
Page 9
More than 60% of the emploa7ees are classified as partly skilled or
semi-skilled. This group will be drawn from the existing local population.
The nearest urban centre is the town of Manavgat with a population of over
10,000. Antalya city has a population of over 100,000. In_addition to
these two centres there are numerous other small towns and villages within
a 50 km radius, and no trouble is anticipated in hiring from this population
base the estimated 534 people in the unskilled and semi-skilled group.
Recruiting the number (145) of personnel requiring direct industry
experience could prove to be a difficult undertaking. In the existing new
mills of SEKA there is already a shortage of highly experienced personnel
and there appears to be a definite reluctance on the part of Turkish workers
to move to new locations.
In order to overcome these difficulties, SEKA will undertake an
immediate program of up-training in their existing mills to be prepared for
the requirements of an Antalya mill. The training program will be developed
as part of the implementation activities and will be an extension of SEKA's
existing on-the-job training efforts. No difficulties are expected in
getting a satisfactory program launched once the consultants (see below)
are hired and the project is underway.
Other Plant Inputs
The purchase of electric power for the entire project from the
public utility serving the Antalya area was weighed against an on-site power
generation from waste heat and rejected. Although the public utility could
supply the necessary 24 MW at a high, but not unreasonable price, the reli-
ability of the supply because of frequent power failures, was less than the
pulp and paper plant could safely tolerate. Electric power will be purchased
only for those parts of the complex outside of the pulp and paper mill
proper, principally the sawmill and wood preparation plant. This would also
provide a source of electric power for plant startup.
The source of process water for the mill would be the Manavgat
River which provides a flow with a good margin of safety (see Annex 8).
Design water flow for the proposed mill would be 0.65 m3/s. Water quality
requirements for unbleached grades are not particularly demanding.
The water from the Manavgat River will require treatment to remove
suspended solids and iron. The water treatment and supply system would be
sized to handle 60,000 m3/day (0.694 m3/sec). Cooling water from the turbo-
generator condenser would be passed through a cooling tower to minimize
water usage.
Although the pulping chemicals would be recovered, there would be
inevitable losses, which would be made up by the addition of 60 kg/ton
(of paper) of saltcake and 30 kg/ton of limestone. These chemicals are
readily available from natural deposits in Turkey.



ANNEX 5
Page 10
A number of manufactured chemicals, principally papermaking ad-
ditives, would also be required. All these are now made in Turkey except
alum and gum.
About half of the process steam requirements would be provided
by the recovery boiler, and the other half would be generated in a separate
power boiler from heavy fuel oil and bark. The same fuel oil would be
used in the lime kiln and a3 a start-up auxilliary fuel in the recovery furnace.
Fuel oil requirements (without taking bark into account) would reach 77,500
tpa at plant capacity and would be supplied by tankship from the refinery at
Mersin.
Implementation
The industrial part of the project would be implementeod by SEKA
assisted by the Consulting Engineers, Sandwell and Company, Ltd., of
Vancouver, Canada. A contract has been signed between SEKA and Sandwell
to cover design development, detailed design, field supervision of
construction, and operational assistance until commercial operation is
under way.
The proposed implementation scheme is set forth in bar chart form
at the end of this Annex (World Bank 7846).
The first six months would be given over to design development.
During this period, the Consulting Engineer would expand in detail on the
technical and capital cost aspects of the feasibilities studies and would
bring the project to the point where all major technical decisions have
been made, capital costs defined in detail, administrative procedures
established, and all major equipment contracts could be let.  This work
would be carried out in the Consultant's office.  The results of this program
would be presented in a construction budget which would include a description
of the mill, basic arrangement drawings and flow diagrams, detailed capital
cost estimates, and detailed schedules for carrying out the work.
The construction budget would be the basis for control throughout
the project and it is therefore important that concepts agreed upon during
de.i:n development not be changed unless such changes are fully evaluated,
found proritable and approved by the Client for inclusion in the project.
Immediately upon SEKA's approval of the construction budget, which
is scheduled by July 1 , 1974, the Consulting Engineer would provide the
staff and facilities to launch tne detailed design program on a broad
front in their offices. Again, SEKA would have staff in the Consultant's
office who would participate in the work. The purchasing program for major
equipment would be concluded promptly to ensure the flow of engineering
design information from the vendors; control documentation for monitoring



AMIEX 5
Page I1
job progress would be established; site preparation contracts would be let
and secondary equipment purchasing commenced; and the preparation of detailed
structural, civil, mechanical, electrical and instrumentation drawings
started and completed in accordance with the schedule requirements.
Procurement would begin with the issuance of detailed specifications
and requests for tenders for all the major equipment about July 1, 1974.
Procurement would be on a toint basis with EIB under 1BRD rules for inter-
national competitive bidding. After evaluation of the tenders received for
the major equipment, it would be apparent whether the EIB loan could be fully
utilized without resorting to allocating some items to EIB during the later
secondary procurement phase. If not, appropriate allocation to EIB would
then have to be made. Procurement would also involve a final determination
of which equipment made in Turkey would be acceptable on this project.
Project control documentation would include engineering work lists
updated monthly, engineering progress reports, weekly construction progress
reports and construction cost accounting reports; the detailed engineering and
drawing program would be scheduled to dovetail with the planned construction
sequence.
The Consulting Engineer would also provide engineering supervision
at the site throughout the construction period, which would begin with site
preparation work about October 1, 1974. A nucleus field group consisting of
engineers from the Consulting Engineer and SEKA would be at the site to
control the field activities from the commencement of construction. The
nucleus staff would gradually be expanded as construction activity increased,
and the specialists on the staff would change in accordance with need. The
final work of the field engineers would be to assist in the checking out of
machinery and equipment and their interconnections prior to the full start-up,
which is scheduled to occur in the sawmill in early 1976 and in the pulp and
paper mill in early 1978.
It will be noted that the scheduled pulp and paper design and con-
struction period is four years, which is somewhat longer than would normally
be required. Every effort should be made to reduce the time to startup; it
is estimated that some 120 million TL (US$8.55 million) in price escalation
alone could be saved for every 12 months reduction in the schedule.
Operational Assistance Program
Because of the scarcity in Turkey of managerial, technical and
supervisory personnel witn the requisite skills, the Consulting Engineer
would also be engaged to provide operational assistance during the initial
years of project operation.
Preoperational assistance would be given starting in 19774 with a
sawmill manager and training coordinator, and would expand as required into
operations.  It is expected that all expatriates would be phased out by



ANNEX 5
Page 12
October 1, 1978. The purpose of the program would be to assist SEKA with the
preparation of the startup, the commissioning of the facilities and the
training of the mill personnel to satisfactory levels of proficiency in the
shortest possible time.
The general scope of the assistance program would be as follows:
1.  The provision of key expatriate personnel as required to achieve
the objectives of the program.
2. The establishment of an organization comprising the Consultant's
personnel and such other of SEKA's personnel as shall be necessary
for the operation of the mills.
3. The development of a detailed program of work which would be
presented in the form of network diagrams and which would identify
the sequence, timing and inter-relationships of all management
activities necessary for start-up and operation of the mills.
4. The development and supervision of training programs as required
for all personnel associated with the project.
5. The supervision of and assistance with preparation of instruction
manuals for the operation and maintenance of the mills.
6. Supervision of and assistance with the preparation of Policy and
Procedure Manuals where required to define the activities of the
organization.
7. Supervision of and assistance with the preparation of product
manufacturing and raw material specifications.
8.   Supervision of and assistance with the preparation of operating
budgets and standards against which performance after start-up
can be measured.
9. Participation in the acceptance procedures developed by the
engineering Consultant for taking over plant and equipment from
the supply contractors.
Whereas the precise requirements for expatriate personnel depend
upon the availability of trained personnel in Turkey with experience of the
degree required, it is presently envisaged that the expatriate team would
consist of the following:



ANNEX 5
Page 13
-    Manager of Sawmill and Wood Preparation
-    Coordinator, Systems and Training
-    Wood preparation Superintendent
-    Sawmill Shift Supervisor
-    Head Filer
-    Head Sawyer
-    Manager of Pulp and Paper Mill
-    Pulp Mill Superintendent
-    Paper Mill Superintendent
-    Utilities and Chemical Recovery Superintendent
-    Pulp Mill Shift Supervisor
-    Paper Mill Shift Supervisor
-    Engineering and Maintenance Superintendent
Each of the expatriates would be associated with a Turkish counter-
part, who, by the completion of the assistance program would have assumed
fully the responsibilities initially assumed by the expatriate specialist.
Conclusions
The Industrial Project is well prepared and ready for implementa-
tion. The conceptual design is nearly complete, so that detailed design
and engineering can commence now that the Consultant is hired. SEKA are
enthusiastic about working with consultants in the manner above described
because for the first time it will involve them intimately in the details
of the Project implementation. The stage is therefore set to get off with
a good start.

2FJTURE STTDIES
BAt2KGROUND
The series of studies that led up to the definition of the Antalya
Project, particularly the final feasibility study, have been well accepted
in Turkey by the relevant Governnent agencies, particularly the MF/GDP and
SEKA who will use thi's approach for the development of further forest industry
projects to meet the future needs of Turkey for forest products.
Since plans were already well advanced for the development of forest
industries in the northwest part of Turkey, tne government and the interna-
tional agencies 11 in January 1973 agreed that priority should be given to this
area.  An initial study of the Marmara and western Black Sea regions was under-
taken -- defined as a preliminary review at the preinvestment level, of the
size and nature of forest industry which the area might support. It was recog-
nized that some difficulties would be encountered in carrying out such a re-
gional study due to the absence of a national forest development plan.
At the request of the Government, the UNDP agreed to provide funds
for this preliminary study.  The Food and Agriculture Organization was appointed
executing agency for the project and Sandwell and Company Limited were retained
to do the work. The following subsections are based on their report.
Forest Operations
The northwest sector of Turkey along the Sea of Marmara and Western
Black Sea Coast (see "Marmara Region" on MAP 1), amounting to more than six
million hectares, comprises 32 percent of the forested area of Turkey and
contains a standing volume of 416,000,000 m3 overbark of decidous and conifer-
ous species. The present annual allowable cut (AAC) from the region would
satisfy projected demands for industrial logs only until 1977. Several alter-
native approaches to forest development and management were considered in the
study, to increase the production of industrial logs. The annual allowable
cut (AMC) for each approach would be:

from afforestation with exotic pines thereby allowing an accelerated
cutting of the mature and overmature existing forest.
/4   Involves adopting an afforestation program to plant triple the area
presently planned by the General Directorate of Afforestation (GDA);
the indicated AAC is achievable by 1993.
While the alternative AAC's examined are technically feasible, a significant
increase in forest operation would be required. For example, if the accel-
erated cutting of 1.5 million m3/A is adopted, the overall annual planting
program including reforestation would have to increase from 22,000 hectares
in 1973 to a possible 78,000 hectares in 1983. The major problems of finan-
cing, organization, and logistics associated with massive afforestation pro-
grams have been successfully resolved in other countries. One of the most
successful examples is in Brazil where the annual rate of afforestation has
been increased from 38,000 hectares in 1967 to 293,000 hectares in 1972. In
the Mediterranean area, Morocco, Portugal, and Spain have successful afforesta-
tion programs.

Future Raw Material Supplies
If it is assumed that:
(a)  The sulphite mill will be shut down at Izmit to reduce pollution,
the Caycuma and Dalaman mills will operate as at present and
that Antalya and Afyon will proceed as planned;
(b)  The paper denand mentioned above is met from locally produced
pulp;
tc)  The Marmara area continues to supply its present share, some
50 percent of national demand of sawnwood (by 1982 the area
would be expected to supply about 2,900,000 m3 annually);
(d)  Modest increases in plywood capacity for Turkey would develop
outside the study area, in which substantially all current
production capacity is located; and
(e)  About 110,000 tons of particleboard be developed within the
study area so that this area maintains its present proportion
of the national demand.
It can be shown that the demand for different types of wood for use in the
following products in 1982 would be as follows:
UsE                       1,000 m3/yr
Unbleached Kraft Pulp         410
Bleached Kraft Pulp           980

Total Deciduous             2,224

On this basis, the wood supply/demand balance in 1982 for the different
forest management schemes mentioned above would be as follows:
Accelerated Cut
Management Method: Current MF Modified Potential 1.0 Million 1.5 Million
(1,000 M3/A)

The tables clearly illustrate the very serious nature of the wood supply
situation within Turkey, particularly in the Marmara region, if present
forest management policies are continued. Unless accelerated cutting coupled
with massive afforestation is accepted there can be little further forest
industry development in the Marmara area.
Possible Industrial Development
For purposes of illustrating the industrial alternatives, it was
assumed that the principle of accelerated cutting will be accepted and a
total cut of 5,225,000 m3/yr will be available in 1983. Taking into account
the nature, type and location of wood supplies, the 1983 market requirements
and the potential plant sites available, Sandwell defined alternative combi-
nations of paper, pulp and mechanical wood products plants which best fitted
the future needs.
The combinations are described in the following table:

Costs, Profits
Rough estimates of the costs -- both capital and operating -- for
the various schemes, the gross income and hence, the gross profit, were made.
The Capital cost of forestry operations would be some 2.5 billion
TL ($180 million) between 1973 and 1982 and the gross return on this invest-
ment would be about 20 percent.
The capital cost of the various industrial alternatives range from
6.1 (Case IC) to 7.4 (Case II) billion TL ($435 to 530 million) with the gross
returns varying between 18 and 20%.
Conclusions
Two main conclusions emerged from the study:
(a) Viable forest industry developments can be foreseen for the
Marmara area which could satisfy Turkey's forest product needs
to the early 1980's.
(b) However, they would require a major change in forest management
(basically massive afforestation and accelerated cutting of
existing stands) and do not adequately take into account de-
velopments in other forest areas in Turkey.
FUTURE STUDIES PROGRAM
From the Marmara Pilot Study the outline of the program of future
studies that will be necessary to ensure timely development of Turkey's
forest resources emerges. The program would encompass several types of
studies:
--   Rough assessments of forest resources in other parts
of Turkey along the lines of the Marmara Pilot Study.
-- National policy papers on such issues as level of
environmental protection, system of forest management,
private versus public development, the place of the
cottage saw-mill, assessment of national demand for
forest products, etc.
-- Detailed techr.o-economic feasibility studies for spe-
cifically defined projects such as that done for the
Antalya Project.



ANNEX 6
Page 8
Given the level of likely investment - $600 -- $700 million in
only the Marmara region -- it is possible to roughly estimate the cost of
the studies by comparison to the Antalya case. On the Antalya Project the
feasibility study cost some $400,000 in foreign costs and 2.5 million TL in
local costs, a total of $580,000 equivalent and the investments will total
about $165 million equivalent. Thus for each $1 million of investment about
$3,500 of study cost were needed $2,400 of which was for foreign consultants.
If the same ratio applies, the feasibility studies needed for the Marmara
region alone would cost about $2.3 million.
The UINDP and FAO have made tentative estimates of study costs by
a preliminary identification of individual studies and an assessment of these
costs. The tentative estimates amount to $2.5 - 3.5 million.
FINANCING A STUDY PROGRAM
The UNDP and the EIB have both indicated willingness to participate
in financing the foreign exchange portion of the studies. They have urged
IBRD to also participate as the Bank is likely to be called upon to finance
continued investments and would be better placed to do so if it were intimately
involved in the study program.
A tentative financing scheme has been proposed in which,
-    the UNDP would contribute about $1 million, partly from
the Turkey Country Program and partly fromn the Adminis-
trator's Program Reserve, specifically the Investment
Feasibility Studies Fund;
-    the EIB would contribute $1.1 million from its existing
line of credit of 2.0 u.a. (about $2.5 million) to Turkey
for preinvestment studies, and
-    IBRD would contribute $0.4 as a "piggy-back" operation
to the Antalya Project.
The total funds of $2.5 million would be supplemented by Government
funds for local activities and possibly also for foreign expenses.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM
Much remains to be done to be done to finalize the details of im-
plementing the program, even though agreement in principle among all the par-
ticipating agencies of the need for and urgency of the program has been
reached.
The first step will be a joint meeting of the UNDP, FAO, EIB, IBRD
and relevant Government agencies to draw up a detailed list of studies, their
te-,ms of reference, budget, timing, and method of execution. Assignment of



ANNEX 6
Page 9
specific studies to specific financing sources will follow. A means of coor-
dinating the future activities, particularly in Turkey, will have to be de-
vised. Certainly regular progress meetings will be held at which the inter-
ested parties will participate.
The joint meeting is presently being planned and should be held in
early January 1974. The first studies could be commissioned by March 1974 with
completion by the end of that year. Major investments could thus be called
for by early 1975.
IBRD PARTICIPATION
In view of
-    the importance of this national resource based sector
of Turkey's economy;
-    the significant role IBRD has played thus far in its
development;
-    the need for massive funding for its future development,
and
-    the likelihood that IBRD will be called upon to help in
the financing.
It is recommended that IBRD funds of up to $0.4 million be made
available to the Government for studies, to be spent at the discretion of
Bank Management in accordance with normal Bank practice for preinvestment
studies.

TRANSPORTATION
Transportation for the project's paper products will be arranged
and paid for by the purchasers. Tne detailed marketing and distribution sys-
tem for the sawnwood has not been finalized but will be studied and imple-
mented as part of the Project. In the Antalya region large quantities of raw
materials as well as fuel oil and other supplies will have to be transported
by SEKA.
The average annual quantities of the major items to be transported
are:
586,000 m           Wood from Antalya region to Mill,
average distance 125 km
112,000 m3          Wood from Adana/Mersin to Mill,
average distance 400 km
182,000 m3           Sawnwood, about 50% to Istanbul,
distance 800 km, average distance for rest
400 km
71,000 tons         Linerboard,
estimated average distance 600 km
49,000 tons         Sackkraft,
estimated average distance 600 km
80,000 tons         Fuel oil,
average distance 500 km
Existing Facilities
The Antalya region is almost entirely dependent on truck
transportation. No rail facilities exist. The nearest rail connections are
at Isparta 150 kilometers to the north, and at Mersin 450 kilometers to the
east. Sea transportation is limited to small coastal vessels generally hand-
ling bulk items such as coal. Their size, configuration, and absence of
handling gear do not favor their use for paper products. Within Turkey, road
systems are well developed and generally of a high standard. Within Antalya,
the coast road from Antalya to Adana-Mersin is narrow and winding. The road
from Antalya to the Anatolean Plateau is winding with many steep grades.  Thus
within the Antalya region there are some speed and vehicle size restrictions.
The privately owned trucking system has a sufficient amount of trucks
to provide necessary transportation for the wood, other inputs and finished
products of the Project. Truck availability is said to exceed demand by a
wide margin. The truck industry is reported to be operating nation-wide at



ANNEX 7
Page 2
only 40% capacity. Most trucks it Turkey are 5 - 8 ton, single-axle units
usually owner-driven. Larger trucks cannot be contemplated for the Project
unless highway improvements are carried out by the Turkish Government on the
Antalya-Isparta road.
Wood Hauling
When full capacity is reached in 1981, it is estimated that wood
transport will require one truck to arrive every three minutes at tne plant
site during working hours. The large number of trucks will require:
- Very careful planning between SEKA and MOF that the right truck
is sent to the right part of the forest at the right time to
pick up the right load i.e., logistics planning will become a
major task for the Mill Management.
- Improvement of the existing highway near the mill, particularly
the section through the town of Manavgat (a bypass may be
needed), the section from Manavgat to the mill site, and access
from the highway to the mill road (over- or underpass).
In addition, it is likely that constraints on truck availability
could arise at certain seasons during the peak hauling of agricultural
produce.
Product Hauling
Typical rates from the Antalya millsite to the key market centres
and for different truck types have been calculated and presented below:
Comparison of Truck Rates to Main Market Centres
Destination    Distance  6 Ton Unit       20 Ton Unit
km       TL/ton           TL/ton
Istanbul          804         270              214
Ankara            629         227              172
Izmir             621         224              170
Adana/Mersin      403        .145          Not Usable
At present, there is a wide range of rates for truck freight depending upon
the availability of backhaul cargo, seasonal demand, road conditions and com-
petition.
Potential for Sea Transportation
In view of the large quantities and distances in truck transporta-
tion involved, other possibilities such as sea transport have been studied by
Sandwell.



A-NNEX 7
Page 3
It is believed that the coast of Turkey offers great potential for
the development of a sea transportation system employing tugs and barges.
In terms of Antalya such a system would be attractive because:
1.  Three of the four major consumption centres are on the coast.
2.  Distances are well within the normally accepted economic
working range of a tug and barge system.
3.  The small tidal differences minimize loading and unloading
difficulties.
4.  The incidence of storms is low and there are many areas of
protected water which offer shelter.
The cost of transportation of all product shipments from Antalya
to water destinations has been developed using a tug and barge system. The
estimate is based on an annual quantity of 120,000 tons of paper and 75,000
tons of sawnwood. No backhaul cargo has been included. The estimate is
based on the use of 3,000 ton barges and 1,500 hp tugs. Where possible tan-
dem tows using two barges have been used.
Based on the foregoing, two tugs and seven barges would be required
at a total investment of 50,000,000 TL. Construction of the vessels is with-
in the capability of the Turkish shipbuilding industry although some compo-
nents, mainly engines, would need to be imported.
Some improvement in dock facilities might be required at the receiv-
ing ports but this has not been included in the estimates.
Freight rates using a tug and barge system have been estimated and
compared with truck rates in the table below. Present and potential freight
rates for product shipments from Antalya to main market centres include all
operating and capital charges.
Comparative Freight Rates
Rate TL/ton
Destination          Tug and Barge        6 Ton Truck    20 Ton Truck
Istanbul                 171                  270              214
Izmir                    146                  224              170
Mersin                   158                  145         Not UsabLe
Conclusion
The foregoing estimates clearly indicate that savings in product
freight costs can be achieved by use of either large trucks or a tug and barge
system. It is conceivable that if sufficient coast traffic from other indus-
tries could be developed, particularly of a backhaul nature, that further



ANNEX 7
Page 4
reductions in the tug and barge freight rates over and above those indicated
might be achieved.
There are however certain pertinent observations which must be
made:
(a) Under the present Turkish market system, the mill will not
have to sell its paper products on a delivered basis nor
is it in any way required to arrange transportation.
Therefore, no savings would accrue to the project itself
from implementation of a tug and barge system on over 60
percent of the cargo shipped because the customer pays
whatever freight rate is involved.
(b) The existing privately owned trucking system has sufficient
trucks to provide necessary delivery service.
Based on the foregoing, there would be little justification for the
Antalya Establishment itself to become involved in the investment and opera-
tions of sea transport facilities. However, as the data reveals, considerable
savings and benefits in economic terms would accrue, particularly if the
potentials for other industries are taken into consideration. Therefore, it
is recommended that the Government seriously consider a study evaluating the
various aspects of the establishment of sea transport facilities. Studies of
road improvements around Manavgat should also be made.
With regard to the wood raw material and other supplies, the
Antalya Establishment cannot avoid deep involvement in the transport economics
and arrangements. As part of the project implementation (see Annex 5), SEKA
and its consultants will, at an early stage, have to prepare detailed trans-
portation plans. In particular, they will have to establish the basis on
which they will engage the private truckers to ensure that they meet their
commitments. The costs of these planning activities are included under the
"consultant services" in the capital cost estimate.



ANNEX 8

PLANT SITE AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Background
The Antalya area is well known for natural beauty, historical sites,
and delightful climate.  Consequently, it stands high on the priority list
for development by the Ministry of Tourism. Pulp and paper plants are equally
well known for their degrading effect on the environment where they are lo-
cated.  Simultaneous development in the Antalya region of tourism and a large
pulp and paper plant would therefore seem to be on a collision course.
However, from the start of studies to develop the area (especially
the Poyry and Sandwell studies), it was recognized that modern tecnology
would enable reduction of the degrading effect of a pulp and paper plant to a
level where it would not interfere with tourism or the population. Detailed
examination of plant sites away from the major tourist areas were made even
though cost penalties would result. An interministerial committee composed
of representatives of all interested Government ministries, including Tourism,
the SP0, and SEKA, evaluated 10 potential plant sites in the Manavgat area,
and finally selected the site furthest from Side, the major tourist develop-
ment in the area. SEKA agreed to this selection even though the site will
cost over TL 45 million more than the site SEKA preferred.
Great care has gone into minimizing harmful effects the plant may
have by:
-    detailed evaluation of 10 plant sites;
-    in-plant design to maximize recycling of process water and
air and thereby minimize harmful effluents being released
to the environment;
-    inclusion of effluent treatment facilities;
-    ensuring that the plant site will have the maximum
aesthetic appeal.
Choice of Plant Site
The selection of a pulp mill site is almost always a compromise
since requirements are often contradictory. Ideally, one would want:
a location which minimizes transportation cost - near
the centre of wood supply;



ANNEX 8
Page 2
good connections to take products to major business
centres;
an adequate and economical supply of process water;
an economic means of disposing of liquid effluents and
where the effects of air emissions will be minimal;
an economical supply of fuel and electric power;
good physical conditions such as sufficient land available
(also for expansion), good foundation conditions, no need
for major earthworks, and protection from floods and
earthquakes;
-    a location close to population and recreation centres to
provide a source of operating labor, housing, and the
required social facilities such as schools, hospitals and
stores.
The prime choice, dictated by the topography (mountains of the
Anatolian Plateau, and a coastal plain along the Mediterranean Sea) was a main
highway going from Antalya to Alanya.  Only in two places do the spur roads
of the coastal highways penetrate to the interior - one is the main link to
Ankara via Isparta, and tlhe other a much more inferior road to Konya.
Wood must go first to the coastal road before going anywhere else.
An inland location, studies show, would have enormous transportation costs.
There are also difficulties of water supply and effluent disposal.
Transportation Situation
If the maximum amount of wood available to the project is all
delivered to any one of the potential sites, the average wood cost is vir-
tually equal as shown by transport studies.  The reason for this is the
spreadout nature of the forest resources over the whole region (see also
Map 1). Regarding transport connections for product shipment, the sites all
require the building of a high quality road to connect with the main highway.
The length of this connecting road does not exceed 10 km for any site, and is
only 2 km for the selected site.
Water Supply.
The availability of process water to supply the plant's needs of
nearly 1 m3/sec is difficult and uncertain at all potential sites except
those with access to Manavgat River. Only the Manavgat River has sufficient
excess water when present and future irrigation potential is taken into account,
as shown in the following Table.

Future Surplus (Shortage)           (52)     (0.3)   (22.8)  (13.3)       15.1
Disposal of Effluents
At all the sites, treated liquid effluents would be discharged into
the sea. The effluent would be treated to render it harmless to the receiv-
ing water and to reduce its coloring effect so it will not be noticed. This
will necessitate construction of on-shore treatment facilities and a sub-
marine disposal pipeline long enough that the effluent will be discharged at
a depth and in an area of current activities to ensure it is adequately
diluted. No serious physical difficulties are expected in laying the
approximately 1.5 km underwater portion of the pipeline.
The current thinking on disposal of gaseous emissions is that after
in-plant treatment to reduce odour and noxious gases to the minimum, they
would be gathered for disposal to the atmosphere through a single high stack.
This should give sufficient lift and dispersion to any remaining pollutants
to make them undetectable at ground level except during periods of major
plant malfunction - which should be rare.
No serious air pollution problem is therefore expected and a1l
the sites could be described as acceptable in this respect. However, the
sites do differ in the proximity of settled and/or future population, and
prevailing wind directions and therefore in the marginal effect that gaseous
emissions may have. The prevailing wind direction is on- and off- shore
breezes, and only 2% of the time with east and west winds that blow along
the beaches.
Aesthetic Effect
Factory buildings and plant layout will be designed for high
aesthetic standards as well as technical performance. The use of landscaping,
natural and planted screenings of trees, and screenings from the lay of land
will all be used to greatest effect to prevent the intrusion of the plant
from degrading the natural beauty of the area.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Fuel and Power Supplie
Electrical power is available at all sites from the private company
which operates the Kepez Power Station and which buys power from the state-
operated Turkish Electrical Authority grid (TEK). Some differences in trans-
mission line costs will occur between sites. The average power cost would be
appr. 200 TL/14iH, about twice the price paid in North America.
However, most of the power needs will be generated on site (93%)
using the steam generated in the chemical recovery and power boilers. Power
supply from the grid is not reliable enough to be the major source of energy.
Supplemental fuel needs will be met by heavy fuel oil delivered by tankships
from the refinery at Mersin to an offshore submarine pipeline unloading sta-
tion.
Physical Site Conditions
The chosen site has sufficient land for an industrial complex of
the size contemplated. Future expansion would not be hampered by lack of
space.
Environmental Impact
SEKA is already engaged in carefully assessing the impact of the
plant on the environment and ensuring that adequate measures are taken to
keep the impact within tolerable limits. SEKA therefore hired consultants
from TW Beak and Co., a subsidiary of Sandwell and Company, well reputed
in environmental work, to assist in this effort. The consultants drew up
a matrix to measure the environmental impact - a technique recommended by
the US Geological Survey to put some numbers to otherwise qualitative judge-
ments. A copy of the matrix is given on page 6.
It shows each possible action caused by the construction and
operation of the plant and its impact - positive and negative - with each
segment of the environment. From a scale of 1 to 10, weights are attached
to the magnitude and importance on each segment of the environment.
The matrix shows that the specific actions with the most important
impac-. are:
1.  Pulp Mill Processing
2.   Air Emissions
3.   Aquaeous Emissions
4.   Paper Hill Processing
5.   Wood harvesting



ANNEX 8
Page 5
The environmental characteristics most affected by the proposed
actions are:
1.   Scenic View (Aesthetics)
2.   Ocean Quality at Side
3.   Ocean Quality at Misirilhir (West of $ide)
4.   Ocean Quality at the plant
5.   Bathing
From this assessment and a knowledge of the processes involved,
Beak was able to suggest appropriate remedial measures as shown below:
Remedial Measures to Reduce Impacts
Air Emissions
The characteristic kraft mill odor is due to the presence of a
mixture of hydrogen sulphide, methyl mereaptan, dimethyl sulphide and
dimethyl disulphide.  The characteristic odour threshold values of these
compounds and sulphur dioxide produced in the furna¢es are:

Methyl mercaptan          rotten cabbage            0.0021 ppm

Sulfur dioxide            acrid, burning            0.47   ppm
In addition, the kraft mill may discharge particulates into the atmosphere
from the recovery furnace, lime kiln and smelt tank (caused mainly by the
carry-over of solids plus the sublimation and condensation of inorganic
chemicals such as sodium sulphate and sodium carbonate).
To reduce odours to the minimum, the pulp mill will be designed
with a low-odour type recovery furnace. Foul condensates will be stripped
and blown to the power boiler where they will be burned and non-condensible
odorous gases from the batch digesters will be collected in a "vaposphere"
and fed to the lime kiln for burning after being first scrubbed with white
liquor to remove sulphur compounds. In addition, black liquor storage tanks
and washer filtrate tanks will be connected to the brown stock washer hood
exhaust and these gases will be burned in the recovery boiler. These inplant
air emission control systems will keep obnoxious air emissions to levels as
low as best available technology offers.
To reduce particulates, an electrostatic precipitator on the re-
covery furnace will remove 99% of particulate emissions. In addition, every
consideration would be given to optimum operation of chip handling and blow-
ing operations to ensure that chip dust does not blow off the property.
However, regardless of how well the mill is designed, there still
will remain some odorous gases which will be discharged into the atmosphere.
The detection of the gases at ground level will be dependent on local meteoro-
logical conditions and the conditions of discharge. Beak concluded that a
stack 130 to 200 m high carrying all discharges, smelt tank, lime kiln, mud
washer, vents flue gases, etc. would probably reduce the ground level odours
to levels below detection. The exact height of the stack would need to be
determined during the detailed engineering design phase of the project. In
addition, a high stack with reheating of the flue gases by combining hotter
drier flue gases from other sources (power boiler) would minimize water vapor
emissions which create fog and which usually invite adverse public reaction
since anything visible coming out of a stack is "pollution". A tall stack
also has the advantage that it does not rely on operating skill for perform-
ance (but the disadvantage of being clearly visible).
It is therefore concluded that the pulp mill can be designed and
properly operated to virtually eliminate any noticeable impact of odour to
local inhabitants or to tourists passing through the area.



A:EX 8
Aquaeous Emissions
Untreated kraft mill wastes give rise to many forms.of water pollu-
tion. They can be conveniently discussed under the following headings:
-    Suspended solids
-    BOD
-    Colour
-    Odor and Taste
Suspended solids include bark, fibre, lime and fly ash which will
settle to the bottom of receiving waters and suffocate bottom dwelling
organisms (invertebrates). Suspended solids also produce aesthetic impairment,
causing fouling of fishing lines and nets, and spoiling of lake or sea bottom
areas for swimming. Some suspended solids float.as fibre mats. However,
most organic suspended solids settle and can form sludge deposits which fre-
quently become anaerobic producing odorous gases.
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) concentrations of untreated kraft
mill effluents are high and when discharged to a receiving stream can pro-
duce conditions of reduced oxygen concentration. These low oxygen levels
in natural waters have.a debilitating or damaging effect on the aquatic com-
munity and can cause fish kills. This condition is most severe when.effluents
are discharged to small rivers and lakes where dilution is not great. Effluent
discharges to the sea receive a la:ger dilution and it is not believed that
reduced oxygen levels will create a problem at the proposed mill site.
Kraft mill effluent is often a dark colour which reduces light
penetration through the surface waters thereby inhibiting phytoplankton
productivity. At a dilution of 100;1 after discharge to the sea the colour
of the effluent would be reduced from a conservatively estimated 400 colour
units to 4 colour units. The resultant colour is considered acceptable
under normal conditions. It would not be noticeable in a jar of water, but
most probably.would be observed by boaters and from the air, and would appear
as a yellowish-brown tinge to swimmers in the immediate vicinity.
The wastes have an unpleasant odour and taste, and can cause fish
flesh tainting.
The design of the mill will ensure that effluents contain a mini-
mum of these harmful pollutants when they are discharged for treatment:
-    The basic design philosophy recommends the maximum reuse
of contamiinated process waste waters in the mill. Clean
uncontaminated cooling waters will be separated in a closed
sewer system and discharged to sea by-passing the treat-
ment facilities;



ANNEX 8
Page 9
-    Inpiant measures will include the maximum reduction of
major sources of BOD, odour and toxicity before discharge
to treatment. For example, foul condensates will be
stripped prior to discharge to treatment;
-    the process systems will be designed for operating simpli-
city to minimize upsets or spills.
The two principal areas of concern for liquid waste discharges
will therefore be suspended solids and colour, and the effluent treatment
facilities will be installed to reduce these pollutants. The degree
of treatment will be such as to ensure that under severe conditions, the
effluent is not noticeable to boaters and bathers in the Side region. The
following measures will be taken:
-    maximum suspended solids removal will be achieved using
a primary clarifier with a very low upflow rate of approx-
imately 500 gallons per sq. ft. per day and with an inner
reaction zone where coagulants such as alum and polyelec-
tolyte can be added to enhance suspended solids removal
efficiency. A significant quantity of colour will also be
removed in this process.
-    The sludge from the clarifier will be dewatered and land
disposed on the mill site. Appropriate reclamation of the
disposal site by the planting of trees and grasses will
minimize its aesthetic impact.  The disposal site could
be used for other mill refuse as well.
-    Clarifier supernatent liquid would then flow by gravity
to one of two - 10 hour settling lagoons. A 24 hour em-
ergency spill basin would also be available to collect
both high suspended and dissolved solids spills.
-    The effluent will then be discharged to sea through an
extended diffused outfall long enough to discharge
effluent at a point with sufficient dilution to create a
submerged effluent dispersion field and eliminate any
surface effluent plume. The length of the outfall pipe
would be established following detailed in situ oceano-
graphic monitoring of currents, and temperature-salinity
profiles and could be 1.5 km or more long.
Biological treatment to reduce BOD is not considered necessary be-
cause of the large assimilative capacity of the sea. In the unlikely event
that sea currents are found to be negligible then biological treatment will
have to be considered. Beak also recommends that land irrigation be invest-
igated.



ANNEX 8
Page 10
Aesthetics
The flow of trucks is expected to be about one every three minutes
during working hours. To minimize the cultural impact of this activity, it
is recommended that highway No. 6 between Manavgat and the millsite be improved
to provide good traffic circulation past the site and that rapid exit and
access ramps be built at the jluetion of highway No. 6 and the access road
leading to the lmillsite.   Ocean transport to and from the site would reduce
the number and frequency of trucks to the site substantially and in the long-
term would be considered preferable and more economic (see Annex 7).
The visual impact of industrial buildings can be minimized by
careful architectural design.  The high stack could be painted a colour such
as olive brown to blend with the nattural pastoral setting. Careful location
of social and administrative buildings will enhance the aesthetics as will
attention to'landscaping,'especially the preservation of as many of the
existing-scrub pine trees on the site as possible.
Outline of Follow-Up Studies
The optimum design for the treatment and disposal of air and water
emissions requires that further studies be commissioned immediately. These
would also help to establish a comprehensive pre-operational environmental
baseline. 'Subsequent follow-up post-operational surveys to be performed
annually would then be able to demonstrate what changes, if any, have occurred,
and what corrective' actions may be necessary.
An outline of the studies recommended by Beak is given here:
Air Survey
A small-meteorological station should be installed at the site
to supplement the Government Station at Manavgat to record the following
parameters three times daily:
Wind direction
Wind speed
Ambient temperature and humidity
Precipitation
Cloud coverage
Barometric pressure
In addition, a weather balloon should be available to record the altitude
temperature profile to determine the existence as well as the extent of
inversion conditions.
Approximately five fixed S02 and dustfall stanchion stations
should be constructed in the vicinity of the proposed site. Samples would
be collected monthly at each station to measure dustfall and sulphate rate
prior to startup of the mill, and total reduced sulphur compounds after
startup.



ATEX 8
Page 11
Oceanographic Survey
The direction and magnitude of the subsurface and surface currents
should be determined at different periods of the year. Drift drogue studies
should be conducted during three periods of the year - August, December and
May. In addition, a recording flowmeter should be installed 1.5 - 2.0 km
offshore to provide a continuous record of currents.
Accurate sonar soundings are required in the vicinity of the proposed
outfall extending 4 km from the shoreline. Underwater marine photographs
should be taken along the proposed pipeline route and several core samples
collected from the bottom to point out any problems which might be encountered
in laying the outfall pipe.
Temperature salinity gradients should be established at several
stations to assist in understanding and predicting water movement patterns,
and in calculating effluent buoyancy. Basic seawater characteristics should
be established at the same time. Analyses should include BOD5, dissolved
oxygen, total and dissolved solids, suspended solids, turbidity, pH, colour
and transparency. The chemical characterization studies should be conducted
during offshore wind conditions three times during the year to coincide with
the three proposed current surveys.
A mobile laboratory could be purchased by SEKA for all scientific
anaylses and used later by the mill Environmental Control Department following
plant startup.
Biological Surveys
Four baseline surveys should be conducted over a two year period
prior to startup to collect information on the type of species, number,
average size and other biological data on fish, benthos (macro-invertebrates),
plankton, intertidal organisms and bottom sediments in the waters in the
vicinity of the plant and the proposed outfall discharge. The surveys should
be continued after startup to obtain comparative data to measure the effect
of the plant.
Environmental Impact of Forestry Operations
The principles of forest management will give utmost importance to
maintaining and improving environmental quality concomitant with maximum
yield and optimizing productivity. This will require an intensity of forest
management hitherto not practiced in the Antalya region, and arrangements are
in hand to ensure that it will be available.
Economically, the most desirable method of forest management would
be to concentrate effort into a few large clearcut blocks, but there are
several reasons as to why this is not possible. The available labour force



ANNEX 8
Page 12
could not be fully utilized without wholesale movement of forest villages
and the use of large camps. The requirements of amenity and aesthetics for
the local people and tourists will demand that cutting blocks be limited in
size.
The silvicultural requirements of some species dictate other than
clearcut logging. For example, Abies, a shade demander, must be managed under
a selection system. Where natural regeneration is to be induced, a system of
group cutting or strip clearcutting is indicated. In addition, much of the
forest is made up of scattered small stands, so that the area of forestry
operatons will be controlled and widely distributed. Rather than attempt to
achieve economies of scale with each cutting block it is more appropriate to
concentrate a series of smaller working units within an area and achieve
economies in this manner.
The sizes of clearcut blocks may vary but would not be greater
than 100 ha. Most blocks should be within the 40 - 60 ha range. These size
blocks should not cause serious soil erosion, as soil engineering will be
practiced. Even so, in the event of unusually large amounts of precipitation
any of the feasible erosion control measures may fail. However, it is equally
true that the forest in its present state also fails to prevent disastrous
erosion in such rare instances.
Conclusion
Matters are well in hand to ensure that the industrial plant's impact
on the environment is held within acceptable limits. The implementing
authorities are sensitive to the need to pay strict attention to this matter
and the necessary steps are under way to ensure that the Plant and its
effluent treatment facilities are properly designed, engineered and constru-
cted. In addition, a program has been established to constantly monitor
environmental impacts to ensure that they will not get out of hand.

** Estimated.
Paper consumption has risen at an average annual growth rate of
about 13% between 1960 and 1972. The average annual growth rate since 1965
has been about 8%. This is a considerable growth rate considering the re-
straints of importation and the relatively high price for paper products
in Turkey, Therefore, additional latent demand can be assumed once procedures
for obtaining paper and prices become more consumer oriented. The forecast
on the next page was prepared by the FAO/UNDP Project in 1971 and is based
on 1969 figures. It also gives a breakdown for several paper products.

This forecast assumes an annual growth rate of 9.3%.  Forecasts
of total paper consumption in 1982 prepared by SEKA, SPO and others between
1969 and 1971 range from 760,000 to 1.1 million.
Imports for the Turkish paper industry in recent years have been
newsprint, pulp and packaging papers, etc. It is expected that import
needs will continue though some temporary ease has taken place because of
the start-up operation of three large plants. With several new plants
increasing production, SEKA dominates pulp and paper, whereas only three
Rills in the private sector are of any significance. In general terms
their paper capacity is approximately as follows:

A new mill is under study by SEKA for the Marmara Region to
produce bleached kraft pulp and bleached printing and writing papers. A
50,000 ton bleached market pulp mill is under contract to be built near
Afyon for SEKA using reeds and straw as raw material.
The actual production of the SEKA mills on a year-by-year and a
product basis is shown in Annex 3. The average capacity utilization of the
SEKA plants was only about 80% in 1972, due to the start-up difficulties of
the Dalaman plant.  The presently established production capacity of 370,000
about equals the present apparent consumption.
To meet the rapidly increasing paper demand in Turkey and to
utilize the available forest resources several additional production facilities
will have to be built in the forthcoming years (see Annex 16). It is esti-
mated that the potential wood resources would enable Turkey to economically
establish paper production facilities to satisfy the projected growth of
demand and therefore would eliminate a major part of the needs for importa-
tion for the foreseeable future.

Past and Present Situation
The absence of a mandatory system of reporting production statis-

** State Planning Office data; 1972 estimated.
The figures in this Table must be viewed broadly.  Sawnwood con-
sumption is cyclical in most markets of the world depending upon economic
conditions generally. However, the erratic growth pattern in Turkey in cer-
tain years is suspect. The annual average increase in consumption in the de-
cade 1962-1972 is about 10.5% on the basis of the figures in this Table.  If
the 1962 figure provided by the SP0 is accepted the rate is reduced to about
8%. The figure of 2,860,000 m3 provided by the SPO for the year 1970 recon-
ciles closely with an FAO/UNDP figure of 2,820,000 m3 in the same year. The
FAO/UNDP estimates 2,256,000 m3 gor construction uses only in 1970.  The
residual production of 620,000 m is being used for non-construction purposes
such as shipbuilding, furniture, transportation, and.for export. On this
basis, construction sawnwood accounts for about 80% of the total market.
All local roundwood and sawnwood consumption is being met by
local production. Recently there have been reported imports of pulpwood
from Canada, but this is expected to be temporary due to low felling activi-
ties last winter and present unexpected high demand for wood.  In past years,
pulp wood has been imported from Russia. Turkey was also importing sawnwood
before 1963.
Exports of sawnwood are also undertaken but in limited amounts
and mainly in beech and fir from the Black Sea region. In 1972, about 50,000
m3 have been exported. There are no imports of sawnwood.

Forecasted Situation
There have been a number of studies by the FAO/UNDP Project and
by Turkish Government authorities with a view to estimating future sawnwood
requirements. These studies have been based on both regression analysis and
end-use analysis. Regression aaalyses were based on projections of cement
consumption (incorporating the trend of building activities), or Gross
National Product as the independent variable. There was a fairly wide varia-
tion in the projected values in 1977 and 1982 by the application of the three
conventional regression formulae y = a + bx, log y - a + b log x and y - a +
b log x. The comparative values are shown below.

Gross National Product      y - a + b log x         3,594,000        4,334,000
The studies carried out by the FAO Team were more searching in analysis of
wood use in the various end-use applications and, in addition to considering
perpetuation of current building practices, gave consideration to changing
patterns of use likely to be implemented with the adoption of new technology
and materials. The projected demand rates for construction sawnwood in
Turkey under the assumed conditions were:
1.   Continuance of present practices        4.3% annual increase to 1982.
2.   Implementation of new technology
and materials                     3.3% annual increase to 1982.
The conclusion of the FAO/UNDP Project was that the rate of 4.3 percent would
more likely apply since a pronounced trend to new methodology, materials, or
smaller housing units was unlikely to develop in the short-term future.
Since a relatively low growth rate of 4.3% for sawuwood on a
national basis is expected, future roundwood production should be sufficient
to meet the sawnwood demand. But future roundwood needs for paper production
are more difficult to predict since several major paper projects will be
needed within a relatively short period. Therefore it is important that
future paper production is closely tied to wood production as it has been
in the Antalya Project.

Source:  1960-1969, FAO Technical Report FOR:  SF126, 1970.
1970-1972, Estimates prepared on basis of interviews with converters.
Over the twelve year period from 1960 to 1972, the total,indicated
increase in consumption of containerboard has been about 475 percent, at an
average annual rate of 15-1/2 percent, starting from a very low level. Refer-
ence to the year to year growth shows an erratic pattern around the 15-1/2%
average. During the last 10 years, the large state-owned monopoly, Tekel,
which produces and distributes tobacco, alcoholic beverages, beer, sugar and
tea, moved from wooden packing cases to corrugated containers. The impact of
this conversion was very significant since Tekel is presently the largest
user of containers in Turkey. They used about 15 percent of all supplies.
From this time on Tekel's requirements will reflect only the growth in the
demand for its products, since the conversion to corrugated containers is
essentially complete.



ANNEX 9
Page 7
At the time of the field interviews with end-users and converters
there was universal evidence of a major supply deficiency in the market for
containerboard. There is no scientific basis for estimating the degree of
that shortage, since convertors did not keep accurate records of orders which
they refused and undoubtedly much of the indicated shortage in supply repre-
sents duplicated inquiries to two or more converters which would naturally
indicate a stronger market demand than in fact exists.
Estimates of true demand if adequate supplies were available
to converters must be largely subjective. Bearing in mind that some of
those interviewed in 1972 had also been interviewed in 1971 when the market
was in a state of real depression and saw nothing but gloom in the future,
the current demand for containers is probably 20% to 40% above the indicated
consumption for 1972. The Table below is based upon the actual estimated
consumption of containerboard for 1972 as shown in the previous Table - about
39,000 tons.

For purposes of this projection it is assumed that a latent demand of between
25 percent and 35 percent is the most reasonable estimate of the latent or
unsupplied market for containerboard and linerboard.
Consumption in Relation to Other Countries
Among countries using linerboard Turkey ranks low despite the
very rapid relative increases in usage which have occured during the past
decade. It is interesting to see how Turkey stands in relation to two other
countries which are both contiguous in location and may be assumed to have
reached an intermediate position in terms of their economic development.
These two countries are Israel, for which market studies were carried out
as a segment of this report, and Greece.
The Tables below and on the next page compare the usage of
linerboard in Turkey with that in Greece and Israel in relation to some
of these indicators.

If some simple relationships between linerboard use and the other factors
in the Table above are developed as measures indicating the significance of
linerboard in the economy, the following appears:
Relative Usage Factors for Linerboard

Usage in Kg per $1,000,000 of Exports         4.6          6.1        3.5
These figures show a reasonable similarity of consuming patterns in Turkey
and Greece in terms of the relationship between GNP and linerboard use but
Greece's total consumption per capita is 4 times that of Turkey while
Israel's is about 25 times as large.
Turkey lags in the usage of both linerboard and packaging. Greece
and Israel use imported supplies of both at internationally competitive prices.
Israel's dominant position is due in large measure to an export-oriented econ-
o;ay.
Sources of Supply
At the time of the market investigations all linerboard being
used in Turkey was obtained from domestic sources. With availability of do-
mestic linerboard from the recently completed paper manufacturing facilities
at Caycuma, regulations have been invoked with a view to curtailing imports.
Statistical reporting procedures are not mandatory in Turkey. The Brussels
nomenclature has been adopted by the Turkish Government in classifying paper
and paperboard grades. Export statistics of the major linerboard exporting
countries in North America and Northern Europe indicate that Turkish imports
were between 5,000 and 8,000 tons in 1970. SEKA operates kraft mills at
Caycuma and Dalaman which produce kraft linerboard. Linerboard production
in Turkey is spasmodic. Linerboard has been manufactured at Izmit, Caycuma
and Dalaman. The market pressure for sackkraft has given that grade priority
at Caycuma. Some linerboard production has been temporarily switched to
the Dalaman mill.



ANNEX 9
Page 9
In addition, to the supplies of linerboard produced by SEKA at
its three mills, some "bogus" linerboard and corrugating medium has been
produced by small mills operating in the Istanbul area. The production from
these mills is small. Their main product line is either boxboard or low
grade wrapping and bag papers. None of them provides a substantial base for
expansion into bogus liner production on a greatly increased scale.
The Corrugated Container Converting Industry
The corrugated container industry in Turkey is new. In the
last 5 years, growth in production has been rapid. It is estimated that in
1960 only about 7,500 tons of containerboard were produced in Turkey (at
Izmit). Current production of containerboard is at the rate of nearly 40,000
tons per year. The following Table lists the corrugated container converting
plants presently operating in Turkey.

Only the three largest of the mills can be regarded as modern converting
operations. The smaller mills employ unsophisticated but often ingenious
home-made equipment which nonetheless turns out containers of acceptable
standards. Three additional plants could be built by 1980. One of these
would be in Izmir, one in Ankara, with a third on the Mediterranean coast.
The Mersin-Adana area appears to be the most logical Mediterranean site in
view of the large potential offered by the fruit industry and the rapid
development of secondary industry in the region,
Despite supply shortages, some of the converters are sales-oriented
and provide a high standard of service.
Use of -Linerboard
The structure of the Turkish economy, the nature of its exports,
and the high cost of corrugated containers when compared to wood, have
combined to restrict the market. Corrugated containers have made headway in
applications where the cost is a subordinate consideration and convenience of
paperboard over wooden cases provides very evident advantages to producers.



ANNEX 9
Page 10
A comparison of the end-use consumption patterns for Turkey and
the United States shows the same general ranking of end-use applications in
both countries with the soft consumer items being the most important product
group, followed by durable consumer products, and industrial products.
In Turkey there is concentration of use in the soft consumer group
of products. This accounts for at least 2/3rd of the total consumption of cor-
rugated containers. Export shipment use is of comparative insignificance. A
further insignificant tonnage is used for shipping of fruit and vegetables.
Likely future trends of this situation are summarized below:
(a)  Wooden cases will continue to be the dominant packaging material;
Corrugated containers will take an increasing share of the market,
especially in the packaging of industrially produced..and higher
value consumer products;
(b) No important conversion from wooden cases in the domestic agri-
cultural trade can be expected until corrugated container prices
are substantially lower than wood;
(c) The export packaging of fruits and vegetables offers the largest
single potential market for corrugated containers, but prices
are still too high. Also, the generally lower quality of the
containerboard, and the absence of integrated systems of trans-
port, storing and merchandizing contribute to this.
Deterrents of cost and quality will have to be overcome because of consumer
pressure to make suitable corrugated containers available to the exporting
industries at economic prices. In citrus packaging, it is believed there
will be a strong growth in the need for corrugated containers, particularly
if the government recognizes the implications to the exporters and intro-
duces export packaging standards.
Projected Future Demand
A minimum growth rate expectancy in-corrugated containers in
countries which have reached the degree of development of Turkey is 10% per
year, and it is believed that a realistic growth rate will lie in the range
of 10% to 12Z. Rates of growth in Turkey are forecast at 8% for the "lower
limit" and 10% for the "higher limit" beyond 1982. It is estimated that the
market is undersupplied to the extent of between 25 and 33%; if anything, the
higher figure is likely to be the more realistic.
The anticipated production of linerboard as compared to the
alternative production of sackkraft from the Antalya project has been based
on the following assumptions:



ANNEX 9
Page 11
(a) The project market for linerboard is the average of the high
and low projections contained in the market study;
(b) The Caycuma mill will continue to produce sackkraft at capacity;
(c) Start-up of new facilities is based on the attainment of 50% of
rated capacity in the first year of operation, 71% in the second
year, 86% in the third year, and full production in the fourth
year;
(d) In the early years of operation of the Antalya mill also
substantial amounts of sackkraft will be produced in order
to service this market and to utilize the remaining capacity.
The production of sackkraft is gradually diminishing as
the needs for linerboard increase.
No problems in selling the output of the Antalya mill are foreseen.
If the comparative price structure within the Turkish economy
allows, and the packaging industry requires, a price reduction in liner-
board comparable to imports, the Antalya mill could meet this requirement
if direct taxes in production costs are removed. Under these circumstances
the Antalya mill would be in a position to produce linerboard at the same
price as imports. On this basis, the probable demand in a market where
supplies are readily available under the pricing policies which presently
apply, the forecast below represents the lower and upper limits of growth
In demand.

Note that the SPO estimates do not appear to provide for latent
demand as do Sandwell's but do allow for a higher average growth rate of 15.4
percent annually from 1972 to 1982. The estimates while different are reasonably
close to one another by 1982.
Sackkraft
Use of Sackkraft
Some 80% of all sackkraft produced is used in Turkey's cement
industry and about 25 cement plants are in operation. The nominal annual
capacity is close to 10 million tons. Cement exports of 1.4 million tons
are subsidized by the Government. Production costs are reportedly higher
than export selling prices. Expansion of the existing plants and the
construction of new ones is expected to increase total capacity of the in-
dustry to 14 million tons by 1975. The growth in cement production will
require a substantial increase in the supply of sackkraft. The standard
cement sack in Turkey is constructed from 3 piles of 70 g/=2 for domestic



PANEX 9
Page 13
2
usage and 6 piles for export usage, 5 piles at 70 g/m2 ar4d 1 ply at 90 gfm
On this basis 150 tons of cement for export or 280 tons of cement for the
domestic market, can be packaged in one ton of paper.  For 1972, the corres-
ponding sackkraft requirements are 9,300 TPY for export packaging and 27,200
TPY for domestic packaging for a total of 36,500 TPY.
The remaining 20% of the country's consumption of sackkraft is
taken up primarily by three other industries:  fertilizer, feed grain, and
gypsum. Of these, fertilizer is the largest consumer of paper. The 1972
production of fertilizer is predicted to be approximately 1.5 million tons.
Expansion now underway will bring the fertilizer capacity to about 4.5
million tons by 1976 and long-term objectives are for 9.7 million tons by
1982.  Although some fertilizer manufacturers use sackkraft for packaging,
there is strong bias in favor of plastic bags.  This preference stems from
the granular and hygroscopic nature of fertilizer which demands a high
degree of moisture resistance from the container. The use of plastic-coated
sackkraft would substantially influence the use of paper packaging for ferti-
lizer in the future. If adopted, the growth in paper for this purpose could
be very large.
Present and Forecasted Situation
The estimated consumption for sackkraft in 1972 is 44,500 TPY
of which 36,500 are consumed by the cement industry. No import needs exist
at present since the Caycuma plant with a capacity of about 60,000 TPY has
reached almost full capacity utilization. Given the reasons above the proj-
ection of future consumption for sackkraft is most closely tied to the ex-
pansion of the cement industry. By 1975, assuming the same operating ratio
as presently exists, cement production should reach 12.5 million tons. If
2 million tons of this are exported, the total sackkraft consumption would
be a minimum of 51,000 TPY. Other industries by 1975 will consume approxi-
mately 11,000 TPY for a total requirement of sackkraft of 62,000 TPY. Ex-
cellent statistics on the production of cement are maintained in Turkey, and
it is possible to use these figures, together with those for capacity under
construction to develop fairly accurate medium term estimates of cement industry
needs up to 1975. Estimates of use outside the cement industry are less
secure, but certainly the rapidly growing fertilizer industry is a natural
competitive area for paper against plastics and a growing share of this
market can be expected.  Consumption in the cement industry is also likely
to be stimulated by an upgrading in packaging specifications which will
require that one ply per sack be 90 g/m2 paper.
Beyond 1975, the projection becomes less certain, being influenced
to a large degree by the government's policy on cement exports. There is
some indication that this may slow down as the countries to which exports are
made become more self-sufficient in cement. The competition from bulk hand-



ANNEX 9
Page 14
Ling of cement does not at this time appear to be a serious threat, but in
view of the experience elsewhere in the world it cannot be completely dis-
regarded. For example, some inquiries are reported for cement exports to the
United States but such shipments would likely be in the form of clinker ce-
ment in bulk carriers.  Based on the above mentioned assumptions, particularly
on cement production, projections of demand for sackkraft up to 1990 are
shown below. The State Planning Office projections have also been included.

The State Planning Organization projects an average growth in cement produc-
tion of 8.3 percent over the period from 1971 to 1992.  This overall rate
appears reasonable although the shorter range projection could be low in
view of the already planned expansion to 1975.
Again, as for linerboard, the SPO estimates show a reasonable
relationship with the Sandwell forecasts but at the higher rather than the
lower levels. Year by year projections will tend to be wrong in any one
year because demand will increase in steps related to new capacity in the
cement industry or the use of sackkraft for packaging fertilizers.  The
average annual growth rate assumed from present consumption to 1978 for
the low projection amounts to 10% and 11.5% for the high projection, there-
after it averages to about 8% for both projections. After 1986, a third
sackkraft paper machine may be required. At that point, the Antalya machine
would gradually reduce its sackkraft production and revert to linerboard
exclusively. The proposed Antalya machine would have considerable flexi-
bility,  Additional capacity would be required in 1983 if the market develops
as expected.

Converting Industry
The converting companies are mostly owned by cement producers.
The exception is the plant operated by SEKA at Izmit. At mid-1972, there
were seven sackkraft plants operating or under construction in Turkey; these
include:
SEKA                      at lzmit
Cesan                     near Istanbul
Nuh Cimento               at Hereke (near Istanbul)
Akciiento                 near Istanbul (under construction)
Bartin Cimento Torba S. at Bartin (near Caycuma)
Cimentas                  at Izmir
Adana Torba               at Adana
With the addition of a converting operation at Akeimento's plant
west of Istanbul, and new capacity at Nuh Cimento's plant between Istanbul
and Izmit, there is sufficient sack producing capacity to meet short-term
requirements. Up to now any problems in meeting the needs of the cement
industry have arisen from shortages of paper, not sack converting capacity.
The continuing expansion in cement may justify sack plant installations at
some future time. The only imudiate prospect for a new plant appears to
be the establishment of such a facility in the Ankara area in order to serve
the two cement plants there and plants at Isparta, Konya, Sivas, Corum and
Bolu. These mills are on the Anatolian Plateau and could be serviced quite
logically from an Ankara converting plant.
Sawnwood
The State Planning Office estimates that about 80% of all
sawnwood produced in Turkey is used for building construction, and the
balance for furniture, shipbuilding and other miscellaneous purposes. These
latter uses are usually more demanding in their quality specifications. Con-
struction grades are used largely for non-integrated purposes in Turkey,
as temporary-use naterial necessary for the placing of permanent non-wood
building components. Their integral part use is confined largely to roof
rafters and tile battens. The greater part finds its use in larger and
usually multi-storied structures - apartments, commercial and industrial
buildings.
About 95% of the wood supplied to the Antalya project would be
pinus brutia which is currently regarded as a construction grade only. Turkish
construction traditions and methods ensure a large and continuing market for
construction sawnwood, although some inroads are bound to be made by new
technology in the form of steel scaffolding and supports, and to a lesser
extent by steel and plywood concrete forms.

Construction Grades
The standard construction sawnwood used is concentrate( in three
main nominal classifications as set out below@  No regulations are imposed on
private sector producers as to dimensions or grade, although the slate-owned
mills are moving to grading of softwood sawnwood.
(a) Boards: This grade has a nominal thickness of 2.5 cm .ad is
produced in random widths of from 10 cm to 20 cm with some £nall
proportion up to 25 cm. Lengths range from about 2.5 to 5 t the
most common width being about 15 cm, and tne length about 3 a.
Boards find their use in the construction of concrete forms
where random widths afford flexibility in selection. Short mnd
extra long lengths are less preferred than the middle range 3f 3
to 4.5 m,
(b)  "5 x 10's":  These are nominally of the dimensions notEl, 5 cm
by 10 cm and are used in a variety of applications, as brac 3 where
strengthening is required, as non-integral material in conciate
form construction, in scaffold bracing, and as roof rafters. Many
of their uses require short lengths and there is a tolerancE of
"shorts".
(c)  "10 x 10's":  Nominally of 10 cm by 10 cm dimensions, r e used
extensively as vertical supports to hold up concrete forms i r casting
of floors in multi-story buildings, and as scaffold members   They
are more durable than either boards of 5 x 10's. Common leryths
are 2.5 and 3.0 m.
Discussions with sawmill operators and contractors idi dated that
over 80 percent of all construction sawnwood is sold in the above c Imensions.
Istanbul builders indicated a trend from 10 x 10 to 8 x 8 for shoriig
supports. There are, of course, a number of other classifications Lncluding
planks and battens. Many of these products are custom orders, oftE i sawn
from logs provided by the customer. With the exception of village iousing
all the identifiable applications for construction sawnwood are in irban
areas.
Zoinery Grades
There is no clear-cut line betieen goinery aad construc:ion grades
In zerms of actual application.  Within thc joinery classification :here is
a range of grades at the top of which is the clear grade, that is, iithout
knots or other dowagra&ing characteristics. But much joinery lumbe- .has a
tolarance for small knots whLich are tight. These lowser grades are ised for
purposes wnich do not require exposure to view.



ANNEX 9
Page 17
However, all joinery grades require stability and freedom from
warping. Where there is exposure to weather and to view, joinery grades
must present a good surface in terms of smoothness and receptivity to paint.
In some applications small knots are bored out and replaced with plugs and
filler to provide a good painting surface.
Pinus brutia is not an accepted joinery grade although some mills
producing both joinery and construction grades to infiltrate small quantities
of higher quality brutia into their parcels of joinery sawnwood.
Most of the joinery sawnwood produced in sawmills is cut to large
cross-sectional dimensions as "cants" or "flitches" for remanufacture in
joinery plants. Canta and flitches range upward from 10 ca in thickness
and to 40 cm in width.
Notwithstanding the above mentioned deficiencies of pinus brutia
it has made important inroads into the traditional markets, especially in
Istanbul.
Field interviews in Istanbul indicated that within the last few
years, Pinus brutia has taken an increasing share of the construction grade
market. As late as 1966 less than 10 percent of all construction sawnwood
was in the pine classification, primarily Scots pine, but a small amount of
Pinua brutia. It is estimated that in 1972, about 65 percent of the consump-
tion was pine, with 60 percent of that proportion, about 40 percent of all
construction sawnwood, being Pinus brutia.
This increased acceptance has been won through pricing policies.
The indicated differential between Pinus brutia and other coniferous
construction grades was reported to be about 20 to 25 percent. Rapidly
rising prices for all grades have led users to substitute lower quality
sawnwood and this has provided sales opportunities for Pinus brutia. No
problems should be encountered in selling if the price differential is
maintained.
Sawnwood Consumption in the Antalya Market Area
There is no long-term statistical record of the regional consump-
tion of sawnwood. Only within the last 18 months has the Government pub-
lished monthly statistics of the building permits issued for new construction
on a regional basis. During the 10 months period for which detailed statis-
tics were available, June 1971 to March 1972, an analysis was made using floor
area as an indicator of sawnwood usage. The analysis of new construction
during the period of detailed reporting indicates that about 54% of the floor
area was constructed in six marketing areas which would logically be supplied
with sawnwood produced in an Antalya complex.

Total                                        54.0
In addition to these prime marketing areas, there are tributary
areas which could be serviced from Antalya. These include the areas contig-
uous to Istanbul on the European side of the Bosphorus, Kocaeli Province to
the east which could be serviced by water, and Bursa, Eskisehir, Afyon,
Denizli, Aydin and Hatay Province which could be serviced by road. The
inclusion of these tributary areas raises the accessible market area to about
60 percent of the new construction recorded in the 10-month period.
Although it is believed that there is a large concentration of new
construction within the marketing areas itemized on the preceding page, it
appears unsound to believe that 54% of the Turkish sawnwood market lies in
the six prime marketing areas.
Undoubtedly they are the dominant regions and are experiencing
population growth at rates in excess of the national average. However, less
than one-third of Turkey's population of almost 36,000,000 resided in the
marketing area in 1970.
Also taking into account the distribution of population, it is
estimated that a more rational estimate of the sawnwood consumption within
the logical marketing area of Antalya is between 40 and 45% of the national
total.  If the higher of these figures is accepted and applied 3to the FAO
estimates of a total sawnwood consumption of about 2,256,030  3 in 1970, the
regional market in that year was slightl  over 1,000,000 m  and by 1972 was
in the order of 1,100,000 to 1,200,000 m , The application of a ratio of 2:1
for t,he proportion of construction grades to .oinery grades gives an indicated
current consumption of between 725,000 and 800,00G m3 of construction sawuwood
used in the regional market, and between 300,000 to 400,000 m3 of joinery
grades.
Forecasted Demand
An annual growth rate of 4.3% has been used for tne overall con-
sumption forecast of sawnwood in Turkey (see Table on next page). For the
marketing area which can be economically served from the Antalya sawmill, a
hi'gher growth rate of about 6.5% is expected. This is based on an analysis
of population growth and new construction activities. The following Table
assumed 6.5% annual growth rate and gives for purposes of comparison, columns
showing the incremental consumption over 1972 at a growth rate of 4.3%.

ANNEX 9
Page 20
The Table shows that Antalya should have no difficulty in selling
its output if the demand grows as indicated. Only in 2 years, 1977 and 1978,
does its output reach 50% of the incremental demand. Moreover, the Table
takes no account of the fact that Antalya will produce some joinery grade
sawnwood. It may even supply flitches and cants for other smaller sawmills
closer to consumption centers for them to supply their traditional customers
with construction grades. This part of the output would therefore not move
directly from the mill to the consumer (see also Annex 15 on this point).
Prices for Aftalya Products
Linerboard and Sackkraft
Paper prices in Turkey are set by the Government. 1/ Since July
1971,, the price of sackkraft and linerboard FOB the Caycuma Mill of SEKA was
5,100 TL/ton. 2/ Delivery is taken by the customer at the mill with the
customer arranging transportation and paying all freight charges. This
same price would apply to a mill in Antalya. Test or bogus linerboard sells
for 4,000 TL/ton while bogus or straw corrugating medium (180 g/m2) sells for
about 3,000 TL/ton.
A price history' of linerboard and sackkraft as well as corrugating
medium in Turkey does not have too much significance in view of the 67% TL
devaluation of August 1970. From 1965 through mid-1971 linerboard sold at
the same price of 4,400 TL/ton, equivalent to $490/ton at the exchange range
which applied prior to devaluation. In mid-1971 the Government authorized an
increase to the current price level of 5,100 TL/ton, equivalent to $365 at
the current rate. During the same span of years the price of corrugating
medium (straw board) increased from 1,650 TL/ton to the current 3,000 TL/ton.
In view of rising wood prices and inflationary trends, it is believed that
further price increases are likely to occur in the near future.
The practice of selling both linerboard and sackkraft at the same
price is contrary to normal international pricing where sackkraft is usually
20 to 40% more expensive than linerboard due to lower pulp yields, lower
machine output, and higher iabor and:other Costs per ton of product.
Import Policy and Effects of Common Market
Restraints on paper imports include non-monetary impediments in
the form of applications, approvals, foreign exchange allocations and a clear-
ance from SEKA, as well as import duties, taxes and other landing costs.
Government policy has been consistent in encouraging the highest
degree of self-sufficiency in pulp and paper in order to utilize to the
greatest degree of both human and natural resources despite sometimes high
internal costs.
1/  For a discussion of Turkish prices compared with World prices, see Annex T1-3
2/   The price of linerboard was raised to 6750 TL/ton in September 1973, but
the increase has not been taken into account in this appraisal.



ANNEX 9
Page 21
The charges which apply to imported linerboard, corrugating medium
and sackkraft as based on the CIF value, port of entry, include:
Percent
Duty                       35.0
Municipal Tax               5.3
Harbour Cost                7.0
Production Tax             29.5
Stamp Tax                  10.0
Total                 86.8
In addition to the above direct charges, there is a bank financing
charge of 12 percent. Duty, Municipal Tax and Harbor costs of together
47.3% exclusively apply to imports whereas the other charges also apply to
domestic production.
Under legislation enacted in January 1972, the Government granted to
SEKA the exclusive right to withdraw imports of paper from customs without
payment of any of the foregoing charges, and authority to resell such imports
at domestic price levels. This permitted SEKA to generate a substantial profit
in 1971 on these transactions. No immediate change in the present policy with
respect to imports, import mechanics, tariffs and taxes appears likely.
Under the agreements with the Common Market, Turkey would attain
full membership by 1992 at which time her tariff structure would conform
to that of the other members. During the intervening years to 1992, tariffs
would be progressively lowered to provide a period of adjustment.
Tariffs on most paper products vis-a-vis the Common Market would
be reduced on a gradual basis as set out in the Table below:

At the time of projected mill start-up in 1978 tariffs would have, been
redluced by 15 percent with accelerated reductions applying through the
years to 1992.
T"he tariff rate to which these reductions would apply has not been
:i<i.ly established. Neither has it been established which grades of paper
and paperboard would be subject to the reduction.  The competitiveness of the
.ntalys proj ect vis-a-vis imports is analyzed in Annex 11.
Sa -awood
Contrary to paper prices, sawnwood prices are determined by the
m.arket on a demand and supply basis. Sawnwood prices are traditionally erratlicx.
anc difficult to determine, and during the field studies in 1972 prices were
escalating rapidly, far in excess of what would normally be expected from
,eansonal variations,
TFhe only reliable history of construction grade sawnwood prices is
'hat compiled by the Ministry of Forestry based upon auction sales held at
the State operated mills.  Tnese figures are a sensitive indicator of going
prices. TJnfortunately none of these mills is a producer of Pinus brutia
sawnwood and no other agency compiles a continuing and consistent history of
Pinus brutia prices on the basis of grade and dimensions as it is not man-
datory in the private sector.
The most pertinent published information on Pinus brutia constructiocn
sawnwood prices was obtained from the Demirel mill, a large private mill in
Isparta producing Pinus brutia sawn-wood.  This mill is the largest softwood
mill in the private sector in Turkey with an anntal capacity of about
30,000 m3.  The mill is unique in that it publishesa periodic price list
showing mill base prices and the transportation costs to selected market
areas. A complete file of past lists was not available but the recorded price-
of construction grade, mainly Pinus brutia but with some Pinus nigra are shown
in the table below:

It would be wrong to generalize too broadly from these figures,
especially in view of findings in other areas of the market which are noted
subsequently, but the following observations are made:
(a) in the 3-1/2 years period covered, prices have increased in the
range of 75 percent to 90 percent depending on type and length. How-
ever, on the basis of discussions with the mill concerned, it appears
that there was resistance to the latest price increase and some dis-
counting off the published list may be practiced;
(b) the relative price differentials between short and longer lengths
have decreased;
(c) there is no significant price differential between lengths of
4.5 m and 3 m within the normal length classification, nor between
lengths of 2.5 m and 2 m in the short length classification.
(d) this mill follows the practice common in the private sector, of
charging the same price for boards as for dimension.
Based on price data obtained from other sources and other areas,
the following average mill prices were calculated for mid-1972 - the level
that has been used as the basis of financial and economic analysis.

The sawnwood prices on the preceding page could be understated by
as much as 10 or 20% because sawlog prices in 1972 have increased to an
all time high. Several months have passed between the purchase of sawlogs
and the selling of the finished product. Allowing for some log storage,
transportation to the mill, and air drying it is possible to visualize at
least a three months delay before sawnwood is finally sold on the market.



ANNEX 9
Page 24
Under the present rapidly escalating price of sawnwood any delay from the
time of log purchase to the time of sawnwood sales contributes to profit.
Thus the prices indicated on the preceding pages are believed to be typical
market prices in mid-1972, but could be low when related to the log prices
prevailing in the same period.
Future prices are expected to increase because of strong demands
originating from investments in new and improved housing, industrial and
hotel construction.
Export Market Potential
Though it is expected that domestic demand will absorb production
of paper products from Antalya, the potential export markets were studied by
Sandwell by sampling four eastern Mediterranean countries (Syria, Lebanon,
Israel and Cyprus). The findings on the different products are as follows:
Linerboard - In the absence of any major production in the sample
countries practically all linerboard is imported from North America and
Scandanavia. The established position of present suppliers and their high
standards of quality and service make these markets difficult to penetrate.
However, the net mill prices to suppliers are not as attractive as in other
markets and the improving market conditions in the United States and Western
Europe which are now evident will make these markets less important to
international suppliers.  Turkey's contiguous location offers advantages, but
becomThg established in the market may require some price discounts, justifi-
able in the eyes of buyers because of the shorter freight haul. Therefore
with s-ome marketing efforts an export position could be built-up and liner-
board tot needed in Turkey could provide foreign exchange and at the same time
be financially attractive to the Antalya project.
Sackkraft - A decline in the rate of growth of sackkraft market
is noted in_the sample countries, due in part to the increased bulk handling
of cement.  This, coupled with the very high standards of paper quality and
market servicing presently provided by Scandinavian'suppliers, make sackkraft
a more difficult product to export from Antalya.
Sawnwood - Due to the deficiencies of Pinus brutia as compared to
other wood species, the export opportunities for the most important part of
the project's sawnwood production would be difficult. Additionally, any
effort to penetrate foreign markets would require a revision of quality and
service standards. A large, modern mill of the type visualized for Antalya
should be able to achieve the required standards. Opportunities to export
good quality cedar are excellent but for other species, especially Pinus
brutia, there appears to be little potential.



ANNEX 9
Page 25
The competitive situation in Lebanon, presently dominated by two
East European countries (mainly Romania) is difficult. They have centrally
managed economies which are integrated with national commercial goals. These
broader objectives seem to be pointed up in the willingness of Russian sup-
pliers to cut prices to maintain exports. However, ir. view of increasing
demand in other countries, Antalya with its modern large production facilities
and located near the coast, would be in a good position to achieve marketing
and distribution economics.
C. Marketing for Antalya Products
In view of the near monopoly which SEKA holds in the supply of liner-
board and corrugating medium, the Company's absolute monopoly in the supply of
domestic sackkraft, its exclusive right of importation of industrial papers,
and a chronic under-supply situation, it is therefore understandable that
selling conditions can easily be set by SEKA without giving much consideration
to the special needs of the purchasers. Among the practices followed by SEKA
which would not exist under competitive conditions are the following:
(a) SEKA sells most of its pulp and paper prepaid at its
warehouse door. It is the customers responsibility to arrange
for transportation and to pay all freight charges;
(b) Each converter must submit to SEKA before year end his annual
requirements of linerboard and corrugating medium for the following
year. This is unknown in a competitive system, but understandable
where limited manufacturing capacity is available and quotas may
have to be established;
(c) Payment of progressive deposits ensures the product is fully
paid for on completion of the production run. For example, for
linerboard a deposit amounting to about 5% of the value of the order
must be deposited with SEKA at the time orders are placed. From
time to time during the operating year SEKA advises the converter
when a program will be run to supply his needs and a further deposit
of 25% of the order value must be made. When the periodic order is
actually run, the converter is advised and must deposit 75% balance
of the order value with SEKA before delivery. No credit terms apply.
At the end of each year an adjustment is made for the small earnest
deposit which was made when annual requirements were indicated;
(d) The converter, when placing his periodic order must accept the
full reel width of the machine which SEKA assigns for its production.
Inasmuch as the converter must produce containers to the size
specifications of his customers, he may be required to order roll
sizes from SEKA which, at the order, he cannot use;
(e) SEKA does not provide assistance and coordination to converters.



ANNEX 9
Page 26
Both the physical and financial burdens imposed upon the converter
by the practices set down above create additional costs for linerboard or
corrugating medium at the converting plant. The continuation of this policy
has to be questionied. The Antalya mill will provide large quantities of
linerboard for the domestic market thereby providing improved packaging for
domestically consumed and export goods.  It is in the country's interest
that the distribution costs for paper products in general are minimized. It
is also in SEKA's interest so that it will be able to sell its products in
a balanced market. For linerboard, an equilibrium between domestic supply
and demand is expected at least during the early operating years of the
Antalya project. Therefore, SEKA has to develop some marketing efforts
and start to turn from a production-oriented to a market-oriented company.
The introduction of a marketing concept for linerboard would at the same
time provide an excellent start for the other paper products. Given Turkey's
gradual exposure to international markets with decreasing import duties
would require a change of SEKA's attitude to marketing in any case. Therefore,
it is recommended that SEKA undertake a study how to establish a marketing
system which serves sellers and purehasers needs as well. In this study
particularly the following aspects should be emphasized:
a)   Evaluate the relative prices of linerboard, corrugating medium, and
sack-kraft to ensure that the relationship is based on equitable
differences in costs of production including all direct and indirect
charges associated with manufacture.
b)   Change the prior deposit requirements as these indirectly increase
the price to customers in the sense that their working capital is
increased. If the supplemental income derived from the use of the
deposits is necessary for SEKA, a more equitable and less complex
method would be to increase prices to the extent necessary and fol-
low more usual commercial selling terms. This could mean cash on
delivery or the extension of credit for a specified period to cus-
tomers of proven integrity.
c)   Change the full-trim practice which requires a buyer to purchase the
full reel width even if side-runs are not of use to him. It is re-
ported that SEKA presently programs reels on a single customer basis.
It is recommended instead that orders of the same basis weight and
furnish specification be grouped, and machines trimmed to obtain
maximum output.
d)   Prior ordering over a period of a year should be terminated.  Some
indication of annual needs should be obtained from customers, but
lead time on order specifications should not exceed 2 months.



ANNEX 9
Page 27
e)   Provision should be made for technical servicing of accounts to
provide converters with all assistance possible in making their opera-
tions efficient, in resolving production problems, and in the design-
ing and setting of performance standards for containers. The partici-
pation of SEKA in the converting business provides a technical base
for this service.
f)   The use of a "delivered cost" pricing system would permit more rational
delivery schedules and avoid the congestion and the lost waiting time
for trucks which characterizes many of the industrial operations in
Turkey. In the event that barge transportation was established to
service the proposed mill, base-point pricing policies should be followed,
with prices quoted FOB discharge depots at Istanbul, Izmir and Mersin.
Marketing System for Sawnwood
The Antalya sawmill with an annual output of 182,000 m3 sawnwood
will be by far the largest sawmill in Turkey. Therefore, the marketing of its
sawnwood has to be carefully planned; this is not so much because it may be
needed not only to sell the output without major marketing efforts, but also
to ensure an organic evolution of the existing sawmilling industry.
Selling Practices
The existence of two areas of production, the public and private
sectors, is reflected in selling methods. Generally the public mills are
located close to the sources of logs, the private mills close to the con-
suming markets.
The selling practices presently applied are as follows:
Public Sector
All sales are made at the producing mill under a system of competitive
bidding. Periodic auctions are held 4 to 12 times a year, depending on mill
size, with prior public and mailed arnnouncements being made to potential buyers.
The parcels of sawnwood are usually of mixed dimensions, but grade and volume
are itemized. Buyers interested in a particular parcel must make a prior deposit
of 7-1/2 percent of the upset price as evidence of good faith. If successful in
the oral auction on the day of sale an additional 7-1/2 percent is paid and an
interim sale agreement is signed subject to approval by the Ministry in Ankara.
Upon taking possession the buyer is required to pay the full 100 percent of pur-
chase price, as well as some small local taxes. He must also arrange and pay
for loading and transport to his destination.
Private Sector
Such complexity of purchasing mechanics do not apply in the private
sector. The producing mills are customarily close to the consuming area and
the buyer makes his purchase, usually after some bargaining, and takes imme-
diate possession upon payment. Unless the buyer elects to "shop around" among



AINNEX 9
Page 28
other producers in the area his purchase is usually completed within a few
hours.
Some of the large private mills have a clientele of buyers which
are usually larger contractors who wish to avoid the administrative costs
of attending auctiorns o-- buying from smaller mills,  Established relationships,
integrity and reliabilitv of supply lead such buyers to obtain their suppliers
from larger mills even at the cost of having longer freight hauls.
The Antalya mill should avoid involvement in the retail distribution
of sawnwood to a wide array of small buyers in order to confine its efforts
largely to the production side, and to sales in large parcels for distribution
by specialists in sawnwood and building supplies. This policy would be rein-
forced if it were decided to ship large cargos of sawnwood to Istanbul and
Izmir by barge.
Under a wholesale system the following mechanics of operation could
apply:
-    Accredited wholesalers would be appointed in each of the
marketing areas to merchandise the mill's sawnwood products.
This would not be an exclusive regional agency, but the,
number of wholesalers handling the company's production would
be limited.
-    Wholesalers would be required to carry stocks to serve their
customers. They would order these stocks on a periodic ba-
sis through the producing company's representative in the
local area. In the six prime marketing areas the sales func-
tion would be closely integrated with the transport function,
the operations being consolidated in the same office.
-    Large contractors would be granted wholesale price privileges,
provided their annual volume of purchases attained certain
agreed levels.
-    Prices would be announced on a periodic basis as is done by
SEKA for its paper sales, and by the Demirel sawmill.
-    A sales commission of 7-1/2 percent would be provided to
wholesalers to cover their distributiorn costs, working
capital, and a reasonable profit margin.
-    All sales to 4holesalers or contractors would be made against
orders filed with the regional sales office.
-    All sawnwood would be graded anr  marked in conformity with
the standards employed by the State mills.



ANNEX 9
Page 29
Sawnwood would be sold in packets as is done by the State
mills. However, each packet would contain a common dimension
(except for Boards where random widths would apply), and a
common grade. Packets would be bundled to permit easy
handling in loading, unloading, and reloading at receiving
ports if a tug and barge system were used. This type of
packaging does not preclude the local distributor from break-
ing bundles on trucks to permit unloading by hand.
Close liaison would be maintained among the mill production
and sales staff, local sales office, transportation staff,
and wholesalers to coordinate the production and selling
functions, especially as this relates to the marketing of
those specific grades and dimensions which best accommodate
efficient mill operations.
The system suggested does not provide for the company
carrying inventory,stocks in local marketing areas.  If
tug and barge transport were used, all shipments would be
made against specific orders for immediate forwarding
to the wholesalers or large buyers. Some inventory would be
carried at the mill to service wholesalers efficiently.
It is recommended that SEKA undertake a study on the marketing of
sawnwood considering the existing selling practices, the above proposal and
their own field investigation and paying particular attention to the implica-
tions for the existing sawmill industry. Given the large impact of the proposed
selling practice for sawnwood, this study should then be reviewed with the
Turkish Authorities and the Bank before a final choice on the selling and dis-
tribution practice is made.
Regional Market Sales
Based on the regional market forecast and detailed marketing consid-
erations the following general sales targets are foreseen for the Antalya
mill:
Market Sales Targets

Marketing Area       Sales Volume                Total

iNNEX 9

The Istanbul area will be the dominant market area for several reasons:
a)   Its large population - 3,000,000 persons in 1970 - and
rapid growth - an increase of 30% over 1965;
b)   Its accessibility by water and the ability to service
this market efficiently;
c)   Its acceptance of Pinus brutia as a construction grade
if prices offer some advantage over other species.
In suggesting market targets, Ankara has been given a much lower
weight than Istanbul for reasons of the latter's absolute size and growth,
and the ready accessibility of this market to producers in the Bolu-Kastamonu
areas which is less than 250 km away. This compares with a distance of 600
km from a potential site at Manavgat. A larger share of the Ankara market
could be attained if there were an embargo on the export of logs from the
Antalya resource area to sawmills in the Ankara area. In that situation
those mills would have to turn north for their supplies and the increased
competition at auctions would increase prices still further to the benefit
of the Antalya area mill.
Izmir is not only a smaller market but is accessible to producers in
the western basmudurluk. It has the advantage of being reachable by water,
but its population and growth rate are both lower than Ankara.
The Konya marketing area embraces a wide basmudurluk in which the
population of the city proper is only 25% of the marketing region it services.
A major deterrent to penetration of this market by an Antalya mill is the poor
condition of Highway 31 north from Manavgat.
The Antalya basmudurluk market extending along the south coast to
Alanya is a natural selling area made more attractive by the anticipated rapid
growth in the tourism industry.  The freezing of log sales in Antalya would
limit private mill production to existing levels, permitting the new proposed
mill to service the growth market.
The Mersin-Adana basmudurluk is also a growing market, but not of
suci size as to permit capitalizing upon its accessibility by water. Truck
transport over existing roads is costly, and since the basmudurluk has a well-
established sawmilling industry and a resource base which permits expansion,
this market has been accorded a lesser degree of attraction as a potential
merchandizing area.

ANTALYA FOREST UTILIZATION PROJECT
STATE INVESTMENT BANK, TURKEY
Introduction
The Bank sent a mission (Colin M. Southall and Edgar C.H. Su) to
Turkey in April, 1973 to conduct a reviewcf the organization, policies,
procedures, operations, and financial position of the State Investment
Bank (SIB), with a view to exploring the possibility of using SIB as a inter-
mediary for the Bank loan for the Antalya Forest Utilization Project. The
mission was also asked to form an opinion on whether a long-term institut-
ional relationship could be developed with SIB for channeling Bank funds
for other Turkish public sector projects in the future. The mission returned
with favorable impressions of the institution. It was felt that SIB, despite
its present weaknesses, would be able to undertake the task related to the
Antalya Project and to make necessary improvements which should precede a
long-term partnership with the Bank. Based upon the recommendations of the
mission, the Bank has decided to use SIB as an intermediary for channeling
the Bank loan for the Antalya Project. Regarding the establishment of a
long-term relationship with SIB, prospects appear good although final
decision will be made only after further work has been done by SIB and in
the Bank, and after a full appraisal of the institution has been completed.
The recent mission's findings and conclusions are summarized below.
Establishment of SIB - Objectives
SIB was created by Law 441 promulgated on March 12, 1964 to provide
credits and guarantees to State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) for their invest-
ments. The purpose was to ensure that the scarce resources available for
the development of public sector projects would be put to use for projects
which were technically, financially and economically sound. Before the SIB
was established, the long-term credit needs of the SEEs were met by the
Amortization and Credit Fund which acted merely as a disbursement agent with
no authority and manpower to appraise projects. SIB is the first financial
institution ever established in Turkey which channels funds to public sector
projects on the basis of the results of appraisals, instead of on instruc-
tions from a Ministry.
SIB's initial authorized share capital was LT 1,000 million but
this was doubled in 1972. As of December 31, 1972, SIB's paid-up share
capital amounted to LT 1,023 million.
Organization
SIB has a Board of five Directors. Three ex-officio members,
namely Mr. Nedim Rustu Aksal, the General Manager of SIB, and Mr. Tarik Kivane
and Mr. Zeki Dusluoglu who are Deputy General Managers. Two others are
appointed by the Ministry of Finance the the CouniiI of Ministers respec-
tively, namely Mr. Helmet Turat, former General Director of DSI, and
Mr. Mehmet Ertugruloglu, former General Director of the Amortization and
Credit Fund. The Board meets once a week. All projects to be financed



A>mE X 12
Page 2
by SIB require the Board's approval, but before they are presented to the
Board, they are subject to clearance by tile Credlt Committee.  Since the
Board is controlled by its ex-officio members, Board approval is assured if
the senior management of SIB supports a proposal.
Mr. Aksal has held a number of Important Government posts and is
able to deal on an equal basis with his counterparts in o.-' "r SEEs. lIe has
been the Gerneral Manager of SIB since 196&-, and it is he wao has been largely
responsible for building up a qualified and capable staff i'L' SIB and in
improving its procedures.
The two Deputy General Managers have clearly defined responsibili-
ties each supervising several departments. H r. Dusluoglu is in charge of
raising resources, programming, loan admiriistration, accounting and disbur-
sements. Mr. Kivanc is responsible for the financial, economic and technical
appraisal of all projects submitted to SIB for financing and for tide super-
vision of the projects until they have been implemented. Both are well
qualified and competent.
At present SIB has a staff of 110 including 55 professionals, the
distribution of which is set forth in the organizational chart. However, SIB
has an authorized staff of 181, and if its role were enlarged, an additional
71 staff members could be recruited without any additional authorization
from the Government. Each year SIB advertises for the professional staff it
requires and around 200 applicants for employment are received. 1/ The most
promising applicants are given a written examination and of the top 15 not
more than 5 are offered positions in SIB. As a result, the staff recruited
by SIB are well qualified and the turnover of staff is not high. Although
SIB staff receive at least twice the salary received by their counterparts
in other Government Departments, because they can be employed on a contract
basis rather than in accordance with the provisions of the Personnel Law,
the ratio of SIB's administrative expenses to its total assets is below 1%.
Policies
SIB is subject to the guidelines specified in Law 441 and the
most important are sum.tarizee below:
(1)  SIB is to make available to SEEs the credit required for
:-5eir projects and to furnish guarant ae en necessary for
t:ie same  -ourpose.  (Wnile SIB's sco>  ii            .s broad-
1l. wracitce only Onose SE3s which submi'.        6ounn  projects
'aave been the recL p ents of SIB's credi: )
(2)  SIB cannot uame ecuiCy investments in .tLt Op e or - -vate
enterprises.
(3)  SIB cannot establish branches and -t- canot acqu-re rearL
estate except w.,hat is necessary for its organizatiori.
i/ e purpose is to have an annual intake of new staff like IBY's
YP system.

(5) Projects whose earnings are inadequate to repay their
debts are not eligible for SIB financing.
(6) The zechnical9 economic and financial aspects of a proposed
project must be evaluated by SIB. If any errors or deficiencies
are 4dentified, cLe appAication for a credit and project appraisal
is returned to the SEEs for correction or completion.
(7) SIB is responsible for following up the implementation of
projects financed by it and for ensuring that the project is
carried out according to its program, only until construction
is completed (and not beyond).
SIB has no written policy statement dealing with investment and
ort olio management. Since its financing of SEEs' projects is on a con-
tinu'ing basis, SIB is unable to set any limit to its exposure in a single
o or establiskhment. Nor has SIB fixed the minimum amount for which it
VL_l consider making a credit, although it has never financed any projects
of a very small size. Neither is there any limitation on SIB's own borrow-
ing power.
Procedures
Project Appraisal
The long-term credit needs of the SEEs were met by the Amortiza-
tion and Credit Fund u7ntil the establishment of the SIB.  No project apprai-
sal work was done as this was not required under the Statutes of the Fund,
and its operations were limited to the disbursement of credits within
approved limits. In tihe first year, SIB recruited 22 experts to undertake
thle project appraisal work.  By now, the number has reached 31, including
a engineers, 12 financial analysts and 11 economists. Thirteen of the
appraisal staff have been trained either in the United States or in Europe.
Du-ring the past 9 years , SIB has received 597 applications. After
t:. zin ~-ar'J review,fi, `.0  applicatioas were returned to the applicant SEEs for
',... .hoe principal reasona we-a the inadequacy of credit limits,
', oIlack of financial vility.  The remaining 496 projects

.a:~e on .he eEE's f$.-nancial position.  So far, the SIB has focussed on the
-o J ae- s-n-bmitted to it for financing and little attention has been given to
th. SEE submitting it to SIB.



ANNEX 12
Page 5
For relatively large projects, SIB's engineers have relied on the
SEE's own judgment on the pricing of the equipment to be procured. SIB has
not established any guidelines concerning the procurement procedures to be
followed by its borrowers. Its economic analysis includes the calculation
of the value added of the project, capital/output ratio, capital/employment
ratio, the effects on the balance of payments, etc. SIB's assessment of the
international competitiveness of projects evaluated by it needs to be
strengthened.
SIB's appraisal staff are qualified people, with the capacity to
appraise industrial projects. They have been continually improving the
quality of their appraisals. During the past two years, considerable progress
has been made as reflected in their appraisal reports. SIB has also organized
seminars on project appraisal for the past five years, for the benefit of
the staff of SEE's. Such seminars have been found useful, especially by
those SEE's whose project appraisal work needs to be up-graded.
Follow-up
SIB has been making serious efforts to follow-up the implementation
of projects financed by it.   Its engineers and financial analysts visit
SIB-financed projects regularly. SIB's follow-up work terminates at the
time when a project is completed, in accordance with its Statutes. Disburse-
ments are made only after the engineers are satisfied with the progress
being made, and the borrower's accounts are examined by SIB's financial
analysts to ensure that all expenditures have been made properly for the
goods and services required for the project.
Reporting from clients is generally inadequate. Since the SEEs
are required to submit reports to different agencies of the Government, they
usually send copies of their standard reports to SIB which are not very
useful. Therefore, SIB attached great importance to staff visits to pro-
jects and to the reports prepared by these staff on their return.
Disbursement and Collection Procedures
SIB has been following the established disbursement and collection
procedures, as briefly described below, which are adequate. During the
past year the new manager in charge of disbursements and collections has
made some changes which increased the efficiency of both. Withdrawals are
made on the basis of invoices and other supporting documents submitted by
the borrowers, after they have been checked by the technical staff. In most
cases they are reimbursements. Advance payments are made only in a limited
number of cases when this is justified. On the whole, the disbursement
procedures appear to be successful in ensuring that SIB loans are actually
used for the related projects.
Each borrower is put on notice fifteen days before an installment
is due. When payment is not made on the due date, an entry is immediately



ANNEX 1 2
Page 6
made ir the arrears statement wh,Iieh is made available to the top management
daily. Loans made during the last two years have been repaid promptly.
The Credits Division which is also in charge of disbursements now
has a staff of 15, including one manager, one assistant manager, two senior
officers, 9 officers and two typists. If SIB is used as an intermediary
for channelling foreign ex&caange resources from IBRD and/or EIB, two officers
in the Resources Secti.3n who have good command of the English language, will
be transferred to the Credit-s Division and together with some of the Division's
existing staff will be assigned to handLe foreign exchange transactions. On
a rotationaL basis, the disbursement staff will receive training in the Foreign
Exchange Department of Central Bank for a period of two to three months.
Given the present work load, the disbursement officers are carrying
work efficiently. However, further training will be necessary, if an addit-
ional assignment is taken up. The arrangements which have been made and are
to be made to enable the staff to get more acquainted with the procedures
related to disbursements of foreign funds appear to be satisfactory.
Resources
SIB's resources include share capital paid up by the Government,
the proceeds of tax free bond issues guaranteed by the Government which are
sold to the Pension Fund and Social Insurance Corporation, funds taken over
from the Amortization and Credit Fund and, the Internal Financing Fund and
Treasury advances. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has been making
working capital loans through SIB to the SEEs on an administered basis.
The resources raised by SIB since its inception are shown in
Table I.  As of the end of 1972, SIB had obtained resources totalling
L: 13,767 million (US$983 million equivalent), of which 90% was from ex-
ternal sources, mainly by selling bonds to the State Social Insurance and
Peasion Funds. The bonds issued recently have a term of 20 years and bear
interest at 9% p.a. (tax free). The only foreign exchange funds are the
foreign debt taken over by SIB from the Internal Financing Fund in 1964,
for which SIB has assumed the foreign exchange risk by order of the Government.
As a result of the Lira devaluation in August 1970, SIB has incurred con-
siderable losses. (The Government did not compensate SIB for such losses).
the end cf 1972, tne outstanding foreign debt amounted to approximately
42  lLo   equivalent.
Operations
DL-:6:In    :the <nse-year period from 1964 through 1972, SIB has ap-
proved 496 _!Gng-term c"-edits totalling LT 12.5 billion, representing 24%
of total invaszi_arents i-a the SEZs during t,e period, with the remaining 76%
bei -g na ced directly under the Budget.  In the Second Five-year Plan
-r:io6 (96E-i972) SlTBs firlancing was om y about 20% of the total.  This
was due to the fact that investments in public sector projects increased
sharply during that period and SIB's capacity to raise resources from outside
sources could not catch up withthe,±ncreased demand.  SIB's loan approvals
and disbursements are _.hown in Table t  below:

The amortization period of SIB's long-term loans ranged from 5 to
over 20 years.  Seventy-one percent of the loans extended by SIB during the
Second Five-Year Plan period (1968-1972) are for more than ten years and
the average size of its loans was LT 24 million. In 1972 the total amount
of loans of LT 100 million or more exceeded 79% of the total amount of all
loans.
Since 1971, the interest rates charged on Sib's loans have ranged
from 9% to 10.5%. The interest rate for each loan is determined by SIB's
Board (within the 9-10.5% range) on the basis of the cash flow projections
o: the project being considered. As a result, some of the better projects,
have to pay interest at a higher rate because the risk factor has not been
taken into consideration.
In 1966, SIB began to make working capital loans to meet the asort-
termn and seasonal needs of SEEs.  In the following year, as the demand in-
creased to a level i&idi could not be entirely met by SIB, the Government
started to make short-term funds available to SIB for relending to SEEs on
a     :':.ssion basis.  In 1969, tne working capital loans of the two categories
:ctallf LT 1 537 milion.  Since 1970, SIB has discontinued making short-
tarm loans out of its o.:n resources, and all such loans have been made
a.inst Gove-zL.ent funds and on a commission $3asis.
SIB's lending is not as well diversified as one would expect from
a 6evelop.t boank, -7in view of its clients being limited to SEEs and their
sabl.shnents.  (Also, since 3IB will only finance viable projects that have
been well ?repared, less than 30% of the SEEs have received SIB credits).

In 1972, 25% of the SIB's loans were extended to the non-ferrous metal iidustry
and 21% of the iron and steel industry. Five sectors: chemicals, petroleum,
cement, steel and non-ferrous metals, absorbed 81% of SIB's financing in
1972. The sectoral distribution of SIB's lending for the past five years,
1968-1972, is shown in Table III.

Financial Performance and Condition
SIB's profit before corporate tax doubled during the five years
1965-1969 from LT 103.3 million in 1965 to LT 221.5 million in 1969. (SIB,
like other enterprises, is obligated to pay the corporate tax). In 1970,
a loss of LT 208.8 million was incurred as a result of the Lira devaluation.
in 1971, a profit of LT 266.9 million was realized and 1972 was also a profit-
able year; Ishe unaudivdi ;rofit and loss statement showing a profit before
i-ax of LT 247 million, representing a return of 22% on average equity.
As or the end of 1970, SIB's long-term debts amounted to LT 9.7
billion, corresponding to 9.4 times of its equity. To reduce this ratio,
the authorized share capital was doubled in 1972 from LT 1 billion to
LT 2 billioni, so that SIB could "re-establish an acceptable balance between
external and own resourcest.
SIB's unaudited Profit and Loss Statement for 1972 and Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 1972 are given on pages 11 and 12.
SIB's statutes provide that 15% of its annual net profit is to be
set aside as provisions for possible losses, until this amount equals fifty
percent of its share capital. After SIB's capital has been fully paid-up
ten percent of its annual net profit will be allocated as additional reserve.
In addition for many years SIB's management has set aside 1% of loans out-
standing as extraordinary reserves and this rate was increased to 2% in
1972. After all the appropriations, the remaining surplus is transferred to
the Treasury. This is because the SEEs including the SIB are not permitted
to retain their unappropriated earnings and funds needed by them for new
investments must be provided for in their annual investment and financial
programs. Since SIB's increased share capital has not yet been fully paid-
up, permission has been given for SIB's net earnings after taxes and pro-
visions for the next three or four years to be converted into paid-up share
capital.
The average collection rate (i.e. the amount collected as a per-
centage of total instalments due in one year) during 1967-1969, was around
80%. In 1970, it dropped to 70% reflecting the fact that the liquidity
of some of its client SEEs worsened as a result of the Lira devaluation. In
17?1  it dropped further to 60%.  However, the situation showed considerable
iamrovzment in 1972 and at the end of March !972, arrears of iaterest
smounted Lo iT 251 miPlion and arrears of principal amounted to LT 464
'Ilion w'-ict. represents only 4.2% of its portfolio.  And by the end of 1972,
total arrears of interest had dropped to Ls 151 million and arrears of
prLncipal to LL 236 mill ion, representing 1..9% of its portfolio.  At the
end of 1972, SIB's provisions and reserves totalled LT 304.2 million, rep-
resenting 2.7% of SIB's loan portfolio including working capital loans.

ANNEX 12

Conclusions and Recommendations
SIB has been playing an increasing important role in providing
long-term finance needed by the State Economic Enterprises. Its contri-
bution has exceeded 20 percent of the total investments in the SEEs during
the past. In the current year, SIB is expected to provide LT 4.2 billion
against a total requirement of LT 13.7 billion by the SEEs. While there is
room for improvemen. in SIB's organization, policies and procedures, we
consider the institution: (a) to be generally sound given the constraints
faced by the public sector entities in Turkey; (b) to offer good prospects
for establishing in the short run a partner with the World Bank for the
identification and preparation of projects in the public sector and, possibly,
to exercise influence on the reform of public sector enterprises; and (c)
to possess the potential to be developed in the long run as a World Bank
intermediary for channeling funds to public sector enterprises.
SIB's association in the Antalya Forest Utilization Project has to
be viewed in light of the World Bank's long-term objectives in the industrial
public sector. The results of the 1972 industrial project identification
mission have been somewhat disappointing in number and readiness of projects
and it is obvious that the Government has not yet taken the initiatives
needed to support, through adequate project preparation, the major indust-
tialization objective of the new 5-year Plan in the public sector.  The Bank
therefore needs a "correspondent" in Turkey which could promote its views,
help influence industrial policy and identify and prepare projects in the
public sector, and keep its industrial pipeline stocked. Furthermore, if
SIB's appraisal and supervision capabilities were expanded, it could be used
to shoulder some of the tasks assumed hitherto by the Bank and to channel Bank
funds either as an intermediary for individual projects or, if the necessary
policy framework has been established, as a public sector DFC. While this
last objective may ultimately be the most important one, the Bank's immediate
needs, namely in project preparation and in the reform of public sector enter-
prises, warrant by themselves a close association with SIB.
The Antalya project is the only opportunity immediately available
for establishing such an association. While offering specific but limited
advantages as training grounds for disbursements, bookkeeping and supervision
procedures, the project would suffer from equally specific but limited draw-
in terms of the complication of lending and disbursement arrangements.
Thae de-ermining factor in our recommendation to use SIB as a channel for
Baaik funds for Antalya is the indispensable need to accustom the staff of Bank
-a  SIB to  or  togethrandtoreconcie their respective procedures and thus
to establish ehe relationship needed to explore the possibility of a closer
partnership. In the light of the Bank's experience in Turkey in recent years
such a partnership would in all likelihood not develop unless a narrower
association was used as beachhead.
In order to ensure that SIB will be able to act as the Bank's inter-
mediary for the Antalya Forest Utilization project, we suggest that the
following steps be taken by SIB, namely:



ANNEX 12
Page 15
1.   To strengthen the disbursement division
SIB should train or recruit disbursement officers who are
experienced in dealing with foreign exchange transactions. SIB
has indicated to the mission that it has made the necessary
arrangements to have their staff trained in the Central Bank
for a period of three months. In addition, SIB has also approached
TSKB for such training, and if necessary TSKB would be requested
to send its Chief Disbursement Officer in the Foreign Currencies
Department to SIB on a loan basis to train SIB staff in regard to
World Bank loan transactions.
2. To strengthen the bookkeeping and reporting system
SIB should make an effort to strengthen its bookkeeping and
reporting system. Administered funds should be treated separately
both in its books and in its reports. The financial reports of
SIB, now prepared annually, should be prepared quarterly. Prefer-
ably, a Special Account should be established in the existing
system for the Antalya Forest Utilization project funds so that no
commingling with other funds should take place, i.e. all foreign
exchange transactions should be segregated from local currency
transactions, both in recording and in the presentation of reports.
In the longer run SIB should strengthen its project appraisal and
supervision staff. SIB's supervision work appears to have been adequate
during 1972, the last year of the Seconxd-Fve-Year Plan. This year, SIB's
financing is expected to double and the number of projects to be appraised
will increase proportionally. It is necessary that SIB should strengthen
its appraisal and supervision staff by employing additional engineers and
financial analysts, and increasing the amount of supervision given to SIB
projects.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Methodology
To quantify the economic impact of the project, the forestry and
industrial parts are combined, as they are parts of an integrated project;
one part dependent on the other. The economic costs and benefits are;
therefore, the incremental costs and benefits of the integrated project.
The economic costs and benefits are evaluated at world prices.
Goods are divided into tradeables and non-tradeables. Tradeables are valued
at border prices. Non-tradeables--i.e. goods whose domestic production cost
lies between c.i.f. and f.o.b. prices--are valued at the social costs of the
inputs required to produce them, because we estimate that an increase in
demand will cause a corresponding increase in supply, leaving relative prices
in economy unchanged. Both skilled and unskilled labor are valued at their
respective nominal wage rates, because we estimate that the rapid increase in
agricultural and tourism activities in the project area are expected to absorb
the unemployed labor during most of the project lifetime. Duties, taxes and
other transfer payments are eliminated from investment and operating costs.
B.   Project Benefits
The project output consists of paper-linerboard and sackkraft--
and roundwood. Turkey has been importing paper for many years, and has re-
cently started importing some roundwood. Since in the absence of the proposed
project these commodities would have to be imported, the economic benefits of
the project are, therefore, the foreign exchange saved by import substitution.
The c.i.f. prices of the project's outputs are given below.
1.   Paper
The major paper exporters have been the USA, Canada, and Northern
European countries. The paper industries in these countries, which until re-
cently had a large unutilized capacity, is now barely meeting demand and
prices have been rising steadily since the second half of 1972. This price
trend is likely to continue: exisitng facilities are operating at practically
full capacity; planned investments fall short of expected growth in demand;
and expenditure on pollution control equipment is raising product cost strain-
ing the industry's financial resources. Furthermore price of major inputs
will continue to rise:  wood, because of felling restrictions and increased
labor cost; fuel and chemicals, because of world shortages.
The steady price increase of linerboard and sackkraft is apparent
from the time series for published Swedish paper export prices which are more
reliable than most. Based on these figures and on the expected world demand



ANNEX 15
Page 2
and supply situation, it is estimated that conservative long-term f.o.b.
Swedish export prices of linerboard and sackkraft, after allowing for the
normal discount, to be about $165 and $210 respectively.

Freight and insurance rates for paper from Sweden to Turkey are
about $26/ton for a fully loaded 12,000 t charter vessel.  Although Turkey
would probably import paper in smaller lots with a concomittant higher freight
rates per ton, we will conservatively use $26/ton as the long-term freight
rated that would be obtained in the absence of the project.
The resulting c.i.f. price for linerboard and multiwall sack paper
are, therefore:
c.i.f. price
TL/ton     US$/ton
Linerboard               2,674          191
Multiwall sack paper    3,304          236

2.   Lumber
The project produces mainly a construction grade of lumber and a
small portion of joinery grade. The border price for lumber produced by the
project is taken equal to the c.i.f. price of Swedish lumber that would give
the same value for the end use. The c.i.f. price of Swedish lumber is obtained
by adding freight and insurance charges to the 1972 FAS Swedish prices given
in the table below. Although 1972 prices are conservative in light of recent
developments, we feel that they reflect long-term trends more accurately than
present prices.

Since the project's construction lumber is somewhat inferior to
Swedish Sixth grade sawnwood, the latter's 1972 FAS price -  21 skr/m3 or
$43.20/r3 -  has been deflated by about 10%, reflecting greater re-use of
Swedish lumber. Adding freight and insurance charges, the would-be c.i.f.
price of project construction lumber is therefore estimated at $56.00/m3.
The project's joinery grade is similar to the Swedish unsorted
pine grade valued at skr 336/m3 FAS in 1972. The corresponding c.i.f. price
is about $82.00/i3.
The border prices for lumber are therefore:
c.i.f. price
TL/m3         US $/3
Construction grade  785.0           56.0
Joinery grade      1,148.0          82.0
C.   Project Costs
The investment and operating costs of the project in economic terms
are calculated according to the methodology outline in section A of this Annex.
Calculation details are shown in the attached tables, and except for the two
costs items described below--forestry division operating costs and wood cost-
the tables are self-explanatory.



ANNEX 15
Page 4
1.   Forestry Division Operating Costs
The relevant operating costs in the economic analysis are the incre-
mental operating costs in increasing output from the present 300,000 m3 of
logs/year to about 800,000 m3/year. However, detailed actual operating cost
could not be obtained. Thereforea we have prorated the total operating cost
of the forest component oi the~ project after expansion. This is justified
because the proposed project extends, with minor modifications, existing
labor intensive production methods to a larger area, with little economies
of scale. Prorating, nevertheless, neglects improvement in productivity in
in existing operation induced by project. However, reduction in the economic
rate of return resulting from neglecting this improvement of the project is
negligible.
2.   Wood Costs
Wood used in the industrial part of the project comes from increased
production in the Antalya and Adana-Mersin Areas. Wood qualifies as a domes-
tic good, because high transportation costs makes it uneconomic either to
import or export it: domestic cost of producing and transporting wood to the
border is $18/mi compared to an expected f.o.b. export and import price of
$12-15 m3 and of $30/m3 respectively on a c.i.f. basis.  Furthermore we esti-
mate that an increase in demand by the project will cause an increase in
supply leaving relative prices in the economy unchanged. The economic cost
of the wood is, therefore, equal to the cost of the inputs required to pro-
duce it.
In calculating the cost of wood we have neglected the value of
existing forests. This is justified because not only are Turkey's forests
overstocked with overmature trees, but the project afforestation and refores-
tation components should provide for increased future tree supply.
Since the forestry and industrial components of the project are
combined for purposes of economic analysis, the economic cost of wood supplied
by the project area (Antalya) is already included in the project operating
cost, and we need only to add the economic cost of wood supplied from the
Adana/Mersin area. Because wood production methods are similar in various
fore&* areas in Turkey, the ex-forest cost of wood in the Adaba/Mersin area
were derived from the investment and operating costs in the project area.
Transportation cost for Adana/Mersin to Antalya were then added to arrive
at the wood cost in Antalya.

1/  As presented in the report, particularly in the market chapter, the  production of the project fully represents the substitution of imports.
2/  Sawnill Residuals are only sold in 1976 and 1977 for use in other pulp plants.  They have been priced at the economic costs of the wood.
3/  For purposes of this analysis roundwood has been treated as a non-tradable item; this is based on the prohibitive transport costs in the case
of exportation which would result in f.o.b. prices lower than the assumed economic production costs.
4/  Excluding transportation costs which are shown separately.
5/  Operating costs in financial and economic terms of the Antalya Forestry Part are shown in Annex            . The annual economic operating costs of
TL145.4 million represent a wood production of 852,000 m3: this corresponds to economic production costs of TL 171 per cubic meter.

jj    The Industrial and Forestry Part of the Project are integrally related.  Therefore, in economic/operating and investment costs of the Forestry Part to supply the required wood to the Industrial
Part have been considered as the economic costs of the wood and included in the economic return calculations.  However, as the incremental operating and investment costs, eseentially the full
costs (except the value of sunk investments which are difficult to quantify) have been used in determining the economic costs of the wood produced.  Since the existing Antalya Forestry unit is
about breaking-even, this means that the cost degression of expanded activities has been allocated to the full production and not only to the incremental production to the Project.  This conser-
vative approximation is justified since most of the investment and operating costs can not be clearly allocated as incremental or necessary for unexpanded existing operations.

ANNEX 16
Page 1
SOCIO-ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF ANTALYA REGION
This Annex briefly describes the economic and demographic situation
in the Antalya area and describes the impact the Project is likely to have
there. It also examines the consequences for the rest of the nation, of
Projects like the Antalya Forest Utilization Project.
Economy of the Region (Basmudurluk)
Agriculture. The most important sector in the economy of the area
is agriculture. Animal husbandry is of great significance for the rural vil-
lagers who rely on goats and sheep for milk, meat, fiber and leather. Com-
mercial agricultural activities are concentrated on the coastal plains and
the Bucak plateau; farming for local use occurs through the region. A 50%
increase in food production from 1 million tons in 1968 to an estimated
1.5 million tons in 1971 has been brought about by sulbstantial increases in
irrigation; successful introduction of glass house horticulture; and an
increase in the intensity of land use. Recorded milk and meat products amount
to 50,000 tons annually but the real contribution of animal husbandry is far
greater as it is consumed locally. Farm animal population in Antalya Province
exceeds 1.75 million and represents a density of 0.83 animals/ha. Some 35,000
tons of cotton and 380 tons of citrus valued at over TL 300 million was exported
overseas from Antalya in unmanufactured form in 1971.
Manufacturing. The major manufacturing activities in the region are
those associated with the processing of agricultural products and the mineral
industry. Wood products are limited to local needs, basically lumber and
wooden boxes. There are several cotton processing and vegetable oil plants,
a chrome ore refinery and mines producing chrome barite, quartzite and bauxite
except for the State box factory and a new 10,000 m3 output sawmill, the wood
processing industry consists of small mills. In 1972 there were over 440
units divided fairly evenly between sawmills, joinery shops and box plants.
The value of manufactured products exported outside Turkey from Antalya in
1971 amounted to nearly TL 60 million.
Tourism. The Antalya basmudurluk with its abundance of archeological
and historical sites, beaches, impressive scenery and mild climate, has sig-
nificant potential for a major tourism industry. Over the past few years,
hotel accommodations, restaurants and other tourist facilities have been
expanded and improved, particularly in the Antalya, Alanya and side areas.
Facilities and attractions include:
Beaches                             Historic Sites
Sand        178 km                  Pre-historic        4

From 1967 to 1971 the number of tourists were 73,000 annually (26,000 foreign
and 47,000 local). The numbers have remained fairly constant due to limited
transportation facilities from Istanbul and European centers and lack of
accommodations. The Ministry of Tourism has extensive plans for the region
and the NfF has designated three National Park areas, however, development
activity to date is limited.
- Forestry. The forests currently play a supporting role to the major
economical activities in Antalya region and provide a very minor part of the
total income and employment. Production in 1971 (Annex 4) was valued at some
TL 102 million whereas expenditures (mainly wages and salaries) amounted to
TL 74 million. The majority of industrial logs are shipped to other parts
of Turkey for manufacture but the forests do provide the basic supply of fuel
and sufficient industrial wood to meet the construction and box industries'
local requirements. Forest land is used extensively for grazing purposes,
often to the detriment of young trees. With an animal population of 0.83
animals per hectare, it would be extremely difficult to stop this practice,
although it is being controlled in certain limited areas. The role of forests
in the economy of the basmudurluk will be substantially increased by this
project.
Land Use. Practically call level and gently sloping land is either
cultivated or used for urban development. Most of the steep land is brush
covered or forested and unsuitable for agricultural purposes. In spite of
this, significant areas have been cleared by the mountain villagers for
subsistance-level agriculture. This together with goat grazing (over one
million goats recorded in 1968) is a continuing problem for the Forest Service
particularly in remote areas. Erosion is severe on the steep hillside
clearings.
Infrastructure. The central section of the region is reasonably well
developed with good highways, adequate commercial facilities and reasonable
community facilities. The northern, western and eastern areas are less
developed and lack the more basic facilities. The region has a fairly ex-
tensive feeder and access road network, but has a limited main road system.
There are some 500 km of asphalt surfaced roads and 500 km of gravel roads
built and maintained by the State Highway Department. The Ministry of Forests
has built 5,500 km of well constructed and located forest roads.
Sea transport facilities along the coastline are rudimentary in
-.ost locations.  Good port facilities exist at Finike and a new harbor is
being built at Antalya City. Modest docks are in use in Kas and Alanya.
Coastal transport is not well developed and does not provide a practical
alternative to highway hauling within the region.
Frequent, inexpensive bus services are available between all major
towrns and villages along the state highways. As the distance from these
routes increases, bus service is less frequent and is practically non-existent
£or the more remote villages, however the situation will improve as the project
is implemented.

Regular scheduled air service is provided by the Turkish Airline
between Antalya, Istanbul and Ankara, using modern jet aircraft. There is no
rail service within the basmudurluk.
All major towns have electricity, water, sewage and medical services.
Commercial facilities, banks and other services are well established in the
towns and are extensive in Antalya. Gasoline service stations are frequent
along the major routes but automotive parts stores and repair facilities are
primitive. In the villages and small communities, situated off the main
highways, commercial services are either of a rudimentary nature or non-existent.
In 1971 there were 772 schools in the Province of Antalya catering for over
105,000 students. Practically every community has one or more elementary
shcools.
Population
In 1970, the Antalya Forest Region had a population of some
617,000 or 23 persons/km2. Of these 245,000 (40%) were living in villages
within the forest boundaries and an additional 108,000 (17%) within 10 km of
the forests. Thus, some 57% of the total population live within 10 km of the
forest and have certain statutory and traditional rights to fuelvood and con-
struction wood to graze animals and to work in the forests. Population in
the Antalya Province has increased at 3.6% per annum over the last five years
and the rate in forest villages is even higher (24% over 5 years as compared
with 18% for the basmudurluk as a whole). Data for the period 1940-70 is
shown below.

This shows that agriculture contributes twice as much as forestry to
the forest villagers income while animal husbandry (primarily goats) contrib-
utes over four times as much. Most remote villagers do not live on a cash
economy - basic needs are either home produced or obtained through barter
from other villagers.
The MDF has estimated that over 20,000 people (men and women) would
be available for regular work on forestry operations and an additional
58,000 could work on some types of operations on a seasonal basis.
A member of one of the Banks earlier missions first impressions of
a visit to some forest villages is quoted here as it states very succinctly
the situation as it is today:
"During my visit to Antalya I made an excursion 100 km into the
deep forests stopping at two villages and having informal and
frank discussions with villagers whom we happened to meet.
A senior forestry official who has been working with us on
this project for some years acted as interpreter.
My general impression is that the forest villagers are not
proverty stricken, lead a reasonably comfortable and healthy
life, but are concerned about "mission out" on the benefits
of modern life, such as education for their children and
some spare cash to get consumer goods. The opportunities for
earning cash are very limited and sporadic. The forest
service is the biggest cash employer but has offered general
employment in that particular area for only three years in the
last ten. The ricnest man in one of the villages was in fact
the local forest guard who earns TL 15,000 per year ($1,100
per year). The people would welcome the project if it would



ANNEX 16
Page 5
provide them with more steady employment. They would prefer
to work and live in their present villages although one or two
of the young men felt that they would move to a factory job
in town, but for a premium in wages. There has been a slow
but steady drift of younger people out of the villages partic-
ularly those who have had some education, so that the village
populations have remained fairly constant in the last decade.
Once a villager leaves, he hardly ever comes back."
Likely Impact of the Project
The greatest social impact of the project will be the addition
of nearly 6,000 forest workers and 850 factory workers to the workers presently
employed on a full time basis in the area. This represents a considerable
increase in people having access to a steady cash income, particularly in
the forest region itself, where at present only 7,000 people have steady cash
income. Thus, wage earners in forest activities will increase by 85%, while
wages will increase by 90% to a total of TL 63 million.
Through planning, the increase in forest workers wages will be
evenly distributed among the region thus avoiding the present situation
where forest activities often move from locale to locale bringing a sudden
increase of wealth for a few years followed by reversion to the more normal
non-cash subsistance, agriculture and barter. With the prospect of full
forest utilization it is relatively simple to plan that activities would
take place in all areas of the forests. A slight cost penalty may be in-
troduced by this policy, but it is likely more than offset in the benefits
accruing from greater flexibility in planning production of different
types of logs and different species. Transportation arrangements would
also be more flexible by being evenly spread out.
Money is useful to villagers living in remote areas only to the
extent it allows them to purchase the few essential items they cannot
produce or obtain by barter. This includes agricultural products such as
salt, sugar, tea and tobacco, and manufactured items like shoes, needles,
thread, printed cotton and transistor radios. Cash purchases are made on
occasional trips to market towns - a major trip for many villagers. This
situation accentuates the dependence on farming and animals since commercial
sources of food, leather and woven goods are just not available. Under these
circumstances, a cash income might not be an acceptable alternative to the
present arrangements for a forest family. However, it is likely that the
potential problem will be self-correcting as the more remote villages will
probably not get a sudden increase in forest activities. Rather, they will
come little by little to the remote areas. As forest activities increase
and cash and infrastructure (particularly transport) becomes available, com-
mercial activities are likely to develop. First the traveling salesman will
come with his goods to the villages and later an enterprising villager will
purchase a stock of mixed goods for resale, starting the first retail outlet.



ANNEX 16
Page 6
He will be encouraged by the availability of supplies from the larger centers
that can be brought in by the steady stream of logging, trucks that will return
empty to the forests (and likewise the truckers will be encouraged to seek
return cargo) and by the increasing demand as the villagers start earning
steady wages and move away from subsistance agriculture.
These developments are bound to bring new life to the forest villages.
The prospect of steady employment near the villages may tend to discourage the
drift to the major towns. Village populations might actually grow, putting
new demands on social services like health and education.
Stabilized poPulations and growing skill levels in the villages
could also be a basis on which other enterprising villagers will branch out
into light industrial ventures. As power saws are introduced, the need for
maintenance facilities will spring up and could be handled on a private basis.
The remarkable private enterprise automobile and truck repair business that
exists all over Turkey which keeps a fleet of the most antiquidated and hetero-
genous vehicles in good mechanical condition is a sign that such development
will occur. Increased truck transport will itself create opportunities for
truck repair shops. Cooperatives of villagers may themselves get into the
trucking business hauling logs out of the forested areas and consumer goods
back. It is very likely that the increased logging activities will spur
development of the already widespread system of private logging contractors.
In such ways, secondary economic benefits of the project will
spread.  At present most of the 446 small sawmills in the basmudurluk (of
which 252 are in small remote communities) start with sawlogs as raw material
and produce fairly elaborate goods as door and window frames, and even fur-
nished products. There are, of course, many that produce regular dimension
stock Lumber which others make into elaborate goods - but most of the mills
in remote areas are in fact ioinery shops forced to have a sawmill to provide
the needed lumber. These smaller mills have most of their capital tied up
in sawlog inventory since they can purchase logs only at the infrequent log
auctions. Discussions with the owaers showed that they would clearly like
to be assured of a supply of reasonable priced lumber available when they
wanted it, so that they could direct their energies and capital to making
joinery goods. Just such a supply of lumber will be available from the project
sawmill - so that far from putting the "little guy" out of business, the big
mill, could actually enable him to do better business.
in summary:
-    c-hat local lum7ber dealers and merchants are likely to
arise to handle the distribution of lumber from the
big mill;
-    demand for lumber is likely to increase with increase
in village income;



ANNEX 16
Page 7
-    the empty log trucks can haul back lumber assuring low
transport costs;
-    more sawlogs would be freed for the more efficient
large mill to process.
With secondary socio-economic impacts of this nature taken together
with the primary impacts, as well as the growing demand for agricultural and
tourism labour, one might even postulate a situation of labour scarcity in the
region. In fact in the wood supply contract, the Ministry of Forestry has
already recognized this potential problem by insisting that it may not be
able to debark the logs in the forest (a hand operation) because of future
labour shortages. As a result, SEKA will install mechanical debarking equip-
ment at the plant to be ready for such an eventuality.
There may be a need to consider mechanization of other activities
in the future. For the moment, careful studies have revealed that the present
hand method of logging and replanting cannot be replaced by mechanical systems
on a cost competitive basis. As wages increase and/or labour becomes scarce
or unwilling to tackle the hard manual work, such things as tractor and cable
skidding, tractor drawn terrace preparation and replanting and even hydraulic
felling equipment may have to be considered in addition to the power saws
which are seen as inevitable as a labor-saving device (at equal cost to hand
saws).
Significance for the Rest of Turkey
If this type of forest development spreads to the rest of Turkey
the significance will be immense since it would offset nearly 1/3 of Turkey's
population (12.2 million in 1970).
Here are reasons why the Antalya-type forest development will
spread through Turkey:
-    both SEKA and the Ministry of Forestry advocate the
integrated approach;
-    the pattern has been established by pilot and feasibil-
ity studies;
-    Turkey's demand for forest products, especially paper
is very great. This will demand a more productive and
efficient approach to forestry.
A major social change will therefore occur as the technical methods
of forest exploitation occur. While the techno-economic value of the changes
has been grudgingly granted by conservative elements in the Ministry of
Forestry, they were resisted only because of the realization of the implicit



ANNEX 16
Page 8
social change and the greater freedom for exercising choice that would thereby
come to the forest villagers. Thus there is also a political aspect to the
social impact of the project as freedom from dependence on a part of the
Government' s administration (the forest service) will slowly come to 1/3 of
the electorate. It is no wonder that resistance was encountered among the
more conservative group in the Ministry.
While the widespread impact of these changes seem clear enough, it
is by no means sure how the impact will be felt in different parts of the
country. The situation in Antalya has been described in detail because it
is well-known, but what would it be like in the socalled Anatolia area where
some two million people are classified as forest villagers, but which has few
forests as such and hence only a meager forest production now and is likely
so to have in the future? Surely it will not be the same as in Antalya where
forestry is high in economic importance, but not as high as a basmudurluk, like
the west Black Sea area where forestry practically dominates all economic life.
It might be possible to conjecture that the impact in poor regions
- like mid-Anatolia 1/ - will hardly be felt at all, because increased forest
production is not possible and hence increased local wealth will not occur.
These regions will therefore have to look for other activities then forestry
to ensure their development. The Ministry of Forestry is formulating a devel-
opment program for some 5,000 of the poorest forest villagers over the next
10 years at a cost of some TL 3 million per village. These are contingency
plans to raise the program to 15,000 villages over 20 years if financing can
be found. The mission expressed interest in this program and steps could be
taken to follow this up to see whether the Bank can or should be involved in
the program.
_On the other hand, the impact of new forestry methods in forest-
rich areas like the west Black Sea area 1/ could be quite disjointing to the 2
present way of life. Since this region is also one of the best developed
forest regions - in the sense of road network and other infrastructure -
there are few "remote" villages as in Antalya that will slowly enter the
'3/  in 1972 1inistry of Forestry expenditures _i  Anatolia were TL 108
million and revenue was TL 92 million - a deficit of TL 16 million
2/   In 1972 in the West Bla& Sea area with some 1.1 million forest villagers,
Ministry of Forestry expenditures were TL 327 million, and revenues were
TL 600 million for a surplus of TL 273 million.

cash economy.  On -t-e contrary those villages are well into the cash economy
through the sale - usually illegal - at market prices of wood that is sold at
marginal cost price to the villagers as their legal right. Higher industrial
wood demands could be met by curtailment of villagers legal entitlements - or
lead at least to increasing the price to market price. This problem could
arise in the execution of the Marmara Region Feasibility Study (see IAnnex 6)
which the Bank is being called on to\finance.-
Despite these potential difficulties which could arise as the social
impact of the Antalya project rises through the forest population, the overall
benefits of such an impact are seen to be positive. The development effect
seems assured even though its exact progress may be uncertain and in need of
continuous monotoring and guidance by the Bank. The Bank's awareness of
possible future problems should not hinder exercising their role.
