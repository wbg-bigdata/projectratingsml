APPRAISAL OF ANTALYA FOREST ITILIZATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a proposed project for the utilization of the
natural pine forests of the Antalya region of Turkey. Tne integrated project
is composed of: a forestry program, a large pulp and paper plant and sawmill
and a study part. The aggregate cost of the project (including its three
parts) is US$170.1 million, including about US$68.0 million in foreign exchange,
of which the Bank has been asked to provide US$40.0 million. The balance of
the foreign exchange is to be provided by a European Investment Bank (EIB)
Loan of about US$24.4 million plus USl.l million from EIB country funds allo-
cated for studies and by US$2.5 million out of Government equity contributions.
The local currency financing is to be provided as equity funds by the Govern-
ment and by a loan by Turkey's State Investment Bank (SIB), which also will
be the channel for the Bank's and EIB's financing for the industrial part of
the project.
ii.       The forestry part of the project involves increasing log production
in the Antalya forestry region, which has 472,000 ha of good forest land, from
its prese5t level of about 300,000 m /year (solid measure) to a level of about
800,000 m /year, almost entirely of pine. The industrial part of the project
involves:  (a) a s wmill to process about 340,000 m /year of logs to produce
annually 182,000 m /year of sawnwood with the sawmill residues and other logs
going to the pulp mill; (b) a pulp mill with an annual capacity of about 147,000
bone-dry tons of unbleached kraft pulp; (c) a papermill with an annual capacity
of either 155,000 tons of kraft linerboard or a lesser quantity of a mix of
linerboard and sackkraft. The studies part of the project involves feasibility
studies of future integrated forest utilization projects. One has been de-
fined in the Adana/Mersin/Maras region east of Antalya and others are current-
ly being defined.
iii.      The Bank and the EIB loans would be extended to the Government at
the usual lending rate of each institution. The Bank and EIR loans for the
industrial part of the project totalling US$56.1 million would be onlent on
the same terms, with a life of 16 years, including a five years grace period,
at 9% p.a. interest. These funds would be passed through SIB and through
Seluloz ve Kagit Sanayii (SEKA), the State Economic Enterprise for pulp and
paper, to the industrial project entity (The Antalya Establishment) which is
a separate legal and financial entity. The joint financing totalling US$7.9
million for the forestry part would not be onlent by the Government but this
part would be implemented by the Ministry of Forestry (Mr) and the funds will
be passed on to this organization for the purposes of the project. Arrange-
ments for passing on the funds for the studies and their implementation are
being finalized.
iv.       The project is the result of many years of planning and promotional
effort by the Government and international agencies.  The principal aim is to
exploit more efficiently a major forest area of Turkey, a country whose forests



- ii -
are the fourth most extensive in Europe. The project contributes to improving
forest management and practices and to meeting the strong local demand for
paner and wood products while at the same time not interfering with the
ecological balance. The preparation of the project required extensive
expenditures of time and money to find the best way to achieve these objectives.
It is of major significance for the future economic development of Turkey
that the two primary entities involved, MY and SEKA, which have faced severe
growing problems, will be beneficiaries of the expertise and direction growing
our of the project.
v.        The forestry part of the project will be executed by the MF and
its General Directorate of Forestry (GDF) through the existing Antalya
regional administration. The industrial part will be executed by SEKA through
its Antalya Establishment, created especially for the project. In order to
achieve integration of the project, the forestry and industrial parts will
be coordinated by arrangements formalized in a wood supply contract. The coor-
dination and implementation of the studies continues under discussion, but
the studies will be carried out by qualified consultants. The forestry part
will utilize well-proven methods of forest management which are new to Turkey
to increase forest yields and improve harvesting methods now generally in use
in Turkey that are considered appropriate under present social conditions.
The industrial part will utilize well-proven processes and methods. The
project will require extensive use of consultants, the scope of whose activi-
ties has been quite clearly defined. It is expected that the major portion
of the industrial part will require four years to execute, with commercial
production of the pulp and paper mill commencing in January, 1978; the sawmill
would commence operations two years earlier. The major forestry investments
will also be made during this period.
vi.       Based upon detailed marketing studies, no problems in selling
Antalya's products are foreseen. The sawn goods will be used primarily in
construction, and the linerboard and sackkraft in packaging. Antalya's
product flexibility, coupled with the flexibility in product mix at the other
SEKA plants, will allow latitude to cope with unexpected shifts in market
demand. Imports of linerboard or sackkraft are expected to prove virtually
unavailable or at least very expensive. Even after Antalya begins operation
a shortage of construction sawnwood is anticipated, and the supply of liner-
board and sackkraft is geared only to median forecast demand until 1981, after
which there may again be a shortage.
vii.      Given the tourist potential of the Antalya coast, the choice of plant
site was made only after a careful review of a number of alternative possibili-
ties by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by the State Planning Organiza-
tion (SPO). The site chosen minimizes possible adverse effect on regional
touristic and agricultural development with only a modest increase in cost
over the lowest-cost site considered. The pulp and paper mill will be equipped
with all the proven facilities to reduce odors and particulates to a minimum
level, and with liquid effluent treatment facilities appropriate to a sea-
coast location.



- iii -
viii.     Upon project completion, the Antalya Establishment is expected to
have a satisfactorv financial structure, the debt/equity ratio will be 60:40
and the debt service coverage will be about 1.6 after the first two years of
operation. The financial return for the industrial part of the project is
15.0% before and 13.5% after taxes on income. International paper and lumber
prices have significantly increased during the last year. It is expected that
upward pressure on prices will continue, reflecting in part rising investment
costs and also operating costs in major supplying countries. Nevertheless
conservative import prices of US$236 per ton of sackkraft and US$191 per ton
of linerboard cif Turkey have been assumed to determine the economic rate of
return of the project. On this basis, the economic rate of return of the
project is about 14%, which is satisfactory. The return is sensitive to
changes in revenues and to a lesser degree to changes in investment and opera-
ting costs. A 10% decrease in revenue would drop the economic return to 11%.
ix.       Apart from the benefits of the project included in the economic
return calculation, major indirect benefits can be attributed. The project
which is the first integrated forest utilization project in Turkey, will sub-
stantially improve the utilization of the country's resources.  The project
itself should become a pilot for this kind of development and the studies
should contribute to its further advancement. The project will also create
additional steadv employment for more than 4,000 people living in the forest
villages, who are regardea as the poorest section of the Turkish population.
Furthermore, it includes training of labor and will provide a steady and re-
liable source of unfinished sawnwood for small sawmills. The net annual
foreign exchange saving of the project is estimated at some US$25 million.
x.        Based on agreements reached during negotiations, the project is
considered suitable for a Bank loan of US$40.0 million.






I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested a Bank loan of US$40.0
million equivalent for a major forestry utilization project in the Antalya
region of southern Turkey (Map IBRD 10502), the aggregate cost of which is
estimated at about US$1.70.l million iincluding about US$68.0 million in foreign
exchange. The project includes three separate but integrated parts: (a) a
forestry program; kb) a large pulp and paper mill as well as a sawmill; and
(c) studies for future forest utilization projects in Turkey. The project
is the culmination of many years of planning and promotional efforts by the
Government and international agencies, including the United Nations Develop-
ment Program (UNDP); the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); the European
Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Food Program (WFP).  The Government of
Turkey, the Turkish State Investment Bank (SIB) and EIE will also provide
financing for the project.
1.02      The Bank's involvement in the project commenced in 1969 when the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program started major project preparation. Subsequently,
in -'~arch 1972, as Executing Agency for a UNDP financed study, the Bank engaged
Sandwell & Co., a well known Canadian firm of forest industry consultantsb
to carry out a feasibility study. This study determined how best to utilize
the Antalya forest resources and defined the specific forestry and industrial
elements to be financed. In preparing the project, improved cooperation
between the two entities which are to carry out the project -- tne Ministry
of Forestry (IT) and Seluloz ve Kagit Sanayii (SEKA), the State-owned pulp
and paper company -- was achieved and a Turkish project preparation team was
established jointly with personnel recruited from MF and SEKA. This impor-
tant joint effort was the first time the integrated development of a forest
region has been tackled.
1.03      The Bank appraisal is based largely upon Sandwell's detailed
feasibility study 1/, wrhich was completed in February 1973, and carried out
in close cooperation with the Bank and the Turkish project preparation
team. Five review sessions with the Bank and Government during the study
helped ensure agreement on its findings. The project was appraised by Bank
missions which visited Turkey in April and June 1973. The appraisal team
consisted of Messrs. Peter Glenshaw (chief), Ilanfred Ferber and Max Oberdorfer
of the Industrial Projects Department, Mr. Raymond Rowe of the Agriculture
Department CPS, Mr. Richard Palmer of the EMIENA Regional Office Program
Department, Mr. Edgar Su of the EMENA Regional Office Projects Department
and Mr. Colin Southall of the Legal Department. Both missions were joined
in the field by staff of the EIB and worked closely with members of all
concerned Turkish organizations, especially NP, SEKA and SIB.

II. FORESTRY IN TURKEY AND ThE STATE PULP AND PAPER COMPANY
A.  Background
2c01      It is not widely recognized that Turkey possesses extensive forest
resources and that it is fourth in Europe in terms of forested area. This
lack of recognition is probably due to the very poor yield from Turkey's
forests (0.3 m3/ha/year compared with 1.7 m3/ha/year or better in Finland
and Sweden) and the fact that forestry makes only a minor contribution to
the country's economy - under 4% of GDP in 1972, compared with about 14%
and 12% of GDP for Finland and Sweden respectively in 1970.
2.02      The poor yield from Turkey's forests - even more apparent when
recognizing that Turkey's mild climate makes trees grow faster than in the
Nordic countries - is due to obsolete systems of forest management where
conservation rather than production has been the guiding principle. The
disadvantage of such a principle is that after a period of rapid growth,
the growth rate declines and eventually mortality causes forest stands to
diminish. Modern forest management allows for harvesting at the end of the
period of rapid growth with immediate replanting using improved young trees
to ensure full use of the combined resources of land and climate.
2.03      The need to change this practice in Turkey has long been recognized
by the Government, which owns all of the natural forests; but to put these
desired changes into practice has been found difficult. The people living
in or near the forests - 13 million or over one third of the country's
population - have legal rights to grazing and procuring forest products at
low prices from the forest administration, making it difficult to introduce
any changes that might seem to encroach on these rights.
2.04      The result is that Turkey's forest exploitation lags behind that
of its European neighbors and its forest-based industries are scattered and
disorganized. Partly due to a haphazard growth and uncertainties in wood
supply, its pulp and paper sector has mills which are small and rather high
cost producers by world standards. At the same time, the economy is creating
a strong demand for paper and wood products. The need for change therefore
has become increasingly urgent and the proposed project should - at least
in the Antalya region - help to overcome these deficiencies and act as an
impetus for other regions to follow. A detailed description of the place
of the Antalya project in the development of Turkey's forests is given in
Annex 2.

B.   The Ministry of Forestry
2.05      Government control of forest operations extends back to the mid-
19th century, but waned in the early 1900's. In 1937, the Republic's
Forestry Department took control of all fellinig and marketing of logs and
by 1956 all privately owned forests over 3 ha in area had been nationalized.
Compensation was given mostly in the form of the rights mentioned above.
The Ministry of Forestry (MF) was established in 1969. Its operational
department, the General Directorate of Forestry (GDF), manages all forest
operations including that in the Antalya area where one of GDF's 24 Regions
are located.
2.06      MF is charged with preserving the national forests and increasing
their yield, planting trees, building forest roads, seeing to the needs of
forest villagers and operating some wood using industries (mostly sawmills).
MF administration is highly centralized, although the vast majority of its
1,500 forest officers who in about equal parts are graduates of the Forestry
Faculty of Istanbul University and the Turkish Forest Training Schools are
in the field. A large portion of the staff have professional competence,
although somewhat outdated training has left them with the overly conservative
attitude to forest management referred to previously.
2.07      MF has a high degree of financial independence, selling logs and
other wood products - and using the income to cover operating, administrative
and investment expenses. In 1972, its total revenues amounted to about
TL 2,100 million, covering about TL 850 million direct production costs, TL 750
million salaries and overheads, TL 400 million investments and about TL 100
million corporation taxes and payments to the National Export Fund. 1/ The
ME has been contributing mainly through corporation taxes and Export Fund
payments to the national budget in recent years; given the strong wood prices
these contributions are likely to increase in future years and may exceed TL 200
million in 1973. Details on the budget mechanism, breakdowns of the individual
costs and revenue components and profit and loss statements and balance sheets
for MF comparable to corporations are presented in Annex 3. The last availa-
ble ones for 1970 indicate a net profit before taxes of TL 137 million; the
balance sheet slhows ecuity funds from retained earnings of almost TL 600
million.
2.08      Roundwood production in 1972 amounted to 5.6 million m3 which will
be increased to 6.4 million m3 in 1973. Additionally, about 19 million
steres 2/ of fuelwood will be produced in 1973. Of the investment expendi-
tures in recent years nearly two-thirds have gone into reforestation, affores-
tation, forest roads and machinery and equipment for forest operations, while
the rest went into forest management, wood processing industries and other
miscellaneous activities. Although MF has in the past devoted a good deal
of its efforts and expenditures directly to improving the social conditions
of forest villagers primarily through developing forest infrastructure well
in advance of need, this is rare today, axcept for very remote areas.  There-

-4-
fore, Turkey's wood prices are no longer loaded with "social costs" which
should more properly be the burden of the State rather than the Forestry
Budget. On the other hand because of the lagging forest yields, log supplies
have been falling behind demand and thus have pushed up prices.
2.09      Within the Ministry of Forestry there are three main budgets.  First,
there is the budget of the Ministry of Forestry itself, which is relatively
unimportant because it covers just the personnel costs of the Ministry. In
1973 this budget amounts to TL 20 million and is covered through the national
budget. Second, there is the "Annex Budget" providing for forest activities
which are of a national nature, for example generally applicable research
projects. The GDF is in charge of the Annex Budget activities and it is
financed through surpluses of the forest operations of the various districts.
Third, there is the "Revolving Fund", which is by far the largest budget and
covers all current and investment costs for forest activities related to pro-
duction and sales. The GDF is also in charge of the overall coordination of
the Revolving Fund whereas detailed execution of the Revolving Fund activities
takes place in the individual Forestry Districts. A detailed breakdown of the
different budgets is given in Annex 3.
C. The State Pulp and Paper Company
1.   Plant Facilities and Operations
2.10      Seluloz ve Kagit Sanayii (SEKA) was founded in 1934 as a State
Economic Enterprise under Law 440 1/ and is by far the largest pulp and paper
producer in Turkey. In 1972, SEKA was responsible for 100% of Turkey's output
of pulp and 85% of paper production; the remainder was produced by numerous
small private plants, most of which are based upon waste paper.
2.11      SEKA is a holding company with each of its plants effectively
operating as separate legal and financial entities. The industrial part of
the project, for which SEKA is sponsor, will also be established under Law
440 as the Seka Antalya Muessessesi (The Establishment) and it will be the
ultimate borrower. Given SEKA's responsibility for project implementation,
its operational influence on its subsidiaries, and its position in the Turkish
pulp and paper industry, its activities and financial situation are presented
in Annex 3 and summarized below.
2.12      SEKA's first plant and its head office are at Izmit.  The Izmit
Plant contains much obsolete equipment and a modernization project is being
implemented. The Izmit Plant was added to piecemeal until the mid-1960's
when SEKA embarked on a major expansion program, building three modern -
though small - plants at Aksu, Caycuma and Dalaman.  Although all of these
had experienced substantial delays in implementation, higher than estimated
capital costs and initial operating difficulties, the first two mills are

- 5-
now operating at reasonable levels of capacity utilization. Major start-up
difficulties at Dalaman were experienced in 1972, the first year of operation.
These difficulties have by now been largely overcome and full capacity utiliza-
tion should be reached in 1974. All these new plants were built with foreign
technical and financial assistance and partly on a turnkey basis.
2.13      Wood is SEKARs main raw material, but straw, reeds and waste paper
are also used.  The plants are generally well run and kept in good mechanical
condition, although the labor force is substantially in excess of what is
usual in other countries. Principal features of SEKA's plants are shown in
detail in Annex 3 and are summarized below:

2.   Management and Labor
2.14      SEKA's Board consists of six members:  one each from the Ministry
of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Technology, one Labor representa-
tive and three members of the Company's top management. The Board functions
as a policymaking and controlling body as well as a liaison and coordinating
group between the Company and the Government. The influence of the Govern-
ment on financial and investment planning is strong, although there is little
interference in day-to-day operational matters. Since 1967, the Managing
Director of SEKA and Chairman of the Board has been Mr. Aziz Gumus, who has
had substantial managerial experience.
2.15      SEKA's management and staff are generally capable but have been
under considerable pressure over tne last 5-10 years, because of the major
expansion program and substantial staff turnover because of salary levels
slipping below those paid by private industry. SEKA's staff is paid in
accordance with the Personnel Law for civil servants. Tnis is felt as a
considerable restraint particularly in middle and upper management where
private industry's salaries are multiples of salaries based on the Personnel
Law. Good staff is thus difficult to attract and to liold and SEKA and the



-6-
Establishment will, if necessary, improve the compensation for certain key
positions by making special contracts as is done in other State Economic
Eniterprises. Relations between management and workers have been relatively
good and no major strikes have taken place in recent years.
3.   Financial Analysis - Past and Future
2.i6      Historical and projected production, income statements, balance
sheets and cash flow statements of SEKA through 1978 are shown in detail
in Annex 3.
2.17      SEKA's present financial situation is dominated by its expansion
program. In each of the years 1970-72, SEKA brought on stream one of its
three new plants. The first two plants are now breaking even, but the
Dalaman Plant incurred losses of TL 179 million in 1972 and a similar loss
is expected for 1973.  The unfavorable development at Dalaman has more than
offset the profits of TL 143 million at Izmit.
2.18      On the other hand the cash generation of SEKA has increased
substantially in the past years and the debt/equity ratio was strengthened
after a substantial infusion of new equity by the Government in 1971. How-
ever, repayments of loans incurred for the recent expansion program caused
debt service coverage to decrease to a point in 1972 and 1973 where cash
generation is just barely sufficient to meet current debt obligations.
Therefore, under normal circumstances, the Company's financial position
would be unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, SEKA has the possibility of further
equity calls on the Treasury and its financial position should improve as
it reaches full capacity utilization at Dalaman.  M4oreover, the Establishment
is not directly affected financially by SEKA.
2.19      To meet anticipated demand SEKA has four major projects under
consideration:  Izmit modernization, Afyon and Balikesir (Annex 3) and
Antalya, the subject of this report. Total investment costs of these
projects are estimated at about TL 4 billion; their additional capacity
totalling about 300,000 tons/year is almost equal to SEKA's existing capacity.
Given SEKA's present financial situation and this major expansion program,
it is important that SEKA pay particular attention to its financial position
if it is to become independent of further budgetary support by the Treasury.
As a start, SEKA has undertaken to review and improve its own financial con-
trol and reporting system.

III. ThIE PR0JECT
3.01      The project, which is expected to be completed by the end of 1977,
consists of three parts - forestry, industrial and feasibility studies. They
are described in detail in Annexes 4, 5 and 6 and are briefly stsmnarized below.
A.  The Forestry Part
3.02      The forestry part involves increasing3log production in She Antalya
region from its present level of some 300,000 m /year to 800,000 m /year.
Tree felling, transport and replanting activities will have to be inereased
and as a result new equipment (mostly transport vehicies and road building
machines 1/) will be needed. About 475 km of roads (plus one bridge) and
some 209 buildings will be constructed and the work force (but not the
administrative staff) increased from 7,000 to 11,000 men*
3.03      Antalya has some 472,000 ha of good productive forest land out of
a total area designated as forest of 1,320,000 ha - the remainder being mostly
maquis scrub. The predominant species is Pinus Brutia (kizilcam in Turkish,
or red pine), w'Lich is acceptable for the production of sawnwood and paper.
The forest blocks are scattered over a wide area and are generally understocked
with trees, i5ostly over-mature.  The productive forest is estimated to contain
30 million m of wood, about 75% of which is classified as sawlogs, 14% as
pulpwood, 1% as plywood logs and 10% as industrial shortwood.
3.04      Management on the basis of sustained yield involves the regulation
of timber harvesting to ensure in perpetuity, an equal, or increasing (but
never diminishing) supply of wood. The annual allowable cut by 1979 when
the pulp and paper3mill should start up has been conservatively calculated
at about 800,000 m . While maintaining the sustained yield principle, MF
has agreed that overmature trees will be liquidated as quickly as possible
and inmmediately restocked with young, healthy seedlings. Reforestation of
some 9,500 ha/year will thus be needed, which when added to the afforestation
effort of 1,500 ha/year makes a planting program of 11,000 ha/year - a
formidable program by any standards.
3.05      Present log production methods and forest organization will be main-
tained and will be extended generally to the whole Antalya region (Map IBRD
10502). Hand felling with animal skidding of the felled logs to the roadside
is used. The logs are manually loaded onto ordinary 3 to 5 ton trucks for
hauling to the mill or to log depots for sale to the public. The emphasis on
manual labor might create labor shortages in the future and productivity in-:
creases by such simple devices as inproved-harnesses, better draught'animals,
and training of workers will then be necessary.
1/ See Annex 4.



-8-
3
Of the annual allowable cut of 800,000 m3 from 1979 onwards, some
o, &,000 m3/year will be available to the Establishment. Of the remaining
90,00oi m3, about 80,000 m3 is expected to be demanded by the forest villagers
tndar their legal priority rights. The remaining 110,000 m3 would be avail-
abLe to meet the Antalya region's demand for other purposes such as other saw-
mills and furniture makers. In addition to the 610,000 m3/year, the mill will
have available to it 15,000 m3/year from the Isparta region to the north of
Antalya and up to 200,000 m3/year from the Adana/Mersin region should the need
ari.se.
B.   The industrial Part
3.07      The plant is proposed to be located on the Mediterranean coast
(para. 3.18) near the town of Manavgat and a river of the same name that will
supply the water year round that is essential in the production of pulp and
paper. As mentioned Previously, the plant will consist of a sawmill and a
pulp and paper plant with all necessary ancillary installations as well as
extensive and entirely acceptable effluent treatment facilities (described
in para. 3.17 and Annex 8), some housing and administrative offices. A
detailed description and a flow sheet are given in Annex 5.
3
3.08      The sawmill will process about 340,000 m /yearl/ of logs 20 cm or
more in top diameter and 2.5 and 5.0 m in length to produce annually 182,000
m3 of sawnwood in three shifts. The logs will be sorted into species in the
woods and delivered by truck to the mill.  They will be debarked partly in
the woods and partly at the plant depending on the availability of labor,
although the plant will be capable of debarking the entire log input. The
primary breakdown will be a conventional bandsaw and no-man carriage, followed
by a quad bandsaw, a horizontal resaw, two other resaws and two adjustable
edgers. Because this will be by far the largest sawmill in Turkey the degree
of mechanization will be relatively high by Turkish standards, although manual
handling and sorting will be far greater than in North America or Europe.
After sawing, the wood will be airdried 2/ for some three months in the yard
and then trimmed and graded before shipment. Sawdust, slabs and edgings will
be collected for dispatch to the pulp mill.
3.09      The pulp mill will have an annual capacity of some 147,000 tons
(bone dry) of unbleached kraft pulp and be operated continuously, as is usual
in this industry. The pulp logs (472,000 m3/year) and sawmill residues
(142,000 m3/year) will be chipped and blended to assure a constant species
mix. Batch digesters have been suggested for simplicity of operation, es-
pecially as cooking conditions will differ for the two types of pulp (high
1/   Wood volume figures used for the industrial part are on a true volume
basis whereas MF figures for sawlogs represent scaled volume which
amounts to about 10% less than true volume.

in the initial investment. However, this matter will again be reviewed
after some actual operating experience has been obtained.

and normal yield) needed for linerboard manufacture.  Sackkraft requires only
normal yield pulp.  Pulp washing and screening will be in two lines also for
this reason and the refining will be done in five double disk refiners, before
the pulp is fed to the paper machine.
3.10      The paper miLl will have an annual capacity to produce 155,000 tons
of kraft linerboard 1/ on one paper machine. However, in order to meet expected
market growth optilmally and taking into account other paper making capacity
in Turkey, the paper mill will also be able to produce sackkraft though of a
smaller combined tonnage. The capacity of the mill producing sackkraft only
would be 90,000 tons per year. The paper machine, a conventional "fourdri-
nier", will have a finished paper width of 6.4 m and maximum machine speed of
600 meters per minute.
3.11      Electric power will be mostly (93%) generated on site and the re-
mainder purchased. Steam will be produced in the chemical recovery furnace
(46%) and in a fuel-oil fired boiler. As mentioned previously, water will be
obtained from the nearby Manavgat River. A small townsite at the mill will
contain 177 housing units for key personnel, a guest house, a shop, a school
and a mosque. Some 857 people will be employed in the mill of which 534 are
classified as unskilled and no difficulty is expected in hiring them locally.
Of the remaining workers, some 145 should have some direct experience in the
pulp and paper and sawmill industry and will be difficult to hire from out-
side. SEKA will transfer personnel from its existing mills after they have
been trained to upgrade their skills. Adequate training is an essential element
of the project and is being provided for (para 6.05 and Annex 5).
3. 12     Transport of inbound traffic (primarily logs, fuel oil and chemicals)
will be arranged by SEKA and outbound shipments (sawnwood and paper) by the
customers (Annex 7). With the considerable quantities involved and the rel-
atively small size of trucks now in use in the area, traffic congestion could
occur at certain times and, improvement of the coastal highway leading to
the plant in places and alternative means of transport should therefore be
studied. Preliminary investigations by Sandwell show considerable savings
in transport costs if truck sizes could be increased from 6 to 20 tons, and
especially if tug/barge sea shipments of products (and eventually wood from
Mersin) could be used. While any road congestion should not affect the
plant's operations it will inconvenience and create problems for local road
users and tourists. This problem has been discussed with the Government,
which will study the impact of the mill on highway capacity in the adjacent
area by the end of 1974 and will implement the necessary steps to ensure
adequate transport infrastructure.
1/   Linerboard is the paper used as the outside and inside layers of corru-
gated containers. The layers are separated by a corrugated paper called
corrugating medium or "fluting".

C. Tne Studies Part
3.-.3     IBRD financing of US$0.4 million is proposed to help finance studies
for the future development of the forest sector. Such studies and potential
resulting investments have always formed part of the discussion leading to
the Antalya Project which is just one step on the long road of Turkey's forest
development. The studies are currently being defined more precisely and their
foreign exchange cost appears to be between US$2.5 and US$3.5 million. The
Bank iinancing would be used for one or more specific studies in this program.
Additional financing is being considered by UNDM in the amount of US$1 million
from the Turkey Country Program and the Administrator's Program Reserve, and
from EIB in the amount of US$1.1 million from an existing line of credit of
2.0 million Unit of Account (US$2.4 million equivalent) already available to
Turkey for pre-investment studies.
3.14      The Groad scope of the studies has been clarified by a "Pilot Study"
of the northwest region of Turkey in the vicinity of the Marmara Sea. This
study was financed by the UNDP and executed by the FAO using Sandwell & Com-
pany as the subcontractor. The study 1/ shows that the Marmara region has
32% of the forested area of Turkey but that the present forest management sys-
tem would not allow enough additional wood to be produced for further indus-
trial development in Turkey. If an accelerated cutting and planting in the
Marmara Region program was instituted it would be possible to raise the annual
allowable cut from 3 to over 5 million cubic meters per year for coniferous
wood. With this increased wood supply it would be possible to expand paper
and sawnwood production to meet Turkey's expected future demands through the
early 1980s. The cost of the forestry and industrial developments would be
some US$700 million over a 5- to 8-year period and initial indications are
that the investments would yield a satisfactory return.
3.15      Much remains to be done in defining the specific scope of the stud-
ies, in establishing the implementation machinery, and particularly in coor-
dinating the efforts of both the Turkish and International institutions, but
these should be finalized by the middle of 1974. It is therefore recommended
that IBRD funds of US$0.4 million be made available to the Government to be
utilized at the discretion of the Bank management in accordance with normal
Bank practice for preinvestment studies.
D.  Ecology
3.16      The Antalya coast is widely reputed for its natural beauty, its his-
torical sites and its delightful climate and has therefore a high potential
for the development of tourism. Pulp and paper plants, on the other hand,
have also been reputed for their adverse impact on the environment. There
would therefore appear to be a conflict in building such a mill in such an
area. However, modern technology has reduced the degrading effect of pulp
and paper plants to a level which need not interfere with tourism development,
so that the two types of development could proceed side-by-side (Annex 8).
1/   Described more fully in Annex 6.



- 11 -
3.17      While marginal risks due to plant upsets may still remain, the en-
vironmental protection measures proposed for the plant will ensure that its
impact on scenic view, air and water quality and traffic congestion will be
reduced to acceptable levels. Careful architectural planning and landscaping
will ensure that the view is not marred by an ugly industrial plant. The
gaseous and liquid effluents will be minimized through maximum in-plant re-
cycling, and the emissions will be treated and disposed of to render them
harmless. Gaseous emissions will all be disposed of to the atmosphere via
a single tall stack. Liquid effluents will be settled and clarified before
being discharged to the sea via a pipeline, long enough (probably 1 to 2 km
into the sea) to ensure sufficient dilution. Plant operating procedures will
specify proper operations of these systems and the personnel will be adequately
trained in their operation and maintenance. The traffic problem will be stud-
ied as discussed in para 3.12 and suitable measures such as highway improvements,
and/or sea shipments introduced.
3.18      The constraints of topography put primary emphasis on locating plant
sites along a 90 km belt of coastal land, some 5-10 km deep. The Government
established an interministerial committee to conduct a detailed comparison of
ten specific sites in a zone 25 km either side of the Manavgat River. The
committee recommended, and the Government concurred in, a site 3 km inland and
some 25 km froi. the historical and touristic area of Side as being the one
best able to satisfy a list of economic, ecological, and tourism criteria
drawn up to compare the sites. It is estimated that the site chosen will
entail initial capital costs of some TL 45 million more than the lowest cost
alternative which would have been some 11 km from Side. Although the site is
owned by private parties there should be no difficulties with land acquisition.
3.19      The Government will ensure that the mill follows strict standards
for air and effluent emission controls and architectural design standards.
The Bank's approval will be sought on the character and implementation of
these ecological controls. The Government will ensure that haphazard devel-
opment of the area surrounding the plant site is avoided. No other indus-
trial plants will be allowed to be built in the vicinity of the mill.
3.20      Forestry operations will be conducted according to sound silvi-
cultural and cutting practices. Management of the forest resources will be
based on the principle of sustained yield to ensure that through regulation
of annual allowable cut, timber supplies will not be diminished. Felling
operations will be carried out with due regard for erosion controls. Both
reforestation and afforestation with indigenous species will further ensure
the maintenance of the natural forest cover. Policing by the Government of
cutting regulations and effective fire and erosion control is expected to
ensure the environmental integrity of the forests and its wildlife.

IV. TIFE MARKET
4.01      The market for Antalya's forest products - sawnwood, linerboard and
sackkraft - which will all be sold domestically, is described in detail in
Annex 9 and summarized in the following paragraphs.
A.   Sawnwood
4.02      The availability of good and ample supplies of sawlogs in the Antalya
forests fits well with the rising national demand for sawnwood.  About 80% of
sawn goods are used for construction purposes, and the boom in house, apartment,
office and industrial building construction will require large amounts. Most
of the Antalya sawn goods from the Pinus Brutia trees will be construction
grade only, used for scaffolding, concrete framework, roof rafters, and roof
tile support battens.
4.03      Current (1972) consumption of sawnwood for these uses in the proj-
ect's natural marketing area (i.e. Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Mersin-Adana,
Konya and Antalya whicl  together account for about 45% of total Turkish con-
sumption) is 735,000 m and is expected to grow in future at some 6.5% per
year. Such a projected growth rate may be on the conservative side on the
basis of both the expected growth in construction activities in Turkey and
past consumption growth in sawnwood in the country which during the period
1962-72 may have reached 10% per year (available statistics are unreliable).
4.04      By 1979, when3the Antalya sawmill is expected to have reached full
production of 182,000 m , the incremental sjwnwood consumption in the mill's
marketing a ea would have reached 405,000 m  (for a total consumption of
1,140,000 m ). Consequently, the Antalya mill would supply only 45% of the i
incremental consumption. Since there are no known major expansions of sawnwood
capacity in the marketing area, and accepting that consumption of sawnwood
may fluctuate with developments in the construction industry, there is no
difficulty foreseen in disposing of the mill's total outpuit. The Antalya
Establishment, with SEKA's help, will prepare a detailed marketing and dis-
tribution plan by the end of 1974 well before production starts and prepara-
tion of such a plan is part of a Project Agreement between the Bank and The
Establishment and SEKA.
B.   All Papers
4.05      Paper consumption rose in Turkey between 1960 and 1972 at an aver-
age annual rate of about 13%.  This is a considerable increase considering
import constraints and the relatively high Turkish paper prices. The follow-
ing table shows consumption and production capacity for major groups of paper
in Turkey in 1972 (actual) and 1982 (projected),

/1   Consumption and capacity do not match well because of differences in
category definitions and because paper machines often produce papers
other than those originally planned.
/2   Includes Antalya and other projected capacity (Annex 9).
The above table does not take into account the many small old private sector
paper mills based upon waste paper xwhich are thought to produce in the range
of 15,000-25,000 tons per year of low-grade paper and board. Overall paper
making capacity was thus somewhat in excess of 1972 consumption, but because
of new capacity having only recently been added and duie to imbalances in
certain types of papers, an estimated 40,000 tons of paner products had to
be imported. Imports are expected to decline to 15,000 tons in 1973 as SEKA's
new mills approach capacity operations. Overall demand for paper is expected
to increase by about 9.5% per year between 1972 and 1982 but this will vary
among different types of paper as can be seen from the above table. Presently
foreseen 1982 capacity appears adequate only for sackkraft, linerboard and
miscellaneous papers.  If more new capacity is not built beyond that now pro-
jected, some 220,000 tons would be imported in 1982, including provision for
special papers not produced in Turkey. imports are likely to be very expen-
sive in the future as Europe has practically exhausted its potential for fur-
ther supplies and demand for imports from outside increase. On the other
hand, given Turkey's substantial forest potential, there is no reason why
it should not be self-reliant for many years to come. Product prices are
covered in para. 7.07.



- 14 -
C.   Linerboard
4.06      Linerboard consumption is directly related to packaging.  In 1972,
linerboard consumption in Turkey is estimated to have reached about 21,500
tons, up from 6,000 tons in 1962 and equivalent to an average annual growth
rate of 13%. But in addition, there was probably a substantial unsatisfied
demand. Corrugated box makers, which are all located near population centers,
and packaging users in Turkey have been complaining of chronic deficiencies
in supply and it also appears that the cotmtry's exports of fruit and veg-
etables have been inhibited by the shortage of modern packaging. Neighboring
countries such as Greece and Israel which are known exporters of these commo-
dities have a per capita linerboard consumption of 4 and 25 times respectively
as large as Turkey, which has much greater timber resources than either of
them. Finally, corrugated container plants in 1972 operated at only about
two-thirds of their capacity for lack of linerboard. Thus, true linerboard
demand in 1972 may have been between 5,500 and 7,000 tons above the actual
consumption of 21,500 tons.
4.07      In future, demand for linerboard is expected to grow by between 12%
and 15% annually, and is thus forecast to reach between 52,700 and 63,000 tons
in 19-79, the first year in which the paper mill is assumed to be operating at
full capacity. It is probable that a corrugating medium pulp and paper mill
will be added at Caycuma. Meanwhile, Caycuma could increase corrugating med-
ium production by up to 30,000 tons per year to meet the needs for this other
component of corrugated containers. Growth in corrugated container demand
will be stimulated mainly by export packaging and also by domestic trade in
high value items such as industrially produced consumer goods while wooden
boxes will most likely continue to be used for agricultural trade in Turkey.
D.  Sackkraft
4.08      The major consumer of multiwall-sackkraft paper in Turkey is the
cement industry which absorbs 80% of all domestic production while the re-
maining 20% is taken up by three other industries: fertilizer, feed grain
and gypsum. All these are rather strong growth industries in Turkey and it
is expected that demand will increase by between 9 and 12% per year from the
estimated 1972 consumption of 44,500 tons to between 84,000 and 97,000 tons
in 1979. The mean demand of 90,000 tons is expected to be met by the Caycuma
(60,000 tons) and the Antalya (30,000 tons) mills. The Antalya mill has the
flexibility of producing both linerboard and sackkraft and the following
table summarizes the expected supply/demand ranges for these two papers.

The above table indicates that (a) were demand to increase for both types of
papers at the upper range of their growth expectations, a supply shortfall
would occur right from the outset of the forecast period, but there would be
a small supply excess if demand were to grow at the low expectations; that
(b) a mean demand rise for both products or likely high/low combinations
could be met through 1981; but that (c) thereafter even the low demand rise
for sackkraft could not be covered by the available capacities of the.Caycuma
and Antalya mills.
V. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCIAL PLALN
5.01      Project costs and financial plans for the Forestry and Industrial
parts of the project are dealt with in detail in Annexes 10 and 11 and are
described briefly in the following sections and a summary of total project
costs and financial plans is given at the end of this Chapter.
A.   Forestry Part
1.   Investment Costs
5.n2      Investments in the Antalya Forestry Division through 1977 are
summarized below:

The above cost estimates are based on detailed forecasts prepared j.ointly by
Sandwell and the Antalya Forestry Division in 1972/1973; they contain provi-
sions for 10% physical contingencies and for 10% per year price escalation
for local, and 8% on foreign expenditures. It is judged that the estimates
are adequate since these investments are not much different from those that
the Forestry Division has been dealing with routinely in the past and also
a large proportion of the investments is made up of standard shelf items.
2.   Financial Plan
5.03  .  The above financing requirements will be met as follows:

5.04      The financial needs of any of the Forestry Divisions are provided
by the Revolving Fund which is prepared annually by the GDF in coordination
with the Forestry Divisions as discussed in para. 2.09. The Ministry of
Forestry is, for its operations, financially independent from the Treasury
except for foreign funds.
5.05      The Bank and EIB will lend to the Government US$7.9 million equiv-
alent (para. 5.15) to cover the foreign exchange requirements of this part
of the project, except for the small amount of the incremental working
capital (US$O.1 million) which will have to be met by th.e Government. The
Bank's contribution of US$4.5 million will be for 16 years including 5 years
of grace and carry an interest rate of 7-1/4% and the EIB portion of US$3.4
million will be on the sane terms, except for an interest rate of 4 1/2%.
The Government will allocate the proceeds of the two loans to GDF for invest-
ments in the Antalya Forestry Division. Assurances have been given that
(a) the foreign loan proceeds will be made available as required by the pro-
ject; (b) the necessary budget provisions will be made to meet the project's
local costs and the foreign exchange portion of the working capital as well
as any additional budgetary provisions to meet any possible project cost
overrun; and that (c) at the same time adequate budget allocations will be
made for GDF's current operations.
B.   Industrial Part
1.   Investment Costs
5.06      The estimated capital costs and total financing required for the
sawmill and the pulp and paper plant are summarized below:

Total Project Cost   1,213    719    1,932   86.6   51.5   138.1    93.3

Total Financing Required  1,254    818    2,072   89.5   58.5   148.0   100
The above capital cost estimates were largely derived from Sandwell's work
based on their detailed investigations of locally available equipment and
services and their costs, inquires for equipment and services not available
in Turkey, and Sandwell's own accumulated cost data. The estimates are based
on end 1972 prices 1/ and the indicated foreign exchange costs represents the
best estimate of what will need to be purchased from outside Turkey.  Changes
made by the Bank include the addition of TL 30 million for extra effluent
treatment; TL 15 million in consideration of the IJ.S. devaluation in February
1973; and the consultant services being based on the signed contract. Foreign
equipment will not be subject to import duties under regulations drawn up to
encourage industrial development. The cost estimates provide for a 15% mar-
gin of preference on those items which may be awarded to Turkish manufacturers
after international competitive bidding. An overall contingency of about 8%
has been added to provide for unforeseen items as well as an annual price
1/ With the exception of the item "consultant services" which is based on a
contract signed in October 1973.

escalation of 10% for local and 8% for foreign expenditures. The estimates
are based on a construction period of four years; this is conservative by
international standards, but probably necessary for Turkey.
5.07      The working capital estimated at TL 94 million may appear rather
low, but this is principally due to the relatively small requirements for re-
ceivables, since according to prevailing practice in Turkey, 75% of the paper
sales value is paid by the customer prior to shipment.
5.08      In view of Sandwell's detailed project preparation, the above cap-
ital costs estimates appear realistic.
2.   Financial Plan
5.09      The financing required for the industrial part of the project is
expected to be met as follows:
Financial Plan - Industrial Part

Total               1,254       818      2,072      89.5     58.5    148.0
/1   A minor discrepancy exists between these amounts in this part of the
report and its annexes on the one side and the legal documents and part
IX. Recommendations on the other. In the latter places the equity is
rounded to TL 830 million and the SIB loan reduced correspondingly to
TL 457 million.
5.10      Project financing will be provided in a 60/40 debt/equity ratio,
which is considered adequate. The IBRD and EIB loans of together USS56.1
million will cover about 96% of the estimated foreign exchange costs, with
the remaining 4% or US$2.4 million to be provided by the Government. Local
costs will be financed through T. 828 million equity contributions of the
Government through SEKA to The Establishment and a TL 459 million loan from
the State Investment Bank.



- 20 -
5.a 1"    Proposed Bank lending of US$35.1 million equivalent will be made to
the Turkish Government at an interest rate of 7-1/4% and for 16 years includ-
ing 5 vears of grace. The Government will channel the loan proceeds through
SIB for onlending to The Establishment at an interest rate of 9% per annum,
which rate is generally consistent with the current IFC interest rate for
projects in Turkey and considered roughly in line with foreign exchange
financing from commercial sources although differences in terms make com-
parison difficult. The interest margin of 1-3/4% (between 7-1/4% and 9%)
will be allocated to SIB and the Treasury (in lieu of a guarantee fee),
in the proportion of 1% to SIB and 3/4% to the Treasury.  A subsidiary loan
Agreement for these arrangements will be drawn up on terms satisfactory to
the Bank.
5.12      The EIB loan of US$21.0 million equivalent would also be made to
the Government but at an interest rate of 4 1/2% for 30 years including 8 years
of grace. It would be passed to the project on the same terms as the Bank
loan, and also through the same channels. The interest margin of 4 1/2%
(9% - 4 1/2%) will also be allocated to SIB and the Treasury, but in the pro-
portion of 1% to SIB and 3 1/2% to the Treasury.
5.13      The SIB loan in the amount of to TL 459 million (US$32.8 million)
for local expenditures would be granted at their usual interest rate of 10-1/2%
for 15 years including 5 years of grace.
5.14      The equity of TL 828 million (USS59.1 million) - TL 795 million for
local costs and TL 33 million for foreign costs - will be Provided by the
Government through SEKA. The Government will provide the equity in time as
required by the project and at least at a rate of 40X of project expenditures.
Also as a guard against any unexpected cost overrun (both in foreign exchange
and local currency) and to keep The Establishment on a sound financial foot-
ing until the project is operating normally, the Government will provide any
additional funds as necessary to complete the project 1/ and on terms satis-
factory to the Bank and to provide at the completion date a current ratio of
at least 1.3:1 in The Establishment. Finally, at least 40% of any additional
overrun financing will be provided in the form of equity or subordinated debt
and the terms of the additional loan funds will be substantially the same as
the original loans.
C.   Summary of Project Costs and Financing Sources
5.15      The following gives a summary of the costs and sources of financing
for each of the three Project Parts. The scope of the studies included in
the project has been discussed in paras. 3.13-3.15 and the financing of the
studies has been included in the presentation below.
1/   The Project "Completion Date" is defined as the date on which the mill
has run at 90% of its rated capacity for 180 consecutive days. This
normally occurs some 2-3 years after mill start up.

EIB loan has been assumed at US$24.4 million. Fluctuations in exchange
rates, however, have at least at the moment lowered the dollar equivalent
of the EIB unit of account. The Government will cover related shortfalls
in dollar value if they in fact occur.
External borrowings from EIB and the Bank of together US$64.4 million equiv-
alent will amount to about 38% and 95% of total financing and foreign exchange
requirements respectively. Additionally, US$1.1 million will be provided
from EIB country funds, allocated for studies. 'The allocation of funds from
the EIB and the Bank are discussed in para 5.17.
D.   Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursements
5.16      A more detailed description of the goods and services for which the
Bank loan of US$40.0 million will be used is given in Annexes 10 and 11 and
summarized below separately for each of the three project parts.

The Bank loan would be used to finance items in accordance with para. 5.17.
Procurement and disbursements would be made as follows:
100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment
100% of ex-factory price of locally manufactured equip-
ment awarded under international competitive bidding, and
100% of foreign expenditures for consultant services pro-
vided by foreign consulting firms.
100% of total expenditures for consultant services pro-
vided by local firms.
100% of interest during construction and committment fee
on the Bank loan.
The Bank would finance 100% of the consultant services contracted to Sandwell
(Canada) for the Industrial and Forestry part of the project in view of the
regional constraints of EIB procurement. As a result of this, Bank financing
for equipment is proportionately lower than EIB financing. As the mill con-
sultants have been hired and as some forestry equipment is being purchased
US$0.9 million of retroactive financing will be necessary.
E.  Procurement
5.17      Goods financed by the loan would be procured under the Bank Group's
normal procedures for international competitive bidding, including the pro-
vision of a margin of preference for local manufacturers for bid comparison
purposes of 15% or the applicable duty, whichever is lower.  Procurement
arrangements will be on a joint basis with EIB. The bidding will be phased,
with the long-delivery, higher-priced major items -- notably the pulp and
paper plant -  being put to tender first, up to the limit of the Bank loan.
Winning bidders from the European Community would be paid with EIB funds,
others with Bank funds. The EIB loan will be available for procurement in



- 23 -
the Six founder members rather than the Nine since ratification of the entry
on the new members has not been completed. As bidding proceeds - should it
become evident that EIB's loan could not be fully utilized during the first
phase, then in the second phase certain goods would be restricted to bidding
within the Six only, to make sure that all EIB funds will be utilized. Cost
penalties, if any, on account of such restrictive bidding should be minor,
since there would still be adequate competition among Community suppliers.
A Loan Administration Agreement under which procedures for bidding, disburse-
ments and supervision will be establ:Lshed has been agreed upon between the
Bank and EIB.

VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Forestry Part
6.01      The Antalya Forestry Division, will have prime responsibility for
the day-to-day implementation of this part of the project; it will be assisted
by the GDF head office staff in Ankara in overall policy planning and the
supply of particular technical expertise.  Although not on the same scale,
the Antalya Forestry Division has been confronted with similar tasks in the
past and is therefore judged to be capable of executing the primarily physical
part of the forestry project, i.e. increasing the wood supply for the Antalya
mill within a relatively short period of time.
6.02      However, outside assistance is needed for meeting the other objec-
tive of the project, namely to help reform an existing forestry operation into
one with a more aggressive approach towards forest management. To this end,
4-6 experienced Turkish foresters assisted by two foreign forestry consul-
tants will form the nucleus of a Project Implementation Team, which is intended
to be in existence for the next 6-7 years although the expatriates would com-
plete most of their work within 2 years. The Team's basic task will be to
prepare detailed forest management plans for the Antalya region. Initially,
it will work out a 5-year development and operations plan, laying down the over-
all objectives to be achieved, to be followed up subsequently with more de-
tailed annual operating plans and instructions. In addition, the Team will
prepare a 20-year plan, setting out the principal objectives of how the region's
forests should be developed and managed to maximize their yield in the longer
term. The Government will cause the MF/GDF to enter into agreements satisfac-
tory to the Bank to hire the consultants and establish the Project Implemen-
tation Team and prepare and implement a forest development plan.
B.  Industrial Part
6.03      The execution of the pulp, paper and sawmills will be the respon-
sibility of The Establishment assisted to a large degree by SEKA. The
project manager has already been appointed - he was the general manager
of the Caycuma mill and has considerable experience in project construction
as well as operations. As the project and general manager, he will be re-
sponsible to an administrative committee, which will consist of the Chairman
and three members who all belong to SEKA's top management and form the link
between The Establishment and SEKA as parent company. Apart from major pol-
icy decisions, The Establishment will have the authority to execute and op-
erate this part of the project. Execution will follow a critical path sched-
ule to be established.
6.04      Sandwell & Co. has been engaged to help in the implementation of
the project. The contract has been reviewed by Bank and EIB staff and found
to be satisfactory. Sandwell's first task will be to finalize the design of
the project and prepare a detailed construction budget and time schedule for
the project execution. Subsequently, Sandwell will have prime responsibility



- 25 -
for detailed design, procurement of equipment through all stages, the obtain-
ing of subcontract services for civil, structural, erection, mechanical
and electrical work on site, and the preparation and issuance of control
documentation to monitor progress of the project. All Sandwell's work will
be done in close cooperation with The Establishments staff and a field office
will be established at The Establishment's plant site, as well as a liaison
office at SEKA's headquarters at Izmit.
6.05      Soon after construction commences and within the same consultant
contract, a program of operational assistance would be started, which will
last from about 2 years before until about 6 months after commencement of
plant operations. Some 20 key expatriate personnel will be provided to estab-
lish the operational organization, develop detailed work programs for the
start-up operation of the mills, run training programs and prepare operating
nanuals.  They will have line responsibility for plant operation initially,
training local counterparts to take their places as soon as possible.
6.06      To strengthen the Antalya operation, The Establishment will by June
30, 1974 undertake and implement appropriate recommendations of studies to
determine the optimum method of wood transport to the plant; to determine the
best marketing methods for the distribution of its products, particularly
sawnwood, which is new to SEKA Establishments; and of Turkey's capacity to
produce corrugating medium and corrugated containers.
C.  Studies Part
6.07      The studies to be financed by the UNDP, the EIB and the Bank will
be defined and implementation machinery established by the three institutions
and the Government during the first half of 1974 (paras 3.13 and 3.15 and
Annex 6).
D.   Role of State Investment Bank (SIB)
6.08      The State Investment Bank (SIB) would be a co-lender for the indus-
trial part of the project and would disburse all loan funds to The Establish-
ment. The proposed Bank and EIB funds would be lent to the Government who
would onlend them to SIB who in turn would onlend them to The Establishment.
A subsidiary loan agreement between the Government, SIB, SEKA and The Estab-
lishment will be entered into in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank.
The arrangements with SIB serve two purposes: they will provide a single
channel for all loan funds to The Establishment, and they will help establish
an initial working relationship between SIB and the Bank in preparation for
possible future lending to SIB. A detailed description of SIB and its role
in the project is given in Annex 12.
6.09      SIB has been playing an increasingly important role in providing
long-term finance needed by the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs). Its con-
tribution has exceeded 20% of the total investments in the SEEs recently.
In 1973, SIB is expected to provide TL 4.2 billion against a total require-
ment of TL 13.7 billion by the SEEs. The resources of SIB are provided mainly
from tax free bond issues, but also from equity contributions and advances
from the Government as well as loan repayments.



- 26 -
6. O      SIB's organization, policies and procedures are generally sound
given the constraints faced by the public sector entities in Turkey.  SIB
staff are competent and its management shows initiative, drive and readiness
to take on new activities. SIB will provide in its bookkeeping and financial
reporting system for separate treatment of the proceeds of the Bank and EIB
loans, and strengthen nroject appraisal and supervision to meet the requirements
of its rapidly increasing lending volume.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Forestry Part
7.01      The Antalya Forestry Division derives revenues from the sale of its
wood products - firewood, sawlogs, pulplogs, mine props, etc. - and other
material such as pine resin. It uses the revenue to cover its operating
costs - mostly labor and transportation - to meet various contributions to
the MF as support for its nationwide programs, to pay income taxes, and to
put aside a depreciation reserve for equipment replacements. The Antalya
Forestry Division's production plan, operating costs and investment costs
are coordinated with the GDF and become part of the Annual Revolving Fund
(para. 2.09) which is consolidated on a national basis.
7.02      The projected revenues and costs of the Antalya Forestry Division
are shown in detail in Annex 13 and are summarized below.
Projected Revenues and Costs for Antalya Forestry Division
(in million TL)

/1   Revenues from 1978 onwards do not increase in direct proportion to the
production volume because an increasing proportion of pulpwood is produced.



- 27 -
The projections have been prepared at constant prices prevailing in Turkey
in 1972. However, given the worldwide trend of increasing wood prices, the
revenue/cost margin is expected to widen since operating costs are not ex-
pected to increase to the same extent as wood prices. Even on the conserva-
tive assumption of constant prices, income and cash flow statements for the
forestry activities of the project show that the Antalya Forestry Division
will have operating losses only from 1974 to 1976 while it builds up its
production activities. However, from 1976 net income and cash generation
is expected to greatly improve leading to substantial cash surpluses to
cover all replacement investments.
7.03      The biggest source of revenues (about 63%) for the Antalya Forestry
Division will be the sales to The Establishment; they will be based on a
long-term wood supply contract, discussed in para. 7.06.  The costs are
dominated by direct operational costg, particularly the forest maintenance
(reforestation, afforestation, erosion contr5l, fire protection) production
and transportation.  In 1982, some 800,000 m  of wood are expected to be3pro-
duced.  jnit production costs - before income taxes - are about 250 TL/m
(US$18/m ) which compares favorably with cost in other parts of the world.
7.04      Given the strong expected cash position, the Antalya Forestry
Division should not need to call on outside funds for operations and
investments after 1977 but should become a net contributor to its Ankara
headquarters even if notional debt service payments are allocated to the
Antalya Forestry Division. The financial return of the forestry part of
the project on an increcremental basis is 24%.
B.   Industrial Part
1.   Revenues and Operating Costs
7.05      A detailed description of the assumptions for revenues and operat-
ing costs is given in Annex 14 and the major findings are discussed below.
7.06      The price assumptions for product sales and operating costs cor-
respond to 1972 prices. Since sawnwood and wood prices are subject to large
price fluctuations, special consideration was given to a careful evaluation
of the cost/revenue structure for purposes of the financial projections, and
that chosen can be considered conservative. Wood prices are based on a long-
term contract between SEKA on behalf of The Establishment and the GDF. This
contract is acceptable and shows that sawlog prices will be adjusted semi-
annually according to average auction prices, while pulplog prices will be de-
termined by a formula prepared by the GDF to ensure that all costs are covered
as well as allowin§ for capital improvements. The present pulplog price ex
forest is TL 145/m  to which the delivery costs have been added.  The sawlog
market price in 1972 ex forest averaged TL 432/m . These prices compare
well with prices in other parts of the world, and reflect well the difference
in value between the two types of logs.  The prices used for the wood costs of
the industrial part are the same as those used to calculate the revenues of the
Forestry Division. Tre wood used as raw material is subject to 12.5% turnover
tax.



- 28 -
7.07      Paper prices are controlled by the Government; paper prices - ex-
cept lEnerboard - have been unchanged since mid-1971 and further increases
are expected shortly. Financial projections have been based upon the following
mid-1972 mill-net sales prices:
Sawnwood (weighted average market price)         810 TL/m3  or      57.85US$/mr3
Linerboard                                     5,100 TL/MT  or    364.30US$/MT
Sackkraft                                      5,100 TTL/MT  or    364.30US$/)MT
In mid-1972, linerboard and sackkraft prices in Turkey were higher (about 50%
and 5% respectively) than world market prices, primarily because of high trans-
fer payments (direct taxes on inputs alone account for about 25% of the paper
price) contained in the operating costs (para. 8.04), and in the case of
linerboard the high local demand. Current paper prices in Turkey and in world
trade are increasing substantially, and while precise prices are hard to come
by, the relationship between Turkish and world prices appears to be similar
to that at the time of evaluation.
7.08      A large item in the operating costs is the production tax (turnover
tax) which amounts to about 13% of the paper products sales price. Other
major items in the operating costs are fuel oil, saltcake and maintenance
materials. Fuel oil is taxed heavily and it was priced at about US$36 per
ton in mid-1972 1/; maintenance materials mainly consist of imported mater-
ials on which an import duty of about 30% is imposed. Labor required for
the operation of the mill and the ancillary facilities is relatively not an
important cost item, even after allowance for some over-staffing as compared
to international standards.
2.   Financial Projections
7.09      The projections are summarized below:
1/   The present oil crisis does not seem to seriously affect fuel oil
availability in Turkey. The mill profitability is not sensitive to
fuel costs, and wood and wood residues can be substituted for fuel
oil if needed.

The projections are based on conservative assumptions as to production and
build-up of capacity (Annex 14). The sawmill will start operations in 1976
and the pulp-and papermill in 1978, allowing for a 4 year construction period
for the pulp-and papermill.



- 30 -
7.iO      The foregoing summary shows that the project would be soundly fi-
nanced; the initial debt/equity ratio of 60:40 drops slightly during the first
two operating years because of start-up losses but improves rapidly from 1979
onwards when repayments of loans start. During the first and second operating
years, when the project is not complete as defined, the debt service coverage
would be respectively, 1.1 and 1.4. It levels off at about 1.6 in subsequent
years. Given the capital intensive type of industry, the profit break-even
point during the initial years will be at about 80% capacity utilization but
decreases rapidly thereafter (Annex 14).  The cash break-even point is at
about 65% during the initial five operating years. Large operating losses
are expected only in the first year of operations of the papermill in which
a capacity utilization of only 50% has been assumed; but as soon as the paper-
mill reaches a reasonable capacity earnings should be satisfactory.
7.11      In order to protect the Establishment from possible unfavorable
relationships between prices controlled by Government for The Establishment's
supplies and products and to permit it to maintain a sound financial condi-
tion, three assurances have been given. SEKA will review in 1975 and every
two years thereafter the prices of the Establishment's inputs and outputs and
will make, or seek from the Government, changes in such prices that are neces-
sary to enable The Establishment to operate on a sound commercial basis.
Secondly, The Establishment will maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.1:1
and the Government will help it to maintain this ratio by making available,
if necessary, loans or by other suitable means in consultation with the Bank.
Thirdly, SEKA being 100 percent owner, will not withdraw funds from The
Establishment if by doing so its current ratio would fall below 1.3 (see also
para 5.14).
3.   Financial Return and Risks
7.12      Based on the projections set forth above, the financial return of
the project would be 15.0% before and 13.5% after taxes on income (Annex 14
shows the calculation). As usual, the return would be sensitive to changes
of revenues. A 10% decrease of revenues would result in a return of 10.6%
before taxes. Increases in wood costs and investment costs affect the return
to a much lesser extent. The rate of return sensitivities for different as-
sumptions for revenues, wood costs and investment costs are shown in detail
in Annex 14.
7.13      The main risk faced by The Establishment is insufficient revenue.
However, since prices seem well assured, any loss of revenue would come
mainly from loss of production. Delay in the start-up date due to construc-
tion problems and technical difficulties which limit output are the usual
main causes of loss of production. However, these risks have been minimized
by employing experienced consultants, who will have major responsibilities
during project implementation as well as until the start-up period has been
successfully completed. SEKA will also have the start-up experience of its
three new mills to draw on.

VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01      In quantifying the economic impact of the project, the forestry and
industrial parts are combined, as they are parts of an integrated project,
one part dependent on the other. The economic costs and benefits are, there-
fore, the incremental costs and benefits of the integrated project.
8.02      The economic costs and benefits have been evaluated at world prices
(Annex 15). Tradeables are valued at border prices, and non-tradeables at
the social costs of the inputs required to produce them. Both skilled and
unskilled labor are valued at their respective nominal wage rates, because
the rapid increase in agricultural and tourism activities in the project
area is expected to absorb the area's unemployed labor during most of the
project's lifetime. Duties, taxes and other transfer payments are eliminated
from the revenue and cost streams.
8.03      The main project outputs are paper - linerboard and sackkraft - and
sawnwood. Turkey has been importing paper for many years and has recently
started importing roundwood. Since in the absence of the proposed project
these commodities would have to be imported, the economic benefits of the
projects are, therefore, measured on the basis of import prices. World
prices of these commodities are mainly influenced by the structure of the
paper and forest industries in the major exporting countries (UJ.S.A., Canada
and Northern Europe).  The paper industry in these countries, which until
recently had a large unutilized capacity, is now barely meeting demand, and
prices have been rising steadily since the second half of 1972. For
the purpose of project evaluation - to have costs and benefits on the same
basis - 1972 world prices are used. On a cif basis these are: US$191/ton for
linerboard, US$236/ton for sackkraft and US$56/m for sawnwood.
8.04      1972 international prices are also used to value project inputs.
Most project inpu:s are tradeables and are valued at border prices. Wood
used to produce sawnwood and paper qualifies as a non-tradeable, or domestic
good, because transportation costs make it uneconomical either to export or
import it - domestic cost of producing and transporting wood to3the border is
US$18/m compared to an expected fgb export price of US$12-15/m and an ex-
pected cif import price of US$30/m - and is, therefore, valued at the cost of
the inputs used to produce it. On this basis, economic values of investment
and operating inputs are about 85% and 50% of their respective financial val-
ues, with transfer payments accounting for most of the difference.
8.05      Based on the economic projections of costs and benefits over the
project lifetime, the economic return is estimated at 14%, which is satis-
factory. Like the financial return, the economic return is sensitive to
changes in revenues: it would decrease to about 11% if nroduct prices
dropped by 10%. In view of recent price trends, this price decrease is
improbable.  A more likely outcome is a 10% increase in product prices,
which would raise the economic rate of return to 17.2%. The project return



- 32 -
--s less sensitive to changes in investment cost: it would drop to 12.8% and
11.6% if investment cost increased by 10% and 20% respectively. This rela-
tive insensitivity to investment cost is due mainly to the labor intensive-
ness of the forestry part of the project.
8.06      No allowance was made in the economic return calculation for ex-
ternal economies attributable to the project. These include training labor;
stabilizing the forestry labor force; and providing the some 440 small sawmills
with a steady and reliable source of unfinished sawnwood, to turn into joinery
products, furniture, and boxes, thereby freeing their capital which was
mostly tied up in log inventory purchased at infrequent log auctions. Thus
the big mill will not harm the small sawmills, but rather help them improve
their operations.
8.07      Although the industrial part will employ only 850 people, the
forestry part is quite labor-intensive, involving direct employment of 4,000.
A detailed description of the socio-economic impact of the project is given
in Annex 16. The net annual foreign exchange savings resulting from the
production of the proJect are estimated at about US$25 million, compared
to the total investment of US$164 million.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following princi-
pal points:
a.   SEKA will develop a training program for the Antalya Estab-
lishment (paras. 3.11 and 6.05).
b.  The Government will study the impact of the Industrial Proj-
ect on highway capacity in the adjacent area by December 31,
1974, and implement the necessary steps to ensure adequate
transportation infrastructure (para. 3.12).
c.   SEKA and the Establishment will install and operate environ-
mental and pollution control systems satisfactory to the
Bank and the Government will monitor their installation and
operations (paras. 3.17 and 3.10).
d.   The GDF and Antalya Forestry Division will carry out
the felling and replanting of the forests and installation
of forest infrastructure in accordance with sound silvi-
cultural standards. The Government will monitor these oper-
tions (para 3.20).
e.   The Government will enable SEKA to make available to the
Establishment at least TL 830,000,000 in equity capital
(paras. 5.10 and 5.14).



- 33 -
f.   The Government will agree to the payment to SIB by the
Antalya Establishment of a fee of 1-3/4%, of which 1%
will be maintained by SIB, thus bringing the total cost
of Bank financing for the Industrial Project to 9%.
(para. 5.11).
g.   The Government will undertake to onlend the portion of the
Bank and EIB loans for the Industrial Project to SIB for
relending to SEKA and The Establishment on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank, under a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement acceptable to the Bank (paras. 5.11 and 5.12).
h.   The Government will undertake that by March 21, 1974.  SIB
will lend TL 457,000,000, to The Establishment. SIB intends
to provide this loan on terms which are satisfactory to the
Bank. (para. 5.13).
i.   The Government will provide or cause SEKA to provide such
additional funds for appropriate transfer to The Establishment,
as may be necessary to cover cost overruns in carrying out the
Ind-u.trial Project and to give The Establishment up to and
including the end of the financial quarter following the com-
pletion date of the Industrial Project a debt/equity ratio of
not more than 60:40 and a current ratio of at least 1.3:1
(para. 5.14).
j.   The Government will ensure that by April 30, 1974 the GDF
establishes the Project Implementation Team, and appoints con-
sultants to assist the Team, and by August 31, 1975 prepares
and implements forestry development plans for carrying out
the Forestry Project all on conditions satisfactory to-the
Bank (paras. 6.01 and 6.02).
k.   SEKA and the Establishment will prepare and carry out the
Industrial Project according to a critical path schedule
(para. 6.03).
1.   SEKA and The Establishment will undertake to carry out studies
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank by June 30,
1974 (i) on narketing and distributing its products; (ii) of
Turkey's capacity to produce corrugating medium and corrugated
containers and (iii) of the best method of wood transport from
the source to the mill by the end of 1974. SEKA will study its
financial control and reporting system by June 30, 1974. The
rscommendations of these four studies that are acceptable to

factory to the Bank on defining more precisely and implementing
the Studies, including the appointment of consultants by
April 30, 1974 on the terms of reference and on counterpart
arrangements for the studies (para. 6.07).
n.   The Government will cause SIB to provide separate accounting
treatment of the Bank and EIB loans in its financial controls
and reporting systems (para. 6.10).
o.   SEKA and The Establishment will agree that the Establishment
will not make any transfer of profits to SEKA if by so doing
the current ratio of the Antalya Establishment would fall be-
low 1.3:1 (para. 7.11).
p.   SEKA will review world and domestic wood and paper and other
input and output prices in 1975 and every two years thereafter
and make, or seek from the Government, changes in such prices
that are necessary to enable the Establishment to operate on
a sound commercial basis; the Government will take necessary
actions based on SEKA's review. (para. 7.11).
q.   The Establishment will maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.1:1
and the Government will enable it to do so by making available,
if necessary, loans or by any other means acceptable to the Bank
(para. 7.11).
9.02      Based on the assurances obtained, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank Loan of US$40.0 million.
