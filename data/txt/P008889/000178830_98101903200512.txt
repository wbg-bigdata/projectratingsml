INTENSIVE DAIRY PRODUCTION
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for intensive dairy production
in Turkey. It is a first phase in the development of modern dairy farming
in that country, and includes a four-year program of lending by the Agricul-
tural Bank of the Turkish Republic (ABT) for on-farm investment in irrigated
dairy farms, assisted by Government technical staff, including two well
qualified Technical Specialists. An estimated 250-300 farmers would
participate. They would already have dairy herds, and most would also be
engaged in other farming activity. ABT loans to project farmers would be
for 12 years, including four years' grace, with interest at 9% per year.
This rate is similar to ABT's current effective rate on agricultural loans
but lower than the 12.5% charged by commercial banks for medium-term
non-agricultural loans.
ii.       Turkey has resources suitable for livestock production, and needs
to increase the supply of fresh milk and meat for its growing urban popula-
tion. Turkey also exports cattle and beef to Middle Eastern neighbors and
is hopeful of developing meat exports to EEC countries. The growing tourist
trade is a direct foreign exchange earner and consumes beef and milk of the
quality the Project would supply. While the Project, by itself, would not
contribuite much to export earnings, subsequent phases would have potential
for increasing foreign exchange revenue. The Project is one of several
interrelated projects in Turkey's Second Five Year Plan, 1968/72.
iii.      Intensive dairy production in Turkey has been hampered by in-
adequate technical knowledge, especially of animal husbandry and forage
production: lack of foreign exchange to import improved dairy stock; and
the absence of long term credit. The Project would provide all these:
technical knowledge through the Intensive Dairy Production Division (IDPD)
of the General Directorate for Livestock Development Projects (LDP) of the
Ministry of Agriculture; foreign exchange through an IDA Credit to purchase
dairy cattle, essential farm machinery and other items; and long term credit
through ABT.
iv.       ABT is the largest bank in Turkey - a semi-autonomous Government-
owned statutory body, founded in 1863. Total assets at December 31, 1969
were TL 17,000 million (US$1,100 million). Modest, but regular, profits
are reinvested. In 1964, ABT started a medium and long term credit scheme,
and in 1968, for larger loans, established a Development and Encouragement
Loans Division, which would be responsible for administering credit under
the Project.
v.        IDA has already made two credits, and the Bank one loan, for
irrigated agriculture: US$20 million in 1963 (TU-38) and US$24 million in
1969 (TU-143 and TU-587) for two stages of the Seyhan Project, providing
water for about 100,000 ha in southern Turkey. The Bank also made a loan



- ii -
of US$3.9 mlllion for grain storage in 1950 (TU-27) and provided US$25.2
million for a multipurpose project in 1952, US$11 million of which was for
agriculture (TU-63).
vi.       The Project is estimated to cost US$7.5 million equivalent,
including US$0.7 million for technical services and US$0.3 million for tech-
nical studies. An IDA Credit of US$4.5 million equivalent is proposed.
The credit would be made to the Government of Turkey which would on-lend
the Turkish Lira equivalent of US$3.9 million to ABT for 15 years at 6.5%
interest annually including five years' grace. Since relending is in local
currency equivalent the Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
The Credit would finance about 60% of Project cost, representing the eligible
foreign exchange component. Government would contribute about 18% and part-
icipating farmers about 22%. Government would provide about US$1.0 million
as ABT capital and contribute about US$0.4 million for technical services.
Returns on incremental investment would be satisfactory, both to individual
farmers (16% to 22%, depending on farm location and size) and to the economy
of Turkey (20%).
vii.      Project farmers would purchase about 4,400 imported dairy cattle.
Cattle would be purchased following receipt of quotations from at least three
different countries, but farmers would remain free to choose whichever source
suited them best; such importation would be free of any import taxes. Pro-
curement of farm machinery not manufactured in Turkey (worth about US$700,000)
would be by competitive bulk purchase. Tractors (worth about US$450,000)
would be procured by international competitive bidding.
viii.     The Project would assist permanent improvement and upgrading of
Turkey's dairy industry in addition to its direct physical benefits. It
would help to supply meat and milk to the important tourist industry as well
as to a growing urban population. Sale of surplus improved dairy stock to
farmers outside the Project, and the demonstration effect, would be useful
indirect benefits.
ix.       The Project is suitable for an IDA Credit to the Government of
Turkey of US$4.5 million.

INTENSIVE DAIRY PRODUCTION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey is seeking IDA finance for the following
interrelated livestock projects: Intensive Dairy Production, Livestock
Fattening, Beet Pulp Drying and Dairy Breed Improvement. These projects
are part of the livestock development program in Turkey's Second Five-Year
Plan (1968/72), which also includes feed mills, abattoirs and milk plants.
1.02      Intensive Dairy Production was the first project to be ready for
appraisal. With a four-year program of lending by the Agricultural Bank of
the Turkish Republic (ABT), the Project aims at expanding milk and meat
production on selected dairy farms through irrigated forage production,
importation of high yielding dual-purpose dairy cattle, and related invest-
ment in farm buildings. A Credit of US$4.5 million equivalent is proposed.
1.03      The Project was prepared by the Turkish State Planning Organization
(SPO), assisted by FAO missions that visited Turkey in November 1967 and
between March 1968 and March 1969.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
to Turkey in September/October 1969, composed of Messrs P. G. Nelson, R.
Khouri, D. Martinusen and S. Silbiger. The Project, as submitted, called
for importation of 16,000 dairy cattle to 600 farms over three years and
Bank Group financing of US$15.0 million. The appraisal mission considered
about 4,400 dairy cattle to about 250-300 farms would be a more realistic
first phase target.
1.05      Since completion of the appraisal the Turkish Lira was devalued
by about 67%. The projections made in this report have been tested against
the possible impact of the devaluation. Based on the revised estimate the
Project continues to show a satisfactory economic and financial justification.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2
2.01      Turkey, withi an area of about 780,000 km , is roughly the size
of France and Federal Republic of Germany combined; a little larger than Texaii.
Sixty percent of the perimeter is coastline, bordering the Black, Marmara,
Aegean and Mediterranean Seas.  A small part (about 3%) is in Europe; the rest
in Asia (see Map).
Climate
2.02      The climate is varled and the country divides into seven general
climatic regions - three coastal belts, three inland areas and the European
mainland. These fall into four broad ecological zones (see Map): (a)
Marmara and Black Sea: northern coastline rising steeply to the Anatolian
Plateau; (b) Aegea and Mediterranean Sea: western and southern coastline,



-2-
generally rising quite steeply to the Anatolian Plateau, with extensive
coastal plains; (c) Anatolian Plateau: central plateau, about one-third
of the country; and (d) Eastern Highlands: the highest part of the country,
also about one-third. All, except the eastern Black Sea coast, have lhot dry
summers and cool to cold, moist to wet, winters.  Mean annual rainfall varies
from 1,400 mm in the Marmara and Black Sea zone (between 550 and 2,400 Tint,
depending on location) to 350 mm on the Anatolian Plateau. Temperatures
vary from winter/summer averages of -40 and 180C in the Eastern Hliihlanids
to 11°C and 240C in the Aegean and Mediterranean zones. Daily variations
can be great and frost can occur throughout the country, though rarely in
the coastal regions and commonly in the others.
Population and GNP
2.03      Population of approximately 35 million is increasing at about
2.8% per year. Although most of the people live in rural areas, the urban
population is rising rapidly. Gross National Product (GNP) in real terms
grew at about 5.7% per year during 1960/66, 6.6% during 1962/67, and is
expected to grow at 7% per year during the Second Five-Year Plan 1968/72.
In 1968 per capita national income was about US$300, roughly equal to Malay-
sia and Colombia but far lower than Spain (US$700).
Imports and Exports
2.04      Turkey suffers severe shortages of foreign exchange, with
repeated deficits on current account (averaging US$152 million per year
during the First Five-Year Plan 1963/67). Imports usually exceed exports
by more than 40%, and there are large outlays for debt service. Foreign
exchange is allocated by comprehensive regulation.
2.05      Agricultural products account for nearly 90% of Turkey's exports
and in 1968 were worth TL 3,900 million (then US$ 430 million) out of a total
of TL 4,500 million (then US$500 million). Cotton, tobacco, hazelnuts, and
raisins comprised 75% of agricultural, and over 67% of total, exports. Go-
vernment is anxious to earn more foreign exchange and looks to fruits and
vegetables and, in the long run, livestock and meat for a major contribution.
2.06      Agricultural imports are generally very small, of the order of
US$10 million, and are discouraged by import restrictions.  Turkey has
resources suitable for livestock including dairy production, and needs to
increase the supply of fresh milk and meat to the important tourist industry
and to its growing urban population. Government gives priority to livestock
development, which could ultimately lead to export revenue.
Turkey and the European Common Market (EEC)
2.07      On December 1, 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC
under an agreement calling for full membership in 17 to 29 years, by three
stages: preliminary, transitional, final. The preliminary stage, expected
to last 5-10 years, obliges Turkey to use EEC rates of excise duty on
tobacco and raisins and half the EEC duty on hazelnuts and figs, all of
which are important Turkish exports. No special arrangements have been
made for livestock and livestock products. EEC countries have mounting



- 3 -
surpluses of dairy products but are likely to be net importers of meat
(especially beef) for some years. In November 1970, a new agreement was
signed on the conditions of entry into a 22 year period of transition to a
full customs union.
B. The Agricultural Sector
Contribution of Agriculture to the Economy
2.08      Turkey has large numbers of relatively small land holdings -
almost 70% are less than 5 ha and 98% below 20 ha. As in many developing
countries, the proportionate contribution of agriculture to GNP is declining;
it was estimated at 50% in 1950/52, 40% in 1959/61, and now about 30%.
Agriculture employed over 80% of the working population in 1955 and about
70% in 1968. Nevertheless, despite recent industrial progress, the economy
is, and for a long time to come will remain, largely dependent on agricul-
ture.
Main Crops
2.09      Of Turkey's many crops, wheat and barley are grown on about 80%
of the cultivated land. Alfalfa and corn are grown under irrigation and
are becoming increasingly popular as forage crops; some rice is grown
along thie southern and eastern shores. Cotton, from the Aegean/Mediterranean
zone, is the principal industrial crop and largest export, followed by
tobacco. Sugar beet is widely cultivated, especially in the north and west,
under the stimulus of Government-owned sugar factories and guaranteed prices,
and Turkey is now more than self sufficient.
Importance of Water
2.10      Except in the Marmara and Black Sea zones, intensive agriculture is
not possible without irrigation, save for winter cereals and drought-
resistant crops such as tobacco, olives, grapes and stone fruits. Out
of nearly 24 million cultivable ha, some 7 mill-ion are fallow at any one
time. Only about 1.5 million ha are now irrigated, but SPO estimates
another 6 million could be.  IDA credits and a Bank loan 1/ were approved
for two stages of the Seyhan Irrigation Project (US$20 million in 1963 and
US$24 million in 1969); these will irrigate about 100,000 ha, with possibi-
lities for a further 70,000.  Supervision missions report satisfactory
progress but experience suggests particular attention be paid to: coordination
between Government departments; prormpt issue of import licenses; and
adequate remuneration for project staff.
Modernization
2.11      Turkish agriculture is gradually being modernized.  There were
57,700 tractors in 1961, and about 80,000 in 1969. During the same period,
1/   IDA Credits TU-38 and TU-143, and Bank loan TU-587.



- 4 -
the area cultivated mechaniically increased from about 3 million to almost
5 million ha. Use of fertilizers rose from about 220,000 tons in 1961 to
about 2.5 million in 1968 1/.
Livestock
2.12      Livestock statistics are not very reliable, but production is
believed to be growing at about 2% per year. Irrigation farmers are
increasingly interested in combining livestock with their other operations.
Improvement in the number and quality of livestock, through imports, is
difficult because of exchange restrictions; modern management and up-to-date
technical knowledge are rare.
2.13      Total milk production grew at about 2% per year to reach approxi-
mately 4.3 million tons in 1968. Annual milk consumption (in all forms) is
about 100 liters per capita, more than Spain's (65 liters) but little more
than half Italy's consumption (181 liters) 2/.
2.14      Between 1947 and 1967 livestock numbers are estimated to have
grown; cattle from 10 to 14 million (40%); sheep from 25 to 36 million
(44%); and goats froni 17 to 21 million (24%). Cows milked are estimated
to have risen from about 2.5 to 4.5 million (80%); and sheep milked from
about 13 to 17 million (30%) 3/.
2.15      Average production per animal is low: milk production, for example,
is about 600 kg per cow per lactation. Imported and upgraded local cows,
by contrast, frequently exceed 3,000 kg per lactation.
Government Policy
2.16      Government policy has tended to favor crops rather than livestock
in order to provide cheap food. With increased industrialization, however,
demand for meat and dairy products is rising. Between 1962 and 1968 annual
per capita consumption of milk rose from about 97 to 100 liters, and of meat
from about 14 to 16 kg. Retail meat and milk prices rose more sharply
between 1960 and 1968 than other foods (partly, in the case of meat, because
controls kept prices artificially low before 1962).
2.17      Government policy is now directed towards increased milk and meat
production and targets in the Second Five-Year Plan (compared with 1962
and 1967) are:

Per capita consumption of milk is expected to rise from 98 kg in 1967 to
108 kg by 1972; of meat from 16 kg to 18 kg during the same period.
Agricultural Credit
2.18       There are 47 banks in Turkey; 13 are State-owned or controlled,
29 private Turkish and 5 foreign (Annex 1). Ten are specialized banks,
including ABT, found in 1863 and now the largest bank in the country. There
is very little lending for agriculture, except through ABT (Annex 2).
C. The Dairy Industry
2.19       Out of a cattle population of roughly 14.5 million, about 4.5
million are statistically classified as milking cows, though these are very
varied in type and quality and widely distributed. Privately owned dairy
farms are not generally very advanced. Few grow forage crops to feed green,
and fewer still make hay or silage (Annex 3).
2.20       There is potential for greater forage crop production under
irrigation. On good farms, alfalfa under irrigation yields up to 11 tons
of hay per ha per year on the Anatolian Plateau, 14 tons in the Marmara/Black
Sea zone and 21 tons in the Aegean/Mediterranean. Higher yields should be
possible with more irrigation; increased fertilizer; greater control of
diseases, pests and weeds; and better harvesting. Other aspects of dairy
farming can also be improved - housing, hygiene, feeding, management, breed-
ing and calf rearing.
2.21      The General Directorate of Veterinary Medicine is responsible for
animal health and employs about 1,500 veterinarians, and veterinary assist-
ants who are backed by 20 regional diagnostic and dispensing laboratories.
Four other centralized and seven regional laboratories produce vaccines and
carry out research on livestock diseases.
2.22       Turkey is approaching self-sufficiency in the production of
veterinary vaccines and drugs. Turkish veterinarians are familiar with
the disease problems of their country and provide good veterinary service
to accessible farms. Imported cattle are particularly vulnerable to foot
and mouth disease and piroplasmosis (tick fever), to which they might be
exposed in Turkey. They should be vaccinated against foot and mouth and
regularly sprayed to control the vector ticks that spread piroplasmosis.



-6-
Market_np_of Dairy Products
2.23      Milk products are traditional in the Turkish diet, especially
yoguirt and white cheese. A great deal (probably 60%) of milk is not sold
but consumed by the farmer, his family and his workers. Household milk
(including yogurt) is sold in three ways: directly from farmer to consumer;
or through a network of traders (milk peddlers) - the most comnon method;
or through pasteurizing factories and their distributors in Ankara, Adana,
Istanbul and Izmir. In addition, 10 to 15% of milk production is made into
cheese, butter and other products.
2.24      Milk prices are not controlled at producer or consumer level,
and vary according to supply/demand in different areas and seasons (Annex
4, Table 2).  In the four major consuming areas, average 1969 on-farm
milk prices ranged from TL 1.10 (then US$0.12) per liter in Adana to TL 1.40
(then US$0.15) in Ankara 1/.  Some milk factories paid TL 0.10 to TL 0.20
more in winter; traders probably more still. The lowest average annual re-
tail price, after pasteurizing in a milk factory, was TL 2.30 (then US$0.25)
per liter in Izmir; the highest, TL 2.80 (then US$0.31) in Istanbul. Milk
prices have been rising somewhat faster than other food prices (1960/68 - 6%
per year for milk compared with 4.5% for other food). The probable effects
of devaluation on milk prices are discussed in Annex 5.
D. The Agricultural Banik of the Turkish Republic
2.25      ABT (Annex 2 and Chart 1) is a semi-autonomous statutory body,
wholly owned by the Turkish Government, subject to the Banking Law of 1958,
and with a six-member Board of Directors appointed by the Council of Minis-
ters (Cabinet). Its purpose is to finance agricultural, fishery and forestry
production and marketing, and allied activities, and it provides almost all
the institutional credit available to farmers. ABT has over 750 branches
and holds about 25% (about US$582 million) of all deposits in the banking
system.  Assets on December 31, 1969 totaled TL 16,760 million (US$1,120
million).  Though profit is not its primary objective, ABT is administered
as a profit making institution, and all profits are reinvested.
2.26      Eighty percent of ABT lending is short-term, much of it highly
standardized with fixed amounts per ha according to crop or purpose.  ABT
has been attempting to increase its medium and long term lending.  In 1964
it began a supervised medium and long term credit scheme, based on farm
forecasts and technical guidance, and in 1968 introduced a Development

for somewhat larger projects in irrigation, livestock, export promotion,
food processing, agricultural chemicals, transportation and storage.
2.27      Effective ABT interest rates for most agricultural loans are
fixed at 9% per year regardless of term. Special lower rates are laid
down for certain types of lending, e.g., export promotion. Medium term
commercial (non-agricultural) loans are made at 12.5%; short term loans at
10.5%. Since most of ABT's lending is to numerous small farmers (2.2 million
borrowers with loans averaging TL 2,000 or about US$133 in 1968) overall
costs of administration are high. With more than 16,000 employees, of whom
955 are university graduates, ABT has a high reputation and a staff generally
well trained in banking practices. Lending operations and procedures are
satisfactory and, although its autonomy is somewhat impaired by Government
direction, it would be a suitable channel for Project lending.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
Definition and Purpose
3.01      The Project is a first phase in the development of intensive
dairy production in Turkey's four main milk consuming areas -- Adana, Ankara,
Istanbul and Izmir (see Map). It includes a four-year program of lending by
ABT for on-farm investment in irrigated commercial dairy farms, assisted
by Government technical advisory staff in the recently formed Intensive
Dairy Production Division (IDPD) of the General Directorate for Livestock
Development Projects (LDP) of the Ministry of Agriculture (para 3.34 and
Chart 2). It also includes technical studies for further development of
the livestock industry. Dairy herds would not graze on open pastures, but
would be fed under cover, on forage (green or conserved) from irrigated
land and on purchased concentrates. Project farmers, most of whom would
also have other farming operations, would invest in preparation and planting
of land for irrigated forage; farm machinery; imported Friesian and Brown
Swiss dairy cattle; and modern cow sheds appropriate to the particular
locality (Annex 3).
3.02      The purposes of the Project are to:  increase the supply of milk
and meat; introduce modern production methods; raise the number of locally
bred improved dairy cattle by herd retention and ultimate sale of surplus
breeding stock; and, through technical training and studies, to prepare for
further development of the livestock industry.
1/   The program was discontinued in October 1969, when the related law was
declared unconstitutional. However, the Encouragement and Development
Loans Division still exists.

Phas iny
3.03       This is tihe first project of its kind in Turkey.  Based on farm
visits and a limited Government survey, participation by 250 - 300 farmers
currently with herds varying in size from 10 to 20 or more cows per farm
would be a reasonable first phase objective. Project estimates are based on:
(a) limited Turkish experience in modern dairy farming; (b) farm models
of two standard types, modified according to conditions in each of the
four project areas; (c) purchase of in-calf heifers in two lots: the first,
a major replacement, the second a minor herd build-up; (d) number of farms
expected to be developed, beginning in each of the first 2 years, with
investment spread over 3 years; and (e) estimated participation by dairy
farmers in each of the 4 project areas.
3.04       About 70% of Project farms are expected to be similar in size to
the two models (paras 3.03(b) and 3.12). The number of farms coming into
the Project and the number of imported in-calf heifers in each year of
Project disbursement would be approximately:
-----YEAR--------
Number of Farms                  1971       1972      1973      Total
Adana                       20- 25   35- 40    -          55- 65
Ankara                      25- 30   40- 45    -          65- 75
Istanbul                    30- 35   45- 55    -          75- 80

/1   Average of 270 assumed for estimate purposes.
This distribution takes account of farmer interest and capability in the
four areas and, especially important in the Adana area, the potential mar-
ket for milk. To ensure that development and the demonstration effect are
concentrated on the most important dairy markets, and evenly spread to serve
them all, assurances were obtained from ABT, during negotiations, that
Project lending would be confined to the above areas and the number of farms
in the range indicated.
B. Project Areas
3.05       Adana is in the Aegean and Mediterranean zone.  Its population
is about 350,000; but, within a radius of 100 km, there are important
centers at Mersin (90,000), Iskenderun (70,000) and Tarsus (60,000).  Irri-
gated land, including that served by the Seyhan project (para 2.10) totals
about 350,000 ha. There is a state-owned milk factory at Adana (Annex 4,
para 8), and a feed factory at Mersin.



- 9 -
3.06      Ankara is on the Anatolian Plateau, with a population approaching
a million, and has the most extreme climate of the four Project areas. Milk
production on the Plateau is much lower in the severe winter than in summer.
Irrigated land here is less developed than in Adana, and totals about 98,000
ha. There is a major State-owned milk factory at Ankara and another being
built at Konya, to be mainly cooperatively owned; also a small private plant
in Ankara. At present, producers supplying through both Konya (260 km by
road, population 160,000) and Eskisehir (230 km by rail, population 170,000)
supplement Ankara's milk supply; Konya in particular, with well-developed
alfalfa production, has good potential but is a long way from the Ankara
market. There are two feed factories at Ankara and one at Konya.
3.07      Istanbul is in the Marmara/Black Sea zone.  Population of this,
the largest city in Turkey, is around 2 million. Irrigated land totals
about 200,000 ha and Government plans to expand this shortly by 40,000 ha.
Istanbul has a major State-owned milk factory and two smaller private plants.
There is also a large State-owned feed factory and several smaller private
ones.
3.08      Izmir is also in the Aegean and Mediterranean zone.  Its popula-
tion is about 400,000. Total irrigated land in the Aegean zone is about
400,000 ha, but much of it is distant from Izmir. Izmir has a State-owned
milk factory and a cooperative feed factory.
C. Detailed Features
3.09      To qualify for the granting of a dairy loan, each applicant would:
(a) have proven competence in dairy farming; (b) own a milking herd of at
least ten cows, provided, however, that smaller herds may also be acceptable
if composed of high-quality animals; (c) have tenure of an appropriate area
of irrigated land, suitable to be progressively brought under forage crops
for on-farm consumption; and (d) meet all other creditworthiness criteria
as shall be reasonably established from time to time by ABT. Assurances
were obtained from ABT during negotiations that dairy loans would be granted
only to those farmers meeting the above mentioned criteria.
3.10      Dairy farm development plans for which dairy loans are to be sub-
mitted to ABT would be prepared by a Project technician or, should one be not
available, by the appropriate regional manager of IDPD, reviewed by such
regional manager of IDPD, recommended for approval by a Technical Specialist
and approved by the Manager of IDPI) (Chart 2). Applications for dairy farm
development subloans would then be transmitted through tlhe Encouragement and
Development Loans Division of ABT to the Board of ART for final approval.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government and ABT that
loan applications would be processed by the minimum criteria outlined above.
3.11      Considering the present state of dairy farming in Turhey (Annex
3), it is important not to provide farmers with more cattle than they can
reasonably manage. Very few now have stock approaching the quality of the
proposed imports.  Although some would be permitted to increase their herds



- 10 -
immediately with imported heifers, most would purchase heifers in two lots
(para 3.03 c).
3.12      Two models have been constructed to illustrate the Project.  One
has a herd increasing from 15 to 30 milking cows over seven years with re-
placement of ten cows in the first year and five added in the second; the
other increases from 15 to 40 over six years with replacement of 12 cows in
the first year and eight added in the second. The larger model generally
represents farms operated by the more experienced and prosperous farmers.
Basic Data from which the models were constructed are in Annex 6. Details
of Investment, Herd Projections, Revenue and Financial Projections for the
two models are in Annexes 7 through 14.
3.13      Imported heifers would be in-calf to progeny tested bulls of the
same breed 1!. Most would be Friesians - daughters of cows yielding at
least 4,000 kg per lactation. Brown Swiss would be imported into the Ankara
area where they adapt readily to the environment; they would be daughters
of cows yielding at least 3,700 kg per lactation. Both breeds are heavier
than some other milk breeds (eg. Jerseys) and therefore useful meat producers
as well. All cattle would be certified free of tuberculosis, brucellosis,
leptosprosis, trichomoniasis and vibriosis and would be vaccinated against
foot-and-mouth disease (Types A and C) prior to export.
3.14      An important feature of the Project is on-farm production of
roughage, typically alfalfa grown under irrigation. Corn, for silage, would
also be raised, especially in Adana where double cropping winter wheat/summer
corn is possible. In addition to roughage, purchased concentrates, produced
in Turkey, would be fed. Seed for Peruvian-type alfalfa (Aegean and Medi-
terranean zone) and for hybrid corn must be imported, since its production
in Turkey is unreliable. All seed imports are made through the Agricultural
Supply Organization of the Ministry of Agriculture. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that importation of seed recommended
by the Technical Specialists and approved by the Manager of IDPD would be
freely permitted and promptly arranged.
3.15      Project farmers already have some machinery but probably one-
third to one-half (depending on farm size) would need an additional tractor.
All would need a tractor-drawn mower, side delivery rake and sundry machinery
for irrigation, weed and pest control and fertilizer application. About
one-third would buy a pick-up baler (or forage harvester).
3.16      Cow sheds in Adana, Istanbul and Izmir would be of simple, but
sturdy, open construction with portable protection (e.g. straw bales) against
cold winds during winter. In Ankara they would be more fully closed but
well ventilated.
1/   Bulls evaluated by the superior milking performance of their daughters.



- 11 -
3.17      Artificial insemination in Turkey is not far advanced and nearly
all Project farmers would keep a bull. Purchase of improved bulls is in-
cluded in the Project for half the farm units, tlhough it is uncertain how
many would be needed. Some Project farmers would provide bull service to
their neighbors.
3.18      Project-related technical services, described in para 3.36, would
buy vehicles and rent office space. The cost of these services over three
years, including tlhe cost of the Teclhnical Specialists for three years has
been included in the capital cost of the project. Details are in Annex 15.
3.19      Technical studies for livestock development approved by IDA would
be undertaken bv the General Directorate for Livestock Development Projects.
These studies would include: (a) survevs; (b) applied research and demonstra-
tion particularly in forage crop production and nreservation; and (c)
training courses and study tours in Turkey and abroad both for technicians
and farmers.
D. Cost Estimates
3.20      Total Project cost is estimated at TL 112.5 million (US$7.5 million)
including contingencies, of which about US$4.5 million would be the eligible
foreign exchange component. Details of Project on-farm development and
technical services cost are in Annex 16. Summarized cost estimates are:

3.21      The estimated foreign exchange component of US$4.5 million equi-
valent arises lgrgely from imports of cattle, tractors and farm machinery,
the basic investment elements in the Project.
E. Financing
3.22      Proposed financing is based on IDA lending for foreign exchange,
with Government providing part of the funds and farmers making a contribution
according to their means. Governrment contribution would be through provision
of about US$1.0 million as capital to ABT and about US$0.4 million for
technical services.
3.23      Twenty percent would be a reasonable farmer contribution to on-
farm investment cost during the first three years, with 80% from ABT,
especially since Project farmers would sacrifice about TL 18 million (US$1.2
million) of income by retaining heifers for herd build up during the first
6-7 years. They would also provide a small amount for working capital.
Assurances as to contributions were obtained from ABT during negotiations.
3.24      Project farmers would themselves finance continued fodder crop
establishnient beyond the initial three-year development period. This would
increase their contribution to on-farm investment from 20% to 25%. IDA
would finance imported livestock (US$2.73 million), machinery (US$0.87
million), seeds (US$0.25 million), the foreign exchange cost of Project
related technical services (US$0.35 million), and technical studies (US$0.30
million); a total of US$4.50 million. This would approximate 60% of total
Project cost, with 22% from farmers and 18% from Government. On this basis,
estimated Project financing would be:

3.25      The IDA Credit of US$4.5 million would be mi(de to Govertnmtnit w1lidh
would on-lend the Turkish Lira equivalent of US$3.9 million to ABIT lor 15
years at 6.5% interest per annum with five year's grace. Since relending is
in local currency. Government would bear the foreign exchange risk. ABT would
lend to farmers at 9% for 12 years, including four years' grace with repay-
ment installments graduated to net income generated by the investment. This
rate is similar to ABT's current effective rate on agricultural loans but
lower than the 12.52 charged by commercial banks for medium-term non-
agricultural loans (para 2.27). ABT would set aside from interest payments
received from farmers amounts at the rate of 0.5% per annum in a Special
Operational Fund to be used for partial payment of operating expenses
incurred by LDP. Expenditures from this fund would be authorized by the
Director of LDP only. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
ABT would on-lend to farmers on the ibove mentioned terms; would make no
changes in the effective lending rate without prior consultation with IDA;
and would not lend to dairy farmers outside the Project on more favorable
terms.
3.26      With loans commencing in two successive years, the latest repay-
ment to ABT would be 13 years from the start of the Project. The Project
cash flow in Annex 17 shows that, allowing for contingent delays, ABT
repayment to Government over ten years after five years' grace, a total of
15 years, would be appropriate, and would in that time return to Government
all IDA funds used for on-farm development. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from Government that it would on-lend IDA funds to ABT on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Procurement
3.27      Dairy cattle would be purchased following the receipt of quotations
from at least three different countries, but farmers would remain free to
choose whichever source suited them best; such importation would be free of
any import taxes. All purchases would be under the close control, and subject
to the concurrence, of the Manager of IDPD, the Technical Specialists (for
their respective areas), and the Veterinary Department. All purchase con-
tracts between farmers and suppliers would require the supplier to ensure
satisfactory arrangements for reception and delivery, and they or their
designated importer or representative would be responsible for cattle until
received by Project farmers. The Veterinary Department has strict health
and production standards for imported dairy cattle and would cooperate fully,
making veterinary staff available to assist in purchase and clearance, as
required by the Manager of IDPD.  In view of its importance, arrangements for
dairy cattle purchase were specifically confirmed during negotiations and
assurances were obtained that Government would expedite their procurement,
veterinary clearance, and deployment.
3.28      LDP would organize the procurement of tractors (35-45 hp) by
international competitive bidding on the basis of individual orders
collected by the regional managers of IDPD from farmers carrying out dairy
farm development plans and would award the contract to the lowest evaluated
bidder. The invitations to bid would specify that suippliers would guarantee



- 14 -
adequate servicing facilities and spare parts supply in each of the four
Project areas. Procurement of tractors would be subject to not more than
two contracts. Agricultural tractors (about 100) would be procured under
the Bank's guidelines for international competitive bidding and up to 15%
domestic preference would be allowed to local bidders. Ass7urances were
obtained from Government during negotiations that LDP would obtain IDA
approval of bidding procedures and bidding documents before bids are invited
and thiat LDP would obtain IDA approval of the lowest evaluated bid before
awarding the contracts.
3.29      LDP would also organize the procurement of farm machinery (mowers,
side delivery rakes, pick-up balers and forage harvestors) by bulk purchase
on the basis of individual orders collected by the regional managers from
farmers carrying out dairy development plans and would award the contract
to the lowest evaluated bidder.  The invitations to bid would state that
suppliers would guarantee adequate servicing facilities and spare parts
supply in each of the four Project areas. These would be circularized to
the embassies of appropriate member countries of IDA and Switzerland and
advertised in at least one newspaper with general circulation in Turkey.
Assurances were obtained from Government during negotiations that LDP
would obtain IDA approval of bidding procedures and bidding documents
before bids are invited and that LDP would obtain IDA approval of the
lowest evaluated bid before awarding a contract.
3.30      The Agricultural Supply Organization would procure seed in its
usual procedures for farmers carrying out farm development plans in amounts,
of quality, and at prices, recommended by the Technical Specialists and
approved by the Manager of IDPD.
3.31      LDP would procure vehicles for the technical service staff under
its usual procedures.
Disbursement
3.32      The IDA Credit would be disbursed against:  (a) invoices from
suppliers showing the cif cost of livestock, tractors, and farm machinery,
submitted and certified by ABT as for the account of Project sub-borrowers;
(b) invoices from the Agricultural Supply Organization for the cif cost of
seed similarly submitted and certified; and (c) statements by the Manager
of IDPD of amounts disbursed from time to time for the cif cost of vehicles
to the foreign exchange cost of technical services and technical studies.
IDA would disburse the equivalent of 40% of the ex-factory price of tractors
should a Turkish manufacturer win the bid to supply tractors.
3.33      Disbursement of the IDA credit would be approximately:

F. Organization and Management
3.34      Government recently established a General Directorate for Live-
stock Development Projects (LDP) within the Ministry of Agriculture and
charged it with the execution of Bank Group financed livestock projects
(Chart 2). LDP is headed by a General Director who is directly responsible
to the Minister of Agriculture. An Executive Committee composed of the
directors of other directorates of the Ministry and the President of the
Agricultural Bank of Turkey meets quarterly to decide on policy and to re-
solve inter-departmental problems. Another Interministerial Committee
coordinates the activities of the Ministry of Agriculture with other Ministries.
3.35      Managers of Divisions within LDP would be appointed for Projects
as they emerge. The Manager for the IDPD is a Turkish national with relevant
experience. Since technicians trained in modern methods of dairy husbandry
and forage crop production are not available in Turkey it was agreed during
negotiations that two well qualified Technical Specialists would be recruited
from abroad to assist him. One of the specialists would cover Ankara and
Adana and the other Istanbul and Izmir. Annex 18 contains draft Terms of
Reference for the Manager of IDPD and Technical Specialists. It is a con-
dition of effectiveness that the two Technical Specialists, be acceptable
to IDA and appointed on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
3.36      The Technical Specialists would be assisted by four regional
managers, one for each Project area, who would each have a staff of three
or four technicians with knowledge of dairying, forage production and agri-
cultural economics. An important function of the Technical Specialists
would be to train staff, not only for the Project now presented, but also
for later phases. Included in technical services is the cost of three
months' tralning of technical staff in a country with similar ecology but
more advanced dairy farming techniques, if the Technical Specialists so
recommend.
3.37      IDPD has four main functions:  to assist farmers in the pre-
paration of dairy farm development plans; to continuously advise dairy farmers
on production and marketing techniques and the keeping of records; to
supervise implementation of dairy farm development plans for ABT; and to
keep records of Project performance. A large part of IDPD work is



- 16 -
extension service, which Government provides free to all farmers. For
this reason, no fee would be charged for Project technical services.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that production
records would be kept on all Project farms and that the Manager of IDPD
would keep centralized performance records on all imported cattle and their
offspring retained on Project farms.
3.38      Requests for dairy loans under the Project would be submitted to a
regional manager of IDPD who would refer them to the local branch of ABT for
a creditworthiness assessment of the applicants. All dairy loan requests
would be returned to the regional manager of IDPD who would ensure that farm
development plans are drawn up for creditworthy applicants meeting the
criteria outlined in para 3.09. Farm development plans, now in the form
of formal dairy loan applications, would be processed by IDPD in the manner
outlined in para 3.10. These applications would then be transmitted through
the Encouragement and Development Loans Division of ABT to the Board of ABT
for final approval. Assurances were obtained from ABT during negotiations
that no dairy loan would be granted without the prior approval of the
relevant Technical Specialist and the Manager of IDPD, and that no dairy
loan exceeding US$100,000 equivalent would be granted without prior approval
of IDA.
3.39      Once a dairy loan is approved, the local ABT branch would be
authorized to disburse the proceeds. For imported goods, ABT would seek IDA
payment of cif costs, itself pay the local costs, and charge the totals to
individual borrowers' accounts. For local goods, ABT would pay suppliers
directly wherever possible.
Accounts and Audit
3.40      ABT would keep separate accounts for dairy loans and submit
quarterly summaries to IDA. A copy of the complete annual accounts for
Project lending would be sent to IDA within three months of the end of ABT's
financial year and a copy of the annual accounts of ABT would be sent when
issued. All accounts would be audited in a manner satisfactory to IDA, and
documents sent to IDA would be in English. (For details of ABT auditing
arrangements, See Annex 2, para 8.) Assurances to this effect were obtained
from ABT during negotiations. The Manager of IDPD would keep accounts of
Project expenditures on Project-related technical services. A copy in Eng-
lish, also audited in a manner satisfactory to IDA, would be sent to IDA
within three months of the end of the Government fiscal year. Assurances to
this effect were obtained from Government during negotiations.
IV. MARKETS, PRICES AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Markets and Prices
4.01      The Project would serve the four largest consumption centers whose
combined population is about 13% of national and nearly 50% of urban total.



- 17 -
4.02      Increased milk and meat production from Project farms would be a
relatively small proportion of total Turkish production. Prices of milk and
meat could be expected to follow closely the experience of a wide range of
products subject to agricultural price support. The average increase of these
products in 1970 was about 20%, and further increases can be expected in the
next 2-3 years. It may be assumed that milk prices would increase by about
30%, and beef prices by about 40% in the next three years as shown in
Annex 5 1/. Operating expenses are also expected to increase by about 30%
so that the rates of return would be slightly more favorable than computed
at the time of appraisal.
4.03      Milk from the Project would generally be sold to pasteurizing
plants and the Milk Organization has offered to pay a premium to Project
farmers providing they would insure regular supplies of good quality,
especially during the winter. This would increase returns to Project farmers.
They would, however, be free to sell through any channel they chose.
4.04      Meat would be sold to the Meat and Fish Organization or to local
butchers. Although important to the financial viability of Project farms,
quantities are relatively insignificant (an additional 1,500 m tons of beef
per year, at full production, compared with national production of about
250,000 m tons).
4.05      Turkey exports cattle and beef to Middle Eastern neighbors (offi-
cially an equivalent of US$2 million for cattle and US$100,000 for beef in
1968, notably to Iran; but unofficial cattle exports are much greater).
(Covernment hopes to develop meat exports to EEC countries and has sought
technical guidance from France, Germany and Italy. The growing tourist
trade is a direct foreign exchange earner and needs beef and milk of the
quality the Project would supply. The important tourist centers of Antalya,
Istanbul, Izmir and Tarsus are in the Project areas. While the Project, by
itself, would not contribute significantly to export earnings, subsequent
phases would have potential for earning foreign exchange. No difficulty
is expected in marketing Project output.
Producer Benefits
4.06      Project farmers :o>,d increase their income at full development,
after nine years, as the following table illustrates:
1/   As a first result of the August 1(, 1i70, devaluation it is expected
that prices in Turkey would increasc ,y Spring 1971 by about 20%.

Revenue Generation
4.07      Farmers would pav interest and repay their loans out of revenue
over the first twelve years. In addition, they would pay a small amount of
land tax and be liable to income tax (Law 193), depending on their total
farm and other income. Income tax concessions for agriculture help to pro-
vide incentive which is especially valuable during this first phase Project.
Assessments begin at 10% on the first US$165 of taxable income, and go
up to 60% on US$66,700 or above. The following is an illustration for
a typical Project farm (Adana 30-cow model):

Dairv farmers in Turkey have been reinvesting extensively in their farms
:2aU it is likely that Project farmers would continue to do so.  They would



- 19 -
also be reinvesting in their herds (mainly by retention of breeding stock)
as the herd values in the above table illustrate (see also para 3.23).
4.09      Actual tax paid is influenced by many variables and revenue re-
ceived by Government from the Project would depend on future income tax
policies and rates. Based on the above illustration, however, incremental
tax revenue from the Project, if collected, could be of the order of
US$250,000 per year.
V. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      In addition to its direct physical benefits, the Project is impor-
tant for the impetus it would give to permanent improvement and upgrading of
Turkey's dairy industry. At full development, by the tenth year, the Proj-
ect would result in an estimated annual additional 27,000 m tons of milk and
1,500 m tons of beef. This production would be worth about US$3.5 million
per year and some would earn foreign exchange, mainly through supplying the
tourist trade. Project farms would also produce about 2,100 breeding ani-
mals worth an approximate US$1 million per year, making total Project pro-
duction worth about US$4.5 million per year at full development in comparison
with total investment of about US$7.2 million equivalent (excluding techni-
cal studies).
5.02      The Project would provide useful indirect benefits through the
supply of surplus improved dairy stock to farmers outside the Project and
through its demonstration effect.
5.03      The rate of return to the economy of Turkey, discounted over the
estimated 25-year life of Project farms, would be about 20% (Annex 19).
VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained amongst others on
the following new points from Government that:
(a) importation of seed recommended by the Technical Specialists
would be freely permitted and promptly arranged (para 3.14)
and procurement, veterinary clearance and deployment of
imported dairy cattle would be done promptly (para 3.27); and
(b) production records would be kept on all Project farms and
the Manager of IDPD would keep centralized records of
performance of all imported cattle and their offspring
retained on Project farms (para 3.37).
6.02      During negotiations, assurances, amongst others, were obtained from
ABT that:



- 20 -
(a) Project lending would be confined to the Project areas of
Adana, Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir and to the number of farms
within the range specified (para 3.04);
(b) sub-loans would be made on the basis of dairy farm development
plans prepared by a project technician or, should one not be
available, by the appropriate regional manager of IDPD, recom-
mended for approval by a Technical Specialist and approved by
the manager of IDPD (para 3.10); and ABT would accept 20% as
the farmer contribution to planned investment cost (para 3.23);
and
(c) loans to Project farmers would be made at 9% for 12 years,
including four years' grace, repayment installments being
graduated to net income estimated to be generated; would make
no change in the effective lending rate without prior con-
sultation with IDA and would not lend to dairy farmers outside
the Project on more favorable terms (para 3.25).
6.03      In addition to the customary conditions, the following has been
agreed upon as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit:
(a) that the two Technical Specialists would be acceptable to
IDA and appointed on terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA (para 3.35).
6.04      The Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$4.5 million to
the Republic of Turkey.

TURKEY
INTENSIVE DAIRY PRCDUCTION
Banking and Credit
A. Banking
The MonetaryX and Credit System
1.        The monetary and credit system of Turkey has a number of peculiarities
associated with recent Turkish economic history. These are discussed at
length in the Bank's Economic Report of February 13, 1969,  (EMA-4a paras
116-134). Briefly, although the system has broadly met the liquidity
requirements of the Turkish economr during a period of rapid growth, it
suffers from a number of inflexibilities which prevent it from efficiently
mobilizing savings and channelling them to the most productive uses. Long
term credit is available only in limited amounts; for agriculture mainly
from the Agricultural Bank of the Turkich Republic (JT)V/, and for other
purposes mainly from the development banks (see para 8). Interest rates
are not interrelated or linked to central banks rediscounting and there is
a very limited public market for securities, whether bonds or equities.
Open market operations cannot therefore be used to control liquidity. Insteai,
credit is regulated by restriction, and credit ceilings have been imposed
on borrowing by various institutions.
The Central Bank of the Turkish Rerublic
2.       The Central Bank, established in 1930 by special law, is the sole
bank of currency issue; holds gold and foreign currency reserves; is banker
for Government and other banks; and rediscounts bank and commercial
paper within restrictions imposed by law. It is now also, by the Central
Bank Law 1211 of January 1970, responsible for credit regulation. Though
formally a joint stock company it is, in effect, under Government control.
The Treasury holds 52% of the voting stock; domestic banks, other (foreign)
banks, Turkish companies and individuals hold the rest.
3.        Cne of the functions of the Central Bank is, jointly with the Goveru-
ment, to preserve the internal and external stability of the currency. In
matters of currency issue and credit volume, the private banks, which had
a strong influence through the previous Regulating Committee, may be asked
to comment prior to implementation of some decisions. The Central Bank
determines the bank's minimum cash ratio (now 10%) and legal reserves against
saving deposits (now 20%) and sets maximum interest rates on loans and on
depoeits. Medium-term rediscount is permitted for bills up to 5 years'
maturity under conditicns determined by the Central Bank Board.
1/ Small agricultural lending banks are the Sugar Bank, Cotton Bank, Tobacco
Growers Bank, Vine Growers Bank, Tea Bank. See Table 1.






ANNEX 1
Page 2
Banks in TurLky
4.        There are 47 banks in Turkey, of which 12 are State-owned or
controlled, 30 private Turkislh and 5 foreign commercial banks established
abroad but with branches in Turkey. Eleven are banks established under
special laws, including ABT founded in 1863, and now the largest bank in
the country with about 750 branches and over 25% of all deposits in the
banking system.
5.        At the end of 1969 these banks had about 2,500 branches and their
total assets were about  TL70,000 million (US$4,660 million). This compares
with 1,825 branches and total assets of TL26,000 million (US$,1,733 million)
in 1963. A list of the principal banks and their assets is in Table 1
attached. The consolidated balance sheets of all Turkish banks are in Tables
2 and 3.
6.        The proliferation of banks and branches is motivated by wide fixed
margins between bank borrowing and lending rates, so that banks vigorously
seek funds to borrow at the low deposit rates by opening branches or agencies
wherever funds may be collected. They also compete by offering prizes and
lottery chances to depositors. IS bank deposit rates were freed, price
competition would encourage banking efficiency, reduce the value of marginal
branches as collection points and lead to mergers among the smaller and less
efficient units. To promote medium and long-term credit, lending terms reed
to be reorganized and made more flexible.
Specialized Banks
7.        Ten public banks and one public investment bank are established by
special laws. Brief details (with years of incorporation) are:
(a) State Investment Bank (196%4): wholly Government oamed; provides
credit for State economic enterprises. No deposits and no
branches.
(b) Agricultural Bank of the Turkish Republic (1863): see Annex 2:
provides almost all the credit available for agriculture; 80% of
lending is short-term.
(c) The Real Estate Credit Bank of Turkey (1927): for house
purchase and construction and allied industries.
(d) Peoples Bank (1938): for artisans associations, small businesses
and trading cooperatives.
(e) Provincial Bank (1933):  provincial reconstruction by price and
municipal bodies and village authorities.






ANEX 1

(f) Public Utility and Mining k (93): for generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity; mining rights;
purchase and sale of nineral products; allied manufacture.
(g) Sumerbank (1933): for textile and other merchandizing;
investment holding and retail/wholesale trading company,
especially in textiles and ceramics.
(h) Maritime Bank (1952):  for sea transport, harbor services,
coastal installation4 shipyards, docks; ship construction,
repair and purchase; allied maritime enterprises.
(i) Tourism Bank (1960): for the tourist industry; also owns,
operates and deals in tourist facilities.
(j) Foundation Bank (195)): for mortgages on real estate.
(k) Teachers Bank (1959): loans and mortgages for teaching staff.
8.        In addition, the follaving development banks provide medium/long-tern
credit:
(a) Tndustrial Development Bank of Turkey (1950):  privately owned,
based on Istanbul, supported by Government and by the Wlorld Bank
group, provides credit on medium/long-term and subscribes equity
capital to industrial companies; also underwrites capital issues.
No deposits and no branches.
(b) Industrial Investment and Credit Bank (1963): privately owned
by five banks for industrial investment and credit, mainly in the
Istanbul area. Not now very active, through lack of new funds.
(c) Mining Bank of Turkey (1968):  privately owned for finance of
mining enterprises (virtually non-functioning because of inadequate
capital).
Interest Rates
9.        Interest rates previously fixed by the Bank Credit Regulation
Committee are now fixed by the Central Bank; since 1961, they have been at the
following general maxima:
Maximum.           Maximum since

1/ Agricultural Bank of theTurUIsh Republic.
2/ Various other maxima have been laid down for specifiC  lending, e.g. 7%
for Topraksu irrigation credit., and rates varying between 3% for e,port
promotion and 8% for agricultvral-manufacturing for ABT Derelopment Loans
Division. Since September 1970 a system of Government  interest subsidy
came into effect which in certain cases assures 13% annual interest to the
lending bank on agricult-ural loans.
The maximum agricultural interest legally payable is 1l-l/2%. but in the case
of commercial loanz, banks regularly increase their effective income by charging
coiwdssion (2-3%) and service fees  and collecting these repeatedly by fre-
quently renewing short-term credit, instead of issuing regular medium or long-
term credit.. Public sector enterprises have access to Government funds at
rates varying between 6% and 8%; and for some special purposes, even lower
rates are cha ged for Government money. With short-term rates lower than
medium-term:!, with special low rates on Government funds, and cheap credit
available to State enterprises and for seasonal commodity support purchases,
there are distortions in resource allocation. There is an extreme shortage
of medium and long-term finance for industry; and for agriculture it is
available only to a limited extent through ABT.
Rediscounts
10.       The Central Bank may rediscount commercial paper up to 120 days
maturity at rates not exceeding 10%, and in amounts depending on the financial
standing of the signatory. This requires credit limits to be established
for numerous banks and business firms and for different categories of paper.
There are complex arrangements for other rediscounting. For agricultural
credit cooperatives 7.5% and for sales cooperatives 9% is charged; and loans
discounted for agriculture mry be of up to 9 months, and for export of up
to 4 months, maturity.
1/ Hier short-ternm rates for loans to numerous small borrowers would be
justified, to an extent, because of high administration costs.






APlXEX 1
Page 5
11.       Special arrangements are made for rediscounting by ABT and by
agricultural credit and sales cooperatives. ABT estimates its rediscount
requirements in consultation with an Agricliltural Credit Regulation Board
(see Annex 2 para 4) and the State Planning Organization.  In poor crop
years, when the demand for agricultural credit is lower than expected,
ABT has rediscounted less than its agreed linmLt. Iimits for credit and
sales cooperatives are similarly arrived at, thouglL the individual amount
on sales cooperative bills varies with the crop.
12.       In general, short-term credit i fairly readily available to
industrial borrawers, but short-term agricultural credit has often been
rationed among borrowers. Hedium and long-term credit is very scarce
for all private borrowers. Inevitably, a large uncrganized non-institutional
credit market exists, of uncertain size, where rates are reputed to exceed
20C (2% to 3% per month for crop advances). The Second Five-Year Plan and
the 1970 Program Decree have proposals for basic reforms in the credit and
banling system. Recommendations of a technical wcr1ing party set up under
the State Planning Organization in 1968 are still under discussion. Although
there are intentions to liberalize the credit system and bring it closer to
market needs, changes are unlikely to be rapid.

Agricultural Ban      he Turkish Reublic 1/
Background and Purpose
1.        The Agricultural Bank of the Turkish Republic (ABT) was founded in
1863 and re-established, in its present form, under a special law of 1937 with
subsequent modifications. It is a semi-autonomous statutory body, wholly owned
by the Turkish Government. Subject to the Banking Law of 1958, its purpose is
to finance agricultural, fishery and forestry production and marketing, and
allied purposes. It may set up, or participate in, institutions with similar
aims and may transact all kinds of banking business. ABT is now by far the
largest bank in T-rkey, with aboyt 750 branches, and holding about 25% of all
deposits in the banking system,2 TL7,906 million (US$527 million) at
December 31, 1968, and TJ,8,736 million (Ust582 million) at December 31, 1969.
It provides almost all iastitutional credit available to farmers.3/  An
important part of its activities is to administer, supervise and provide
credit for close to 2,000 agricultural credit and sales cooperatives. Most
of its lending is short-term. It has, in recent years, attempted to extend
its medium/long-term lending (though the proportion of short-term lending
is still about 80%) and, in 1964 began a supervised medium and),ong-term
credit scheme, based on farm forecasts and technical guidance.W  In 1268,
a Development Loan program was introduced for somewhat larger projects in
livestock breeding and fattening, export promotion, food processing, agri-
cultural chemicals, transportation and storage. This program was discontinued
when the related Development Law was declared unconstitutional on October
2,5 1969.
Capital and Conrtrol
2.        ABT is adrdnistered as a profit-making Institution, though profit
is not its primary motive. Reporting to the Ministry of Commerce, its autonony
1/ In this Annex all Turkish Lira amounts have been converted into US dollars
at the recently devalued rate (August 9, 1970) of TL 15 to US$1. Prior
to devaluation the rate was TL 9 to US$1.
2/ Official, comercial, bank and saving deposits. For further information on
Banking and Credit in Turkey, see Annex 1.
3/ Other small agricultural lending instituticns are the: Sugar Bank, Cotton
Bank, Tobacco Growers Bank, Vine Growers Bank, Tea Bank; see Annex 1,
Table 1.
4/ This t-ype of credit includes: promotion, planning, formulation of
individual projects, a technical consultancy bureau and supervision.

is somewhat impaired by Government direction and by legal limits on borrowing
and1m&-ing rates, though these are also applied to other banks. Authorized
capital is TLl,500 million (US$100 million) increased from TL750 million in
1965 and TL 1,028 million (US.h,69 million) paid in capital fully owned by the
Govermment as of December 31, 1969. A 1955 law provided that 6% of land
Tax and 1% of Turkey's fiscal receipts be subscribed annual3l to 1BT's capita:i.,
and that profits after reserves, be capitalized.  Governmont has nct fully
implemented this provision since 1959 and, of TL 1,266 milon due, since
that year, has budgeted only TL 2Y8 million and paid in TL 146 million (12%
of the amount due).
Orga zation and Management
3.        A mixed Congressional Commission (15 Senators and 35 Representatives)
regularly examines the accounts and operations of state enterprises, including
ABT. It is appro=xlmately equivalent to a committee of stockholders. A
Commission sub-committee regularly visits ABT, reviewing records and
discussing the accounts.
4.        ABT higher policy is decided by a 12-menber Agricultural Credit
Regulation Board comprising the Minister of Commerce (Chairman), the MinUsters
of Agriculture and Finance, the Director-General of the Certral Bank:, ABT
Board Chairman, two other members of ABT Board, the four ABT Assistant
Directors-General, and the Under-Secretary of the State Plannig Office. The
Committee normally meets only once a year to lay down the principles of an
annual program, to direct the flow of agricultural credit and to establish
lending criteria. It does not have power to fix interest rates, these
being determired by the Central Bank.
5.        The six-member Board of Directors is appointed by decree of the
Council of Ministers. It comprises appointees of the Ministers .   Commerce
and Finance, and of the agricultural credit cooperativres; the ABT Director-
General (Chairmnan) and two kssistuant Directors-General. The Board establishes
operating procedures, regulates the disposition of ABT's re3ources and
investments, examines and approves -the annual budget, balance sheet and profit,
and loss account. It also receives, for approval, all loan applications for
more than TL150,000 (US$10,000).
6.        The Director-General and four Assistant Directors-General are
appointed by the Council of M1inisters, subject to approval by the President
of the Republic, on the recommerdatilon of the Minister of Commerce. The
Director-Sene,ral has no specific power of veto, but, being also Chairman
of the Board, has considerable influence over ABT affairs. The present
Direckor-General, a law graduate of Ankara University, was appointed in
1966. He was previously Secretary-General for two years, and before that,
Manager of a large branch. He began his career with Afi in 1949.

7.        ABT has more than 16,000 employeesI/ (including those for whom it
is responsible in the cooperatives); 955 are university graduates. Salaries
are regulated by Law 1327 (August 14, 1970) establishing 16 salary classes
and nine step increases for all civil service and state economic enterprise
emplcyees. The classification of ABT s employees into this new system is
in process (end of 1970). In the past ABT's salaries were somewhat higher than
the civil service, though not as high as private banks and other private
enterprises. It is expected that reclassification of ABT's employees under
the new salary system wil.l assure them advantages over the other employees
of gove-rnnmntal bureaucracy. ABT has a hi.gh reputation and its staff vae
generally well qualified. ABT organization is shown in Chart 1.
Audit
8.        ABT's internal Audit Division has a staff of 264 which regularly
and promptly exa.i-nes the accounts of headquarters and the branches, and of
the agricultural cooperatives under ABT supervision. Branch managers make
regular cash counts. ABT's permanent auditors can speedi2y certify the
accounts or any part of them, and they could so certify project accounts
maintained separately from ABT's other accounts. Formal audit, though closely
regulated, is slow. ABT must submit records to the High Audit Board, a State
institution responsible for auditing all Government enterprises, One High
Audit Board member and three accouLntants are permanently engaged on ABT
audit and they spend about six months of every year in ABT's head offie.e,
tlhe rest in the branches. The balance sheet for the year ended December 31
must be submitted Lo the High Audit Board by March 31 and, when approved by
that Board, is submitted to the Mixed Congressional Comni.ssion and finally
to the Assembly and Senate. This can take a long time; 15 months is not
unusual. Since transfers to reserves and allocation of profit must await
final approval by the Assembly and Senate, these final adjustments are often
delayed. Auditors of the Ministry of Finance also regularly check on deposits
at the larger branches and generally ensure compliance with the Banking Law.
Lending Policies and Procedures
9.        ABT's principal business is lending short-term uo the small farmer
and to cooperatives, small farmer being defined: "as a person whose main
occupation is agriculture and whose farming unit can be operated by the family
depending upon it".  ABT total lending for agriculture (total disbursements)
and the proportion of short and medium/long-term loans from 1965 to 1.969 wras:
1/ As of April 1969, the number of professional employees was 12,763;
supporting staff 3,544.

10.       Loans are made for a wide variety of agricultural purposes and stacidard
amounts are laid down for 22 different crops. Cereal growing is the largest
category. The amount to be lent short-term to an individual farmer, for culti-
vation, 1s computed from tables of standard cash requirements per unit of area
(dekar,l/ hectare) for different crops; for marketing, it is based on standard
amoiunts per kilo of different crops sold. There are also standard maxima per
unit of area for land improvement.
11.       In general, branch managers may approve loans from TL 10,000
(US$666) up to TL 50,000 (US$3,330) according to the nature of the loan; for
larger branches the limit is TL100,000 (US$6,660). There are special higher
and lower limits for machinery purchase, according to type.  Above these
limits, loans must be referred to Ankara headquarters, where Division Chiefs
may approve up to TL 150,000 (US$10,000), but arything higher must be submitted
to the Board. Most of ABT's lending is thus highly standardized; ABT could
not otherwise successfully lend small sums to many farmers. For numbers and
amounts of loans, see Table 1.
Collateral and Land Title
12.       Land titles, title registration and related procedures, are regulated
by Articles 632 to 936 of the Turkish Civil Code and Law No. 766 of June 28,
1966. Title may be acquired by purchase or inheritance of already registered
land, or by 20 years of uninterrupted peaceful possession, adjudicated through
a local court. Court expenses are relatively low, however, registration costs
and fees are TL 160 per hectare which, compared with the value of the land, are
substantial. The related attorney fees are from TL 1,000 to 5,000 per case,
although, theoretically, the farmer may act as his own attorney. Land Registry
offices maintain "Title Registration Books" in each ounty.  Cadaster offices
exist in some provinces, handling the mapping f the applicant's land, although
the employees of the Reigstrar's offices, with the aid of the municipality mary
1/ 10 dekars = 1 hectare.



lAMTEX 2
Page r
do mapping work, where cadaster offices do not exist. The time requirement
of the court procedure averages three years. This and the expense of regis-
tering title are responsible for the large number of unregistered and holdings
in Turkey. In addition, the farmer's belief that registration of title may
involve the danger of losing his land if offered as collateral of a loan stb-
sequent2y in default, also militates against land registration. Farm land
values are appraised at least once in each five year period, by a committee
composed of the local branch manager of the Agricultural Bank of the Republic
of Turkey, a member of the village Board of Eldermen and a reliable farmer from
the village. Separate values are established for irrigated and non-irrigated
land, according to the quality of the land in each location of the area. The
appraisal protocol is forwarded to hBT headquarters (Anlara) for approval.
The approved appraisals are taken into consideration in establishing the
borrowers' creditworthiness in the case of registered land titles. Mhenever,
the borrower has no registered title, the size and value of his unregistered
holdings are often takeni into account in determining his economic strength
and related creditworthiness, even though the unregistered title cannot be
part of the loan collateral. The Agricultural Bain's branch managers'
tendency is to tie up all available collaterals of the loan applicant
(first mortgage on land, chiattel mortgages, farmers group guarantee or three
guarantcrs acceptable to ABT) to minimize the credit risk.
Foreclosure Rights
13.       As a State institution, ABT has preferential security rights and
can enforce its mortgage security without court orders. It almost always dces
have a mortgage covering all items of the borrower's farm unit. After 45
days' notice of failure to pay, the property may be sold at public auction,
without further formality, at the borrower's expense. However, the average
Turkish farmer will not bid on the property of his fellow farmer in financial
difficulties. In ABT's long history there was only one successful- auction sale.
Allocation of Resources
14.       AET annually estimates its resources, and branches forecast loan
requirements, based on standards referred to in para 10, number df potential
borrowiers, and credit needs. About '130 branches, in addition, handle super-
vised agricultural credit (see para 1) The State Planning Organization (SPO)
is consulted as to the probably availability of budgetary funds and the limit of
Central Bank rediscounts and resources are annu,1lly allocaLed to braXiches
which include the amounts repaid by their owia borrowers during the year.
15.       The Encouragement and Development Loan Division, beginning 1971 is
expected to be responsible for administering the contemplated US$4.5 millico
IDA credit for dairy loans. It lends to larger enterprises and corporations
after appraisal of detailed submissions. The minimum size of its loans, whieh
must all be approved in Ankara, is determined by the minimum size of enterprise



AdM2EX 2
P age 67 
to which it may lend, e.g., dairy farms with 10 cows or more; fattening
units with 50 or more cattle; citrus orchards of 10 ha. All applicant farms
are visisted by ABT branch staff. The Division has its own staff of 20, of
whom 8 are university graduates and three expect to graduate shortly; the
rest have high school education. Its background and experience in handling
supervised loans would enable it efficiently to approve, disburse and supervise
loans under the project. Since it began operations in January 1969 it
approved 509 loans totalling TL 220 million (US$,15 million) up to October 25,
1969 when the law providing funds fcr "Encouragement and Development" was
declared unconstitutional. As of August 31, 1970, TL 161 million have been
disbursed. The funds collected from outstanding loans are being repaid to
the Turkish Treasury.
Borrowers' Contribution
16.       ABT normally expects the boMrower to provide 30% or more of the
funds required for the loan pucpose. For standardized short-term lending,
a fixed amount per unit is lent and the farmer provides the difference out
of its own resources (see para 10), usually about 50%. The borrower's con-
tribution varies with the loan purpose; e.g., 25% for tractor purchase;
40% for building construction (but 30% in the eastern part of the country);
25% for cattle fattening; 50% for sheep; 50% for local dairy cattle.
Interest Rates
17.      IAT's effective interest rat s as of Septenber 1, 1970, for agri-
cultural loans are standardized at 9%9 irrespective of term. Special
rates are laid down for certain types of lending. For example, 3% on loans
for export promotian. ABT may make commercial loans at up to 101/2% interest
for shcrt-terms and 12-1/2% for medium-terms.
18.       Interest is collected annually in arrears.  The average rate of
interest and commission earned on agricultural loans in 1969 was 7.4%V, but
will considerably increase for the period following September 1, 1970,
due to increased interest rates permnitted on agricultural loans.
Resources
19.       ABT's largest source of funds is customer demand and term deposits.
Next most important are advances and rediseounts with the Central Bank.
1/ Actual interest rate is 10-1/2% which is reduced by 1-1/2% Government
subsidy to 9% effective interest rate.  No administrative or super-
vision charges can be collected.

21.       The purpose for which agricultural loans were made ere shown in
Table 2. Direct seasonal short-term loans have been between 20 and 26% of
the total during the last four years; loans to credit cooperatives between
20 and 21$; for marketing between 26 and 314.  Shlort-term loans have been
between 82 and 8Vo of the total (see para 8); of the balance in medium and
long-term lending, the largest part was for equipment and land purchase.
Direct lending to farmers for livestock purposes, including purchase of food,
varied between 4.1% and 5.3% of the total loans disbursed.
22.       Loans to credit cooperatives are mostly for short-term seasonal
purposes. Loans for marketing, mostly to marketing cooperatives, increas-
ingly finance the Government's price support program.
23.       Most direct borrowers had loans of less than TL 5,000 (US$330);
the largest group by number of borrowers had up to TL 2,000 loans. Details
are in Table 1.
24.       In addition to its loan portfolio, ABT has 38 equity investments
in a variety of agricultural industries (including fertilizer, textiles,
minor processing) and an insurance compary. The market value at December
31, 1969, was about TL 257 (US$17 million), or 1-1/2% of total assets.
Financial Situation
25.       Summarized ABT balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for
1964-1969 are in Tables 3 and 4. ABT, in common with other banks, is
obliged to reserve 20% of the amount of its demand and time deposits in
cash and deposits with the Central Bank. The balance sheet total has more
than doubled between 1964 and 1969 from TL 7,057 million to TL 16,764 million.
Cash has varied between 3% and 5.3% of total assets. Commercial loans,
although more lucrative than agricultural loans, are restricted as a matter
of deliberate policy and were about 13% of assets in 1969 compared Vith about
20% in previous years.  Agricultural loans are now about 50% of all assets;
other assets (including sundry debtors) have varied between 12% and 17%.
26.       The proportion of liabilities represented by capital and reserves
has declined slowly from 13% to 8%; bond issues are negligible; rediscounts,
at one time 9% of liabilities are now at a high of 25%; deposits, always
the largest item, have varied between 52% and 60%.
27.       ABT regularly earns a profit, albeit a small one. Between 1965
and 1968 it has been in the range of TL 64to 79 million after falling to
TL 30 million in 1964 from TL 140 million in 1963. It was TL 42 million
(US$2.8 million) in 1969.  As a percentage of total assets, profit has
fallen from about 1% in 1965 to 0.3% in 1969; as a percentage of capital
paid-in and reserves, it has varied between about 3% and 8.5% during the
same period.



ANNEX 2

Defaults
28.       The total of ABT loans in default increased from TL 781 million
(US$52 million) in 1964 to TL 1,783 million (Us$119 million) in 1969. The
percentage to total loans, increased from 17.4 in 1964 to 18.3 in 1969.
Sirnce ABT reports that most of its loans in default are ultimately collected,
this record is not unsatisfactory.
29.       Extensions are granted for overdue loans if there is a good reason,
e.g., genuine crop failure due to drought. Installment repayments up to five
years are granted occasionally by special legislation for disaster conditions
in specific areas.
30.       Records of loans overdue for less than a year are kept in the bran-
ches, not at head office in Anlmra. Loans overdue for more than a year are
subject to legal action and automatically reported to head office.
Conclusion
31.       Although ABT lacks flexibility, its lending operations and proced-
ures are generally sound, especially for longer-term lending under the
Development Loan program. Lending to smaller farmers, which is an oblig-
ation imposed by ABT statute, is expensive and liable to greater risk than
lending to larger farmers with more acceptable security. ABT, through its
Encouragement and Development Loans Division, would be a suitable channel
for IDA lending to dairy farmers.

INTENSIVE DAIRY PRODUCTION
The Dairy Industry in Turke
Introduction
1.      Turkey's L4.5 million cattle are in two main categories;  multi-
purpose indigenous animals in villages throughout the countr-r; and dairy cattle
on private farms in and around the larger towns and villages and, to a lesser
extent, on Government farms.
l4ultipurpose Farms
2.      The multipurpose breeds include the Anatolian Black, the Eastern Red
(claimed to be descendants of Danish imports) and the Nestern lhite of Thrace,
introduced a few centuries ago from Central Europe. All three are used for
draft and serve as sources of meat and milk. They are relatively small
(200-400 kg), low in fertility (60a), mediocre in productive capacity (average
lactation about 600 lcg and average carcass weights about 90 kg) but remarkable
in hardiness and the ability to survive the harsh Turkish. envirornent.  Animals
are grazed during the day, usually in village herds and by hired herdsmen, and
are returned at niglat to their owners for milking. Village herds vary in size
and range from a few to several hundred animals.
3.      Turkeyts hot dry summers and, over most of the country, cold wet winters,
restrict plant growth to three or four months in spring and early summer.
Communal pastures then offer a plentiful supply of nutritious feed but, for the
rest of the year, are overgrazed, matured and weathered. Stubble, fallow,
residual and roadside grazing provide additional feed from mid-summer to late
winter. Supplementary feeding is rare and is practiced only if there is an
acute shortage of forage.  Cereal straw is then the most common feed, followed
by industrial by-products (beet pulp, cottonseed hulls, bran) and cereal grai's.
4.      Calving is concentrated in winter to maximize milk product-on from lush
spring pasture. Calves are fed on minimal amounts of milk and are weaned at
an early age to increase revenue from the sale of milk. Calf mortalities are
consequently high (10-20%).
5.      Animals under tihese adverse conditions are on a semi-starvation level
of feeding for at least six months of the year. Their rations during this
period are not only excessively bulky, but are also highly deficient in pro-
tein, fat soLuble vitamins (A & E) and mrinerals.  The result is loss of body
weight and condition and vulnerability to tlhe many endermaic diseases.
6.      By and large, the Turkish villager is a herdsman and not a dairy farmer.
He grows no forage crops and makes no hay or silage.

Dairy Cattle
7.      The Southern Red, originally introduced frorn Syria and currently
restricted to the Iiediterranean and Aegean regions, is the only indigenous
dairy breed. Individual lactations range from about 1500-2500 kg and average
about 2000 kg.  There are about 30,000 of this breed around Adana.  A highly
selected herd at the Directorate of Veterinary Medicine's research farm at
Chuckorova near Adana has averaged about 3250 kcg of milk per lactation, with
individual cows reaching about 50CO kg.
8.      Holstein-Friesian, Brown Swiss and Jersey cattle have been introduced
in relatively small numbers from Europe and North Am-erica and are now found
mainly on Government farms. Holstein-Friesian and Brown Swiss cattle in the
country together total about 10,000, wfith Brown Swiss being slightly more
sicurerous .
9.      Mlost dairy cows on private farms are upgraded combinations of indigenous
breeds and exotic introductions. iHilk production of upgraded animals increases
by about 25-30% with the first cross and, wi-th continued crossing, in progress-
ively smaller increments to the fourth generation when they become almost
indistinguishable from pure breds. Lactations range from 2000-4000 kg depend-
ing on age, breeding, feeding and management. IIore than 4000 kg is exceptional.
There is no official system of railk recording in the country. Animals are
bought, sold and bred more on the basis of pedigree and appearance than on
certified productive performance. The official estimate of cows milked in
Turkey in 1966 is about 4.5 million.
10.     Dairy farms are not restricted to rural areas. Host are small
domestic operations in or around villages, towns and cities - usually under
10 and rarely over 20 cows. The larger and more sophisticated private farms
(20-50 cows) are far less numerous and are generally further away from urban
centers, frec±uently on the properties of the larger land owners. Even on
these properties, dairying is often a sideline with cash crops as the main
source of income.
11.     Feeding standards of dairy cows on Government farms are good.  Liberal
amounts of good quality roughage (green forage, hay and silage) and balanced
concentrate are fed around the year. On private farms, however, feeding
standards are much more variable.  Few farmers grow forage crops for green
feed and fewer still make hay or silage. Iiost feed cereal straw for more than
six months of thie year and supplement this with concentrates for milk produc-
tion. Although manufactured feeds are available, concentrates are still mostly
mixed on the farm and are composed of various combinations of cereal grains,
milling by-products, and vegetable oil meals. Ilinerals and vitamins are rarely
added.
12.     Cow sheds are designed to provide a maximum of shelter and are, as a
result, poorly ventilated.  This, coupled with narrow dung gutters and alley-
ways, little or no bedding and complete absence of water under pressure for
hosing down, leads to generally poor hygienic conditions. Animal health and
clean milk production are further imperiled by the fact that cows are generally
hand milked in their stalls and not in milking parlors.

13.    I-ost farms have at least one bull.  Calving rates range from 70-80/.
Artificial insemination was introduced a few years ago, but is not yet
commonly used because of 2oor com,aunications, low conception rates (below 60%)
and farmer prejudice. Inseminators are using the old speculum and forceps
method and are averaging 2-3 cows per day. Semen is collected twice weekly
and is refrigerated following dilution in egg-yoik citrate medium. There are
no facilities for the storage of frozen semen. Bulls on both Government and
private farms are selected on the basis of pedigree and appearance and not on
performance.
Government Services
14.     State institutions and enterprises servicing the dairy industry
include:
(a) The Directorate General of Veterinary IHedicine, responsible
for animal breeding and animal health, is staffed by about 1300
veterinarians. It administers the artificial insemination service
and provides:
(i)    field services (including 21 diagnostic laboratories
and dispensaries) for the prevention, diagnosis and treat-
ment of disease, with about 1500 officers, of whom less than
half are veterinarians;
(ii)   centralized laboratory services (4 main and 7 regional)
for the production of biologicals and research on the epi-
demiology of disease; and
(iii) State farm services (39 st.'tions) for the provision
of breeding stock and research in nutrition and management.
This Directorate stresses the importance of breeding and disease
control but, although responsible for nutrition, places little
emphasis on forage crop production and preservation.
(b) The Directorate General of Agriculture, providing a cadre of
provincial animal husbandry specialists (67) primarily responsible
for the training of county and village extension officers (about
1800) and also responsible for the improvement of range lands and
pastures. The Directorate administers 12 experimental State farms
but also places little emphasis on forage crop production and pre-
servation and is not very effective in extending advanced dairying
methods to private farmers.
(c) The INeat and Fish Organization, running a number of packing
plants (4), is expanding its operations and plans to export meat
to the Middle East, Europe and North Africa.  This Organization
currently handles 5-7% of the countryy's neat trade and could serve
as an outlet for culled dairy animals and baby beef.
(d)  The National Milk Industry Organization, operating dairy
factories in Istanbul, Izmir and Adana and building others in four
smaller towns.  All its existing plants are operating well below
capacity.



ANNEX 3
Page  4
(e) The Feedstuffs Industrial Corporation operating 8 feed
factories with annual single shift capacities ranging from
4200-12,500 tons. These manufacture dairy concentrates of
certified composition and analysis. Prices are reasonable,
mainly because of seasonal and large-scale buying of ingredients.
(f) The Agricultural Supply Organization, selling machinery,
fertilizer, certified seed and agrochemicals at strategically
located regional depots.
(g) The Sugar Organization, producing large quantities of
beet pulp and molasses from 17 factories scattered around the
country. Its dairy farms are used for demonstration purposes
and as sources of breeding stock.
Prospects
15.     Turkey's future in dairy farming is largely dependent on irrigation.
Only with cheap quality roughages can the industry develop and prosper. Present
yields of alfalfa on irrigated land are up to 11 tons of hay/ha/year on the
Anatolian Plateau, L4 tons in the Marmara region and 21 tons in the M4editerra-
nean and Aegean regions, compared with an average 12 tons in Yugoslavia and
20 tons in Israel, both with prosperous dairy industries. These Turkish yields
should increase with more irrigation, increased use of fertilizers,better
methods of harvesting and greater control of diseases, pests and weeds.
16.     There is considerable room for improvement in practically every facet
of Turkey's present system of dairy farming; forage crop production and pre-
servation, housing, hygiene, feeding, management, breeding and calf rearing.
'This could be achieved through a more intensive program of applied research,
extension and demonstration and by the provision of credit to more progressive
farmers.
Project Dairy Farming
17.     Project dairy farming would be based on growing of good quality forage
crops under irrigation, feeding of balanced concentrates for milk production
and improved methods of management. Climatic conditions in the four ecologioa).
regions permit the growiing of both alfalfa and corn, and project farmers would
have the opportunity of making hay and silage. Eowever, farmers, in all
regions, are more experienced in growing alfalfa than corn and in making hay
than silage. Most project farmers would therefore be likely to grow alfalfa
and preserve it as hay.
18.     Project cost estimates assume that all participants would need finance
to purchase a mower and a side delivery rake, and about one-third would need
finance for balers or forage harvesters (each costing about US$2,700) to make
hay or silage. Participants not purchasing this optional equipment would hire
it from a neighbor.
19.     Dairy herds in the Adana, Izmir, and Istanbul regions would be housed
in open sheds, with portable protections such as stacked hay bales, should
solme winters prove severe.  In the much colder Ankara region, more conventional
closed but well ventilated sheds would be used. Cows would be yolked and wolld

face inwards onto a slightly elevated central alleyway wide enough for a
tractor and trailer to be driven through. A single feed manger would run
along either side of the alleyway and cows would back onto wide and shallow
dung gutters. Simple partitions made of two-inch tubular piping would separate
animals and water fountains would be shared by each adjacent pair. Both types
of sheds would have pressurized water outlets for hozing down and would open
onto a loafing yard having a shaded area, a feed manger and a water trough.
20.     The herd would be restricted to the shed and loafing yard and would not
be allowed to graze. Roughage would be fed green when weather permits and hay -
with or without silage - when it does not. Cows would be well bedded and hand
milked in their stalls. They would be fed concentrates at the time of milking
at a rate of 1 kg for every 3 kg of milk over the first 5 kg.

TURKEY
IiJTENJSIVE DAIRY PRODUCTION
Milk Marketing in the Project Areas
1.       Milk products are traditional to the Turkish diet.  They have been
consumed, until recently, in unpasteurized liquid form, as yogurt, its diluted
derivative "ayran" or raw milk (usually boiled before use).  In solid form
milk is most2y consumed as white cheese.
Traditional Milk Trade
2.       In rural areas, a household depends on its own animals for milk or it
may purchase what it needs from a neighbor (for cash or Iind). In remote arets
surplus milk is sold to village cheese makers. In towns, the supply 0ystem
is more complex, with networks of traders ("peddlers") and sales to small
specialized yogurt and cheese makers. In smaller towns, farmers often deliver
direct to consumers; in larger towns, such as Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and
Adana, specialized middlemen handle most of the trade. In some cases, a
peddler buys direct from the farmer and delivers house-to-hous4 in others,
a trader buys from a farmer or milk collector and sells to peddlers, who
deliver house-to-house, or to retail stores. Occasionally, a larger farmer
may deliver direct to households and restaurants in the city, and he may
produce and sell yogurt as well.
3.       In some towns, numerous traders of vari.ous kinds engage in the milk
business. In Istanbul. alone (population 2 million), there are over 1,200.
Traders transport their wares by bicycle, pack animal, cart and motor vehicle.
Although yogurt is sometimes packaged, raw milk is typically delivered in
large cans and ladled into the consumer's container at time of sale.
4.       Because of the nuimber and variety of outlets, accurate statistics of
milk product consumption and of the form and distribution by type of outlet
(e.g., restaurant or home delivery), are not available.
Pasteurization - The Milk Factories
5.       In 1957, the Government of Turkey, with UVESCO help, built its first
pasteurized milk factory on a State Farm just outside Ankara. Government
later set up, also with UNESCO help, a National Milk Organization, which, in
1968, opened new pasteurized milk factories at Istanbul, Izmir and Adana
and in 1969 in Kars. This same Organization is now joining a local milk
cooperative to build a new factory in Konya, 260 km south of Ankara, and
an important channel of supply to the Ankara market.
6.       Government's aim was to improve milk production hygiene, eliminate
unsanitary handling and avoid adulteration, allegedly practiced by some
traders. A law Frohibiting sale of unpasteurized milk in cities of over
100,000 was enacted, but is not yet enforced.



Page 2
7.       Table 1 sets out the daily capacities and percent utilization of the
four Government factories. The Ankara plant, now in its 13th year, is
approaching an average one-shift utilization; the others operate between
9% and 23% capacity, though they are still very new. Figures on "market-
share" are not available, but it is clear that the Government factories
supply only a small part of the market.

Factory Collection
8.       The four factories have organized their supplies along different
lines.  Collection, payment bases, and radius of collection vary consider-
ably. Adana and Izmir have the most compact collection areas (within 60
km and 120 km, respectively) and Ankara the most dispersed (with supplies
from as far as 320 km). Ankara and Izmir pay for milk delivered factory.
while Istanbul and Adana pay on-farm and collect the milk themselves
(directly or from a collection point). Twenty-two cooperatives collect
milk for Izmir; for Ankara, a variety of cooperatives, individuals and
traders perform this task. For all four factories, the average supplier
is a small producer.
Distribution of Pasteurized Milk
9.       Methods of distribution also vary. The Adana plant delivers to
over 300 retailers and those in Ankara and Izmir use distributors payed on
a commission basis. Distribution of pasteurized dairy products in Istanbul
has been monopolized since July 1970 by a traders cooperative composed
of some 130 of the estimated 1,300-1,500 milk peddlers operating in the
city.
10.      All four factories produce a full line of fluid mi' k, yogurt
(and ayran), white cheese, butter, but only those in Ankara and
Istanbul manufacture ice cream.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Acceptance of pasteurized milk is relatively less developed at Adana and
Izmir than at 1An1cara. Also, Izmir and Adana use quantities of raw milk for
cheesemaking - 27p and 50%, respectively. In Istanbul and Ankara, roughly
35% and 15%, respectively, of factory output goes to t,he army and other
Government markets; for Izmir and Adana, such markets are not so important.
Government 1dlk Factory Prices
11.    Selliing and buying prices vary considerably betwieen the four factories,
as set out in Table 2. Retail selling prices var-y by TL 0.50 (Us$ 5.5 cents),
from TL 2.30 (US$ 25 cents) at Izmir to TL 2.80 (US$ 31 cents) at Istanbul.
Buying prices shoow a smiliar variation.  Surprisingly, factory gross margins
are similar, varying from TL 0.53 to TL 0.63, a range of only TL 0.10.

ANWEX 4

Retailers' gross margins vary widely, ranging from TL 0.20 at Ankara and
Izmir to TL 0.60 at Istanbul. The Istanbul margin includes the cost of
retailers' collection and delivery functions not normally performed by
retailers at the other centers.  Ankara and Izmir have attained wide retail
distribution in spite of the modest retail margin of TL 0.20 per liter
(betwseen 6d0 and 9g of retail pr-ce).
13.    In each of the four areas, milk supply varies markedly with the
season. To encourage winter feeding kfrom stored fodder) and a change in
production cycle (to early winter calving), Istanbul and Ankara pay TL 0.20
per liter more in wrinter (September through February). Adana pays TL 0.10
but Izmir pays,90thing. At Ankara, where the problem of low winter supply
is most severe- , the factory offers encouragement by agreeing to take 4
liters during the summer flush for every 1 liter delivered during winter.
Cheese is made (at a loss) from the summer surplus.
Competition
14.    Private traders compete vigorously with the milk factories on price
and service. The comparative prices charged are set out in Table 3 and
suggest that traders:
(a) charge prices that are TL 0.25 to TL 0.50 lowier than the
factories (and deliver to the househo2d as well);
(b)  operate on a TL 0.25 to TL 0.50 lower overall margin
between farmer and consumer; but
(c)  generally do not, on average, pay the farmer a
significantly higher price.

3/ The management of the Ankara factory advised that traders compete by
price for supplies in the winter-time but never in sumier.



AuNEX 4
Page 5
15.   Traders do, however, tend to pay higher prices in winter, particularly
in Ankara. This pattern is consistent  Sith the factory managers' general
comment that their problem is selling, not supplies.  Besides delivering
direct to the household, the trader also gives credit, reportedly for up to
one month. Delivery by the trader is traditional and may involve long-
standing trader/household personal relationships.
16.    Given the lower price and (to many households) the noticeably better
service of the traditional trader, it is not surprising that milk factories
have had a difficult time increasing their business. There is practically
no advertising, product promotion being virtually limited to factory tours
for school children and housewives.
17.    No quar.titative information is available on present usage of pasteu-
ized milk products.  Broadly, two groups of consumers are discernible:
(a) higher income groups wiho use pasteurized milk for health
reasons; and
(b) the beverage market.
18.    The first group appears to buy pasteurized milk for the sick, the very
young and the very old. Pasteurized milk is becoming more popular as a soft
drink for consumption in stores, restaurants, factories, and so on. The
250-ce container of milk or ayran costs about the same as the colas and can
be kept in retail chill cabinets widely used for regular soft drinks.
19.    The milk factories were set up to operate as pasteurizers of most of
the raw milk traded in their areas, a near monopoly situation. At present,
however, the pasteurization laws are not enforced and the nilk factories
operate at a cost and price disadvantage.  While, the real costs of pasteur-
ized will probably alwtays be higher than unpasteu.rized milk, there are several
steps that could be taken to irprove the factoriest competitive position:
(a) promote pasteurized products more aggressively;
(b)  employ greater flexibility in pricing; and
(c) more dynamic distribution.
20.    The  reat difference between summer and iwinter supplies at Ankara
(nearlyr 201) suggests that winter/summer price differentials are
inadequate.  Tnis is confirmed oy retailers, who would like more winter milk,
and believe consumers would stand a higher winter price which would, in turn,
stimulate winter supplies.
Pasteurization Program
21.   Consumers have traditionally protected themselves from the possible
ill effects of using pasteurized milk by purchasing yogurt or ayrp (whose
manufacture involves boiling) or by boiling raw milk prior to use; . There
1/  For example, tihe Istanbul Public E-ealth Department estimates that 80%
of raw milk sold is for home preparation of yogurt.



ANNEX 
page 6
are, however, disadvantages to these practices:
(a) nutritional value is reduced by boiling;
(b)  sanitation is lacling in traditional yogurt manufacture; and
(c)  raw milk is alleged to be watered dowmn, and otherwnrise
adulterated, by some peddlers.
22.    Govcrnment   intended to chanmel all rawr milk for Istanbul, Ankara,
Adana and Izmir through the Government milk factories. This is not easy to
do.  First, the urban herds of Istanbul, Ankara and Adana (a significant
part of local sapply) are difficult to supervise and contrcl. Their transfer
outside the tonas would increase costs (at least in the short-run) through
removal and installation expenses, and overall dairy cow numbers would probabLy
be reduced because some urban herdsmen would refuse to move. Second, addi-
tional expenses would be incurred in achieving full utilization of the facto-
ries and in setting up collection and wholesale distribution centers.  Third,
it is possible that factory capacity might not be adequate to service the
total market; better estimates of present (and future) consumption in the
four markets are needed before this could be determined.  Finally, the precise
role of the factories - whether they are ultimately to be marketing and trad-
ing organizations or merely custom processors of raw .ilk - needs to be
clarified. The role of the private trade at all levels of distribution,and
the mechanism for pricing,must also be spelled out. These problems, together
with tardy consumer acceptance of pasteurized milk, suggest a slow approach
be made to full compulsory pasteurization.
Conclusion
24.   As long as the milk factories operate commercially (i.e., the laws
prohibiting the sale of unpasteurized milk are not enforced), project farms
should be free to market milk as they wish and should not necessarily be
tied to the milk factories. The reasons are two-fold. First, milk facto-
ries have trouble enough selling all the milk currently available to them
in the sunmmer season. Thus, while the total market for milk products is
growing rapidly in the four project areas, the market shares of the milk
factories may not grow fast enough to ensure that the factories would be
able to buy all project milk production. Second, certain project farms may
be able to develop outlets for their milk that are more remunerative than
selling to the milk factories.
25.   The National ILilk Organization is considering paying a premium price
for milk of the quality expected ifom project farms and it is likely that
much of the project output would, in fact, be sold to the Organization
factories. As long as the milk market remains free, however, there seems
no reason to penalize project farmers by requiring that their output be
tied to the mDilk factories.

TURKEY
INTEWTSIVE DAIRY IRODICTION
Basic Assumptions on the Effect of Devaluation
1.        On August 9, 1970, subsequent to field appraisal, the par value per
Turkish Lira to the US dollar was changed from nine to 15, representing equ -
valent to a devaluation of 66.7%. Along with the decision to devalue the Li:-a,
Government also increased the price of sugar and fuel by about 35% and raisei
the effective rate of interest on agricultural loans from six to nine percen-z.
Government policy was to limit agricultural input prices to an average of about
ten percent increase over predevaluation levels. However, this limit has sinue
been exceeded as is reflected below in the table of some Government controlled
pre and post devaluation prices. 1/

2.        Devaluation in the order of about 67% can be expected to have various
effects on the Project, but it is yet too early to determine with precision
its final impact on investment, operating costs, commodity prices and farmers'
benefit.
3.        This devaluation results in an increase in the Turkish lira equivalent
of the foreign exchange component of investments. To a lesser extent, it would
also result in an increase in milk and catile prices and in operating costs.
4.        To account for devaluation the following assumptions have been made on
Project related increases in investment costs, V mmodity prices, operating
costs, operating capital and residual herd value:
1/ Source: State Flanning Organization, October 1970.
2/ Percentage in increases over levels prevailing at time of appraisal in
October 1969, Annex 6.

5.        Post devaluation price increases should be greater for beef than
for milk because of the following factors:
(a) the purchasing power of beef consumers is greater than that
of milk consumers;
(b) the domestic demand l/ fof beef is greater than that far milk; and
(c) Government policy is to promote meat exports to the high
priced Middle Eastern countries.
6.        Based on the above assumptions the effect of devaluation of the T.L,
would not decrease the rates of return, as estimated during appraisal (October,
1969), that were 17% for the rate of return to the economy and 15-20% fer the
various models in the various Project areas.

i  During appraisal - pre-devaluation - the retail price of the tractor was calculated
by about TL 40,000 representing an equivalent of us$4,500. After devaluation i.e.
when the tractors would be procured their price is assumed by TL 57,000 representing
a 42% price increase (weighted average of 67% increase of the 40% foreign exchange
and 25,% increase of the 60% local currency component in tractors). However, a dollar
equivalent of about 4,500 per tractor has been maintained.

ANNEX 19
TURKEY
INTENSIVE DAIRY PRODUCTION
Rate of Return to the Economy
1.       The estimated rate of return to the economy of Turkey is 20%,
calculated from the attached table.
Incremental Net Income
2.       Incremental net income is taken from the models and multiplied
by the number of farms, of model size, expected to be developed in two
years; 210 30-cow models and 60 40-cow models. Annual net irncome before
development is deducted from annual net income after development, in each
case, to arrive at incremental net income attributable to the project
(see Annexes 10 and 14).
Investment
3.       Investment cost is likewise taken from the models (Annexes 7 and
11). Farmers continue to invest in fodder crop estab"Tohment, according to
the needs of their growing herds, after the first thrc e years of major capital
investment. Investment, therefore, continues beyond the four year ABT
lending program.
Shadow Wage Rate
4.       Because of unemployment and underemplqyment in agriculture, the
current wage rate overstates the labor cost to the Turkish economy. The
wage cost is, therefore, reduced by adding back 25% of the labor cost at
current wage rates based on TL 2.50/hour in year one to three and TL 3.00/
hour during project's lifetime.
Technical Services
5.       The technical services in the total project cost include training
and staffing for later phases of intensive dairy production. These should
not all be charged against the economic cost of the project. The cost of
the project manager plus approximately half the cost of supporting staff is
therefore included in the economic cost during the first three years and
the cost of technical services to the project is gradually reduced as the
need for on-farm appraisal and supervision declines and staff are trans-
ferred to other duties.
Rate of Return to the Economy
6.       The farms are considered to have an economic life of 25 years and
the balances are discounted over that period (26th year for farms coming
into the project in the second year).
