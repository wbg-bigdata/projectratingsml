CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
Until recently, the Sri Lanka Rupee was pegged
to the Pound Sterling at a parity rate of X 1.00 = Rs 15.60.
On May 24, 1976, the Sri Lanka Rupee was officially linked
to a basket of currencies with the initial parity rate based
on the prevailing Rupee/Pound rate. Both the composition of
the basket and the weights assigned to the currencies in it
were revised on March 12, 1977. The current Rupee/US Dollar
rate has been used throughout the report, except where stated
to the contrary. 1/
US$1           =  Rs 7.28
Rs 1           =  US$0.137
Rs 1 million  =  US$137,363
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
1 long ton = 2,240 lb         =  1.016 metric tons
1 hundredweight (cwt)
= 50.8 kg                 =  112 lb
1 bushel (bu) of paddy        =  45 lb
1 pint                        =  0.57 liters
1 acre (ac)                   =  0.405 hectare (ha)
1 mile (mi)                   =  1.609 kilometers (km)
1 square mile (sq mi)         =  640 ac (259 ha)
1 foot (ft)                   =  30.5 centimeters (cm)
1/   Through the sale and purchase of Foreign Exchange
Entitlement Certificates (FEECs), Sri Lanka effec-
tively practices a dual exchange rate. Most non-
foodgrain imports have to pay a surcharge of 65%
through the purchase of FEECs. Most non-traditional
exports receive a 65% premium over the official rate
through the sale of FEECs.

APPRAISAL OF MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agriculture plays a major role in Sri Lanka's economy.  It
accounts for about one-third of the GNP, more than one-half of all employ-
ment, and about four-fifths of export earnings. Historically, the country
has depended upon export earnings from tree crops -- tea, rubber and coco-
nuts -- to pay for imports of foodgrains and other goods. However, agri-
cultural production has stagnated since 1970 and, with adverse changes in
the terms of trade, Sri Lanka has found it increasingly difficult to import
almost 50% of its foodgrain requirements. This has prompted a re-examination
of past policies and increased food self-sufficiency is now a major objec-
tive for the Government's agricultural policies. Two corner stones in the
Government's strategy to increase food production are better utilization of
existing irrigation facilities and creation of new irrigation potential.
ii.       The Mahaweli Ganga is Sri Lanka's largest river, draining an area
of about 4,000 sq mi. It is the principal source of water available for
irrigation in the dry zone, which covers the northern and eastern part of
the island. The river rises in the mountainous southern-central part of the
island, which receives an annual rainfall of 175 to 200 inches, and discharges
to the north-east into the Bay of Bengal. The richness of the water resources
at its source is contrasted with the relatively low rainfall (35 to 75 inches)
in the dry zone.
iii.      The present Master Plan for the Mahaweli Development Scheme, formu-
lated in 1968 by a UNDP/FAO team, envisages 900,000 ac of irrigation and 970 MW
of hydropower. Construction of Stage I of the scheme started with Bank Group
assistance in 1972 and is now almost completed. Stage I consists of a 40 MW
power station, and a transbasin diversion from the Mahaweli Ganga at Pogolla
to improve water supply to some 130,000 ac of existing irrigated land and to
provide adequate water for the irrigation of 90,000 ac of new land most of
which is located in the present project area. The Stage II works, which
would utilize water diverted by Stage I to irrigate 71,000 ac of new land,
were started in 1974. So far, irrigation infrastructure has been completed
for 6,100 ac and work is in progress on 24,600 ac. The proposed project
would complete the second stage of the Master Plan.
iv.       The project would cover a contiguous area of 106,000 ac.  It would
include: (a) construction of irrigation, drainage and road infrastructure
for 40,300 ac (US$13.7 M net of administration costs and contingencies);
(b) clearing of jungle and preparing 40,300 ac for cultivation as well as
settling some 15,300 families on 2-1/2 ac plots (US$18.2 M); (c) construction
and O&M facilities and equipment (US$12.6 M) for 71,000 ac; (d) production



- ii -
support ici the form of farm equipment, marketing, transport and processing
facilities for 71,000 ac (US$13.1 M); (e) improved agricultural extension
services for the whole 106,000 ac (US$1.9 M); (f) social infrastructure --
village wells, schools, medical and community development facilities -- for
64,900 ac (US$6.4 M); and (g) technical assistance and monitorlng (US$1.2 M).
v.        Total project costs are estimated at US$100.5 M equivalent, in-
cluding US$20.5 M in import taxes and duties. The foreign exchange com-
ponent is estimated at US$32.6 M, or 41% of the total net of taxes and
duties. Civil works and buildings amount to US$37.8 M; equipment and
vehicles, US$26.3 M; technical assistance, US$0.6 M; engineering, settle-
ment assistance, administration and monitoring, US$6.5 M; physical con-
tingencies, US$6.8 M and price contingencies, US$22.2 M.
vi.       With assistance from the Bank Group, GOSL has tentatively secured
credits of about US$6.0 M equivalent from Canada, US$5.0 M from The Nether-
lands, US$7.2 M from UK, and US$5.0 M from the US, for financing parts of the
project costs. Together with the proposed IDA credit of US$19.0 M, they would
finance all foreign exchange costs and about 20% of local costs, or 53% of the
total project cost net of taxes and duties.
vii.      Project implementation would take about five years.  The Mahaweli
Development Board (MDB), an agency under the Ministry of Irrigation, Power
and Highways, would be responsible for implementation of all civil works and
buildings proposed under the project. The Department of Agriculture in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Lands would be responsible for reorganizing
and strengthening the extension service. The Sri Lanka Tractor Corporation
would be responsible for the procurement and distribution of farm equipment
to the project area farmers as well as for procurement and distribution of
construction and O&M equipment. Interagency coordination of planning and im-
plementation would be provided by the Mahaweli Coordination Committee, chaired
by the Secretary of Irrigation, at the policy level and by technical sub-
committees at the working level.  After completion of construction, all build-
ings would be handed over to the agencies concerned. The MDB, initially, would
be responsible for operation and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure.
At the field level, interagency coordination would be provided by the Project
Advisory Committee, chaired by MDB's Resident Project Manager which would in-
clude officers from the concerned agencies as well as farmer representatives.
viii.     Equipment and vehicles to be financed under the credits from Canada,
UK and the US would be procured in accordance with their respective procurement
guidelines. Other equiDment and vehicles would be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines.  Since the civil
works and buildings (US$37.8 M) would be relatively small, labor-intensive,
scattered over a wide area and implemented seasonally over a five year period,
international competitive bidding woiuld not be practical. Most of these works
(US$28.7 M) would be carried out after local competitive bidding or through
small unit price contracts. About 24% of all works would be carried out by
MDB under force account (US$0.6 M) or by public agencies under negotiated
contracts (US$8.5 M).



- iii -
ix.       The irrigation infrastructure provided under the project would
directly benefit some 15,300 families who, at present, are landless or
practice subsistence agriculture on small holdings. Most of them would
be given secure tenure for the first time and their incomes, presently
one-half of the national average, would reach the national level. The
expansion of the cropped area and the more intensive cultivation, made
possible by the provision of irrigation, would generate an annual farm
employment of three million man-days or about 12,000 full time jobs. The
project would have substantial secondary employment effects in marketing,
processing, supply of farm inputs and services, and would help relieve
the large unemployment and underemployment prevailing in and around the
project area.
x.        At full development in 1986, the project would increase the
production of: foodgrains by 42,300 tons; chillies, 1,100 tons; oilseeds,
3,800 tons; and vegetables, 3,600 tons. At projected world market prices,
this would represent a net annual foreign exchange saving of about US$8.0 M.
The project's economic rate of return would be 21%. Sensitivity tests
indicate that the project would remain economically viable even under a
combination of unlikely adverse circumstances.
xi.       The proposed project would constitute the first major integrated
development of unirrigated land under the Mahaweli Master Plan. In its
approach to project management, community participation and supporting
services, the project was formulated with an overriding concern for replic-
ability in future land development in the dry zone.
xii.      Subject to appropriate assurances to be obtained from the Govern-
ment, the proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$19 million.
The Borrower would be the Republic of Sri Lanka.

APPRAISAL OF MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has requested IDA assistance
for a part of the Mahaweli Development Scheme. The scheme, which is based
on a Master Plan prepared by a UNDP/FAO team in 1968, envisages the irrigation
development of 900,000 ac and 970 MW of hydropower. Stage I of the scheme,
supported by the Bank Group through Credit 174-CE (US$14.5 M) and Loan 653-CE
(US$14.5), was started in 1972 and is expected to be completed in 1977. It
consists of a 40 14W hydropower plant and a transbasin diversion from Mahaweli
Ganga at Polgolla to the present project area and partial rehabilitation of
an existing irrigation system serving some 130,000 ac. The Stage II works,
started in 1974, would utilize part of the water diverted by Stage I to
irrigate 71,000 ac of new land in north central Sri Lanka in order to settle
27,000 families. The proposed project would complete Stage II and provide
agricultural extension services to the 71,000 ac as well as 35,000 ac of
adjacent irrigated land, at an estimated cost of US$100.5 M (US$80.0 M net
of taxes and duties).
1.02      This would be the Bank Group's fifth operation in support of the
country's efforts in water resources development. In addition to supporting
the Mahaweli Ganga Stage I Project, the Bank Group has been involved in a
Lift Irrigation Project (Credit 121-CE, US$2.0 M), a Drainage and Reclamation
Project (Credit 168-CE, US$2.5 M), and a Tank Irrigation Modernization Project
(Credit 666-CE, US$5.0 M).
1.03      The feasibility study for Stage II, provided for under the Loan/
Credit Agreements for Stage I, was prepared by the consulting firm SOGREAH
of France. An FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program Mission visited Sri Lanka in
early 1975 to finalize a preparation report (Report No. 17/75 CEY 7), and
the project was appraised in April/May 1975 by a Bank Group Mission. In
February 1976, GOSL requested that the project be reformulated. A followup
Mission, comprising: Messrs. P. Ljung; S. Baker; C. J. R. Bridge, and Ms.
M. Nguyen (IDA), and Mr. C. D. Datey (Consultant), visited Sri Lanka in May/
June 1976 for this purpose. This report is based on the findings of the
followup Mission. At various stages, the IDA Missions were accompanied by
representatives of four prospective co-financing countries: Messrs. R. Bailey
and E. Yendall (Canada); R. Glazener (The Netherlands); W. Franklin (UK); and
C. Billings, J. Coles, R. Perry and J. Watson (USA).

II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      Sri Lanka has an estimated population of about 13.8 million, 80% of
which is rural. Of the total land area of 16.2 million ac (about 25,300 sq
mi), about 5 million ac are used for agriculture. The climate is characterized
by nearly constant temperatures and large variations in rainfall (Annex 1).
The island can be divided into two distinct precipitation zones: the wet
zone (average annual rainfall over 75 inches), situated in the southwest
quadrant and covering about 30% of the land area, and the dry zone (average
annual rainfall ranging from 35 to 75 inches) covering the remainder of the
island. The wet zone supports more than three-quarters of the total popula-
tion and accounts for about 70% of the cultivated land.
The Economy
2.02      The average per capita income is low (US$150 in 1975).  Government
policies have resulted in a well-developed system of health care and other
public services, a high literacy rate, and an absence of extreme poverty.
These developments, however, have not been accompanied by a satisfactory
growth in output, and, since 1970, the annual increase in gross national pro-
duct (GNP) has averaged 2.5%, somewhat higher than the population growth rate
of 1.7%. The slow pace of economic development is mainly due to inadequate
investments in the productive sectors. Due to the poor production perfor-
mance, the employment situation has deteriorated and about one-third of the
labor force is unemployed or severely underemployed. During recent years,
prices of major imports, foodgrains, fertilizers and petroleum products have
risen sharply while price increases for the main exports, tea, coconuts and
rubber, have been relatively moderate, and the country now faces a severe
foreign exchange shortage. The budgetary resources of the Government are
barely adequate to cover its current expenditures, leaving most capital
formation to the vagaries of external assistance.
Agricultural and Irrigation
2.03      Agriculture contributes about one-third of the GNP, more than one-
half of all employment, and over four-fifths of export earnings. About half
of the total cultivated area of 5.0 M ac is under tree crops, primarily tea,
rubber and coconuts. The other half is under field crops, principally paddy
(1.8 M ac), manioc (0.3 M ac) and chillies, maize and pulses (about 0.1 M ac
each). The cropping intensity on paddy lands ranges from about 185% in the
wet zone to about 110% in the dry zone. The average for the country is about
150%.
2.04      In the decade ending in 1973, agricultural output increased at an
annual rate of 2.3%. Production in subsequent years has been adversely
affected by droughts. While foodgrain production increased 3.1% annually,
output in the tree crop sector increased 1.2% annually. The poor performance
of the tree crop sector is largely a result of inadequate investments due to
low financial returns and an uncertain investment climate. Production of field



-3-
crops has suffered from poor water management, scarcity of farm inputs, lack
of adequate farm power for tillage, poor extension services, marketing and
credit facilities and from a system of controls and subsidies which reduced
farmer incentive. Measures taken during the past few years to increase field
crop output have included: increases in guaranteed price levels; lifting of
controls on movement of paddy; banning imports of subsidiary crops such as
chillies, onions, potatoes and pulses; establishment of Agricultural Pro-
ductivity Committees (APCs) to improve the supply of farm inputs and support-
ing services, and most importantly, an increased emphasis on efficient water
utilization and management.
2.05      Irrigation in Sri Lanka dates back to about 600 B.C., when a series
of village tanks for local rainwater storage were constructed in the north.
Over the last century, many of these tanks have been reconditioned and incor-
porated into new irrigation systems. Currently, about 900,000 ac, throughout
the island, are irrigated and efforts are continuing to expand the area. In
addition, the Government has undertaken a number of multipurpose water develop-
ment projects, including the Gal Oya, Uda Walowe and Mahaweli Ganga.
The Mahaweli Development Scheme
2.06      The Mahaweli Ganga is Sri Lanka's largest river, draining an area
of about 4,000 sq mi. It rises in the mountainous south-central part of the
island, which receives an annual rainfall of 175-200 inches, and discharges
an average of about 7 M ac-ft annually into the Bay of Bengal. It is the
principal source of water for irrigation in the dry zone. The Master Plan for
Mahaweli Development, formulated by a UNDP/FAO team in 1968 envisages: provi-
sion of irrigation to about 650,000 ac of undeveloped land; improvement in the
water supply to and partial rehabilitation of about 250,000 ac of existing
irrigated land; and development of about 510 MW of hydropower from multipur-
pose reservoirs. It would also create the potential for a further development
of about 460 MW of hydropower in single purpose reservoirs. As a result of
the great importance attached to increased food production, the emphasis in
the present implementation program is on irrigation, leaving much of the power
development to later stages.
2.07      Construction of Stage I of the Master Plan began with Bank Group
assistance in 1972 and is now nearly completed. It consists of a transbasin
diversion from the Mahaweli Ganga at Polgolla to the present project area,
provision for an assured water supply to some 130,000 ac of existing irrigated
lands and a 40 MW power station. Stage II works, which would utilize water di-
verted by Stage I to provide irrigation to 71,000 ac of new land, were started
in 1974. So far, irrigation infrastructure has been completed for 6,100 ac
and work is in progress on 24,600 ac. The proposed project would complete
Stage II, and provide agricultural extension services to the 71,000 ac as
well as to 35,000 ac of adjacent irrigated lands.
Settlement Schemes
2.08      Since the turn of the century, many settlement schemes have been
introduced to relieve overpopulation and unemployment in the more densely



- 4 -
populated areas of the wet zone. During the late 1950s and early 1960s,
settlers were admitted to the schemes prior to land development and were left
to do this work themselves. This resulted in a slow build up of benefits, a
wasteful use of water and a high drop-out rate. On the recommendation of an
FAO/IBRD Mission in 1966, some major colonization schemes were reorganized as
"Special Projects" under Resident Project Managers in order to increase agri-
cultural productivity and utilize irrigation water more efficiently. The
success of these projects, resulted in the extension of the "Special Projects"
program in 1969. However, the expansion has been limited due to the shortage
of qualified and experienced managers.
2.09      In recent years, the Government has also experimented with collec-
tive farming and self management in low cost programs such as Youth Settle-
ment Schemes, Cooperative Farms and District Development Council Schemes. An
assessment of all these schemes, made by the Agrarian Research and Training
Institute (ARTI) in 1974, showed that few of them have been successful in
achieving the desired objectives due to inadequate supporting services, in-
appropriate settler selection, lack of competent management and insecure
tenure.
Rural Institutions and Legal Framework
2.10      During the early 1970s, rural institutions underwent a drastic
change. A number of laws were enacted to increase agricultural productivity
and to achieve a more equitable income distribution. The Agricultural Pro-
ductivity Law (APL) of 1972 and the Agricultural Lands Law (ALL) of 1973
established the Agricultural Productivity Committees (APCs) and reorganized
the Cultivation Committees (CCs). The APL obliges all owners and occupiers
of agricultural land to use it to the maximum benefit of the country and
provides for dispossession from owners or tenants who do not properly utilize
their land. The ALL regulates tenants' rights and provides for security of
tenure and prescribes rents payable to landlords.
2.11      The APCs have the responsibility to promote, coordinate and develop
agriculture in the areas they cover (typically 10,000 ac) and to assist the
Ministry of Agriculture and Lands (MAL) in formulating and implementing annual
programs for crop and livestock production. They are directly responsible,
through the CCs (each covering about 1,000 ac), for the water distribution
below the 50 ac level. Because of their power to regulate cropping patterns,
the APCs also have a responsibility for the overall water allocation within
their areas. The APCs and the CCs, whose members are appointed by the MAL,
do not have any professional staff. They work through, in cooperation with,
and to a large extent under the supervision of the Government's technical
staff. The most important task of an APC is the preparation of the Annual
Production Program, which is done in consultation with the Government's agri-
cultural officers. The program is then subject to the approval of MAL and
the District Government Agent. In this process the APC represents the far-
mers' interests, while the Government staff provides the technical input and
assures the feasibility of the program.

III. THE PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The project area is located in Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Matale
Districts in north-central Sri Lanka. The proposed project would cover a con-
tiguous area of 106,000 ac; comprising 35,000 ac of old irrigated land, 30,700
ac presently under development and 40,300 ac of undeveloped or new land (Map
11908R and Annex 1, para 2). The estimated population in the project area is
about 140,000, with an average family size of 5.5 persons. All project com-
ponents would be provided to the main project area of 40,300 ac. The other
areas would benefit only from selected project components.
Climate (Annex 1)
3.02      Climate is tropical with mean monthly temperatures ranging from
76 F°to 83 F, making it suitable for year round cropping. Mean annual rain-
fall is about 56 inches and almost two-thirds of that occurs during the maha
season (October to January). The unpredictability of the rainfall makes irri-
gation necessary for high and stable yields in the maha season. Cultivation
during the yala season (March to June) depends almost entirely on irrigation.
Topography and Soils
3.03      The project area is characterized by gently undulating topography
with slopes ranging from 1% to 5%, with an average of about 1.5% to 2% over
the greater part of the area. Two soil types predominate: (i) reddish brown,
moderately coarse, highly permeable soils, located on uplands with rolling
topography and (ii) brown to grey-brown, finer and poorly drained bottom land
soils with higher silt and clay content. All the soils are slightly acidic.
The reddish brown soils that occupy about 60% of the area are best suited
for the production of upland crops, while the bottom soils (about 40% of the
area) are ideal for paddy production.
Socio-Economic Conditions
3.04      The old irrigated areas consist primarily of settlement schemes
established between 1946 and 1964, with a population of approximately 70,000.
The farm sizes range from 2.0 to 5.0 ac, with an average of about 3.0 ac. In
the areas presently under development, irrigation infrastructure was completed
for 6,100 ac and about 2,300 families were settled during 1976. Irrigation
works are in progress on the remaining 24,600 ac. The existing population in
these areas is about 33,000. In the 6,100 ac area that has already been
settled, the farm size is uniformly 2.5 ac of farm land and 0.5 ac of home-
stead. In the remaining areas, the present situation is very similar to that
in the main project area.



-6-
3.05      The main project area is sparsely populated with an estimated pop-
ulation of about 37,000. Most of the settlements are purana (old) villages
with a traditional pattern of clustered homesteads next to a small village
tank. In recent years, a considerable number of migrants have moved into the
area and begun cultivating public land. The main occupation is subsistance
farming, with about 20% of the labor force permanently engaged outside agri-
culture. Farm incomes are low and only about one-third of the families derive
all their income from the family farm. Most of the purana families cultivate
both paddy (1.5 ac) and chena --rotational slash and burn--(0.5 ac) and have
a fairly large homestead lot (1.0 ac) where they grow tree crops, chillies and
vegetables. The more recently settled families in the area tend to cultivate
homestead (1.0 ac) and chena (1.6 ac) land only.
3.06      The land tenure situation in the purana villages is complicated.
Most of the tank irrigated paddy lands with traditional ownership rights have
been inherited and subdivided from one generation to another, which has re-
sulted in small and fragmented holdings. A small number of families lease
their paddy land from the Government at a nominal rent. This land can be
inherited but not sold, mortgaged, or fragmented. About 80% of the paddy
land is cultivated by the owner. The remainder is rented under a variety of
arrangements such as share cropping, cash lease or fixed rent paid in kind.
The rent varies substantially from a fixed 6 bu per ac in some cases to half
the produce in about 50% of the cases. About three-quarters of all the land
-- almost exclusively upland area -- is owned by the Government. The peasants
can farm this land with annual permits. However, in most cases, cultivation
is practiced without permit.
Land Use and Farming Practices
3.07      On the old irrigated lands paddy is virtually the only crop grown
in the maha season (yield: 1.4 tons/ac) and it accounts for about 90% of
the cultivated area in the yala season (yield: 1.2 tons/ac). The cropping
intensity is about 150%, with 80% to 90% in maha and 60% to 70% in yala. The
areas where construction is underway are in transition, their pre-development
(i.e. pre-1974) situation was similar to that existing in the main project
area. Most of the main project area is covered by jungle, varying from dense
to light scrub. Irrigated, low yield paddy (0.8 tons/ac in maha and 0.7 tons/
ac in yala) is grown mostly on lowlands around village tanks (about 5,000 ac
in maha and 1,000 ac in yala, see Annex 11). Sowing of maha crops starts in
October/ November, after the tanks have been filled to a level deemed adequate
to ensure the water supply for the crop. Because of inadequate farm power for
land preparation and the priority given to chena cultivation, the sowing is
extended into late January. The crop is harvested between February and April.
Subject to water availability in the tanks, yala paddy is broadcast during
March/April for harvest in June/ July. Broadcasting is preferred to trans-
planting, but row seeding, particularly in the yala season, is becoming more
popular as it allows easier weed control.



3.08      Cereals (maize, sorghum and finger millet), pulses (cow peas,
green and black grams), and chillies are grown under rainfed conditions on
the non-irrigated highlands and under chena cultivation in the maha season.
Sesamum is grown in the yala season. The area cultivated under rainfed
conditions is about 8,000 ac. Coconuts, bananas, and vegetables are grown
on the homestead lots.
Agricultural Supporting Services (Annex 4)
3.09      Marketing and Processing.  The PMB has a legal monopoly over paddy
purchase with the cooperatives as sole agents. However, with the recent
removal of legal restrictions on the movement of paddy, the activities of
private traders have increased and they have purchased a large part of the
1975 crop. The milling is done primarily by private mills under contracts
with PMB. It is expected, however, that PMB would continue to play an import-
ant role in paddy marketing and milling. Existing milling and storage facil-
ities are adequate for present demand. Other crops (chillies, cereals and
pulses) are mostly marketed through private channels.
3.10      Farm Equipment.  About two-thirds of land preparation is done by
bullocks and the remainder by four-wheel and, to some extent, two-wheel trac-
tors. The four-wheel tractors are usually owned by licensed tractor operators
who move over a large part of northern Sri Lanka in pace with the varied plow-
ing season. Two-wheel tractors are owned primarily by well-to-do farmers.
3.11      Agricultural Extension and Research.  Extension suffers from a
shortage of vehicles, equipment and staff quarters as well as the absence of
a well-defined, goal-oriented work program. Following IDA recommendations,
the project area (106,000 ac) was recently organized into a separate extension
district under a Project Agricultural Extension Officer (PAEO). Additional
staff is being recruited. A regional training center designed to train staff
and contact farmers is located in the project area at Maha Illuppallama, where
research on crop and cropping systems for the dry zone is concentrated. Rice
breeding is conducted at the nearby Batalagoda station, which has produced a
number of good modern varieties. Research findings have been successfully
applied to two irrigated pilot schemes within the project area.
3.12      Cash Inputs.  Seeds are distributed by the extension service and
varieties adaptable to all climatic zones and seasons are generally avail-
able. Fertilizers are primarily distributed through the branch cooperatives
in the villages and agro-chemicals principally through the private sector.
However, some APCs have also started to sell these inputs. The supply of
fertilizer is usually sufficient to meet the demand, but deliveries are not
always timely. Pesticides and herbicides are generally available but there
is a shortage of application equipment. Institutional credit is provided
through the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank. However, about 85% of the
short- and medium-term credit is provided by private sources. Due to inade-
quately trained field staff, lack of supervision and poor credit discipline,
the recovery rates on institutional credit are, generally, low (about 50%).



-8-
Transport
3.13      As in most parts of Sri Lanka, the project area has a good trans-
portation network. The main railroads from Colombo to Jaffna and Trincomalee
pass through the project area. The area is served by good all-weather
asphalted roads. The secondary roads are usually graded and many are
gravelled. However, the village and farm roads are often nothing more than
tracks and are usually impassable during the wet season. The area is served
by regular bus service.
Social Services (Annex 5)
3.14      Education and health care in Sri Lanka are generally considered
good compared with other countries in South Asia and the existing population
in the project area is well served in these respects. Primary schools are
usually within easy walking distance. Health services are provided by a
network of medical institutions. Other public services are also adequate for
the needs of the present population.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Concept
4.01      The proposed project would complete the first major integrated dev-
elopment of new lands under the Mahaweli Master Plan. It builds on experiences
gained from both the on-going Mahaweli works and previous settlement schemes
in Sri Lanka (paras 2.08-2.09). The project is of a pattern that can be repli-
cated in the future. Primary considerations in project design have been:
(a) Optimal use of the available water resources to increase
food production and to maximize farm incomes. This would
be achieved through the provision of irrigation and drain-
age facilities for each farm with adequate control struc-
tures, lining of critical canal sections and proper land
preparation.
(b) Equitable distribution of project benefits through settle-
ment on uniform 2.5 ac farms.
(c) Development of a spirit of self-reliance among settlers.
This would be achieved by letting the farmers do most of
the on-farm works in return for payments from MDB. The land
would be sold to the settlers, with secure tenure, at a
price which, in nominal terms, would recover about 60% of
the cost for irrigation and land development works.
(d) Provision of well organized, highly intensive extension
services in order to train the settlers in new and improved
farming techniques.



(e) Creation of settlements that are socially and economically
viable through the provision of basic social infrastructure
and agricutural supporting services. Especially in the
selection of settlers, preference would be given to the
population living in and around the project area to retain
existing social links and to maintain a culturally homogeneous
population. Following the traditional village pattern, the
settlements would be grouped into small neighborhood units
(hamlets) each with a population of about 100 families.
(f) Strong coordination at the project level would be achieved
through the appointment of a Resident Project Manager (RPM)
assisted by Deputy RPMs for Agriculture, Community Development
and Engineering. Community participation in planning and
implementation would be supported through a close coordina-
tion between farmers' organizations and project officers.
Project Components
4.02      Since the development throughout the project area is not uniform,
the various components of the project would cover different areas as shown in
the table below. The table also shows the number of families benefitted and
the investment cost per family for each project component.

Irrigation and Land Development (Annex 3)
4.03      Irrigation Infrastructure.  The first 18 mi of the new 28 mi Kalawewa
RB Main Canal are under construction and the remaining 10 mi would be con-
structed under the project. Four large tanks along the canal route would be
improved and would serve as equalizing reservoirs to reduce operational losses
along the canal. Eight branch canals, 31 mi in total length, would take off
from the main canal to serve the project area. About 250 mi of distributary



- 11 -
canals and 400 mi of field channels would convey irrigation water to the irri-
gation turnouts.   Operation and maintenance roadways would be provided along
one embankment of the main, branch and distributary canals. About 10 mi of
natural main drains would be improved and 100 mi of secondary and 110 mi of
tertiary drains constructed. All canals would have structures necessary to
properly control and measure irrigation deliveries throughout the project area,
giving the system considerable flexibility and high operational efficiency.
4.04      On-farm Development Works.  The agricultural and settlement areas
would be cleared of trees and brush and cross ripped by heavy tractors. The
MDB would plow all areas when the settlers arrive to assist them in leveling
work and in construction of soil conservation bunds.- About 1,500 mi of farm
ditches and drains would provide water distribution and drainage to each 2.5
ac farm within the turnout area.
4.05      Construction and O&M Equipment and Facilities.  Because of the
general shortage of heavy construction equipment and vehicles in Sri Lanka,
construction equipment and vehicles would be provided to complete the civil
works in accordance with the project implementation schedule. Equipment would
also be provided for a construction workshop to be set up in the project area.
To ensure that the irrigation works would be properly operated and maintained,
new equipment and O&M facilities (workshop, offices and staff quarters) would
be provided for this purpose.
Production Support (Annex 4)
4.06      Agricultural Extension and Research.  Agricultural extension serv-
ices would be reorganized and strengthened under the project. The number of
field extension workers (KVSs) would increase from about one per 500 farm
families to one per 250 families. This intensity would permit scheduled
weekly visits by the KVS to small farmer groups, along the lines successfully
adopted in a number of Bank Group financed projects in India. The project
would provide vehicles, staff quarters and demonstration equipment. The
Regional Agricultural Training Center at Maha Illuppallama, designed to train
extension staff and farmers, would be provided with additional equipment,
teaching aids, staff quarters and dormitory accommodations. A new Irrigation
and Water Management Pilot Project, jointly sponsored by MDB and the Irriga-
tion and Agriculture Departments, would be set up in the project area to in-
vestigate water management and cropping patterns. The scheme would also be
used as a demonstration area for extension workers and contact farmers.
4.07      Farm Equipment.  Since there is a severe shortage of farm power in
the project area -- both animals and tractors -- 300 four-wheel and 1,200 two-
wheel tractors with farm implements would be provided under the project. In
addition, 50 power sprayers and 1,300 hand sprayers would be provided for
plant protection.
4.08      Storage, Marketing and Processing.  Existing facilities in the pro-
ject area would be inadequate for handling the increased agricultural produc-
tion generated by the project. The following facilities would be provided:



- 12 -
(i) storage facilities for fertilizer, seed and paddy in each of the 50 vil-
lage centers; (ii) buildings for three new primary multipurpose cooperatives
and 24 new branch cooperatives and funds for the renovation of 26 existing
branch buildings. Vehicles (for transport of inputs and paddy) and some minor
equipment for the three primary cooperatives in the area; and (iii) buildings,
plant and equipment for a PMB processing complex (with a milling capacity of
1,000 tons per month and 5,000 tons of storage), 50 rice hullers and 25
thresher/winnowers for the Cultivation Committees in the project area.
4.09.     Market Roads.  To allow all-weather access throughout the project
area, some 50 mi of existing link roads would be improved and 25 mi of new
link roads would be constructed.  The 310 mi of O&M roads along the canals
would also be used by the farmers for transport.
Social Infrastructure (Annex 5)
4.10      Existing social facilities are adequate for the present population,
but, additional facilities would be essential for the 14,000 new families to
be settled in the area. The project would provide: (i) Schools -- about 600
classrooms in primary schools (grades one to nine) and 20 classrooms in
secondary schools (grades 10-11) with laboratories, playgrounds and staff
quarters. (ii) Medical Facilities -- two rural hospitals and two central dis-
pensaries and maternity wards together with vehicles, equipment and staff
quarters; (iii) Community Development Facilities -- about 50 small community
halls for village meetings, training sessions and recreation; and vehicles
and housing for community development staff; (iv) Village Wells -- a total of
1,235 wells for domestic use -- about one per 20 families; and (v) Roads in
New Villages -- some 200 mi of 15 ft-wide graded and unmetalled roads inside
the new hamlets and villages.
Other Project Components
4.11      Settlement (Annex 10).  Each settler would receive materials for a
temporary hut, seeds and planting material for his first crops, field tools
and a subsistence allowance of Rs 50 per month for five months. This assist-
ance would amount to about Rs 680 per family. In addition, the new settlers
would receive, for a period of one year, free food rations from the World
Food Program (WFP). The GOSL expects that the present agreement between GOSL
and WFP will be extended beyond the expiration date of March 1977. Equipment
and vehicles would be provided to the settlement staff.
4.12      Technical Assistance.  The project would provide the services of an
implementation advisor and an on-farm development specialist for a period of
three years each (Annex 9). An assurance was obtained that these two spe-
cialists would be appointed by January 1, 1978.
4.13      Monitoring Project Performance.  The project would include a program
to monitor irrigation efficiencies and to assess the agricultural, economic
and social impact of the project (Annex 9, Appendix 2). Funds would be pro-
vided for:  installation of about 50 flow recording stations; vehicles and
equipment; the service of one hydrologist for 12 months; and agro-economic
surveys by the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI).

Implementation Schedule (Annex 9, Figure 3)
4.14      Construction work in the project area is ongoing and under MDB's
present rate of implementation irrigation infrastructure and settlement would
be completed within three years; social infrastructure, within four years; and
on-farm works, within five years. It is expected that the project would be
fully implemented by June 1982. In order to ensure a well-planned settlement
process, an assurance was obtained that no settlers would be brought into an
area earlier than three months before the expected delivery of water to the
area.
Engineering
4.15      Field surveys have been completed and detailed maps for the layout
of the irrigation distribution and drainage systems are scheduled for comple-
tion during 1977. For farm layout and design of the irrigation and drainage
system within turnout areas, surveys would be made after clearing of forested
areas. Detailed design of major irrigation works were started by MDB in
January 1976 and would be completed during 1977. Design of works below the
field turnouts, each of which commands about 50 ac, would be done by the proj-
ect engineering office. All designs are in accordance with sound engineering
standards.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality (Annex 2)
4.16      Supply.  The water supply would come from:  (i) irrigation diver-
sions from the Mahaweli Ganga, which have priority over power releases through
facilities provided by Stage I of the Mahaweli Development Scheme; (ii) local
runoff collected by the major tanks within the project area, and (iii) return
flow from irrigation in the upper reaches of the project. About 60% of the
demand would be met by Mahaweli diversions, 25% by local yield and the remain-
der by return flow. An average of about 7.5 ft of water would be available
annually for irrigation over the entire project area.
4.17      Demand.  Water requirements, estimated by the Modified Penman method,
were based on a cropping pattern planned for maximum use of rainfall, as shown
in Annex 11, Figure 1. The irrigation demands for the Kandalama and Kalawewa
command areas would average about 765 MCM (620,000 ac-ft) annually. This would
amount to about 7.0 ft/yr for the gross service area (88,500 ac). The full
irrigation requirements would be supplied in about eight years out of ten and
irrigation shortages in the water deficient years would range from about 5% to
15%. Irrigation deliveries would be rotated between farms and between farm
channels and the smaller distributary canals, in accordance with irrigation
schedules developed during each crop season. This would permit the farmers to
irrigate more effectively than would be possible under continuous flow irriga-
tion practices.
4.18      Quality.  The waters of the Mahaweli Ganga and Amban Ganga are of
excellent quality for irrigation. Tanks within the project area have water
of slightly lower but satisfactory quality for irrigation.



- 14 -
Environmental Effects
4.19      Schistosomiasis does not occur in Sri Lanka and the principal water-
related disease in the area is malaria. The increased water storage in major
tanks, as a result of the project would be more than compensated by a substan-
tial reduction in the number of small village tanks, which are a more suitable
habitat for mosquitoes. The improvement of natural drains would remove tail-
water from the fields which stagnates in borrow areas and low spots. As a
precautionary measure, an assurance was obtained from GOSL that it would
institute a malaria monitoring program, and if necessary, take appropriate
preventive and remedial measures in the project area. The extension of the
irrigation season into the dry season would improve the recharge of village
wells and thus improve the domestic water supply. The net effect of the
project on public health and environment would be favorable.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
Project Cost Estimates
5.01      Total project costs are estimated at US$100.5 M equivalent, including
about US$20.5 M in taxes and duties. The foreign exchange component would be
about US$32.6 M or 41% of the total, net of taxes and duties. Costs estimates
are based on contracts recently awarded for similar ongoing works in the proj-
ect area and have been adjusted to the January 1977 level. Unit prices for
equipment and materials are based on January 1977 price quotations of suppliers.
Based on past experience, costs for administration, design and construction
supervision are estimated to be about 10% of construction costs. Physical con-
tingencies were estimated at: (i) 20% for irrigation infrastructure, reflect-
ing the lack of detailed mapping and field location of the distribution system
at the time of estimate; (ii) 15% for market roads; and (iii) 10% for social
infrastructure, stores and buildings as well as the monitoring program since
these requirements are fairly well defined. Price contingencies are estimated
at about 31% of the base cost estimate including taxes and duties in accord-
ance with the following anticipated annual inflation rates:
1977-1979     1980-81
Civil Works                      12%           10%
Equipment and Services            8%            7%

Financing
5.02      With assistance from the Bank Group, GOSL has tentatively secured
about US$23.2 M equivalent in bilateral financing for the project:
Country            Amount                   Terms
Canada             US$6.0 M    Loan.  No interest, repayment over
(Parallel                      50 years including ten years' grace.
financing)                    Tied procurement of equipment.
The Netherlands   US$5.0 M    Loan.  2-1/2% interest, repayment over
(Joint financing)              30 years including eight years' grace.
UK                 US$7.2 M    Grant.  Tied procurement of equipment.
(Parallel
financing)
US                 US$5.0 M    Loan.  3% interest, (2% during grace
(Parallel                      period), repayment over 40 years
financing)                     including ten years' grace.  Tied pro-
curement of equipment.
5.03      The above bilateral assistance combined with the proposed IDA con-
tribution of US$19.0 M would finance the full foreign exchange costs and
about 20% of local costs, or about 53% of the total project cost net of taxes
and duties. Commercial Banks and the buyers of farm equipment would provide
about US$9.7 M for financing the farm equipment. The Government would con-
tribute the remaining US$28.1 M. A condition of credit effectiveness would
be the prior or simultaneous effectiveness of agreements with the co-financiers.
An assurance was obtained that GOSL would provide adequate funds to the
agencies concerned for project implementation and that it would submit to IDA,
no later than November 1 each year, a detailed implementation and financial
plan for the following fiscal year.
Procurement
5.04      Equipment.  The estimated cost of equipment and vehicles (Annex 6)
is US$26.3 M including import taxes and duties (US$8.6 M) local handling costs
US$2.4 M and locally procured equipment (US$0.2 M). Most of the equipment and
vehicles would be furnished by the co-financiers, as indicated on the equipment
lists, in accordance with their procurement guidelines. The remainder would
be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or prevailing customs duty
if lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in evaluation of bids.
Small off-the-shelf items costing less than US$10,000 for each order, and for
which international tendering is not practical for international tendering,
would be purchased through GOSL standard procedures which are satisfactory to
IDA. Such purchases, however, would be limited to an aggregate total of
US$250,000.



- 17 -
5.05      Civil Works.  Because most civil works would be labor-intensive,
relatively small, restricted to seasonal construction, scattered over a wide
area and could not be grouped into large contracts, they would be unsuitable
for ICB. The private sector in Sri Lanka has very limited capacity for civil
works construction. On the other hand, a number of public agencies have sub-
stantial experience in this type of work. Therefore, part of the works would
be awarded to private contractors after local competitive bidding (LCB) and
the remainder to public agencies under negotiated contracts.
5.06      An agreement has been reached that the award of contracts to public
agencies would be governed by the following conditions: (i) unit prices would
not exceed those in the lowest evaluated LCB bid for similar work; (ii) all
contractors would meet prequalification standards acceptable to IDA; (iii)
IDA would approve all public sector contracts before they are awarded, with
the exception of contracts below US$50,000 up to an aggregate of US$500,000
and (iv) the role of the Department of Machinery and Equipment (DME) would
be restricted to procurement, renting, repair and maintenance of equipment.
5.07      The following categories have been established for the construction
of the various project works: 1/
(a) Kalawewa Main Canal, Branch Canals and Village Tanks
(US$3.7 M). In view of the limited capacity of the
private sector, about 50% of these works would be
awarded to private contractors under LCB and 50%
would be awarded to public agencies under negotia-
ted contracts. The LCB contracts would be advertised
locally in accordance with standard Government pro-
cedures, which are satisfactory to IDA;
(b) Distributary Canals, Drainage Channels and On-Farm Develop-
ment (US$13.8 M). These works would be carried out following
LCB or would be let on a unit price basis to small village
contractors;
(c) Land Clearing and Preparation (US$11.2 M). The initial
clearing of brush and trees up to 6 ft girth would be
awarded on a unit area basis following LCB or by unit
price contracts established at the beginning of each
construction season following LCB. Works requiring
heavy equipment would be allocated on an overall 50:50
ratio to private contractors after LCB and public agencies
under negotiated contracts. Because of the need to time
the work to coincide with land preparation carried out
1/   Amounts shown are basic costs net of land acquisition costs and
physical and price contingencies and administration and engineering
staff costs (Annex 7).



- 18 -
by the settlers, initial plowing would be carried out
under force account. Land leveling, grading and con-
struction of soil conservation bunds generally would
be carried out by the settlers on a contract basis.
The MDB would carry out work not completed by the
setters.
(d) Roads, Social Infrascructure and Buildings (US$9.2 M).
Most of these works would be constructed under LCB in
accordance with standard Government procedures. How-
ever, about 50% of the buildings would be constructed
by public agencies under negotiated contracts.
5.08      The categories above have been established to utilize, as far as
possible, the Sri Lanka's available construction capacity. It also provides
a means for controlling the cost of negotiated contracts. The total amount
of work under negotiated contracts would be about US$8.5 M or about 24% of
the total civil works cost. Force account work would amount to about
US$0.6 M. The remainder (US$28.7 M) would be awarded to the private sector.
Disbursement
5.09      Disbursements from the IDA Credit would be made for:  (i) 100% of
the foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment, vehicles and spares;
(ii) 50% of local expenditures for imported equipment, vehicles and spares
procured locally; (iii) 100% of the ex-factory price of goods manufactured
locally; (iv) 100% of foreign expenditures for technical assistance and the
monitoring program; (v) 25% of local expenditures for irrigation infrastruc-
ture and roads, and (vi) 47% of local expenditures for social infrastructure
and buildings. Disbursements for force account work under item (v) above
would be made against a certificate of expenditure from GOSL. The documenta-
tion for this would be retained by GOSL and made available for inspection
during project supervision. All other disbursements would be made against
full documentation. The estimated schedule of expenditures, the proposed
allocation of the aid package and an annual disbursement schedule are pre-
sented in Annex 8. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by
December 1982, about six months after completion of the project. Any funds
remaining in the credit account after completion of the project would be can-
celled unless, subject to IDA's concurrence, suitable project related ex-
penditures can be identified.
Accounts and Audits
5.10      An assurance was obtained from GOSL that MDB and other organiza-
tions responsible for implementing any part of the project would prepare and
maintain separate project accounts and financial statements on project ex-
penditures and recoveries thereon, in accordance with sound accounting prac-
tices. Such accounts and financial statements would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Certified copies of the audited
accounts and the auditor's reports would be submitted to IDA within six
months of the end of each fiscal year.



- 19 -
Cost Recovery (Annex 12)
5.11      The prime vehicle for recovery of capital costs for the project
would be the Sale of State Lands Law under which the land would be sold to
the settlers. The sales prices would cover the cost of on-farm works and of
special assistance to the settlers. At present, the price is estimated at
Rs 8,880 per family (Rs 3,550 per ac of farm land). Paid over 20 years at 4%
interest, this would require an annual charge of Rs 650 per farm (Rs 260 per
ac) in current terms.
5.12      The O&M costs for the irrigation infrastructure would be recovered
through the Land Betterment Charges Law (LBCL). The'LBCL will, inter alia,
enable the Government to impose water charges in irrigation and drainage
schemes taking into account factors such as amount and dependability of water
supplies, increases in agricultural production, capital and O&M costs. For
the project, GOSL intends to collect a betterment charge of at least Rs 30 per
ac which would be increased gradually over five years to cover full O&M costs
of irrigation works above the field turnout (Rs 80 per ac). An assurance
was obtained that, by January 1, 1978 the Government would complete all
administrative and other measures necessary for imposition and collection
of appropriate charges on all publicly financed water development projects.
5.13      The proposed level of charges, which would give a cost recovery
index of 33% (excluding relevant sunk costs) and rent recovery indexes of 28%
and 33% for upland and lowland farms respectively, is considered appropriate
for the project since: (i) the per capita income of the settlers presently is
below the critical consumption level and would only reach the national average
after full development; (ii) GOSL's present pricing policies for foodgrains
and subsidiary crops are biased against the agricultural sector, and (iii) in
the past, GOSL has not charged for irrigation and there would be considerable
opposition from farmers if the charges were perceived as "too high". An
assurance was obtained that, every three years, GOSL would review, and if
necessary, revise the level of charges to ensure adequate recovery of O&M
costs and as much as possible of the construction costs within the ability
of the farmers to pay in accordance with a cost recovery plan acceptable to
IDA.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Mahaweli Development Board (MDB)
6.01      The MDB was established in 1970 to plan and implement the develop-
ment of Mahaweli Ganga's water resources. It is an agency under the Ministry
of Irrigation, Power and Highways (MIPH), well staffed with experienced tech-
nical personnel, and financed by regular GOSL budget appropriations. The
Board would have overall responsibility for project implementation and settle-
ment as well as agricultural development and the operation and maintenance of
the completed irrigation system. To strengthen its capability in settlement
and agricultural planning and implementation, GOSL intends to appoint an
Additional General Manager (Operations). The present General Manager (GM)
would retain engineering design and construction responsibilities (Annex 9,



- 20 -
Figure 1). The Additional GM (Operations) would be assisted by three Deputy
GMs -- Agriculture, Settlement and Community Development, and Irrigation O&M.
The position of Additional GM (Operations) has been established and his ap-
pointment would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
Project Planning
6.02      The MDB is responsible for planning all aspects  of development in
the project area including irrigation, agriculture, marketing, storage, health
and education. To ensure coordination between 11DB and the specialized depart-
ments that would operate these facilities, GOSL has set up working level tech-
nical subcommittees (TSCs) for sectors other than irrigation. Each TSC is
headed by the Director of the specialized department, with concerned MDB and
department staff as members. The Additional GM (Operations) of MDB would
coordinate the work of the TSCs. At the policy level, a Mahaweli Coordination
Committee (MCC) has been established, chaired by the Secretary, MIPH, with
Directors of the specialized departments, the chairman of the MDB and the
Implementation Advisor (Annex 9, Appendix 1) as members. The committee is
responsible for interagency coordination and for resolving any conflicts
arising at the TSCs.
Project Implementation
6.03      Civil Works and Buildings.  The MDB would be responsible for imple-
menting all civil works and the construction of all buildings through its
Deputy General Manager (Construction). Two field construction offices, each
headed by a Chief Project Engineer, would be responsible for the design of
minor structures, distributary canals, field channels and drains, and con-
struction supervision within their area of operation (typically about 20,000
ac). After the completion of roads and buildings, they would be handed over
to the specialized departments concerned.
6.04      Construction and O&M Equipment.  The MDB would be assisted by the
Department of Machinery and Equipment (DME) in MIPH, in preparing procurement
documents for all construction and O&M equipment. Sri Lanka Trading (Tractor)
Corporation (SLTC) would import all the equipment, including that required by
by private firms that have been awarded contracts, since it is the sole autho-
rized agency for such works. The availability of the required equipment would
be specified by GOSL in the bid documents and the contractors would get an
advance from MDB to buy the equipment from SLTC. The DME would make available
the repair facilities to private contractors. However, contractors would have
the option to select other repair facilities. Public sector agencies that
would carry out part of the works under negotiated contracts would rent the
equipment from DME which is the central pool for machinery and equipment used
for construction of civil works in Sri Lanka.
6.05      Agricultural Extension Services.  The Department of Agriculture
(DA), of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands (MAL), would be responsible
for the reorganization and strengthening of agricultural extension services
in the project area and for the procurement of equipment, vehicles and supplies



- 21 -
for the extension service. Motorcycles and bicycles to be used by the exten-
sion personnel would be sold by DA on terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA. The DA would provide a mileage allowance to the extension staff.
6.06      Farm Tractors and Agricultural Equipment.  The SLTC would procure
farm tractors and implements and distribute them to dealers for resale in
the project area. In line with Government policy, the APCs would buy and
operate some farm equipment on a cooperative basis. However, as the APCs
are relatively new and inexperienced, private custom operators selected and
supervised by the APCs, would play the major role. A condition of sale of
tractors to private operators would be that they agree to do custom work with-
in the project area, as specified by the concerned APCs. Credit for purchase
of farm equipment and implements would be provided by the Bank of Ceylon and
the People's Bank. Terms of lending would be 100% financing for APCs and not
less than 75% financing for private operators at prevailing interest rates
(currently 9% to 10% annually) with repayment over five years. Refinancing
for not less than 75% of the total loans for farm equipment would be made
available by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
6.07      Other Equipment and Vehicles.  The processing equipment (Annex 6,
Table 6) would be imported by SLTC and sold to CCs and cooperatives on the
same terms as farm tractors. No downpayment would be required. The Coop-
erative Development Department, the Paddy Marketing Board and the Depart-
ments of Health and Education would procure the required equipment for their
use.
Field Organization After Project Implementation (Annex 9, Figure 2)
6.08      A proper coordination between agricultural extension, irrigation
and community development officers is vital to the success of the project.
In order to ensure this coordination, a project management team would be
established. This would consist of a Resident Project Manager (RPM), report-
ing directly to the Additional GM (Operations), and Deputy RPMs for (i) Agri-
culture, (ii) Engineering O&M, and (iii) Settlement, Community Development and
Cooperatives. The Project Agricultural Extension Officer (PAEO) would be
responsible for the extension activities within the area (para 3.11) and report
directly to the Deputy Director of Extension in the Department of Agriculture.
The PAEO, ex officio, would be Deputy RPM (Agriculture).
6.09      Because of the APCs' and CCs' future responsibilities for agricul-
tural planning and water allocation (para 2.11), their boundaries should con-
form with the commands and sub-commands of the irrigation system. An assurance
to this effect was obtained from GOSL. The Community Development Officers
(CDOs), who would be responsible for all settlement aspects of the project,
have been given many of the powers of the Government Agent, including broad
supervisory responsibility over the APCs and CCs. The Agricultural Officers
(AOs) would have to fulfill an important function in giving advice to the APCs.
Since the size of the area under one AO and one CDO roughly corresponds to the



- 22 -
area of an APC, the area of responsibility for one AO, one CDO and one Irriga-
tion Engineer would correspond to the area of one APC. These officers would
be located adjacent to the APC office and they would work closely together.
6.10      At the project level, a Project Advisory Committee (PAC) has been
established. (The legal foundation for the PAC is provided in the draft
Irrigation Law.) The RPM would be chairman of the PAC with the three Deputy
RPMs and senior officers from Anuradhapura District (for example, District
Health Officer) as members. The APCs and the Multipurpose Cooperatives (MPCs)
would nominate farmer representatives as members of the PAC.
O&M of Irrigation Works
6.11      Until local institutions have developed sufficient competence, MDB
would have the responsibility for the O&M of the irrigation infrastructure
down to the field turnout. The CCs, acting under the general supervision
of the APC and advised by Irrigation Engineers of MDB as well as AOs, would
be responsible for the maintenance of field channels and for the distribution
of water among the various users on each field channel. The MDB would oversee
the maintenance operations of the CCs and would have the authority to take
over the O&M of field channels if this was not properly done. The cost for
these works would be assessed against the water users and the required charges
would be collected by the District Government Agent.
6.12      As provided under the Agricultural Productivity Law and the Agri-
cultural Lands Law, the APCs, with the assistance of the CCs, would be res-
ponsible for crop planning within their areas (para 2.11). After completion
of the project, the APCs would work with MDB's as well as the DA's field staff
in preparing the proposed cropping and water delivery schedules. With this
information, the MDB would establish the operating calendars for the various
canals and distributaries. In periods of water shortage, the APCs would re-
vise the cropping schedule in accordance with directives issued by the PAC.
Staffing and Funds
6.13      Assurances were obtained from GOSL that:  (i) all irrigation works,
roads and buildings would be maintained in accordance with sound engineering
practices and that adequate staff and funds would be provided for this purpose;
(ii) adequate funds and personnel would be made available for the agricultural
extension services in the project area; and (iii) all schools and medical
centers in the project area would be adequately staffed within one year after
settlement.
Settlement Procedures (Annex 10)
6.14      The Settlement Planning and Development Division of MDB, headed by
the DGM (Settlement) would be responsible for implementing the settlement pro-
gram, which is based on detailed socio-economic surveys. About 24% of the
area is privately owned and would be acquired by GOSL for settlement pur-
poses under the Land Acquisition Act of 1964, with compensation paid to the



- 23 -
owners. The remaining area is State Land. Farm families already residing
in the project area would be given priority in the selection process, with
the exception of a small number of encroachers on State land who moved into
the area after 1970. The balance of the families to be settled would be re-
cruited from nearby areas. The selection would be based on a detailed points
system, with considerable weight given to agricultural experience. Other
criteria determining the priority are tenurial status, age, marital status
and family size. After final selection, each settler would purchase an
allotted 2.5 ac farm and a 0.5 ac homestead under the Sale of State Lands
(Special Provisions) Law of 1973.
VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND FARM INCOMES
General
7.01      The production benefit of the project would principally accrue in
the main project area (about 87%) where a full package of components --
irrigation, on-farm development, production support and social infrastructure
-- would be provided. The cropping patterns and yields throughout the project
area are not uniform at present, since some areas are already irrigated and
some are still underdeveloped (Annex 1, para 2). However, since the climate,
topography and soils are the same, it is projected that, at full development,
the cropping pattern and yields in all areas would be similar (Annex 11).
Agricultural Production
7.02      The project would provide reliable irrigation to both maha and yala
seasons to the main project area, where the crop area would increase from
14,000 ac at present to about 64,000 ac. The lowland soils (40% of the area),
which are suitable only for paddy, would have a cropping intensity of about
185% (95% in maha and 90% in yala). On the upland soils (60% of the area), a
wide range of crops would be grown. These are mostly non-flooded (upland) rice
in the maha and chillies, cereals, pulses and oil crops in the yala season.
The cropping intensity on the upland farms would be about 170% (90% in maha
and 80% in yala). The overall cropping intensity would be 176%.
7.03      With on-farm development, the farmers in the main project area would
be able to effectively control field water application. This, coupled with
improved agricultural extension and other supporting services, would lead to
a rapid build up of yields. Projected yields at full development are estimated
to be at: paddy, 1.4 tons per ac; cereals, 1.0 tons per ac; pulses, 0.5 tons
per ac; chillies, 0.4 tons per ac; and groundnuts/soybeans, 0.75 tons per ac.
The estimated present and projected future (1986) cropping patterns and pro-
duction levels for the main project area are summarized below:

7.04      The areas presently under development would be provided with agri-
cultural supporting services such as farm power and extension. The irrigation
works would be completed by the GOSL without assistance under the proposed
project and the future cropping pattern would be similar to that of the main
project area at full development. The old irrigated area will basically
remain under double irrigated paddy cultivation with a cropping intensity of
150% to 160%. The project would provide extension services to this area which
would not significantly affect the present cropping pattern. It is estimated
that the project would increase foodgrain production in these areas by some
5,600 tons.
Marketing and Prices
7.05      In recent years, Sri Lanka has imported about 50% of its annual
foodgrain requirements of about 1.8 M tons. Despite the Government's empha-
sis on food self-sufficiency, it is likely that Sri Lanka will continue to
be a foodgrain importer for the next decade. At present, the project area
is a rice deficit area. Consequently, the project-related increase of about
42,300 tons of foodgrains at full development would be absorbed readily into
the domestic market. The import ban on pulses and chillies in the early 1970s,
accompanied by a substantial rise in their domestic prices, has reduced signi-
ficantly the per capita consumption of these crops. Thus, the increased
production of pulses and chillies under project conditions would be easily
absorbed by the domestic market. Similarly, no problem is foreseen in mar-
keting the increased production of groundnuts and soybeans in the domestic
market since the demand for vegetable oil is projected to grow rapidly as
a substitute for coconut oil. Prices for economic and financial analyses
are discussed in Annex 13, Appendix 1.
Farm Incomes (Annex 12)
7.06      At present, most farmers in the project area are subsistence ori-
ented. They consume most of their foodgrain and market some chillies and
oilseeds. Non-farm employment such as in construction, transport and
trade is a major source of income during the yala season, when the scarcity



- 25 -
of water prevents the cultivation of subsistence crops. Under project con-
ditions, farm size would be uniform at 2.5 ac but most farmers would be either
on upland (60% of the total) or lowland (40% of the total) soils. Since
different cropping patterns and cultivation methods would be applied, two
farm models have been analyzed. The net farm incomes would be as follows:

Project Rent (Rs)                          -       2,195         2,565
7.07      In the derivation of farm incomes, cash payments for hired labor
and inputs have been charged as production costs. The "future with project"
budgets are based on the assumptions that the farmers would pay on the average
Rs 485 per family in constant 1976 terms for State land at full development
(Annex 12) and the full cost of O&M (Rs 80 per ac) or a total of Rs 565. Pro-
ject rent represents the incremental net income to the farmer when all factors
of production, except water and related services supplied by the project, are
given the rewards that are required for their cooperation.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
General
8.01      Land resources in the sparsely populated northern part of Sri Lanka
are highly underutilized and irrigation is essential for intensified cultiva-
tion. The project would help relieve this major resource constraint and
simultaneously assist the GOSL in achieving three basic development objec-
tives: (i) increase food production which in turn would improve the balance
of payment situation; (ii) reduce high unemployment and underemployment
rates; and (iii) improve income distribution.
Production Benefits
8.02      The production increase, due to the project, is estimated at 42,300
tons of foodgrains, 1,100 tons of chillies and 3,800 tons of oil seeds. The
increased foodgrain production would give net foreign exchange savings of
US$8.0 million (in 1977 dollars) per year.
Employment Effects (Annex 13, Appendix 2)
8.03      Increase in labor requirements would be generated primarily by the
expansion of cultivated area and to a more intensive land use in the main
project area. Taking into account the likely growth in farm employment that



- 26 -
would occur without the project, about 12,000 full time jobs would be created
in agriculture. The provision of farm power to other parts of the proj-
ect area would reduce both labor and irrigation requirements during the land
preparation periods. The water savings would be used to expand the cultivated
area, which would lead to increased labor demand for other operations. It is
estimated that these two effects on the labor demand would roughly balance.
Thus, the overall direct employment affects would largely stem from the pro-
vision of irrigation in the main project area. With an increase in the gross
value of agricultural production of some Rs 150 M, the project would generate
additional income and employment in the local non-farm sectors such as market-
ing, transport, and processing. Based on experience from similar areas in
Asia, this would increase non-farm employment in the order of 9,000 man-years.
Income Distribution
8.04      Most of the future settlers -- whether they already live in the
project area or would come from nearby areas -- are poor subsistence farmers
or landless agricultural laborers. Their present incomes, which are fairly
uniform, are about half the national average. Under the project, they would
be settled, with secure tenure, on 2.5 ac farms and the incomes, at full dev-
elopment (in the mid-1980s), would reach the national average.
Social Benefits
8.05      The benefits from social infrastructure are basically non-quantifia-
ble. Likewise, it has not been possible to quantify the benefits accruing to
other areas where population pressure on scarce land resources would be alle-
viated. However, as demonstrated by the failure of many settlement schemes
in Sri Lanka provision of these components under the project would be essen-
tial for the success of the settlement program and help to achieve the pro-
jected production increases.
Economic Evaluation (Annex 13)
8.06      Most of the investments under the Stage I project, which diverted
Mahaweli water from Polgolla to the Stage II area, were prerequisites for
the present project. Stage I created the potential for subsequent invest-
ments, which would have shorter gestation periods and give relatively high
returns. The sunk costs for the Polgolla diversion do not affect the eco-
nomic viability of the proposed project. However, in order to establish
whether the initial decision to provide irrigation to the Stage II areas was
sound or questionable, sunk costs have been included in the analysis.
8.07      The major components of the project -- irrigation, on-farm develop-
ment and agricultural supporting services -- are interdependent; the benefits
from any one depend on whether the others are implemented. Thus, the compo-
nents have to be evaluated as a package. However, since each component of the
package must be justified in its own right, benefits and costs associated
with each component have, to the extent possible, also been analyzed sepa-
rately. The economic rate of return (ERR) for the basic case (i.e. direct



- 27 -
production benefits from the major components of the project) is estimated
at 21%. If sunk costs are included, the ERR would be 14%. For the whole
package, including social infrastructure and sunk costs, the ERR would be
13%. The ERRs for separate component are presented in Annex 13.
Prolect Risk
8.08      In eight years out of ten, the project would provide sufficient
water for the proposed cropping pattern. Irrigation shortages in water
deficient years would range from 5% to 15%, which would have only a minor
effect on the production. Thus, the risk associated with the water supply is
rather small. The ERR of the project is relatively sensitive to construction
delays and to changes in future prices and yields but not very sensitive to
a slower build up of project benefits. The project would remain viable even
under severely adverse assumptions (a combination of (i) 25% decrease in bene-
fits, (ii) 15% increase in construction costs, (iii) two years delay in proj-
ect completion, and (iv) realization of full benefits delayed four years would
give an ERR of 12%). However, there is a need to carefully monitor and con-
trol project costs and to ensure realization of full project benefits.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      Agreements on the following points have been reached with GOSL:
(a)  An Implementation Advisor and an On-farm Development
Specialist would be appointed by January 1, 1978
(para 4.12);
(b)  no settlers would be brought into an area earlier than
three months before the expected delivery of water to the.
area (para 4.14);
(c)  a malaria monitoring program would be instituted and, if
necessary, appropriate preventive and remedial measures
would be taken in the project area (para 4.19);
(d)  adequate funds to cover all project cost would be provided
to the agencies concerned for project implementation and
that detailed implementation and financial plans for the
following fiscal year would be submitted to IDA not later
than November 1, each year (para 5.03);
(e)  award of contracts to public agencies would be governed by
the following conditions: (i) unit prices would not exceed
those in the lowest evaluated LCB bid for similar work;
(ii) all contractors would meet prequalification standards
acceptable to IDA; (iii) IDA approves all public sector
contracts before they are awarded, with the exception of
contracts below US$50,000 up to an aggregate of US$500,000,



- 28 -
and (iv) the role of the Department of Machinery and Equip-
ment would be restricted to procurement, renting, repair and
maintenance of equipment (para 5.06);
(f) MDB and other organizations responsible for implementing any
part of the project would prepare and maintain separate pro-
ject accounts and financial statements on project expenditures
and recoveries thereon, in accordance with sound accounting
practices. Such accounts would be audited annually by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to IDA. Certified copies of
the audited reports would be submitted to IDA within six
months of the end of each fiscal year (para 5.10);
(g) the Government would complete by January 1, 1978 all adminis-
trative and other measures necessary for imposition and collec-
tion of appropriate charges on all publicly financed water
development projects (para 5.12);
(h) every three years, the Government would review and, if
necessary, revise the level of charges to adequately cover
O&M costs as much as possible of the construction costs,
within the ability of farmers to pay in accordance with a
cost recovery plan acceptable to IDA (para 5.13);
(i) the boundaries of the Agricultural Productivity Committees
and Cultivation Committees would be reorganized to conform
with the commands and sub-commands of the irrigation system
(para 6.09);
(j) all irrigation works, roads and buildings would be maintained
in accordance with sound engineering practices and adequate
staff and funds would be provided for this purpose and for
the agricultural extension services in the project area
(para 6.13); and
(k) all schools and medical centers in the project area would be
adequately staffed within one year after settlement (para 6.13).
9.02      Conditions of Credit Effectiveness would be that:
(a) the agreements with co-financiers have been, or are being
simultaneously, declared effective (para 5.03); and
(b) the Additional GM (Operations) has been appointed (para 6.01).



- 29 -
9.03      With the above agreements and together with the bilateral assistance
of US$23.2 M, the proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$19.0 M
under standard IDA terms. The Borrower would be the Republic of Sri Lanka.

SRI LANKA
MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
The Project Area
General
1.        The project area lies within the Kala Oya basin about 10 mi south-
west of the historic town of Anuradhapura, which is the capital of the north
central province of Anuradhapura and an important road junction. Jaffna,
Trincomalee, Kandy and Colombo are a few of the major towns less than 130 mi
distant by road and rail from Anuradhapura. Some of the important railroads
such as the Colombo-Jaffna and Colombo-Tricomalee lines and two paved primary
roads bisect the main project area. Secondary roads serve remaining portions
of the area.
2.        The proposed project area would cover a contiguous area of 106,000
ac of irrigated and irrigable land and can be divided into five distinct
sub-areas:
Old Irrigated Areas                              Acres      H - blocks /a
Recent Settlement Schemes (1954-1964)    17,500        10, 11, 12

ANNEX 1
Page 2
Topography
3.        The project area is located in the "dry zone" in north central
Sri Lanka, which is characterized by gently undulating or rolling topography
with rough, eroded catchment areas above the more or less flat lowlands. The
area is generally underlain by a substratum of gneiss or quartzic rock at
fairly shallow depths and rock outcrops are exposed in various locations
throughout the area. River valleys, such as the Kala Oya, have incised stream
channels that drain the area effectively. Slopes range from 1% to 5%, with
an average of about 1.5% to 2% over the greater part of the area. Elevations
range from about 200 to 400 ft above mean sea level.
Soils
4.        The soils are residual (i.e. were developed in place), are derived
from an underlain at relatively shallow depths by granites, and are unusually
low in silt content. As a result, infiltration and permeability rates are
high and water holding capacities are low. Erosion in the uplands has re-
sulted in the lowland soils being somewhat finer in texture and lower in
permeability.
5.        Land classification of the commanded areas, done by the soil survey
of Sri Lanka somewhat along the lines of the United States Bureau of Reclama-
tion method, have indicated that there are: no Class I soils; that most of the
high lands, comprising about 60% of those considered irrigable, are Class II
and Class III; and the bottom lands, are in Class IV, which is considered ex-
cellent for paddy.
6.        The soils of the areas are similar in most respects and are composed
of two main types: (1) well-drained, dark brown to reddish brown soils (Red-
dish Brown Earths or Alfisols) on the crests and upper slopes of the undulat-
ing landscapes; and (2) poorly drained, finer, dark brown to dark grey soils
with pseudo-gley and gley horizons (Low humic Gley, Aqualf suborder of
Alfisols).
7.        The reddish brown earths (RBE) occupy about 60% of the area and the
low humic gley soils (LHG) about 40%. The RBE soils are developed on material
derived from the weathered products of the metamorphic rocks and are underlain
by a gravelly sandy clay loam layer 2 to 4 ft below the surface, which in turn
grades into the underlying weathered rocks.
8.        The most important characteristics of the soils of the project
areas, with regard to development and land use, are: (1) high infiltration
and permeability rates, from a low of 0.17 inches per hour (LHG soils) to more
than three inches per hour (RBE soils); (2) low available moisture holding
capacities (1.2 to 1.6 inShes per foot of soil); (3) high bulk densities
mostly 1.6 to 1.7 gram/cm ); and (4) very low silt contents. The soil clays
31



ANNEX 1
Page 3
are mostly of the non-expanding type (illite and kaolinite), the pH ranges
from 6 to 7, the exchange complex is 80% to 90% base saturated, the silica:
sequioxide ratio is about three, the exchange capacity is 0.5 to 0.6 meq per
gram of clay and the exchange capacities range from 4 to 20 meq/100 grams.
There are some salt and alkali accumulations in low spots where the drainage
is completely blocked. The organic matter content of the surface layer ranges
from 1% to 5% and averages about 2%. Nitrogen and available phosphorus are
low and potash is moderate.
9.        The infiltration rates of the upland soils are above one inch an
hour and of the LHG soils from 0.1 to 1 inch per hour. Thus, water-logged
conditions can exist in either of these soil types only where the drainage
outlets are blockecd. Since the soils retain a relatively small amount of
the water that is available for plant growth (13 to 16% by volume) and the
rooting depth of most crops apparently is restricted, a few irrigations will
be required in the wet season, and more often in the dry season. Because
of their unusually low silt content, the soils are very soft when wet and
very hard when dry and the period when they can be effectively worked for
seed-bed preparation is very short. Hence, it will be necessary to provide
mechanical equipment for timely land preparation.
10.       As implied above, the RBE (uplands) are best suited for the pro-
duction of upland crops such as cereals, pulses, chillies, maize, etc.,
whereas the LHG soils (bottomlands) are suitable only (in the absence of
drainage) for paddy. Recent trials in the project area show that non-flood
(upland) rice can be successfully grown on the RBE soils in the maha season.
Climate
11.       Climatic data for a station at the Maha Illuppallama Research
Station centrally located in the project area near the southwestern tip of
area H4, are shown on Table 1.
Population
12.       The old irrigated areas (35,000 ac) have been fully settled with
11,230 families under the colonization scheme of 1946. The new irrigable
areas (71,000 ac) will be settled with approximately 27,000 families. In
the present situation, sub-area HI is already settled with 2,320 families
of which about 250 families have been brought in from adjacent areas. Re-
sults from a socio-economic survey have indicated that there are approxi-
mately 10,620 families in the Stage II area (excluding H1). Since there
would be approximately 61,750 ac of irrigable land available for allotment
(2.5 ac per family), about 14,000 families would be brought into the area.
13.       The average family size in some of the older irrigated areas is
slightly larger than that in the new irrigable areas (5.6 as opposed to
5.4), due to a larger farm size. Under project conditions, the average
family size in the Stage II area would be reduced, since some of the married

members of the existing families could also apply for purchasing land in
the project area. In addition, the young age distribution of the potential
new settlers (about 35 to 40 years of age) would contribute to a smaller
family. Thus it is assumed that the average family size under project
conditions (in the Stage II area) would be about 5.1.
14.       Present and future population for sub-areas are shown in Table 2.
Existing Settlement
15.       The existing settlement pattern in the project area has evolved
from the irrigation complex of tanks constructed by the Sinhalese settlers
as early as 600 B.C. There are four distinct types of settlements in the
area:
(i) Purana villages: Inhabited by the descendants of the ori-
ginal settlers with a tradition-bound, long history. The
important parts are the village tank, the paddy fields and
the residential unit. These form one composite component
and the highland and chena lands form the other component
and are away from the main village. About 50% to 60% of
the villages or hamlets in the project area are purana
villages. The average number of families living in these
villages is 50 to 60 with a population of about 300 to 400.
(ii) Colonization schemes: In the Stage I area there are four
major colonization schemes, which were started between
1946 and 1964. These are the settlement schemes organized
by the Government on lands which occupy some 35,000 ac
(20,000 ac paddyland and 15,000 ac highland). Under the
project they are covered only by agricultural extension.
(iii) New villages: This recent category generally represents
the overflow from colonization schemes and urban areas.
These new villages are located close to the main roads.
Some 10% to 15% of the villages in the project area are
new villages.
(iv) Urban centers: The largest, Kekirawa, is located on the
fringe of the area (sub-area H7) and its population
amounts to about 4,000. There are also six small urban
centers in or on the fringes of the area. These towns
are places of transit and have better bazaar and public
facilities.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
Water Supply
1.        The main sources of irrigation water for the project are the
diversions from the Mahaweli Ganga at the Polgolla diversion site, water
developed by tank storage on various streams (oyas) within the project
area (principally the Kandalama and Kalawewa tanks on the Mirisgoni and
Kala oyas), and return flows from upstream irrigated areas that can be re-
used as supplemental supplies in lower areas. The adequacy of water supplies
in the quantities and at times required by the crops depends on how effec-
tively these supplies are integrated, regulated, distributed and utilized.
2.        The Mahaweli Ganga diversions are conveyed by the improved Sudu
Ganga (Dhun Oya) channel to the Bowatenna Diversion Dam and a portion (a
maximum of 1,000 cusecs out of a total diversion capacity of 2,000 cusecs at
Polgolla) is diverted through the Bowatenna Tunnel to the headwaters of the
Kala Oya, while the remainder flows via the Elahera Canal to the Amban Ganga
service area (Map 11751R). A further division of the Bowatenna Tunnel diver-
sions is made at the outlet portal; out of the total possible diversion of
1,000 cusecs, 700 cusecs would be released to the Dambulu Oya Reservoir and
300 cusecs would be conveyed by canal for a distance of about 3 mi to a
bifurcation structure, where 170 cusecs would be diverted to the Kandalama
tank and the remaining 130 cusecs would flow to the Huruluwewa tank and ser-
vice area. The water released to the Dambulu Oya Reservoir and the Kandalama
tank would augment water supplies developed in the Kala Oya Basin for irriga-
tion use in the H area.
3.        The historic flow of the Mahaweli Ganga at the Polgolla diversion
site during the 1945 to 1964 period varied from an average monthly flow of 115
cusecs in March 1948 to 13,590 cusecs in December 1958. Minimum, maximum and
average monthly recorded flows (in cusecs) during this period are shown
below:

ANNEX 2

It is evident from the historic record that the full (2,000 cusecs) diversion
capacity of the Polgolla complex could be fully utilized for only about seven
months of the average year, assuming that nearly the entire flow of the river
could be diverted. Downstream water requirements and monthly and seasonal
variations in flow and varying irrigation demands would reduce considerably
the diversions from the Mahaweli Ganga during the remainder of the year.
4.        Actual water diversions from the Mahaweli Ganga at Polgolla were
begun in mid-1976, after experiencing the two lowest years of recorded flow
in the Mahaweli Ganga in 1974 and 1975. Early diversions were limited to
from 300 to 500 cusecs because of extreme low flow in the river. The re-
currence of such a drought period after full implementation of the project
would result in significant irrigation shortages unless holdover storage is
provided in the system, such as contemplated in Stage III development.
Water Demand
5.        Water requirements were based on the design cropping pattern shown
in Annex 11, Figure 1. The crops include flooded rice in LHG soils during
both maha and yala (135 and 105 day varieties, respectively), upland rice in
RBE soils during maha (105 day variety) and pulses, cereals, chillies, ground-
nuts and soybeans in RBE soils, to be grown principally in the yala season.
Cropping intensities of 95% and 90% were assumed for flooded rice in maha
and yala in the LHG (lowland) soils and 90% and 80% for upland crops (includ-
ing upland rice in maha) in maha and yala in the RBE (upland) soils.
6.        Crop water requirements were computed by the Modified Penman method
with grass as the reference crop, using the WATREQ computer program developed
by the Bank. Climatic data for the Maha Illuppallama Research Center, cen-
trally located in the project area, were used in the consumptive use calcula-
tions. Two studies were made: the first to determine an average monthly ir-
rigation requirement at the diversion point based on the average monthly data
available and, the second, to determine irrigation requirements on a monthly
basis using actual data records for use in a simulated project operation study
over the entire period of study. Effective rainfall for the first study was
estimated based on the 75% probability of experiencing average rainfall in
each year (determined separately for both the maha and yala periods). In the
second study, the actual monthly recorded rainfall was used as the base. For
rice grown in paddy, the effective rainfall was limited to 0% of monthly rain-
fall less than 10 mm, 90% for rainfall from 10 to 50 mm, 80% from 50 to 100 mm,
70% from 100 to 200 mm, and 0% for monthly rainfall in excess of 200 mm. For
upland crops (including upland rice), effective rainfall was estimated using
the monthly effective rainfall method (formula) developed by the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture (SCS).
7.        Water requirements for rice grown under flooded conditions (LHG
soils in the lowland areas) would require pre-irrigation for land preparation
requirements. It was assumed that water provided for land preparation would
be sufficient for rice seedling nursery needs in areas where transplanted
37



ANNEX 2
Page 3
rice would be grown. A land preparation period of 20 days was assumed to al-
low time for the land to be worked and for decomposition of weeds and rice
stubble. Soil saturation requirements were estimated to be 50 mm in the maha
and 40 mm in the yala. Evaporation water loss was estimated to be 0.8 of the
average pan evaporation during the 20-day period. Percolation and dike losses
were estimated at 5 mm per day. The flooding requirement for rice to provide
an optimum depth for cultivation was estimated to be 100 mm (four inches).
This water also would provide for consumptive use requirements during the
last two weeks of the cultivation period when irrigation had ceased. Water
requirements for land preparation were estimated to be 50 mm (2 inches) for
upland (irrigated dry) crops.
8.        A field irrigation efficiency of 85% was assumed for the flooded
rice crop during maha and 90% during yala, not including deep percolation
and dike losses (5 mm/day) which are accounted for separately.  Based on field
trials in the project area, a field irrigation efficiency of 30% was assumed
for upland rice:  frequent irrigation would be required and water losses would
be high for rice cultivation in the porous RBE soils.  An average field irri-
gation efficiency of 60% was assumed for the other upland crops. Canal and
distributary conveyance losses (seepage and operational losses) were estimated
to be about 25% (75% efficiency) in the area served by the Kandalama tank.
Canal conveyance efficiencies in the extended Kalawewa service area were
estimated to be about 75% in the lowland areas and 70% in the free draining
RBE (upland) soil areas. Seasonal water requirements for flooded rice are
developed in Table 1. Computer printouts of water requirement calculations
for each crop are shown in Table 2, pages 1 to 12.
9.        The various service (command) areas within the H area are given in
Table 3. The table lists the areas presently irrigated and new areas to be
irrigated with the project, showing both gross and net irrigated categories.
In estimating the net irrigated area, it was assumed that only 90% of the
area to be irrigated would be cultivated and that the remainder would be
taken up in roads, irrigation and drainage works, field bunds and other un-
cultivated areas. A further breakdown between upland and lowland soils is
also shown in Table 3.
10.       Irrigation water requirements and the design of the irrigation
system were made on the basis of rotational irrigation (intermittent flow),
as it would be virtually impossible to supply a uniform, continuous flow to
the small farm holdings in the project area. The extremely small flows in-
volved in continuous irrigation would be too difficult to deliver and manage
effectively and canal losses for the low flows would be high. Therefore,
to conserve water and for ease of operations, rotational irrigation practices
would be instituted and followed in the project area. The basic unit for
irrigation would be the area served by a one cusec turnout from a distribu-
tor canal, averaging about 40 ac in size. A field channel, heading at the
turnout, would convey water to each 2.5 ac farm. Assuming a 3 inch irrigation
38



ANNEX 2
Page 4
requirement and that the full stream (1 cusec) would be available to each
farmer in turn, irrigation deliveries would be rotated between the 2.5 ac
farms on 7.5 hour intervals and water supplied to the field channels would
be rotated every five days. Irrigation scheduling would vary according to
the size of the area served, the crop grown, and the water requirements at
the particular time of service. Irrigation deliveries would be rotated
between the smaller distributor canals during periods of low irrigation re-
quirements for low consumptive use crops.
Water Balance
11.       An analysis of the adequacy of available water supplies to meet
irrigation requirements of the command areas proposed for inclusion in the
Mahaweli Ganga project, based on UNDP/FAO detailed water balance studies for
the 20 year 1944-64 period, was included in the Stage I report (Report PA-29a).
System operation studies were carried out for the six critical (dry) years to
supply ultimate irrigation requirements of the H, Hl, Di and G areas utiliz-
ing Mahaweli diversions at Polgolla, Amban Ganga diversions at Elahera and
the local yield of tanks. Based on the capacities developed for the Polgolla
Tunnel (2,000 cusecs), Bowatenna Tunnel (1,000 cusecs), Elahera canal (1,500
cusecs), H area tanks (195,500 ac-ft), and Di and G tanks (363,000 ac-ft),
irrigation deficits were estimated to occur in five out of twenty years,
ranging from less than 10% (for two years) to 35% (three years).
12.       Detailed studies also were made to determine if a more effective
utilization of Mahaweli flows could be possible by: (1) including reservoir
storage on the Mahaweli Ganga above Polgolla; (2) increasing the size of
the Polgolla tunnel (to 2,500 cusecs); (3) increasing the capacity of the
Bowatenna tunnel (to 1,500 cusecs), and providing storage at Bowatenna. The
studies showed that a significant reduction in irrigation shortages would
occur with deficits in only three years ranging from 20% to 30%, and that an
additional transfer of about 80,000 ac-ft of water to project tanks could
be made by increasing the Polgolla and Bowatenna tunnels to the capacities
shown.
13.       Although the Stage I report strongly recommended that the size of
the Polgolla and Bowatenna tunnels be increased to 2,500 cusecs and 1,500
cusecs, respectively, for the reasons of: (1) increase in water availability;
(2) reduction in irrigation deficits and (3) to provide additional flexibility
in the irrigation distribution system, the tunnels were constructed as initi-
ally planned. A water availability study, made by SOGREAH for the 1945-68
period of study using diversions possible with the existing tunnel capacities
and water developed by the seven largest tanks in the command area, showed
that the irrigation supply developed would be sufficient to supply irrigation
requirements in the total H area (106, 000 ac) plus 10,000 ac in the
Anuradhapura area (computed on the basis of the Bank's cropping pattern and
the water requirement and efficiency criteria assumed by the Bank) in 21
years of the 24 year study period. Irrigation shortages in the three years
of short supply would range from about 20% to 35%.

14.       A monthly water balance study also was made by the MDB engineering
staff using: (1) irrigation requirements based on an assumed MDB cropping
pattern and monthly historic rainfall; (2) estimated monthly diversions from
the Mahaweli Ganga based on the existing tunnel capacities and historic run-
off in the Mahaweli Ganga; and (3) estimated monthly tank yields and return
flows from irrigation generated within the project area. A simulated
operation of the Kandalama and Kalawewa service areas was made to supply
the irrigation requirements of the study areas, using inflow to and regula-
tion provided by the Kandalama and Kalawewa tanks but without considering
storage regulation available in the Dambulu Oya reservoir. The study showed
that irrigation deficits would occur in five years of the 24 year study
period, ranging from about 3% to 15%. With the Dambulu Oya reservoir, the
shortages would be reduced to three years of the study period, in the range
of 5% to 10%.
15.       Based on the simulated operation study, it appears that the water
supply available for project use would be adequate to irrigate the proposed
area. The supply would be reliable and would result in a minimum risk to
the farmers of crop failure due to a short water supply. Although the study
period (1944-1968) did not include the 1974 and 1975 drought years, which are
the lowest flows on record, the inclusion of these years in the operation
study would not change the viability of the project.
16.       The computerized irrigation requirement study made by the Bank,
using historic rainfall and the Bank's proposed cropping pattern and water
requirement and efficiency criteria, supported the study made by MDB.
Considering that the full requirements of the area would be met in 21 years
(88%) of the 24-year study period and that in the remaining three years the
shortages would be less than 30%, the water supply would be adequate for the
area proposed for development. Taking the 1974 and 1975 drought years into
consideration in the study, the area would be fully supplied in 26 out of 31
years (84%), which is within the criteria normally set for irrigation projects.
Quality of Water
17.       The UNDP carried out a study on the quality of the waters of the
Mahaweli Ganga and Amban Ganga and in the Kalawewa and Minneriya tanks. The
tests indicated that the waters of the Mahaweli and Amban Ganga are of
excellent quality, having a conductance of less than 250 micro mhos per centi-
meter, and can be used for irrigation of all soils without developing problems
of salinity. They have a sodium absorption ratio (SAR) of less than ten and
would not pose any danger of alkalinity problems. Tests on water supplies
from the Kalawewa and Minneriya tanks indicated conductance of 250 to 750
micro rnhcs per centimeter. These waters can be used for irrigation of medium
salt: tolerant crops and salinity control measures would not be required pro-
vided drainage is not impeded. The SAR values for these waters are also less
than ten. As the bulk of the irrigation requirements would be met from the
river supplies, the overall quality of water for irrigation can be considered
as good.
March 1977                                                                   40

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Irrigation Works
General
1.        Stage I of the Mahaweli Ganga project, assisted by the Bank Group
under Loan 653-CE and Credit 174-CE, included works for diverting the flow
of the Mahaweli Ganga River at the Polgolla Diversion Dam through a tunnel
to the Sudu Ganga and further diverting a portion of this water through the
Bowatenna Tunnel to the Dambulu Oya and the Kandalama tank in the H area.
Stage II includes the irrigation and social infrastructure in the 71,000 ac
H area and the necessary equipment, agricultural inputs and extension assis-
tance required by the new settlers to successfully settle and farm the H area.
The current Bank assisted project would provide irrigation and drainage facil-
ities in areas H4 and H5 and complete remaining social infrastructure and
other assistance required in the H area. The engineering plans, surveys,
designs and estimates and construction methods for the irrigation and drain-
age works to be provided by the project are discussed in the following
sections.
Engineering Plans and Surveys
2.        A feasibility study and report for Stage II development was pre-
pared by the consultant firm SOGREAH under the Loan/Credit Agreements for
Stage I. The FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program also prepared a summary report
for developing various tank modernization schemes and Stage II of the
Mahaweli Ganga project. These served as the basis for additional Mahaweli
Development Board (MDB) investigations and plans for implementing Stage II
works.
3.        Initial feasibility planning for Stage II was done using 1:63, 360
scale maps (1 inch: 1 mi) with 20 ft contour intervals prepared in 1946, with
later revisions. Detailed engineering surveys in the H area were started in
1969 by running profile lines on a 1/2 mile grid, using spot levels at five
chain intervals to determine contours and using transit traverse surveys
to locate physical features. Topographic maps at a scale of 1:6,336 (10
inches to 1 mile) with 2 ft contour intervals were prepared for use in
laying out the irrigation system for construction purposes. Enlarged topo-
graphic maps (scale 1:3,168) with a 2 ft contour intervals were made for
farm layout work and for locating field and farm ditches and field drains.
A complementary land use and settlement map at the same scale was prepared
and a closed circuit survey made of each hamlet (scale 1 inch to 2 or 4
chains) to locate each 1/2 ac homestead.
55



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.        The field surveys for areas H4 and H5 have been completed and
detailed maps for the distribution system layout are scheduled for com-
pletion by March 31, 1977. Additional surveys required to prepare the
detailed topographic mapping for farm layout and irrigation and drainage
system design within field turnout areas (30 to 50 ac unit) would be made
after clearing has been completed in the forested areas.
5.        The preparation of the detailed maps and the general irrigation
system layouts are done by MDB in the headquarters office in Colombo.
Strip surveys with cross-sections every 400 ft are made to prepare maps
used in making construction designs and estimates for the main and branch
canals. The layout of the distributor canals also is done in the head
office but designs are prepared by the field officers under the direction
of the Deputy General Manager (Engineering) and the location of each canal
is checked in the field. A traverse survey is made of each field canal and
drain.
Designs and Estimates
6.        The designs and estimates for works exceeding a cost of Rs 50,000
(major works) are done in the head office of MDB as well as all hydraulic
structure designs. The detailed designs of irrigation works in areas H4
and H5 were begun in January 1976 and are scheduled for completion during
1977.
7.        The Stage II project is designed to irrigate a total of about
71,000 ac of land. The major storage component is the Kalawewa tank, which
commands 58,000 ac of the Stage II area comprising about 18,000 ac on the
left bank and 40,000 ac on the right bank of the Kala Oya. The existing
Righ,t Bank Main Canal (Kalawewa Yoda Ela) is 55 mi in length and provides
water to about 13,000 ac of land, 9,000 ac of which are located in the
upper reaches of the canal. Under the Bank project, a new canal would be
constructed beyond the 17th mile to irrigate 40,000 ac of new land and the
remaining 4,000 ac presently irrigated. The new canal would be 28 mi in
length and would be designed to carrv 1,150 cfs in its upper reach. The
canail would enter four large tanks along its route, which would serve as
equailizing reservoirs. A total of eight branch canals would take off from
the main canal to serve the project area. Both the main and branch canals
would be double banked and lined sections would be provided in rock excava-
tiorL areas. Earth embankments for all canals would be compacted to reduce
leakage from the canals and provide better bank stability. Lining would be
provided for distributor and field canals in reaches constructed in fill
and for main and branch canals in unstable, silty soil areas.
8.        Cross regulators would be provided in the main and branch canals
to provide a minimum head of two-thirds full supply depth at each turnout.
Parshall flumes would be located above and below each tank on the main
canal to determine flow in each reach. Off-takes from the main and branch



ANNEX 3
Page 3
canals would be gated and weirs would be provided to determine flows to
distributor canals. Field turnouts from distributor canals would be gated
and weirs or constant head orifices would be provided to measure flows in
the fie±d canals. The canals and drops, siphons, road crossings, turnouts,
cross regulators and other canal structures are designed in accordance with
accepted engineering criteria to provide required control and measurement of
irrigation flows. The designs are similar to designs prepared for on-going
works in the H area. Irrigation tanks, located along the canals would pro-
vide the additional operational flexibility necessary to achieve high distri-
bution system operation efficiencies. Operation and maintenance roadways
would be provided along one embankment of the main, branch and distributor
canals. The main, branch and distributor canals would flow continuously
during the irrigation season and flows in the field canals would be rotated
by turnout units (usually from 30 to 50 ac each). The MDB designs and opera-
tional plan assume furrow irrigation in upland soils on a 12-hour daylight
schedule, with unattended irrigation deliveries during the night to lowland
paddy areas. This would require careful and continuous canal operation for
changing irrigation requirements and a proper balancing of upland and low-
land soils in each turnout unit. Field irrigation efficiencies would be low
if irrigation water applications were irregular or unbalanced. Also, rota-
tional deliveries by field canals would require the same crops or that crops
with similar water requirements be grown by farmers within each field turnout
area.
Construction Methods
9.        Main and branch canals would be constructed by private contractors
or by public construction agencies, using equipment-intensive construction
methods. The first 18 mi of the new Right Bank Main Canal is presently under
construction or will be under contract by the end of 1976. The remaining 10
mi would be included under the Bank project. The construction of distributor
canals, drains field canals and on-farm distribution canals and drains would
be let in small contracts to local contractors, including the farmers them-
selves where qualified, and would be principally labor-intensive. In clearing
forested areas, brush and trees up to 1 ft girth would be cleared by hand,
trees 1 ft in girth to about 6 ft girth would be cleared with chain saws, and
larger trees would be cleared with heavy equipment. The trees and brush would
be piled and allowed to dry for about one month before burning. Two burning
operations would probably be required, one for clearing by hand labor and with
chain saws and the other for trees and stumps cleared by machine.
10.       Ripping and stump removal would be done by machine, as well as the
smoothing of small mounds or elevated areas during the ripping process. Rip-
ping and cross ripping would normally be done 12 to 15 inches in depth. The
MDB wouild provide one initial plowing of all farm areas after arrival of the
settlers to assist the settlers to complete land grading and bunding on their
own farms. Land preparation work not completed by the settlers, due to the
difficulty of the work or the unwillingness of the farmers to complete the work,



ANNEX 3
Page 4
would be completed by MDB. Land leveling or grading work on lands with
slopeBs up to 2-1/2% generally would be completed by the settlers themselves
under contract to MDB.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Production Support
General
1.        The proposed project would complete Stage II of the Mahaweli Ganga
Development Program. Stage II would provide irrigation to 71,000 ac of
largely undeveloped land and settle about 27,000 families. To fully utilize
the potential created by the irrigation infrastructure, agricultural produc-
tion would be supported by: strengthened agricultural extension services and
applied research; farm equipment; marketing and processing facilities, and
market roads.
Agricultural Extension
2.        Present Situation.  The Department of Agriculture (DA) operates a
multiplicity of extension programs that are all supervised by the Deputy
Director of Agriculture (DDA), Extension. Its general, country-wide program
works through the District Agricultural Extension Officers (DAEOs) in each of
the 22 Districts. The District extension organization primarily assists
farmers in areas that have not received any special benefits from irrigation
projects or any other form of land improvement. Irrigation projects, special
land development projects and schemes to promote the production of specific
crops are usually supported by their own extension service with only informal
links to the regular District extension service.
3.        The project area principally falls within the Anuradhapura District
which has the following extension staff at present: 1/
1 District Agricultural Extension Officer (DAEO)
1 Deputy DAEO
7 Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs)
3 Agricultural Officers (AOs)
42 Agricultural Instructors (AIs)
147 Village Level Workers (Sinhalese acronym is KVS, standing for
Krushikarma Viyaptha Sevaka).
4.        Extension activities in north-central Sri Lanka are technially
supported by the Maha Illuppallama Research Station. However, contacts are
not formalized and depend entirely upon the personal relationships of the
officers. Maha Illuppallama is also the site of a training center, which
runs in service and orientation training courses for all levels of staff, but
thEse activities are impeded by a lack of adequate facilities.
1/   The functions of these officers are described in para 9.
60



ANNEX 4
Page  2
5.        Besides little exposure to up-to-date research, the extension
services suffer from: a lack of clearly defined responsibility; the
absence of fixed schedule for farmers' training; serious shortage of
transportation for all levels of staff and a lack of accommodations -- all
of which hamper the recruitment of key staff for field operations.
6.        Reorganization of the Extension Services under the Project.  The
project area is located in the Districts of Anuradhapura, Kerunegala and Matale.
Besides the three District extension organizations, a couple of special exten-
sion projects are active within the project boundaries. To ensure a uniform
extension service in the area and to facilitate the coordination with the
irrigation and community development staff, it was recently decided to create
a special extension District for the project area (106,000 ac). Staff for
this special District is presently being recruited.
7.        The proposed staffing is:
New Areas      Old Areas
(71,000 ac)   (35,000 ac)
Project Agricultural
Extension Officer (PAEO)                     1
Additional PAEO                              I
SMSs                                         8
AOs                                          8              3
Al Field                                    26             14
AI (attached to APC Office)                  8
KVS Field                                  104             30
KVS Assistant to AI and APC                  8
8.        The staffing density for new areas is based on:  one KVS per 250
farmers; one AI per 1,000 farmers, and one AO per 3,5000 farmers. This density
is high but it is justified because the proposed farming systems would include
new techniques and require very careful attention to water use and management.
Thinning of staff would be done as the program progresses. Since the farmers
in the old areas have experience in irrigated cultivation, the staffing den-
sity in these areas would be lower than in the new areas.
9.        The proposed extension organization is illustrated in Chart 16495.
The functions of the new staff would be:
Project Agricultural Extension Officer (PAEO). The PAEO would be
in overall charge and responsible for the work performance and training of
all the staff. He would, ex officio, occupy the position as Deputy Resident
Project Manager (DRPM), Agriculture. He would be assisted at project head-
quarters by an additional PAEO who would have charge of the day-to-day opera-
tional activities of all extention workers. The APAEO would serve principally
as a staff officer. Both these officers would be agricultural graduates with
several years operational and technical experience.
61



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs). To enable maximizing output
and to utilize fully expensive and scarce inputs there would be SMSs for:
--   farm machinery maintenance and operations;
water management and irrigation practices;
extension methods;
farm management;
paddy;
maize and sorghum;
other upland crops, and
--   plant protection.
The SMS would be a university graduate with at least two years specializa-
tion in his subject and at least three years general field experience. His
functions would be:
(a) field work, in support of staff in contact
with farmers;                                                60%
(b)  training courses (lectures and demonstrations);              20%
(c) contact relevant research work and workers,
and                                                          10%
(d) preparing material for publication and training
courses administration, work planning -- short-
and long-term                                                10%
Agricultural Officers (AO). Each AO would be responsible for one
Agricultural Productivity Committee (APC) area, reporting directly to the
PAEO and supervising about three AIs. He should preferably be a university
graduate with at least five years' experience, capable of planning, organ-
izing and supervising the extension activities of his staff. He would be
well acquainted with problems facing the farmer in the field of crop produc-
tion and farm management.  The planning of the KVS, AI and farmer training
programs would be his specific task. In this he must have access to, and the
assistance of, the SMSs. He would spend three days a week in the field,
visiting his AIs and ensuring that he sees, in rotation, all his KVSs and all
their work areas. The task and the problems in hand would determine whether,
and which, SMS accompanies him during the visits.
62



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Agricultural Instructor (AI--Field). One AI would supervise
about four KVSs. He would have at least two years training at an agri-
cultural school and three years' field experience. He would be sufficiently
well versed in the production of all field crops, plant protection and
water management to be competent in back-stopping his KVSs. He would, in
turn, visit each of his KVS's farm groups. He would participate in the
fortnightly KVS training sessions and take personal charge of demonstration
plots and the field days conducted on them. He would help organize and take
part in the periodic farmers' extension meetings.
Agricultural Instructor (AI--APC). One AI would be posted to each
APC; his office would be located in the APC complex. He would advise and
assist the chairman and the members of the committee in their function of
ensuring proper and efficient farming practices, which would include the
preparation of the annual production program. He would be assisted by one
KVS.
Village Level Workers (KVSs). The staff having the most frequent
contact with the farmers would be the KVS. They must have a rural, farming
background and preferably also formal training in a special training insti-
tute. They would have suitable transport to travel within this area and
would be subjected to frequent practically-oriented training courses devised
and run by first and second-line supervisors. They would have, within their
areas, initially about 250 farmers. Methods of operation would be centered
around a prearranged and rigidly followed schedule of visits, known to all
farmers in the area. They would return to the same outlet command every week.
The KVS would visit, and work with the same contact farmers for at least one
season. The contact farmers would all have been carefully selected as re-
spected leading farmers of the area. Two groups of six contact farmers would
be a suitable number for the one day's visit. Other farmers having land in
the same outlet commands would be encouraged to participate. Success would be
measured by the number who follow the KVSs' recommendations and by the results
they achieve. The regular visiting schedule would enable the KVS to assist
farmers in matters pertaining to input distribution and administrative proce-
dures. During every farm visit, only the specified extension tasks of the
period would be discussed. Other problems would be dealt with on a special
day set aside for the purpose or passed on to their supervisor.
10.       Staff Training.  Training would be continuous for all levels of
extension staff. The KVSs would receive regular fortnightly training. Between
sessions, they would communicate to the farmers no more than the two or three
key points of crop husbandry that they, themselves, were taught during the
fortnightly courses. The KVS training may well take place in the field to
ensure that all participants are actually capable of doing the task that
they would be called upon to teach and demonstrate.
11.       Before each season, there would be a one week intensive training
course for the KVSs, held at the Maha Illuppallama Training Center. The
syllabus would consist of lectures on the major crops, discussions on
63



ANNEX 4
Page 5
problems encountered, any new production techniques and the most effective
extension methods to use. The participants would have the opportunity of
utilizing past experience and newly acquired knowledge and skills to draw
up work plans for their areas for the following six months. In developing
these plans, emphasis would be placed on the priorities determined, practi-
cability and focusing of efforts. A number of these programs would be pre-
sented by their planners for analysis as well as in general discussion.
This, in itself, would be an important exercise.
12.       There would be a one-day training session each month for all the
AIs during which the previous and the following months' activities would be
discussed. There would also be presentations on special problems and some
practical training. A seasonal six day seminar of AIs would be organized
before each maha and yala season.
13.       The program for the graduate staff would cover not only technical
matters, but also practice of supervision, organization, management and
extension methods. It would include discussions with agricultural research
groups, management groups from other projects, and staff from the Institute
of Management and the Institute of Public Administration.
14.       Training of Contact Farmers.  The expected impact, of, and on, the
contact farmers cannot be achieved by KVS visits alone. Further training
would develop their abilities and make the work of the KVS more effective.
The training would take the form of practical demonstrations of the crops
they are growing, to improve crop husbandry practices by emphasizing key
factors such as timely weeding, fertilization, pest control, water management,
and most importantly, irrigation methods. Farmers would be taught the most
suitable cropping pattern for their conditions, as it was developed or has
evolved in their own area. This training would be in the form of short
courses taking place either at the Training Center in Maha Illuppallama
or at one of the APC centers. The courses would last two to three days and
be held before each season after the KVS courses.
15.       Monthly meetings of these same farmer groups would be organized by
the KVS and AI with the participation of the Cultivation Committee. The
meetings would serve as a forum for discussions concerning crops and farm
problems in general. Guidance by the AI and the KVS would highlight the
specific tasks to be undertaken during the following weeks.
16.       Project Support.  In order to support the reorganization of the
extension services, the project would provide: (Annex 4, Table 1 and Annex 6,
Table 4):
(a) bicycles for KVSs;
(b) motorcycles for AIs;
(c) field vehicles for AOs, SMSs and PAEOs;
64

(d) demonstration equipment for the extension service;
(e) offices and quarters for extension staff, and
(f) equipment, dormitories and other buildings for the
Maha Illuppallama Training Center
Agricultural Research
17.       Present Situation.  Agricultural Research is headed by the Deputy
Director of Agriculture (DDA), -- Research -- who is based at headquarters of
the Department of Agriculture, Peradeniya, near Kandy. There are 16 research
stations in the country, two of which are significant to the project --
Batalagoda where almost all the paddy breeding is done, and Maha Illuppallama
where both irrigated and rainfed farming systems and agronomic improvements
are being investigated.
18.       Sri Lanka has always had a good rice breeding program.  From the
period 1960 to 1970, the "H" series of locally bred varieties replaced most
of the traditional varieties. Since the advent of modern varieties (HYV),
Sri Lanka has successfully incorporated the IRRI strains to produce varieties
suitable to her own conditions. Of the varieties released, BG 11-11, 90-2,
34-6, and 34-8 are outstanding. The most notable feature of some of these
new varieties such as 34-6 and 34-8 is the short growing season (three to
three and a half months) which maximizes utilization of rainfall in the yala
season. All these varieties have a desirable plant type and are resistant to
blast.
19.       Research on other crops and cropping systems for the dry zone is
concentrated at Maha Illuppallama, located in the project area. Considerable
progress has been made in introducing and developing new varieties of chillies,
green gram, black gram, pigeon peas (dhal) and cow-peas. Water management and
drainage studies have been carried out under different conditions, for these
crops and for rice. These studies have covered items such as: irrigation
frequencies; furrow lengths and consumptive use of water.  The research find-
ings from tIaha Illuppallama have been applied to two pilot projects within the
project area.  These projects test cropping patterns under irrigated conditions
and farmers' acceptance of new agronomic practices.
20.       Proposed Research Project.  A new Irrigation and Water Management
Pilot Project would be set up in the project area. It would be jointly spon-
sored by the Irrigation Department, Agriculture Department and MDB. It would
involve:
(a) farming techniques and cropping patterns suitable
for the soils, topography and climte of the dry
zone;



ANNEX 4
Page 7
(b) water management techniques, with special attention
given to irrigation requirements, frequencies of
application, drainage methods and changes in soil
properties under prolonged irrigation; and
(c)  farmers' acceptance of new crops and improved irri-
gation and cultivation practices.
The scheme would also be used as a demonstration area for extension workers
and contact farmers.
21.       Project Support.  To support research activities of the pilot
scheme, the project would provide (Annex 4, Table 1 and Annex 6, Table 4):
(a) four-wheel and two-wheel tractors;
(b) laboratory and field equipment
(c) field vehicles for research staff, and
(d) offices and quarters for research staff.
ARricultural Equipment
22.       Farm Power--Present Situation.  In the project area, about-two-
thirds of the land preparation for the tank irrigated paddy fields is done
by bullocks. The remainder is done by four-wheel tractors and, to a lesser
degree, by two-wheel tractors. Land preparation for chena cultivation is done
exclusively by manual labor. However, in the more developed parts of the dry
zone,, about four-fifths of the land preparation is done mechanically, since
the soils are extremely hard when dry and timely land preparation is required
for high yields and optimum use of scarce water resources.
23.       The four-wheel tractors, most of them in the 35 to 40 hp class,
use mainly a tined cultivator (tiller) and only occassionally, under dry con-
ditions, a disc plow. The two-wheel tractors use a reversible mould-board
plow and a rotary cultivator. The buffaloes use a barpoint plow with a long
sole which helps to seal the surface on which it travels, thereby impeding
percolation and assisting with water conservation.
24.       Farm Power Requirements under the Project.  The farm power and
requi.rements in the area would increase about nine-fold under the project.
The number of draft animals is small and the stock increase will be slow. The
Department of Agriculture has plans for a buffalo breeding and training pro-
gram which could lead to an increase in the working buffalo population in the
project area. However, in view of the island-wide shortage of buffaloes, it
is assumed that the bulk of the primary and secondary tillage would necessar-
ily have to be done by tractors.
66



ANNEX 4
Page 8
25.       It is estimated that about 30% of the future needs for land
preparation could be met by the project area's existing farm power and
from sources outside the area. The remainder of the requirements would
have to be provided under the project. The future requirements have been
estimated using the following output factors:
Working
Tillage                            days (8 hrs)
Tractor             Operation           Rate/Acre         per season
4-wheel              Primary              2 hrs                40
Secondary         1.3  "                 40
2-wheel              Primary             11  "                30
Secondary           7                    30
26.       Project Support.  The project would provide 300 four-wheel and
1,200 two-wheel tractors with implements and 50 motorized and 1,300 hand
knapsack sprayers (Annex 6, Table 5).
Storage, Marketing and Processing
27.       Seeds -- Present Situation.  Farmers obtain their seeds via the
extension service and the Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies (MPCSs), which
get them from Government farms and from certified seed growers. There is
a great deal of farmer-to-farmer exchange and many cultivators save their
own seed, especially for paddy. An unofficial certification scheme for
paddy seed is operating, which is similar to that of the International Seed
Testing Association in relation to standards, and recognizes foundation,
registered and certified seed. Foundation and registered seed are always
grown on Government farms; certified seed is mostly produced by certified
growers. The system works well for paddy, as illustrated by the rapid
spread of new varieties. Pulse seeds usually present serious storage and
quality control problems due to the rapidly decreasing germination rate.
Thus, it would be desirable to introduce statutory controls and standards
for pulse seeds. However, the GOSL is presently advised on seed quality
control problems by a team from FAO.
28.       Fertilizers -- Present Situation.  All fertilizers are imported
by the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation (CFC) which also prepares most basic
NPK mixtures. The imports are expected to be reduced in the future because:
(a) The GOSL plans to construct a urea plant, to be in
operation by 1980, which would have an annual capa-
city of 300,000 tons, and
67



ANNEX 4
Page 9
(b) Sri Lanka has deposits of some 25 million tons of
rock phosphate (30% P205) and GOSL intends to use
these deposits for the production of super phosphate
and diammonium phosphate.
29.       Fertilizers for field crops are sold at controlled, subsidized 1/
prices primarily through the MPCs, with the distribution to the cooperatives
handled by the Department of Rural Institution (RI). A minor part of the
fertilizers is sold either directly by the RI or by the APCs and CCs. Pri-
vate dealers tend to specialize in fertilizers for a small number of cash
crops.
30.       Plant Protection Chemicals -- Present Situation.  Active ingre-
dients and emulsifiers for all pesticides are imported; most of the formu-
lation takes place in Sri Lanka. Locally established representatives of
two major companies have access to proprietary products and handle some 75% of
the market; most of the non-proprietaries are handled by the Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation which is also the only importer for solvents. The range of
pesticides available is comprehensive and adequate, and packaging is good.
The GOSL controls both the retail price and the range of products that can be
sold. (permissions are given first after successful field tests). However,
there is no statuatory control over storage conditions or shelf life, but such
legislation is now under consideration. The private sector firms have their
own Field Advisory Services and run demonstrations on farmers' fields. They
have a network of sub-distributors at the village level and also supply MPCs
and APCs.
31.       All formulations are liquid, therefore, they must be applied
through sprayers, which are usually rented from a neighbor or from the MPC.
The weed killers are systemic, and are effective if put on the leaves of
the weeds growing in water or on any part of the weed if there is not
starLding water. Insecticides, especially for plant hoppers, must be applied
in small droplets and very uniformly. Many of the sprayers are not of a
design that would ensure this.
32.       Storage and Marketing -- Present Situation.  Marketing of paddy
has been handled by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) and to some extent by
the private traders. As a result of the recent removal of legal restric-
tions on the movement of paddy, the activities of private traders has in-
creased. However, due to their limited storage facilities, it is expected
that: the PMB would continue to play an important role in paddy marketing.
1/   The present rate of subsidy is about 50%.
68



ANNEX 4
Page 10
33.       The PMB buys paddy from farmers at a fixed price (presently
Rs 33/bu) through a vast network of purchasing points run by the coopera-
tive societies. The Village Level (Branch) Cooperatives get a commission
of Rs .75 per bushel from PMB for grading, weighing, and sacking. Grading
is normally done according to the following standards.
Grade I        Grade II
Chaff                                 9%            12%
Foreign matter                        1%             2%
Other varieties                      10%            10%
Moisture content                     1.6%           16%
The difference in price is Rs 1.15 a bushel in favor of Grade I
(very little Grade II is purchased). Since the purchase centers are not
equipped to test for quality variations, grading is mostly based on judg-
ment and experience.
34.       The periods of purchase are between March and July inclusive,
and again between August and October. The peak period is between March
and May, when the transport is sometimes a bottleneck which results in an
accumulation of produce at the purchasing centers and temporary suspension
of purchases. From the point of purchase, the paddy is taken to the PMB
stores. At present all is flat storage; the first silos are now under
construction. There is no drying facility, no forced ventilation, although
the stores are well designed for natural ventilation. Average storage time
is about four months and annual turnover is only one time a year.
35.       Marketing of maize and sorghum is handled mostly through private
channels. The GOSL, through the Oils and Fats Corporation and PMB, also
purchases maize and sorghum for feed purposes or for blending with imported
wheat flour. Recently, as the farmers are encouraged to grow maize and
sorghum, the PMB is compelled to purchase these crops without limit at the
guaranteed prices.
36.       Marketing of other crops such as pulses, and chillies, are mostly
through private channels. Per capita consumption has fallen to about one
third of the amount used before the import ban in the early 1970s as a
result of a significant increase in prices. Consequently, no problem is
foreseen in marketing the increased production of these crops in the future.
37.       Processing -- Present Situation.  Paddy milling is the only major
processing industry in the project area; any sorghum or maize processing
that may be necessary would take place either in flour mills or Oils and
Fats Corporation feed mills, outside the project area. Rice milling is a
two-tier operation. The small village husking mills work on a custom basis
to meet domestic requirements. 1/ Large commercial privately-owned mills
1/   Provision is made in the village layout for the private sector
under project conditions.                                               69



ANNEX 4
Page 11
handle the other 20% but their share will increase in time because the
private sector is not allowed to replace its mills. The village mills
seen were of poor quality and in a poor state of repair. Practically all
the grain is broken and much is wasted with the husks. The larger mills,
although all are better maintained and waste little grain, do not polish
too finely and also have high breakage. Because of the superficial polish-
ing, milling out-turns are about 70%. About 10% of the milled rice is
parboiled.
38.       Project Support.  Existing facilities in the project area would
be inadequate for handling the projected nine-fold increase in agricultural
production. The project would provide (Annex 4, Table 2 and Annex 6,
Table 6):
(a) 50 seed stores;
(b) 50 fertilizer stores;
(c) 50 paddy collection centers. Each collection center,
located at each village center, would require about
100 tons storage (based on storage of 25% of estimated
crop collection) and working space for a simple auger-fed
bagging shute about 1,000 sq ft of floor space. The
building would have large doors at each end and a load-
ing dock at the end opposite the bagging unit.  A moisture
tester capable of giving instantaneous readings would be
available.  Samples above 16% moisture would be accepted
at a discounted price and then only if they could be
delivered to a drier the same day;
(d)  buildings for three new primary MPCs and 24 new branch
cooperatives, funds for the renovation of 26 existing
branch buildings. Vehicles (for transport of inputs and
paddy) for the new primary cooperatives and vehicles and
minor equipment for the Cooperative Development Department;
(e) buildings, plant and equipment for a PMB processing complex
(with a milling capacity of 1,000 tons per month and a
storage capacity of 5,000 tons); and
(f) rice hullers, threshers/winnowers for the 50 Cultivation
Committees in the project area. These units would be
available for hire to farmers.
Aricultural Credit
39.       Present Situation.  The main institutional sources of agricultural
credit for the farmers in the project area have been two state-owned banks --
the People's Bank and the Bank of Ceylon. Private lenders also have an



ANNEX 4
Page 12
important role in supplying credits due to their flexible terms and condi-
tions as well as simplicity of operation (about 85% of the total credits).
However, their roles have been largely confined to consumption rather than
production loans.
40.       Two types of loans are provided to the farmers:  (i) short-term
loans for crop cultivation at 6% to 9% rate of interest and with a repayment
period of 180-270 days, and (ii) medium-term loans for purchases of farm
power and agricultural implements at 9%-10% rate of interest and repayment
period 2 to 3 years.
41.       A farmer who is a member of a cooperative may apply for a loan
from the People's Bank through the Cooperative Rural Bank (CRB) of the MPC.
He may also apply for loans directly from the branches of the Bank of Ceylon
by presenting an Agro-Identity Card. This card which contains his identity,
his acreage as well as his outstanding indebtedness in other banks would
have to be cleared by the CRB. If he is found to be a defaulter, his appli-
cation would be rejected.
42.       Upon the approval of the loan from either one of the institutions,
the farmer would receive money for expenditure items requiring cash payments
such as land preparation, harvesting and threshing. Others, like fertilizers
and pesticides would be issued in kind by the MPCs and the APCs. Terms and
conditions of a loan from both banks are comparable. However, it takes a
shorter time to process a loan with the Bank of Ceylon than with the People's
Bank since the former has direct contact with the farmers.
43.       The default rates have been running on the average at more than 50%
of the outstanding loans during the last three years. One of the main rea-
sons for this is the practice of the writing-off of defaults on outstanding
loans with reimbursement up to 75% from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to the
other banks. The rate of recovery showed a very wide range between the CRB
concerned and between crop years, reflecting variations in farmers' ability
to pay from year to year as well as the capabilities of the respective bank
managers in collecting loan repayments. The default rate of the Bank of
Ceylon is lower due to its stricter control in the determination of a loan.
However, it may also be due to its recent entrance into providing rural
credit whereas the People's Bank has been operating the loans since 1967.
44.       Recent legislation would improve the default situation.  The Bank
of Ceylon would provide loans only to farmers and for purposes approved by
the APCs who are also empowered to collect the loan repayments. The Agri-
cultural Insurance Law would compensate for crop failures which would pro-
vide the farmers with cash to repay the loan in unfavorable years.
45.       Proposed Credit Arrangement under Project Conditions.  The project
would provide four-wheel and two-wheel tractors, as well as sprayers,
threshers, and winnowers to the project area. Credit facilities for the
purchase of farm equipment would be provided by the Bank of Ceylon and the
People's Bank. Terms of lending would be 100% financing for APC and not
71



ANNEX 4
Page 13
less then 75% financing- ior private operators at prevailing interest rates
(currently 9% to 10% annually) with repayment over five years (currently
three years). Refinancing for not less than 75% of the total loans for farm
equipment would be made by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to the Bank of Ceylon
and the People's Bank. The terms and conditions are satisfactory to IDA.
Market Roads
46.       The project area is well provided with good all weather roads.
However, the secondary road network in the main project area (40,300 ac)
would require improvements to cater to the increased needs after the area
has been fully settled. The project would provide 25 mi of new link roads
and improvements to about 50 mi of existing link roads (Map 12362 R). The
link roads would be built according to the Department of Highways' "Class D"
on a 20 m wide right of way, with a formation width of 7.5 m, a carriage
way width of 3.6 m and a pavement depth of about 28 cm. The link roads
would be maintained by the Department of Highways.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Social Infrastructure
Present Situation
1.        Settlement in the project area, at present, largely consists of
colonaization schemes and purana type villages (Annex 1). Social infra-
structure like schools, medical facilities and post offices are scattered
throughout the area. The colonists who are settled on the more developed
land (Stage I, old irrigated area) are better served with these facilities
than traditional villagers. However, on the whole, social services in the
area are considered more advanced that that in similar areas of other South
Asian countries.
2.        There are three levels of schools in the project area:  primary,
junior, and senior secondary schools. Primary schools (Grades 1-5) are
usually within an average one mi walking distance. However, the walking
distance is about five to eight mi for junior (Grades 6-9) and senior
secondary schools (Grades 10-11). Class size is about 30 to 35 students
for 'primary schools and 20 to 25 students for higher level. Education is
free for all students while fees are collected for operation and maintenance
of non-classroom facilities such as playgrounds, sport centers, and libraries
(about Rs 6 per year per student). Primary school teachers are normally re-
cruited from the villages whereas the higher level teachers come from cities.
Quarters are usually provided to the principal and the vice-principal and
in some cases to teachers.
3.        The health services are provided through a network of medical
institutions of varying levels, the largest being provincial hospitals
with specialist services located at the District level serving a population
of 70,000 to 100,000 and smaller institutions such as central dispensaries
at tihe village level, serving 8,000 to 10,000. There is a system of referral
in whnich cases from small institutions are sent to larger institutions by
an ambulance service. There is also a public health field program which
sprays anti-malaria chemicals about three times a year. Preventative health
care for mothers and children is undertaken by public health nurses, mid-
wives and inspectors under the overall charge of a Medical Officer of Health.
Family planning services are integrated with maternal and child health ser-
vices. Partly because treatment feeds are nominal, with no fee charged for
in patient and Rs .25 charged for out-patient treatment, medical serviOes
are frequently used by villagers.
76



ANNEX 5
Page 2
4.        Other services such as bus and postal faclilities and village wells
are scattered throughout the project area. These facilities are considered
adequate to serve the present population.
Proposed Settlements
5.        Under project conditions, the landholding pattern would be re-
organized into 2.5 ac farms and 0.5 ac homestead lots in the new land (71,000
ac) whereas there would be no change on the old irrigated area (35,000 ac).
Since the existing families would not fill up all the available irrigable
lots in the new land, additional families would be brought in. The number
of area families would increase from 25,270 to 39,350 after project im-
plementation.
6.        Settlements in the new land would be arranged in accordance with
the irrigation layout. The basic unit would be an irrigation sub-command
(or block) with about 1,250 ac of irrigable land corresponding to the
Cultivation Committee (CC) boundaries and would consist of about 500 farmers.
Within this sub-command area, farmers would be grouped into hamlets of
about 100 farmers each. This contrasts with the settlement pattern in the
old colonization schemes with a grouping of about 500 families. This large
grouping was found to lead to alienation and a lack of social cohesion.
7.        Each group of about five hamlets would have a village center
where most of the supporting services such as branch cooperatives, storage
facilities and CC offices would be located. The village center -- serving
about 500 families -- would be situated within the most central hamlet of
the group. The average distance from any homestead to the village center
would be about three miles. Settlement layouts would incorporate the
existing situation throughout the project area to the new design in order
to displace as few homesteads as possible.
8.        The largest service center would be the township which would
correspond to an irrigation command area and an APC area -- serving about
3,000 to 4,000 families. It would have service facilities such as primary
cooperative buildings, APC offices and milling plants. A detailed descrip-
tion of social infrastructure at all settlement levels is given in Table 1.
Project Support
9.        Existing facilities are adequate to serve the present population.
However, additional facilities have to be provided for some 14,000 new
families to be settled in the area. The project would provide the following
components.
(a) Schools. About 600 classrooms in primary and junior secondary
schools (Grades 1-9) and 20 classrooms in senior secondary
schools (Grades 10-11) together with laboratories, playgrounds



ANNEX 5
Page 3
and quarters. The proposed number of classrooms are
based on the standard national planning criteria of the
GOSL Education Department which would be responsible for
operating and maintaining these facilities. Details are
provided in Tables 2 and 3.
(b) Medical Centers. Two rural hospitals and two central
dispensaries with maternity wards as well as vehicles,
equipment and staff quarters. The required medical
facilities are based on the national planning criteria
of the GOSL Medical Department which would be responsible
for operating and maintaining these facilities. Details
are provided in Tables 4 and 5.
(c) Community Centers. A community hall to each village
center. The center would be used for village meetings
and training sessions (i.e. water management, farm
practices, and home economics) as well as for cultural
and recreational activities. These facilities would be
operated and maintained by MDB. These activities would
be administered by community development staff who are
also responsible for the settlement aspect of the project.
The staff would be provided with vehicles and housing.
A description is in Table 6.
(d) Village Roads. About 200 mi of roads are required to be
upgraded or built within the hamlets throughout the main
project area (H  and H5, 40,300 ac).  These roads would
be simple, 15 ft wide, and graded but not metalled. Drain-
age and culverting would be supplied where required. Details
are provided in Annex 7, Tablc 1. Village roads would be
maintained by MDB.
(e) Hamlet Wells. About 1,235 new wells would be required to
serve additional families in the project area. One well
would serve about 20 families. The wells would be main-
tained by MIDB.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II.
Organization and Management
The Mahaweli Development Board (MDB)
1.        The MDB, an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Irrigation,
Power and Highways (MIPH), was established in 1970 to oversee the develop-
ment of Mahaweli Ganga's water resources. It has the responsibility for
preparing final plans, designs, specifications and tenders, for awarding
construction contracts and for supervising the implementation of the pro-
ject. The Board is financed by regular budgetary appropriations by the
Government.
2.        Because of the nature of its previous work, MDB has been oriented
to engineering design and construction and the Board is now well staffed
with experienced technical personnel. However, since the present and future
stages of the Mahaweli Development S heme would require a greater emphasis
in the settlement and agricultural  3pects of project planning and imple-
mentation, reorganization of the M-f: would be proposed (Figure 1).  A de-
scription of the reorganization is >,7ovided in the main text (para 6.01).
Field Organization after Project Implamentation
3.        Since the project would con,Litute the first major development
of unirrigated land in the Mahaweli Master Plan, a proper coordination be-
tween agricultural extension, irrigation and community development officers
would be vital to the success of the project. The proposed organization at
the project level is detailed in Figure 2 and a description is provided in
the main text (para 6.08-6.10).
Construction Implementation
4.        All works under the project are scheduled for completion by June
1982 as shown on the Implementation Schedule (Figure 3). Details on comple-
tion of surveys and topographic mapping for the irrigation and drainage system
and designs and estimates of the irrigation works are given in Annex 3.
Irrigation infrastructure would be completed by July 1980, with irrigation
works in the H4 area being implemented and completed shortly before similar
works in H5. Construction of the drainage system would be delayed until
drainage requirements are more fully identified; however, it is expected that
this work would be completed by late 1981. The first 28 mi of the Kalawewa
Right Bank Main Canal is presently under construction and the remaining 10 mi
under the Bank project would be completed by December 1979. Land preparation
101



ANNEX 9
Page 2
work would be initiated after arrival of the settlers and the work would
continue through early 1982. Land clearing and ripping of forested areas
would be among the first work initiated (using equipment presently in the
country) and would be completed in both areas by June 1979. The improvement
and construction of market roads in the project area would be completed by
June 1981. The construction of social infrastructure would be started by
July 1978 and those works necessary for the immediate comfort and well being
of the settlers would be in place when the settlers arrive. All social in-
frastructure would be completed by June 1981. Administrative buildings,
workshops and quarters would be completed as rapidly as possible for use by
supervisory staff during construction of the project. Other buildings would
be constructed according to individual program requirements.
5.         The Deputy General Manager (Construction) under the direction of
the General Manager (Design and Construction) would have direct responsibility
for construction of the project. Two field construction offices would be set
up; one in the H4 area at Tambuttegama, and the other in the H5 area at Gala-
wewa. Four separate construction units would be established in the H4 area
and three in the H5 area. Staffing requirements for these offices would be
as shown in Figure 4.
Operation and Maintenance (Figure 5)
6.         Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the total H area (except for the
previously developed H3, H6, H8, and HIO-12 areas which are operated by the
Territorial Civil Engineering Organization) would be controlled by eight
range command offices under the direction of the Resident Project Manager.
Each range office would be responsible for irrigation and drainage facili-
ties serving about 9,000 ac, as well as reaches of the main canal and/or
irrigation tanks that fall within the range boundary. Regional sub-command
offices, two in each range, would be directly responsible for irrigation
releases and canal maintenance for about 1,500 ac. Ditch riders (Jala Palana
Sevaka - JPS), operating from the regional offices, would distribute water
from the distributor canals to the field channels, controlling up to 500 ac
each.
7.         Irrigation requirements for each season would be determined by the
Project Advisory Committee (PAC) (Figure 2). The CCs would make recommenda-
tions with respect to cropping calendars and water requirements for irrigated
lands under each turnout. Water requirements for each service area would be
determited and operating calendars would be established for the various
canals. The estimated requirements for the project area would be submitted
through the DGM (Water Use Allocation) to the Water Management Panel, who
would make water allocations for power and major irrigation command within
the Mahaweli system. Irrigation deliveries would be rotated between field
channels (turnouts) and between farmers served by each field channel. The
MDB plan of operation assumes that upland areas would be irrigated 12 hours
per dlay during daylight hours and that the water either would be released to
102



ANNEX 9
Page 3
lowland paddy areas during the night or stored in tanks in areas where tanks
are available. This assumes a proper balance between uplands and lowlands
in each turnout area or a flexibility of operations that is not necessarily
available. In order to achieve project irrigation efficiency levels assumed
for project formulation studies, irrigation deliveries would have to be made
on a 24 hour rotational basis as soon as the farmers are trained in this
method of irrigation.
8.        Proper operation, repair and maintenance of the irrigation and
drainage system would require modern equipment, which would be provided under
the project (Annex 6, Table 3). Vehicles and telephone communication in the
project area would be required for effective control and delivery of project
water supplies, and heavy equipment would be required to maintain the system
and make emergency repairs.
9.        Operation and maintenance costs of the irrigation and drainage
system in the H area are estimated to be about Rs 80 per ac or US$11.00 per
ac (Table 1), which would provide an excellent standard of operation and
maintenance of project facilities.
Technical Assistance
10.       Development of the Mahaweli Ganga Project is proceeding rapidly
and MDB's capabilities to plan, design, supervise, construct, operate and
administer the irrigation and drainage facilities and related programs of
the expanding project are under considerable strain. Equipment limitations
and the small number of qualified construction concerns in Sri Lanka would
require the maximum utilization of in-country resources and a high level of
management planning ability to complete on-going works and the new project
facilities as scheduled. Management assistance to MDB would help to in-
sure that scheduled completion dates are met. Similarly, project benefits
would be fully realized only upon the final implementation of on-farm ir-
rigation and drainage facilities and the timely completion of the leveling,
grading and land preparation work proposed for the particular crops to be
grown. Assumed irrigation efficiencies are dependent upon well executed
and technically sound development of upland areas for irrigation, expertise
for which is lacking in Sri Lanka. The MDB's predominant orientation to plan-
ning and construction would gradually shift to operation and management of
the completed works, where additional expertise would be required to develop
proper irrigation delivery schedules and establish preventative maintenance
measures.
11.       In order to strengthen MDB's capabilities in these fields, the
project would finance for a three-year period the services of one implemen-
tation advisor and one on-farm development specialist. Draft terms of re-
ference for these specialists are provided in Appendix 1.

ANNEX 9
Page 4
12.       The services of a Hydrologist for short-term consultant help (several
trips totalling about 12 months) to assist with the hydrologic monitoring pro-
gram would be financed by the project (see Appendix 2).
Monitoring and Project Performance
13.       The project would provide funds for a program for monitoring project
performance. The program is outlined in Appendix 2.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II.
Monitoring and Project Evaluation
Objectives
1.        The Stage II of the Polgolla Complex is the first development of
new lands under the Mahaweli Master Plan. It is designed to create a de-
velopment pattern that can be multiplied in the future. Thus, the objec-
tives of the monitoring component would be to:
(a) evaluate the development model, and
(b) provide data for refining the technical design para-
meters for future stages.
Scope
2.        The monitoring studies functionally can be divided into four major
groups:
(1) Water Use.
(a) continuous flow measuring program;
(b) estimation of irrigation efficiencies.
(2) Agricultural development.
(a) annual compilations of cropping patterns and yields
using routine data;
(b) in depth analysis of yields in areas where field
irrigation efficiencies are estimated; and
(c) in depth bench mark surveys.
(3) Indirect employment effects.
(4) Social adaptation and institutional development.
113



ANNEX 9
Appendix 2
Page 2
Staffing
3.        The water use studies would be carried out by MDB field staff, with
intermittent assistance from a consultant in hydrology (twelve man-months).
The annual compilation of cropping patterns and yields would be done by the
agricultural extension staff, partly utilizing data supplied by APCs and CCs.
The remaining studies would be contracted to the Agrarian Research and Train-
ing Institute (ARTI).
Steering Committee
4.        A small Steering Committee would be set up to coordinate the moni-
toring studies. It would consist of:
Additional GM (Operations), MDB, Chairman
DGM (Agriculture), MDB
DGM (Settlement), MDB
DGM (O&M), MDB
RPM
Director, ARTI
Director, Maha Illupallama Research Station
Director, Irrigation and Water Management Pilot Project
DetaiLed Components of the Studies
5.        Continuous Flow Measuring Program.  About 50 flow recording stations
would be installed at selected sites to monitor: water releases through the
Bowatenna Tunnel; the amount of water released from the major storage tanks;
and water distribution to selected branch canals, distributaries and field
channels. For branch canals and distributaries, where no recording stations
are installed, approximate stream measures would be used to estimate the water
releases to each irrigation block. Reports on such releases would be sub-
mitted annually to IDA.
6.        Estimation of Irrigation Efficiencies.  The data from the flow re-
cording stations would be used for estimating: conveyance and operational
efficiencies for various types of canals; field conveyance and field applica-
tion efficiencies below the turnouts for both upland and lowland areas.
7.        Annual Compilation of Cropping Patterns, Yields and Impact of
Exten,sion Services. This data would be collected by the agricultural exten-
sion staff in cooperation with the APCs and the CCs. Besides yields and
cropping patterns, information would be collected on the number of contact
farmers and "followers" and estimated yield differences between "followers"
and farmers who do not follow extension advice. Such reports would be sub-
mitted annually to IDA.
114



ANNEX 9
Appendix 2
Page 3
8.        In-Depth Analysis of Irrigated Yields.  In those turnouts where
field conveyance and field application efficiencies are monitored, produc-
tion of various crops would be fully enumerated in order to establish the
yield - irrigation relationship under normal farm conditions.
9.        Bench Mark Surveys.  Three in-depth bench mark surveys would be
carried out (1977, 1981 and 1985) by ARTI. They would be on a stratified
sample basis and cover, for upland and lowland areas: cropping patterns;
yields; input requirements; use of hired labor; farm incomes; non-farm
incomes and their sources; marketing channels and prices; family members'
age and occupation; farm capital owned; credit channels, and interest rates.
10.       Indirect Employment Effects.  Sample surveys would be made to: es-
timate the number of non-farm households and their sources and levels of
income; obtain enumeration of agricultural processing facilities in the pro-
ject area, and to establish the numbers and types of commercial establish-
ments in the area. The amount of non-farm employment would be related to
both the population of the area and its total agricultural population. The
surveys would be carried out in 1977, 1981 and 1985.
11.       Social Adaptation and Institutional Development.  In 1981 and
1985, ARTI would carry out interviews with members of APCs, CCs and MPCs,
Government officials and a sample of settlers to evaluate the administra-
tive set-up for the project. The surveys would cover items such as: ade-
quacy of social services; community participation; conflicts between old
population and new settlers, and the role of project management in the de-
cision process.
12.       Evaluation Reports.  Based on the annual monitoring reports and
the special surveys, ARTI would prepare two comprehensive evaluation reports
to be submitted to IDA by June 30, 1982 and June 30, 1986.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Settlement Procedures
General
1.        Under the project, the settlers would be provided with a 2.5 ac
farm and a 0.5 ac homestead lot. Since some of the areas are privately
owned and some are State owned but encroached upon, all the land in the
project area would have to be acquired and reorganized in order to ensure
equitable distribution. The responsibility for the settlement process rests
with the Settlement Planning and Development Division of MDB, headed by a
Deputy General Manager (who is also appointed as a Deputy Land Commissioner).
The settlement procedure is described below.
Socio-Economic Surveys
2.        Subsequent to soil and land classification, irrigation surveys
and dtelineation of the area to be developed, social-economic surveys are
conducted. These have been completed by MDB in cooperation with the Agra-
rian Rlesearch and Training Institute (ARTI) over 24,600 ac of the area and
in oultline over sub-areas H4 and H5 (49,300 ac). These surveys are designed
to coLlect basic data and information on such matters as population, land
ownership and tenure, agricultural practices, income levels and infrastruc-
ture facilities. The data also provides the number of eligible farmers
likely to become settlers and the number of settlers to be recruited from
outside the project area.
Land Acquisition
3.        About 24% of the total land area in the project area is privately
owned or leased from the GOSL; the remaining 76% is State land. In order
to plan an orderly layout of the irrigation system and associated settle-
ments and to assure equal land ownership, GOSL has decided to acquire all
lands within the project area (including all homestead lands) in accordance
with the Land Acquisition Act as amended in 1964.
4.        The basis for land acquisition is a Government declaration pub-
lished in the Gazette (a Government Publication) that the land is needed
for a public purpose. After an inquiry into the market value of the land,
the acquiring officer of the District determines the amount of compensation
to be paid. The act allows appeals against the amount of compensation but
not against the decision of the Government to acquire the land. The Govern-
ment can take possession of the land even if such appeals are pending. For
116



ANNEX 10
Page 2
the Mahaweli Stage II area, the compensation has been set at Rs 200 per ac
for upland areas and Rs 300 per ac for paddy land. Homesteads are subject
to individual valuation, taking the size and quality of the buildings into
account.
5.        Whenever any land becomes vested in the Government, under the pro-
cedure described above, it becomes "State land". Any person who might occupy
such land without authority becomes an encroacher on State land and subject
to eviction.
Settler Selection
6.        Farm families already residing in the project area are given prior-
ity in selection with the exception of the illegal encroachers who moved
into the area after June 1, 1970. The latter are estimated to be about 9%
of the existing population. To ensure a socially homogeneous population and
to maintain existing social links, the balance of settlers would be recruited
from nearby areas. The selection would be based on a detailed points system,
with highest weight given to agricultural experience. Other criteria deter-
mining the priority would be tenure status age, marital status and family
size.
Sale of State Land
7.        The basic law regulating the sale of State Land is the Sale of
State Lands (Special Provisions) Act of 1973, as augmented by the Regula-
tions of the Minister of Agriculture and Lands in 1975. Under the law, the
District Government Agent (or his representative) makes the selection of
the settlers. Appeals against the selection are decided by the Land Com-
missioner, whose decision is final.
8.        The settler can either pay the price for the lot in full and
receive a "grant" for the land or pay the price in equal installments over
20 years with 4% interest and receive a "permit" for the land. When
the payment is completed, a grant would be substituted for the permit.
Under both systems, the lots can be subdivided through sales, with prior
approval by the Government Agent, or through inheritance. However, for the
project, no fragmentation below one acre would be permitted.
9.        Permit land cannot be leased to any other person and grant land
can be leased only under certain circumstances such as prolonged illness.
Joint ownership is not permitted and the land can only be mortgaged to
certain specified institutions, such as the People's Bank or the Bank of
Ceylon.
Allocation of Land
10.       Approved settlers who have been farming land in the area would be
given first choice of land and they would normally be allocated farms in the



ANNEX 10
Page 3
same area as they farmed before. Similarly, new settlers would be given
choices of land and be grouped together with their friends. In the event
that no mutual agreement would be reached, balloting would be done.
11.       Each settler would be given 2.5 ac of irrigable land in one unit.
Most farms would be situated on one of the principal soil types; either on
the upland soils (RBE) or on the lowland soils (LHG).  The former are more
permeable and suitable for mixed cropping. The latter are suitable pri-
marily for paddy cultivation. However, the income earning potential of the
two Earm types would be similar. Using the design cropping pattern of 170%
cropping intensity on the upland farms and 185% cropping intensity in the
lowland farms, the respective net family income at full development would
be albout Rs 7,400 for upland 1/ and about Rs 7,600 for lowland farms.
The upland farms moreover could quickly adapt to market opportunities due to
the varied cropping possibilities compared with the lowland farms, which would
specialize in paddy. In addition to the 2.5 ac farms, each settler would be
given 0.5 ac of homestead (upland and non-irrigated) where he would reside and
have the opportunity to grow tree crops, vegetables and rear livestock.
12.       The price to be paid by the current settlers in respect of alien-
ations in 1975 and 1976 has been fixed by GOSL at a total of about Rs 8,800.
Future sale prices may be varied by GOSL in the light of any increased cost
of development, however, expressed in constant terms, they are expected to
remain at the present level. The basis for the current sale price has been
calculated as follows:
2.5 ac farm land plus 0.5 ac homestead lot            Rs
Undeveloped value of the land                         600
Jungle clearing and stumping                        2,500
Leveling and farm layout                            1,300
Field channels                                      3,800
Special assistance /a                                 680
Total               8,880
/a   See para 14.
Establishment of Settlers
13.       The entry of settlers on the land would be timed so that irrigation
water would be available to each individual farm within three months of entry.
1/   Average of two projected financial farm gate prices.



ANNEX 10
Page 4
At entry, all land would have been cleared, stumped and cross-ripped (where
necessary in forested areas) and also would have been given a single plowing
to help with land shaping. Where land shaping is necessary, the settlers
would be given the choice of doing the work themselves (manually) or having
it done by MDB. If they do it themselves, they would be paid at unit rates
by MDB. If the works would not be completed within two years, the work
would be taken over and completed by MDB. Settlers would also be paid for
construction of soil conservation bunds and other on-farm works required
such as drainage ditches. (The cost of the above on-farm development would
be included in the purchase price of the land, see para 12.)
14.       The settlers would also be given the following special assistance
(to be repaid):
Materials for temporary hut          Rs 100
Seed and planting materials             250
Field tools                             100
Subsistence allowance @ 50/month
for five months (cash payment)        250
Total             680
World Food Program (WFP)
15.       Under an agreement between GOSL and WFP, every settler family (up
to a maximum of five members) would receive free food aid for a period of
12 months. The present agreement expires in March 1977 but it is expected
that it will be extended. The monthly amount per a family of five persons
is approximately as follows:
flour         92 lbs.
dhall           8 lbs.
dried fish      8 lbs.
skim milk       5 lbs.
sugar           3 lbs.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT 'II
Cultivation Practices, Cropping Patterns and Yields
Genera:L
1.        The proposed project covers an area of 106,000 ac of which 35,000
ac are old irrigated land and 71,000 ac are undeveloped land. Irrigation
infrastructure has been completed by the GOSL for 6,100 ac (Hi) of undevel-
oped land and it is presently under construction for 24,600 ac. The remain-
ing 40,300 ac of undeveloped land would be provided with irrigation infra-
structure under the proposed project. At full development, the cultivation
practices, cropping pattern and yields of the land under development would
be similar to that in the old irrigated area. Since most of the production
benefits of the proposed project would come from the irrigation development
of 40,300 ac of undeveloped land, the discussion below is confined to this
area.
Present Situation
2.        Irrigation Cultivation.  Paddy is the main irrigated crop grown
during both maha and yala seasons. Maha paddy is broadcast, row-drilled
or transplanted during October-January and harvested during January-April.
Yala paddy is planted between February and April and harvested during May-
July. Transplanted paddy is not popular with the farmers in the project
area due to the lack of assured water supply. Cultivation is mostly carried
out by manual labor except for plowing, tilling and leveling which is
generally done by buffaloes, four-wheel tractors and to a lesser extent,
two-wheel tractors. Harvesting and threshing are also not fully mechanized.
3.        Since the soil is very hard when dry, a considerable amount of water
is used in field preparation (saturation and leveling). Because of this
practice, land preparation in the maha season usually does not begin until
the tanks are sufficiently filled to ensure a crop. This results in a delay
of the maha planting season and consequently, insufficient use is made of rain-
fall. During the yala season, the soil is softened and less water is required
for land preparation. However, yala planting is also delayed partly by the
delays in starting the maha paddy crop and partly by the need to harvest
crops planted on the slash and burned (chena) land (para 4).
4.        Chena Cultivation.  Slash and burn (chena) agriculture is practiced
in nearly all jungle areas. Clearing and land preparation commences in June
or July, depending on the nature and density of the vegetation, and is norm-
ally completed in August, followed by burning. Sowing and planting on the
120



ANNEX 11
Page 2
chena land commences with the rains towards the end of September and extends
to the end of November. Cereals (kurakkan, maize and sorghum) are normally
planted first, followed by chillies and pulses (principally cow peas). Because
of an unreliable water supply from the tanks to ensure a paddy crop, most farmers
look upon chena cultivation as their major source of food. For this reason,
only when the chena crops are secured does the farmer and his family transfer
attention to the paddy lands. In the meantime, much of the rainfall has been
wasted. In addition, since some of the farmers are likely to plant paddy as
early as when the maha season commences, irrigation of late planted paddy is
difficult to correlate with the requirements of paddy planted earlier. This
results in increased irrigation losses and wastage.
5.        Chena Crops.  Cereals crops such as kurakkan, maize and sorghum are
grown in the maha season (under rainfed conditions). Sorghum has recently been
expanding as good varieties have become available from India and these ratoon-
well in Sri Lanka. Maize has not been grown successfully in the area due to
pest and bird damage as well as its succeptibility to waterlogging in periods
of heavy rains. However, investigations at the Maha Illupalama Research Center
show that both sorghum and maize can be grown successfully under irrigation,
especially, on the more permeable soils. Pulse crops such as cow peas, black
and green grams and pigeon peas are presently grown under rainfed conditions
but trials have been made to grow them following the paddy crop on the irri-
gated lands. This is supported by the good results from the Maha Illupalama
Research Center. The chillies crop which is also grown under rainfed conditions
has become an important cash crop in the area due to the ban on its imports
to Sri Lanka. However, the widespread planting of chillies is constrained
by its high labor requirements as well as intensive use of fertilizer and
pesticides. Oilseed crops such as sesamum are the only crops grown during
yala season due to their low water requirement. This is mainly used to
provide cash income to the farmer.
6.        Present Yields.  Information on present irrigated paddy yields
was obtained from socio-economic surveys conducted by the MDB in January
1975 and from surveys conducted by the Agrarian Research and Training Insti-
tute (ARTI) in Anuradhapura District. The average yield for the project
area during the maha season is estimated to be 0.8 tons per ac. The water
supply in the yala is more unreliable and yields are somewhat lower--about 0.7
tons per ac. Present yields for other crops are based on field observations,
discussions with farmers and extension and research workers and by reference
to survey data.
Future Without Project
7.        Under the "future without project" conditions, water supply in
the tanks would increase slightly due to the return flow from irrigation
of nearby areas. This would lead to a small increase in the yala paddy
acreages and yield in addition to the historic average yield growth rate
(about 2% per annum). It is expected that the areas of chena crops would
increase slightly as some would become stabilized rainfed crops. Yields of
chena crops would increase about 2% per annum.                            121



ANNEX 11
Page 3
Projected Cropping Pattern and Yields under Project
8.        The project would provide irrigation in both maha and yala seasons
to a net irrigated area of 36,300 ac (gross 40,300 ac). Thus, it is projected
that the cultivated area would increase from 14,000 ac at present to about
64,000 ac with the project. The lowland soils (4% of the area), which are
suited only for paddy, would have a cropping intensity of about 185% (95% in
maha aLnd 90% in yala). Due to the high permeability of the upland soils (60%
of the area), a wide range of crops would be grown, mostly non-flooded (up-
land) rice in the maha and cereals, pulses, chillies and oilseeds in the
yala season. The cropping intensity of the upland farms would be about 170%
(90% in maha and 80% in yala). The overall cropping intensity would be 176%.
9.        The main factors which would contribute to increased yields under
the project would be: the increase in quality and reliability of the irriga-
tion supply; the provision of drainage; better cultivation practices result-
ing from a reorganized extension service, as well as an improved distribution
of agricultural inputs (machinery, seeds and pesticides). Research station
yields at Maha Illupalama between 1970 and 1974 have indicated that, if
sufficient water is available, the paddy yields in both the maha and yala
seasons are about equal. However, in the case of maize, sorghum and pulses,
the yields during the yala season would exceed those during the maha. The
difference is due, in part, to more hours of effective sunshine.
10.       Considering the above information as well as farmer practices and
the findings of surveys by the ARTI, it has been concluded that, approximately
five years after the completion of project works (assuming a strengthened ex-
tension service), average yields would be on the following order:
Long Tons per Acre
Maha          Yala
Rice Lowland (broadcast)    1.41            1.41
Rice Upland (drilled)         1.27            -
Cereals                      0.90           1.10
Pulses                       0.50           0.55
Oilseeds                      _             0.75
11.       The proper management of irrigation deliveries would permit pre-
season preparation of maha crops only in September. Maha sowing would be
from September through October for harvesting in January and February. Yala
sowing would be in March through April for harvesting in June through July.
Other changes in agronomic practices expectd with the project would be:
122



ANNEX 11
Page 4
(a) Land preparation for a given unit would be done with mechanical
power within a short time, preferably while dry or following
the first monsoon rains. This would decrease the demands on
stored water for pre-irrigation to soften the soil.
(b) Firm irrigation seasons would be established. This would en-
able shortened crop cycles over the entire service area but re-
quire much greater discipline of farm operation than at present.
(c) Farmers would be trained in proper water management techniques
for efficient use of the irrigation supply. Efforts would be
made to educate the farmers in rotational irrigation (Annex 2)
practices on a 24-hour delivery schedule to further conserve
water and to reduce waste.
Crop calendars and cropping pattern are provided in Figure 1. Present and
projected areas, yields and production are described in Table 1.

SRI LANKA
MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT  II
Crop Inputs and Farm Budgets-
General
1.        Present agricultural practices in the project area and the expected
overall changes in cropping patterns, yields and production due to the project
are described in Annex 11. This Annex discusses the impact on the individual
farm. The purposes of this micro-analysis are:
(a) to estimate the farm incomes for representative farm sizes
in order to determine whether the prospective increases
in farm income would be sufficient to compensate the
farmer and his family for the additional effort and for
other production costs they would have to incur;
(b) to determine the distributional impact of the project
and to compare the income level of the project area
farmers with those of farmers in other areas, and
*(c) to analyze the effects of different Government policies
regarding water charges.
Crop Input Requirements
2.        Present and project unit input requirements under the project
are given in Table 1. The estimated current levels of inputs are based on
interviews with project area farmers and on information obtained from the
MDB f-ield staff, the Department of Agriculture and from several surveys in
similar areas of Sri Lanka. Some improvements in farming practices are as-
sumed for future "without project" conditions. Future requirements under
the project are based on the recommendations by the Department of Agricul-
ture and on observed cultural practices of the progressive farmers of the
area. For the different inputs, the estimates are:
(a) Land Preparation -- Much of the land preparation work in
the area is done on a custom basis. At present land prep-
aration in the upland areas (mostly chena cultivation)
is done by manual labor while in the lowland areas, trac-
tors or bullocks are used. These practices are assumed
to remain basically unchanged in the future if the
1/   This Annex was prepared before the March 1977 re-evaluation.  *The
re-evaluation will have no gignififant effect on the conclusion
reached in this Annex.
126

project is not implemented. The future "with project"
estimates assume that land preparation is done either with
tractors or bullocks for both upland and lowland areas.
For a detailed discussion on the cost estimates of land
preparation, see Annex 13, Appendix 1.
(b) Fertilizers -- The estimated present and future usages of
fertilizers in relation to the recommended applications
for irrigated crops are shown below. It is not expected
that usage will reach an overall 100% of the standard crop
recommendations with the exception of Nitrogen in the case
of paddy.

/b W -- "future with project"
(c) Farm Labor -- Labor requirements for each operation and
crop are presented in Table 1. These estimates are based
on the assumption that land preparation is mechanized with
the introduction of the project. Consequently, labor re-
quirements for land preparation "with project" conditions
will be reduced compared to present and future "without
project" conditions. However, the increase in yields would
increase labor requirements for harvesting and threshing.
The hired labor components are estimated at 30% of total
labor requirements for paddy and chillies and 20% for
other crops. The hired labor is valued at the average
market wage rate of Rs 5.5 per man-day under the "present"
and "without project" situations and Rs 8.2 per man-day
under "with project" conditions. 1/
1/   Increase in demand for farm labor under "with project" conditions will
increase the market wage rate (see para 17).

ANNEX 12
Page 3
Crop Budgets (Table 2)
3.        Crop budgets are based on the financial prices of outputs and inputs
discussed in Annex 13, Appendix 1. The present subsidized prices for fertil-
izer are used for present crop budgets while no subsidies are assumed for the
future.
Choice of Farm Size
4.        Under the present condition, most of the farmers in the project
area cultivate both paddy and chena lands. Since the distribution of farm
size is fluid due to the continuous shift in chena cultivation, the present
and "future without project" conditions are derived by dividing total net
value of production by the estimated number of agricultural families in
the area.
5.        Under project conditions, farm size will be uniform at 2.5 ac but
most farmers will be either on upland soil (60% of the total) or lowland soils
(40% of the total). Different cropping patterns and cultivation methods will
be appliLed and hence two farm models are analyzed (Table 3).
6.        The following assumptions have been made in the analysis of the
farm budgets:
(a) Net Cultivable Land -- Under project conditions, the gross
size of each farm is 2.5 ac. Since a part of this area is
taken up by bunds, ditches, etc., the net cultivable area
is somewhat lower. Consequently, it is assumed that the
net cultivable land is 95% of the gross area.
(b) Crop Yields and Input Requirements -- Present and projected
yields used in the analysis are given in Annex 11. Crop
inputs have been estimated based on the input requirements
discussed above and given in Table 1.
(c) Cropping Patterns -- Lowland farmers would be double cropped
with a cropping intensity of about 185%. Due to the high
permeability of upland soils, a wide range of crops would be
grown; mostly with non-flood (upland) rice in the maha and
chillies, soybeans, groundnuts, cereals and pulses in the
yala. The cropping intensity would be about 170%.
(d) Prices and Subsidies -- The prices used in the analysis are
the financial farm gate prices discussed in detail in Annex
13, Appendix 1. Since two financial prices of various crops
are projected in the future, two farm budgets are estimated.
(e) Irrigation Cost -- At present, no water charges are levied for
tank irrigated paddy. After implementation of the project,
the total charges are assumed to amount to Rs 685 per farm
(para 14).
128



ANNEX 12
Page 4
(f) Homestead Income -- In addition to the ownership of paddy and
chena lands, most of the farmers also derive some income from
tree crops or cash crops grown in the homestead lots. The
average size for homestead lots under present and "future
without "project conditions is around 1.0 ac while it is
reduced to 0.5 ac under project conditions.
(g) Non-farm Income -- The current level is estimated from
the socio-economic survey of a similar area to the project
area around Rs 900 per year per family. The substantial
rise in agricultural income would increase demand for non-
farm services and hence increase employment opportunities
and wage rates. However, the labor requirements on the
family farm would also increase. Due to the lack of data
on consumption patterns and the supply of migrant labor,
it is assumed that the non-farm income will remain unchanged
in the future.
Distribution Effects of the Project
7.        Under the above assumptions, the net farm income, including the
imputed value of the farm produce consumed at home, is estimated to increase
from about Rs 3,200 per year at present to about Rs 8,560 for upland farms
and Rs 7,630 for lowland farms 1/ under "future with project" conditions.
Thus, as the result of the project, the farm incomes would be more than
doubled.
8.        For the new settlers who would be mostly landless laborers from
surrounding areas, the present income levels are unknown. However, they
are likely to be below those for the farmers currently in the project areas.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that without the project, their incomes would
experience any significant gains. Accordingly, the gains for the new set-
tlers would be even higher than those for the existing farmers.
9.        The landholding pattern under project conditions will be uniform.
As a result, it is expected that the income levels will be fairly equal. When
the production is valued at the projected GPS prices, the net incomes for
the lowland farms is around 23% higher than that of upland farms. On the
other hand, the net farm incomes of the upland farms are approximately 13%
higher than that of the lowland farms when the value of production is esti-
mated at the projected average market prices. In addition, since the crop-
ping pattern of the upland farm can be altered in response to the market
opportunities, the disparity between lowland and upland net farm incomes
would not be significant.
10.       In comparing the project area income level with the average national
income, the farm income figures presented above which include the imputed
value of home consumption valued at farm gate prices, have to be adjusted for
1/   At projected market prices.                                         129



ANNEX 12

the difference between farm gate and local retail prices. Consequently, it
is estimated that the farm households have a net annual farm income of about
Rs 3,500 or a per capita annual income of Rs 620. This is 60% of the national
per capita income of about Rs 1,250 per year. In the future, the average
household income in the project area would increase from about Rs 7,600 to
Rs 9,700 per year or a per capita annual income of Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,900 per
year. Assuming that the national per capita income increases about 2% an-
nually, at full development, the project area incomes would be approximately
the same as the national level.
Cost Recovery
11.       At a discount rate of 10% per annum, the present value of the pro-
ject investments in irrigation infrastructure and land development are esti-
mated to be about Rs 180 million or about Rs 4,700 per ac. 1/ In addition,
the 0&M of the irrigation system would require an annual expenditure of about
Rs 80 per ac. Assuming the water charges were introduced after the construc-
tion oE the irrigation infrastructure, a full cost recovery would require a
total charge of Rs 5,250 per ac -- Rs 4,700 for recovery of capital costs and
Rs 550 for O&M costs or an annual charge of about Rs 740 per ac.
12.       The prime vehicle for recovery of capital costs for the project is
the Sale of State Lands Act under which developed land would be sold to the
settlers. The sales price would cover the cost of development below the turn
out and the amount of special assistance to the settlers. At present, the
price is estimated at Rs 8,880 per family (Rs 3,550 per ac of farm land),
which would be paid over 20 years at an interest of 4%. This gives an annual
charge of Rs 650 per farm in current terms. Assuming an expected rate of
inflation of 4.3% per annum (the average rate of inflation in Sri Lanka for
the last 20 years) and the settlement schedule in 1979 for the project area,
the present value of land payment is estimated at about Rs 1,245 per ac or
Rs 3,110 per farm.
13.       Operation and maintenance costs for the project would be recovered
through the Land Betterment Charges Act (LBCA). The LBCA would, inter alia,
enable the Government to impose water charges in all publicly-financed irri-
gation and drainage schemes taking into account factors such as amount and
dependability of water supply, increases in agricultural production, capital
and O&M costs. Detailed regulations for the actual implementation of the
land betterment charges in 1978 are under preparation. For the project, the
GOSL intends to charge Rs 30 per ac for the first three years after the
construction period and full O&M costs (Rs 80 per ac in current terms) for
the irrigation works in the following years. This would give a present value
of about Rs 495 per ac. The proposed level of charges (land payment and
water charges) would give a cost recovery index of 33%.

14.       The price of land is based on the actual costs for development,
and it will be adjusted for inflation. However, once the land is sold to
the settler, the repayment will be fixed in current terms. For families
settled in 1979, it is expected that the annual repayment would amount to
Rs 740 per annum in current terms. Taking into account the expected infla-
tion, it is estimated that the land payment at full development (1986) will
amount to Rs 485 per farm in constant 1976 terms. The betterment charge, at
full development, is estimated at Rs 80 per ac or Rs 200 per farm in constant
1976 terms. These values have been entered in the farm budgets.
Farmer's Repayment Capacity
15.       Project Rent.  For the estimation of the farmer's ability and
willingness to pay water charges, it is necesary to estimate the "project
rent". In simple terms, project rent can be defined as the incremental net
income when all factors of production, except water and relatd services sup-
plied by the project, are given the rewards that are required for their co-
operation. Project rent is equal to the net incremental income less the
necessary rewards to family labor and management for their additional labor
and entrepreneurship.
16.       The calculation is complicated by the uncertainty about the yields
and the crop prices that the farmer can expect. One way of handling this
problem is by introducing explicit probability distributions and a function
that shows the "utility" or "value" of different income levels. Unfortunate-
ly, this would lead to severe estimation problems. A simpler approach is
adopted in this case. The risk aversion of the farmer can be taken into
account by using a certainty equivalent (CE) instead of the expected value
(EV). If the yields have a normal distribution which is known, CE can be
expressed as a function of EV:
CE = EV - n x s
where   s  = the standard deviation
n = a factor that expresses the
farmer's risk aversion.
17.       Some empirical studies indicate that the farmer's choice of crop-
ping patterns and production techniques can be accurately predicted for values
of 'n' in the interval 1 to 2 1/. The value of'n'decreases when the farm size
increases. Since the farm size is small and uniform under "future with pro-
ject" conditions and the farmers are relatively poor, under "future without
project" conditions, n = 2 is applied to all farmers.
1/   These studies, which have been carried out by the Development Research
Center and the South Asia Projects Department, are still unpublished.

18.       The variation in historical yields in the project area is within
roughly 20% from the average values. This gives s = 0.2 x EV. Consequently,
CE = 0.6 x EV. However, under "with project" conditions, it is not likely
that two crops fail in the same year while under "without project" con-
ditions, there is basically one crop during the maha season. Thus, it is
assumed that CE = 0.6 x EV for the "without project" situation and CE =
0.8 x EV for the "with project" situation.
19.       The next problem which arises in the calculation of project rent is
the value of family labor. The overall labor demand would increase substan-
tially from .967 M man-days in the "future without project" situation to 3.9 M
man-days under project conditions. The market wage would move upwards and
family workers would require a somewhat increased return for their labor in
order to compensate for the lost leisure. The increase in average wage for
both hired and family labor with the project is derived from the "S - curve"
with the following assumptions:  (i) during the slack season when less than
50% of labor supply is employed, the wage rate is equal to Rs 5.0 per man-day,
(ii) during peak season when the available labor force is fully employed,
the wage rate is equal to Rs 8.0 per man-day, and (iii) when labor require-
ments exceed the labor supply in the project area, the wage rate is equal
to Rs 10.0 per man-day. This would give an average cost of labor at Rs
5.5 per man-day under the "future without project" situation and Rs 8.2 per
man-day under project conditions.
20.       The reward for management and entrepreneurship can, in part, be
related to the capital employed in the production if this is not included in
the crop production cost. But it is primarily a premium for the special
skills that farm management require. Furthermore, many activities are not
included in the crop labor requirements such as applying for credit, listen-
ing to extension officers, hiring and directing daily laborers, etc. Conse-
quently, it has been assumed that the "management fee" is equal to 10% of
the net returns.
21.       The derivation of project rent also depends on the assumptions for
crop prices. In Sri Lanka, two pricing systems are in operation: the Govern-
ment guaranteed price schemes (GPS) and the market prices. With the exception
of paddy, the free market prices often exceed the guaranteed prices. On the
other hand, the guaranteed prices would assure certain income level as opposed
to the widely fluctuated market prices in response to the change in production.
Due to the existence of this dual pricing system, four estimates of project
rent are derived in Table 4 based on four assumptions of prices:
I.   the present GPS prices;
II.   the prevailing average market prices;
132



ANNEX 12

III.   the projected GPS prices; and
IV.   the projected average market prices. 1/
22.       Project rent varies from Rs 590 to Rs 4,725 per farm.  With the
proposed level of charges indicated above, the rent recovery index, at full
development, ranges from 14% to 114% for upland farms and 26% to 31% for low-
land farms. 2/ This shows that project rent is sensitive to the variations in
projected crop prices. Taking Alternative III (projected GPS prices) as the
basic case, the sensitivity of project rent to price assumption is tested by
shifting the guaranteed prices of paddy and accordingly the cost of labor in-
puts. 3/ This is depicted in the rent recovery index curves shown in Figure
1. For example, a 20% increase in crop prices would mean a 42% increase of
the project rent for upland farms and 36% for lowland farms. The potential
water charge would change from about Rs 550 per ac to Rs 780 per ac for upland
farms and from Rs 1,040 per ac tb Rs 1,400 per ac for lowland farms. Due to
the sensitivity of project rent to price level and the importance of the
Government guaranteed prices for food production in Sri Lanka, a decision
about the exact level of water charges would have to take into account the
expected change in Government agricultural pricing policy.
Critical Consumption Level
23.       The project area farmers and the new settlers are relatively poor
with present consumption level equal to about 40% of the national average
(Rs 1,400). 4/ At full development of the project, their incomes would be
brought up approximately to the national average. In order to estimate the
settlers' ability and willingness to pay water charges, a critical con-
sumption level (CCL) is estimated. Since the GOSL puts a heavy emphasis
on income distribution and the welfare of the lower income group, the CCL
is estimated to be in the range of two-thirds to three-fourths of the
average consumption level. 5/ With the present level of charges, at full
1/   For a detailed discussion on projected prices, see Annex 13, Appendix 1.
2/   Since the land/payment is fixed in current rupees, the rent recovery
index based on discounted present values is slightly higher (Table 5).
3/   Since the projected GPS prices of other crops than rice is based on the
typical ratio between their prices and that of rice, prices of other
crops also vary proportionally. The cost of labor inputs also varies
proportionally if it is assumed that the wage paid is equal to the value
of marginal product of labor. The costs of other inputs are held constant
due to the subsidy and tax structures associated with these inputs.

development, the project area farmers would pay up to about 25%-35% of their
incomes over and above the CCL. Since the family incomes of the settlers
would be only at the same level as the average for the country, this level
of charges would be considered adequate.
24.       Four levels of water charges can be identified in Table 5.  The anal-
ysis indicates that full cost recovery would undoubtedly stretch the farmer's
ability to pay too far. Consequently, the farmer's incentive to use irrigation
water would be impaired. The present proposed level of charge is regarded as
appropriate for the project due to the following reasons:
(a) Income distribution -- the farms are small and even below
the critical consumption level. After full development,
the incomes of the settlers would not exceed the average
per capita income in Sri Lanka;
(1b) Incentives to the settlers -- increased foodgrain production
is an important national objective, the provision of irriga-
tion with associated settlement in the sparsely populated
dry zone is a prime means to achieve this objective. How-
ever, the settlers have to be given proper incentives to
buy the land and to fully develop their new farms;
(c) Government's pricing policies -- the present policy on
taxes and duties and the procurement prices for foodgrains
and other subsidiary crops are biased against the agricul-
tural sector. This imposes an implicit tax on the farmer; and
(d) Tradition -- Sri Lanka has not charged for irrigation water
in the past and there would be considerable opposition from
farmers if the charges are perceived as "too high".

ANNEX 13

SRI LANKA
MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Economic Analysis-/
General
1.        The major components of the project -- irrigation infrastructure,
on-farm development and production support -- are interdependent. The bene-
fits from one component depend on whether the others are implemented. Thus,
they will be evaluated as a package. However, in order to justify the com-
position of the package, benefits and costs associated with each of the
components will also be analyzed separately.
2.        The normal approach for analyzing irrigation projects assumes that
the opportunity cost of water is zero. This assumption cannot be made in
the estimation of the benefits resulting from the on-farm investment and land
preparation by farm tractors which would lead to substantial water savings.
Consequently, the value of water is taken into account in the economic
analysis of these two components.
3.        The economic analysis of the project basically follows standard
Bank methodology. However, instead of using a shadow exchange rate (SER)
to translate foreign exchange costs and earnings into local market prices,
a standard conversion factor (SCF) has been applied to domestic market prices
in order to translate them into border prices. This will not affect the eco-
nomic rate of return of the project since the SCF is directly related to the
SER and the official exchange rate (OER):  OER/SER = SCF.
Basic Assumptions
4.        Standard Conversion Factor (SCF).  An SCF = 0.6 is applied to the
domestic component of the project costs and benefits in the economic analysis.
The sensitivity of the economic viability of the project to this assumption
is tested by using a 20% error in the estimated SCF. The detailed calculation
of the SCF is discussed in Appendix 1.
5.        Savings.  Following Bank standard practice, no premium has been put
on public or private savings. Consequently, public income and private con-
sumption are assumed to be equally valuable.
1/   This Annex was prepared before March 1977 re-evaluation.  If it is
assumed that the re-evaluation will not lead to the introduction of
either higher import duties or quantitative restrictions, the basic
rate of return would fall from 21% to 19%. However, it is more likely
that more quantitative restrictions would be introduced. In this case,
the economic rate of return would remain basically unchanged.

6.        Agricultural Inputs and Outputs.  The economic prices for these
goods are discussed in Appendix 1.
7.        Construction Costs.  The construction of roads, irrigation and on-
farm Lnfrastructure is carried out by heavy equipment, and skilled and un-
skilled labor. For the economic analysis, the conversion factor of each
method is estimated as follows:
(a) Capital-intensive methods: The economic cost for capital-
intensive works is calculated directly from the estimated
input and output factors of machines used in the construction.
The procedure for this calculation presented in Table 1 shows
the build up of the economic cost for ripping operation by a
180-200 hp crawler tractor. The conversion factor for this
operation is 1.10. Similar exercises which are applied to
other types of capital-intensive works give conversion factors
ranging from 1.0 to 1.2. Therefore, the conversion factor
1.10 is applied to all types of capital-intensive works. 1/
(b) Skilled Labor. The skilled labor component is adjusted with
the standard conversion factor of 0.6 to get the economic
costs.
(c) Unskilled Labor. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor is
derived in Appendix 2. This gives a shadow wage rate of
unskilled construction labor at two-thirds of the market
wage rate. Since the unskilled labor component is expressed
in domestic price, a standard conversion factor of 0.6 is
applied for the economic analysis. A summary of the con-
version factors for the construction costs is given below.
Conversion Factor
Capital-Intensive Works                          1.10
Skilled Labor                                    0.6
Unskilled Labor                                  0.4
Construction Costs (weighted average)            0.75
1/   The financial bid prices for the civil works are not translated to
the economic prices by applying the standard conversion factor due to
the following reasons:
(i) the competitive situation for construction companies in Sri
Lanka is such that the price is set at the break-even point.
(Where it is equal to the lowest average variable cost.)
(ii) there are a large amount of indirect taxes in the construction
companies--bid prices which have to be excluded in the economic
analysis.

8.        Sunk Costs.  Most of the investments under the Stage I project,
which diverted Mahaweli water from Polgolla to the Stage II area, were pre-
requisited for the proposed project. Stage I created the potential for
subsequent investments, which would have shorter gestation periods and give
relatively high returns. The sunk costs for the Polgolla diversion do not
affect the economic viability of the proposed project. However, in order to
establish whether the initial decision to provide irrigation to the Stage II
area was sound or questionable, the sunk costs have to be included in the
analysis. The expenditures involved in Stage I are adjusted to the amount of
water allocated to the present project area to derive the sunk cost per acre
for the Stage II area. Detailed analysis is provided in Table 2.
9.        Value of Water.  On-farm development and land preparation by farm
tractors would result in substantial water savings. This water can be pro-
ductively used for increased cultivation. Consequently, if the water is
used for increasing cropping intensities, the opportunity cost of water
saved is estimated. Under project conditions, the average field water re-
quirements are estimated to be about 6,500 m /ac per annum. The net value
of production is estimated at about Rs 2,300 per ac at full development.
This gives an opportunity cost of water about Rs 0.35 per cubic meter.
Various studies on the impact of irrigation on the increase in foodgrains
production also give a value of water in the range of Rs 0.19-0.38 per
cubic meter. 1/ Conservatively, a value of Rs 0.3 per cubic meter of
water at the field outlet is applied in the economic benefits of land
development and farm power investments.
10.       The opportunity cost of water varies depending on the areas
where the water saved is applied. For the project area, where there are
many control structures, the conveyance efficiency is higher than that of
other areas. Consequently, the marginal productivity of water in the
project area is valued at Rs 0.3 per cubic meter whereas the marginal
productivity of water in other areas is valued at Rs. 0.2. 2/
1/   The World Bank's appraisal report on the Andhra Pradesh Irrigation
and Command Area Development Composite Project calculates the oppor-
tunity cost of water about Rs 0.20-0.30 at the field outlet with
the command area development program. An IRRI paper on A Field
Comparision of Rotational and Continuous Irrigation in the Uppoer
Pampanga River Project indicates that for the padddy yield level
of 3.25-3.50 tons per hectare, the application of one cubic meter
of water would result in an increase in production in the range
of 0.12-0.24 kg. At the economic price of paddy Rs 1,600 per ton,
the value of water is about Rs 0.19-0.38 per cubic meter.
2/  Assume conveyance efficiency is 0.5 for other areas compared to
0.75 for the project area.

11.       Based on hydrological studies, it has been estimated that about
30% of water losses are regained further down in the system (Annex 2). Of
the water saved after taking the charge into account, it is assumed that
half would be used for irrigation within the project area and half outside
the project area. This gives an average value of Rs 0.175 per cubic meter.
On Farm Development
12.       On-farm development would result in both higher yields and
increased irrigation efficiencies in the project area. The higher yields
would be a direct benefit to the participating farmers whereas higher
irrigation efficiencies would lead to increased agricultural production
in other areas. To which farmer and to which area the benefits would
accrue would depend on water allocation decisions. If each area were to
be given a fixed water allocation, the higher irrigation efficiency would
result in either a higher cropping intensity or planting of more water
consuming crops. The water saved could, alternatively, be used to irrigate
other areas, thereby benefiting a different group of farmers.
13.       On-Farm Benefits.  Since a major part of the lowland farms in
the project area have been leveled by the farmers, the benefits of a careful
on-farm development program would mainly accrue to the upland crops. It
is estimated that the yields of these irrigated crops would increase by
15% to 25%. At full development, this would mean an increase in benefits
on the order of Rs 400-600 per ac. Land leveling would also result in a
yield decrease as it disturbs the thin layer of top soil. Various
studies 1/ indicate the loss of soil fertility resulting in yield
decreases from 20% to 50% depending on the method of land leveling (i.e.
manually or by bull dozer). Since most of the land leveling and shaping
in the project area is done manually, it is assumed that the yield would
decrease about 20% and 5% in the first and second year, respectively,
if nc additional fertilizer is applied to compensate for the loss of
soil fertility. The following pattern of benefit build-up is assumed
for the on-farm development.

14.       External Benefits.  On-farm development would result in a sub-
stantial saving of water which could be used to increase cropping intensity
withiLn the project area and to irrigate other areas. The net irrigation
water requirements for the various upland crops in the project area is
estimated at about 2,200 m  per ac per year.  Without on-farm development,
1/   A Field Comparison of Rotational and Continuous Irrigation in the
Upper Papanga River Project, IRRI mimeograph, undated.
144



ANNEX 13
Page 5
the field efficiency of upland farms would be around 0.45 whereas it would in-
crease to 0.6 with on-farm develop3ent.  Thus, the investment would result
in a water saving of about 1,200 m per ac. This gives an annual benefit
of about Rs 210 per ac per annum.
15.       A summary of economic costs and benefits is shown in Table 3.  The
economic rate of return is estimated at about 26%.
Farm Tractors
16.       Land preparation by farm tractors would result in labor and water
savings in the project area. It is estimated that land preparation by
manual labor would require about 20 man-days per ac more during maha and
15 man-days more during yala than that by bullock or by tractors. In addi-
tion, since the soils in most of the dry zone areas at the beginning of the
maha and yala cultivation seasons are extremely baked and difficult to
break, cultivation by buffalo or manual labor is either not possible or
would require a substantial amount of water to soften the soils. Conse-
quently, mechanical cultivation would lead to a substantial savings of
water which could, alternatively, be used to increase cropping intensity
within the project area or benefit a different group of farmers in other
areas.
17.       Labor Saving.  As land preparation is normally carried out in
the months of August, September for the maha and January, February for
the yala, the requirement of labor without tractors for this purpose will
exceed the peak monthly labor supply in the project area. The economic
opportunity cost of labor without tractors is then estimated by using the
"S-shaped" curve, described in detail in Appendix 2. This gives Rs 5.5
per man-day. Since land preparation by manual labor would require 20 man-
days per ac in maha and 15 man-days in yala, the cost of this operation
would amount to about Rs 190 per year per ac. The economic cost of land
preparation with a four-wheel tractor is estimated at about 29.00 per hour
for 3.3 hours of primary and secondary tilling per ac (about Rs 94 per ac
per annum).
18.       Water Saving.  The gross field 3irrigation requirements for
various crops is estimated about 6,500 m per ac per season. Since land
preparation with tractors would shorten the duration of the operation and
reduce water requirements to soften the soils, the amount of water saved
could be significant.  Conservatively, it is assumed that 10% of the gjoss
water requirements are saved. This gives water savings of about 650 m per
ac. The benefits of water saved would amount to about Rs 115 per ac. Given
these assumptions, the economic rate of return is estimated at about 20%
(Table 4).
145



ANNEX 13

Extension Services
19.       Two major factors determine the benefits of extension: (i) the aver-
age increase for farmers who follow extension advice and (ii) the number of
farmers who adopt improved techniques. The proposed extension programs in
Sri Lanka would have similar characteristics as the programs that have recently
been introduced in Bank Group-assisted projects in India. The experience so
far has indicated that after two years some 20% to 30% of the farmers are
followers and that their yields have increased some 10% to 20%. The impact
of the extension program is greater in areas which are covered by on-farm
development. Consequently, it has been assumed that about 30% of the farmers
within the project area would be followers (of which 20% are contact farmers)
with yield increases of some 20% to 30%. On the average, this would increase
the value of production by Rs 120-180 per ac per annum compared to the annual
economic cost for extension services of Rs 24 per ac. Consequently, the bene-
fit cost ratio for the extension program is highly favorable.
Marketing, Storage and Processing
20.       The provision of marketing, storage and processing facilities in
the project area would result in savings from handling and storage losses
and transportation costs as well as improvement in quality of rice to the
constumers. The benefits derived from these components have been quantified
as far as possible to be included in the economic analysis of the basic case.
It is conservatively estimated that the inclusion of these components would
reduce the losses in handling, storage and transport from 7% in future with-
out the project to 5% in future with the project.
Social Infrastructure
21.       The economic costs of social infrastructure are excluded from the
basic case of the analysis since the benefits derived from them are basically
unquantifiable. However, as the failure of many settlement schemes in Sri
Lanka shows, these components of the project would be important for the
success of the settlement program, and thus, help to achieve the projected
production increase. For this reason, an economic rate of return for the
project, including the costs for social infrastructure, has been estimated.
However, since most of the benefits of these components are unquantified,
this gives a conservative estimate of the rate of return for the whole proj-
ect package.
Investment Package for the Main Project Area
22.       Economic Rates of Return (ERR).  The main project area would receive
a full package of project components. The economic viability of the invest-
ments in this area is also an indication of the viability of the whole Stage
II dLevelopment. The benefits and costs for the basic case 1/ (excluding
1/   See paragraphs 4 to 8.
146



ANNEX 13
Page 7
agricultural research and social infrastructure) for the assumed 50 year life
of the project are shown in Table 5. The economic rates of return for the
investments in the main project area are estimated at: 1/
(a)  Basic case                    21.2%
(b)  Basic case plus sunk costs   14.4%
(c) Basic case, including sunk
costs plus agricultural
research and social
infrastructure                13.6%
23.       Sensitivity Analyses.  Several tests were made to determine the
sensitivity of the rate of return estimates to various alternative assump-
tions. The results which are summarized in Table 6, show that the project
is moderately sensitive to changes in the standard conversion factor and the
shadow price of labor.
24.       Project Risk.  The project would provide sufficient water for
the proposed cropping pattern. Thus, the risk associated with water supply
is limited. The following tests illustrate the risk associated with other
factors:
Rate of Return
a.   Basic Case                                               21.2%
b.   Construction Cost increase by 15%                        17.3%
c.   Operating Cost increase by 25%                           20.9%
d.   Decrease in net incremental benefits by 25%              16.8%
e.   Construction completed in five years instead
of three years                                         17.1%
f.   Full agricultural development reached after
seven years instead of five years                      19.9%
g.   A combination of c and d                                 15.2%
h.   A combination of c, d, e, and f                          12.2%
February 1977
1/   The ERR attributable to the whole project is not meaningful since
the areas under development would be provided with project components
that are interdependent with investments undertaken by MDB. The proj-
ect should be justified on the basis of the viability of the whole
Stage II development. Since each of the areas would receive the same
package as the main project area, the viability of the Stage II devel-
opment can be extrapolated from the viability of the investments in
the main project area.

Prices for Economic and Financial Analyses
General
1.        The estimated future economic prices of internationally traded
agricultural inputs and outputs are derived from the projected 1985 world
market prices expressed in 1976 currency values with appropriate adjust-
ments for freight, handling and processing. Since pulses and chillies
are not traded internationally in any appreciable quantity, the Bank Group
does not put out price projections for them. The economic prices for these
two crops are then based on the long-term average ratio between their
cif Colombo prices and world market price for rice. 1/
2.        The GOSL operates a guaranteed price scheme for most major crops
in order to encourage production. However, with the exception of paddy,
the free market prices often substantially exceed the Government guaranteed
prices. For the period 1959-1976, the free market price of paddy differed,
on the average less than 5% from the Government guaranteed prices. Typically,
half of the marketed surplus of paddy is sold to the PMB, and consequently the
average farm gate price differs less than 3% from the guaranteed price. For
farm budget analyses, it is assumed that the farm gate price of rice is equal
to the guaranteed price for rice at the 1976 level in constant terms. Two pro-
jected financial prices for other crops are estimates. One is based on the
long-term average ratio of the guaranteed prices of these crops and that of
rice; the other is derived from the typical ratio of their market prices
and the guaranteed prices for rice.
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
3.        Until May 1976, the Rupee was officially valued at a Pound Sterling
rate of US$1 = Rs 15.60. Since then it has been fixed against a "basket" of
currencies. As these currencies are floating, the US Dollar/Rupee exchange
rate is subject to change. Conversions of financial prices have been made
at US$1 to Rs 8.60 which was the short-term average rate prevailing at the
time oE appraisal.
1/   The ratio between rice cif Colombo to rice fob Bangkok (5% broken)
is about 1.03.

4.        In order to promote "non-traditional" exports and to cut-down
on non-essential imports, the Government practices a dual exchange rate
system through the sale and purchase of Foreign Exchange Entitlement
Certificates (FEECs). At present, about 35% of current receipts and 61%
of current payment of foreign exchange are subject to the FEEC rate of
about US$1 = Rs 14.20 (FEEC = 165% of OER).
Standard Conversion Factor (CF) - Shadow Exchange Rate (SER)
5.        In order to take into account the level of protection provided
by tariffs and trade restrictions, an SCF is applied to the price of non-
traded goods and to consumption. In the absence of trade restrictions,
the SCF can be approximately calculated through the formula:
SCF =X+M
X + S  -T  + FEEC  + M + TM + FEECm
where X  = fob value of exports at OER
M  = cif value of imports at OER
S  = export subsidies
T  = export taxes
TM = import duties
FEEC = FEECs on exports
FEEC = FEECs on imports
6.        For 1975, this calculation gives SCF = 0.75.  Since this estimate
does not take into consideration the quantitative restrictions, 1/ it pro-
vides only an upper limit for the SCF. The unofficial market rate of Rs 15
to 20 2/ gives a lower estimate of about 0.50 for SCF but this estimate
partially reflects the demand for luxury imports and for capital flight.
7.        Absence of any economy-wide models and the presence of a complicated
system of import restrictions, taxes and duties makes it difficult to estimate
a correct value of SCF. For the purpose of economic analyses, an SCF of
0.60 has been used. This gives a SER approximately equal to the FEEC rate. 3/
1/   Since 1970, imports on subsidiary crops such as chillies and pulses
and vegetables were banned.
2/   Mission's estimate.
3/   The SCF is directly related to the SER and the OER:  SCF = OER

In order to test the sensitivity of the economic viability of the project
to this assumption, the analyses have been done assuming a 20% error in
the estimated SER. The resulting SERs and SCFs are:
US$1 = Rs
Official Exchange Rate                              8.6
FEEC Rate                                          14.2
SER:  Base Case (SCF = 0.60)                       14.3
SER:  Alternative 1 (SCF = 0.50)                   17.2
SER:  Alternative 2 (SCF = 0.75)                   11.5
Prices of Agricultural Outputs
8.        The economic prices for rice, cereals, pulses, and chillies are
based on their border prices at the official exchange rate.  The domestic
cost components (i.e. local transport and marketing charges) are adjusted
by the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.6.
9.        The economic prices for non-traded outputs such as sesamum and
vegetables are derived by multiplying the economic prices of paddy to the
ratio between the financial prices for these crops and the price for paddy.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs
10.       Fertilizers.  Fertilizers in Sri Lanka have been sold with a 50%
subsidy since the late 1960s except for a few months in 1974 when the subsidy
was eLimanated inspite of record high world market prices. The ratio between
fertilizer price and paddy price during the 1970s has been favorable (an
average of 0.75). Even during the short period of non-subsidy, the price
ratio was around 1.5. Consequently, as the projected world market prices
for fertilizer have declined substantially from their 1974 levels, they
are thus projected to remain well below those levels or substantially reduced.
The present farm budgets are calculated with the prevailing rate of subsidy
while the future farm budgets are based on the assumption that all subsidies
would be removed.
Diesel Fuel
11.       The price of petroleum is expected to remain on its present level
of about US$11.6 per barrel fob Ras Tanura (Saudi Arabia). The prevailing
financial price of Diesel Fuel Rs 5.30/gallon is assumed for the farm budget
analysis and an economic price of Rs 4.3/gallon when taxes are deducted and
the domestic cost components are adjusted with a standard conversion factor
(SCF) of 0.6.

Land Preparation
12.       Much of the land preparation work in the project area is done
on a custom basis either by bullocks or tractors. The prevailing rental
charge for tractors is Rs 190/ac and for a pair of buffaloes four bushels
of paddy per ac, excluding driver. 1/ The cost of land preparation by
bullocks is around Rs 212 (the cost of paddy is Rs 33 per bushel plus
the wage rate of farm labor estimated at ten man-days per ac for Rs 8 per
day). However, since there is a credit element in the rental charges for
bullocks, it is assumed that the average financial prices for land pre-
paration is Rs 190 per ac whether it is done by animal or farm power. For
economic analysis, the estimates of rental charges per ac for four-wheel
tractors, two-wheel tractors and bullocks are derived in Appendix 2. Since
the economic cost of land preparation by each method is roughtly equal, it
is assumed that the economic cost is Rs 100/ac(Table 2).
Agricultural Labor
13.       The peak wage rate for farm labor is around Rs 8 per day for men
and Rs 6 per day for women and children. During the slack period (Yala
season), the wage rate is around Rs 5 per day for man and Rs 3 for woman
and children. The economic cost of labor is based on a seasonally adjusted
opportunity cost in terms of output forgone in alternative employment. The
details of the analyis are given in Appendix 2.

MAHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Farm Labor Analysis 1/
General
1.        The settlers in the project area are predominantly engaged in
subsistence farming. It consists of paddy cultivation under village tank
schemes, chena cultivation on upland soils and planting tree and cash crops
on the homestead lots. The cultivated area per family is small and the
average farm income low. Consequently, temporary work on the non-farm sector
has become one of the major sources of providing income. Little employment
data exist for the projet area but some rough estimates can be presented based
on the socio-economic surveys (1975-75) by the MDB as well as the 1971 census
of the whole island.
2.        Because of relatively high underemployment, current wage levels
(reported in the project area) problably overstated the economic opportunity
cost of farm labor. For the economic analysis, the opportunity cost of labor
has been derived from the "S-shaped" curve (shown in Figure 1). The assump-
tions behind the curve are discussed below.
Labor Supply
3.             Population.  Based on prelimninary results from the 1976 socio-
economic survey carried by the MDB, it is estimated that there are around 6,900
families living in the area, of which 10% are engaged in non-agricultural activ-
ities. As the project is implemented the landholding pattern is recognized and
additionmal families will be brought into the project area. Under "without
project" conditions, it is assumed that the existing population wil lgrow at a
rate of 2% per annum. 2/
4.        In Sri Lanka, women from low income families do work in the fields
but the participation rate is lower than that of men. Based on the results of
the Land and Labor Utilization Survey in 1975 by the Central Bank of Ceylon,
1/   The analysis is restricted to the main project area (H4 and H5).  Since
the employment situation and cropping patterns are similar for all other
areas, the qualitative results apply to the whole project area.

1963-74.

the labor force participation rate for females is approximately 20%, whereas
it is 54% for males in the rural area, or an average of 37%. Since labor
requirements for the project area are estimated in terms of man-day equi-
valent, the labor force participation rate for the project area is adjusted
downward to 33%.
5.        Farm Labor Supply.  In the present situation, around 10% of the
existing families in the project area are engaged in non-agricultural activ-
ities such as trade and commerce, Government services and construction. Based
on the experience in Hl area, it is expected that the existing non-agricul-
tural faAilies will be accommodated in the new scheme to provide services for
the new settlers.  In addition, the increase in total population in the proj-
ect area will also increase the demand for non-agricultural activities such as
education and health, trade and commerce. Thus it is assumed that the pro-
portion of non-agricultural families will remain constant in the future.
6.        In the project area, some members of the existing agricultural
families are also engaged in permanent non-agricultural activities. The re-
sults from the socio-economic surveys indicate that roughly 10% of the work-
ing members of agricultural households are permanently employed in non-farm
sectors. Under "without project" and "with project" conditions, it is also
assumed that 10% of total labor force from the farm families will be perman-
ently employed outside agriculture as the result of the increase in the de-
mand for non-agricultural services. The estimates of farm labor supply per
annum given below, have been made using 250 days per year. This allows for
less than a full day's work for the young and the old who are included in
the labor force estimate and for people working long hours during the peak
months of agricultural activities (the peak monthly labor supply is higher
than the average for the year).

Labor Demand
7.        Farm Labor.  Estimates of monthly farm labor requirements for
various crops are given in Table 1. Estimates of total monthly demand are
given in Table 2. In total, the project would increase farm employment
from about 0.74 M man-days in future "without project" to 3.91 M man-days
per annum. The increase in demand for labor arises from the significant
increase in cropped areas as well as more intensive land use.
8.        Non-Farm Employment.  The project would offer scope for a substan-
tial rise in agricultural income and hence generate additional income and
employment in the non-farm sector. The lack of reliable data on non-farm
employment at the present situation and data on consumption patterns in the
project area makes it extremely difficult to project accurately the employ-
ment effect in the future. However, experience from similiar areas in
Asia indicates that an increase in agricultural production of Rs 15-20,000
would generate one man-year of employment in the local non-farm sector. 1/
As a result of the project, the gross value of agricultural production
would increase by some Rs 150 M, the increase in non-farm employument would
be on the order of 9,000 man-years, of which about 8,000 man-years would be
attributed to the increased production in the main project area (H4 and H5).
9.        Homestead Employment.  As mentioned in Annex 12, the farmers in
the project area also derive some income from tree crops or cash crops grown
in the homestead lots. Based on the results from the socio economic survey
of the project area, it is estimated that labor requirements for homestead
farming are 30 man-days per family under present and future project "without
conditions" and 15 man-days in future "with project".
Economic Opportunity Cost of Farm Labor
10.       Scarcity of detailed data on farm income levels, off-farm employ-
ment opportunities and the agricultural labor force profile makes the evalu-
ation of economic shadow rates for farm labor extremely subjective. Economic
farm labor costs were estimated by using monthly shadow wage rates reflecting
different opportunity costs associated with various segments of the labor
force and slack and peak periods during the year.
11.       On the basis of avalilable information from the project area and
experience from similar areas, it is postulated that the marginal opportunity
cost of farm labor can be represented by an "S-shaped" curve. The marginal op-
portunity cost of farm labor is positive at all levels of demand and increases
1/ Draft Report on Rural Non-Farm Employment and Earning Opportunities
in Rural Areas and Town, Development Economics Department.
165



ANNEX 13
Appendix 2

when more labor is absorbed into field work. The increase in the opoportun-
ity cost is initially slow and reflects the scarcity of alternative pro-
ductive employment, but it is more rapid when full labor supply is utilitized.
At employment level above the maximum available in the area, the opportunity
cost would again increase at a slower rate since a large number of migrants
would be attached to the project area from neighboring areas where there is
substantial underemployment. In practice, it is reasonable to approximate
this idealized "S-shaped" curve by three straight segments.
12.       Figure 1 gives the curve of approximate shadow rates used in the
analysis. The curve shows the estimated marginal opportunity cost of labor
as a function of demand (expressed as a proportion of the supply). The shape
of the curve is based on the following assumptions.
(a) at minimum employment levels, the marginal cost would be
the value of additional consumption needed for family
members to undertake field work (Rs 1.5 per man-day 1/)
plus the value of foregone activities such as fishing, home
improvements, etc., (Rs 0.5 per man-day);
(b)  when the monthly labor employment just exceeds the off-
peak family labor supply (taken as 50% of the full supply),
the marginal cost would be the slack market wage rate
(Rs 5.00 per man-day 2/);
(c) at a monthly labor demand corresponding to the present
peak level, the marginal cost would be equal to the maximum
market rate (Rs 8.00 per man-day);
(d) when the employment is equal to or larger than the
estimated supply of farm labor from the area, the labor
would be drawn from the non-farm activities and opportunity
cost would increase to about Rs 10 per man-day, since at
this wage, a large number of migrants would be attracted
to the project area.
13.       The economic opportunity cost of farm labor, expressed in border
prices, is equal to the area under the curve to the employment level for
each month multiplied by the SCF. The increased monthly labor cost due to
the project is shown in Table 2.
1/   Taken as 75% of the current average daily consumption of foodgrains.
2/   Farm family members of the labor force not regularly employed else-
where during slack periods.

14.       The total labor requirement will increased from .97 M man-days
with the project to 3.91 M man-days with the project. The economic cost
for this increase is Rs 8.98 M which gives an implicit cost of Rs 3.00 per
man-day.

Construction Labor Analysis
General
1.        The construction of irrigation infrastructures such as distributaris,
field channels and minor drains in the project area has been traditionally
carried out by the labor intensive method. In addition, a large part of
jungle clearing and on-farm works such as land levelling and construction of
bunds are also expected to be contracted to local labor.
2.        The main source of supply of construction labor comes from the
settlers in and around the project area whose employment opportunities
are restricted to chena cultivation and temporary work in non-farm sector.
With the exception for the maha season, the unemployment and underemployment
rates are high. Consequently, the traditional method of valuing construction
labor at the market wage rate would overstage its economic opportunity cost.
Hence, for the economic analysis, shadow wage rate for construction labor
is derived.
Economic Opportunity Cost of Construction Labor
3.        The output foregone in alternative employment of the settlers in
the project area is represented by the net income from chena and homestead
cultivations and from employment in non-farm sector. Since chena cultivation
consists of cereals, chillies, pulses in the maha and sesamum in the yala,
it is assumed that the cropping pattern for the upland crops in the project
area is also applied for chena crops. The average chena acreage for families
who do not have any paddy land is 1.6 ac. The income from chena cultivation
is approximately Rs 1,120 per family. Homestead cultivation yields a net
income approximately Rs 200 a year and non-farm employment Rs 900 per annum.
4.        The estimated average labor supply per family is based on a labor
force participation rate of 33% and assuming 250 working days per year. The
financial opportunity cost of construction labor (Rs 5.0 per man-day) is
estimLated to be about two-thirds of the wage rate for construction labor in
the project area (Rs 7.50 per man-day). The economic cost per man-day,
expressed in border prices, is derived by adjusting the financial opportunity
cost by the SCF of 0.6.
