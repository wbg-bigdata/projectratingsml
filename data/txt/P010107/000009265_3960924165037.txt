PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
SRI LANKA
.AHAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II (CREDIT 701-CE)
MAHAWELI GANGA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT (CREDIT 979-CE)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of two Mahaweli development projects
in Sri Lanka. Credit 701-CE in the amount of US$19.0 million was approved
in April 1977 for the Mahaweli Ganga Development Project II (Mahaweli II).
The last disbursement was made on February 6, 1986 followiug extensions of
the closing date from June 30, 1983 to June 30, 1985. A total of US$7.69
million was cancelled on February 6, 1986.   Credit 979-CE in the amount of
US$3.0 million was approved in January 1980 for the Mahaweli Technical
Assistance Project (Mahaweli TA Project). It was originally expected to be
comple':ed in 1982 and closed in September 1982 but the closing date was
extended three times, to September 1985, and the credit account was left
open thereafter  until  June  1986.    Extensions  were  granted to finance
additional urgent studies requested by Government. The final disbursement
was made on May 14, 1986 and the remainder of the IDA credit for a total of
US$1.1 million cancelled.
Both Mahaweli projects benefitted from cofinancing. Mahaweli II
was  cofinanced  by  Canada  (an   interest-free  loan  of  US$6.0  million
equivalent), the Netherlands (US$5.0 million equivalent), UK (a grant of
US$7.2 million equivalent) and USA (US$5.0 million). The contributions by
Canada, UK and USA were for tied procurement of equipment and for
construction of rural works under parallel financing arrangements. The
Netherlands  contribution was   untied   in   joint  financing with  IDA.
Subsequently, a further contribution of 2 million Units of Account (about
US$2.4 million equivalent at the time) was granted by the Commission of the
European Communities to help the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) defray the
cost of local expenditures. The Mahaweli TA Project was cofinanced with an
EEC Special Action  Credit  of  US$2.0 million  equivalent.   Like the IDA
Credit it was extended three times. About US$280,000 equivalent of the EEC
Special Action Credit was ultimately cancelled.
The audit report consists of an audit memorandum prepared by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED), a Project Completion Report (PCR)
on the Mahaweli II Project dated March 1987 prepared by the former Irriga-
tion I Division in the South Asia Projects Department on the basis of a
draft project completion report dated June 1984, which was prepared by the
staff of the Planning and Monitoring Unit of the Mahaweli Authority of Sri
Lanka and a PCR on the Mahaweli TA Project dated June 30, 1986 prepared by
the same division also on the basis of a draft PCR prepared by the
Borrower. The audit memorandum is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal



- ii -
Report for the Mahaweli II Project (Report No. 1487a-CE dated March 31,
1977); the President's Reports (Mahaveli II: No. P-2021-CE dated April 7,
1977; Mahaweli TA: No. P-2686-CE dated January 10, 1980); the Credit
Agreements (for Mahaweli II dated June 27, 1977; and for Mahaweli TA dated
April 16, 1980);  and  the  PCRs.    Correspondence  with  the Borrower and
internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank
files have also been consulted, and local representatives of cofinancers
and Bank staff associated with the projects have been interviewed.
An OED mission visited Sri Lanka in July'August 1987. Discussions
were held with project and Government officials and project beneficiaries
who were interviewed  during  visits  to  project  sites.   The information
obtained  during  the  mission was  used  to  test  the  validity  of  the
conclusions of the PCRs.
The audit concurs with the principal pcints made in the two PCRs.
Points discussed in the audit memorandum have been selected because of
their relevance and importance for these and other Bank-supported projects.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower and cofinanciers for
their comments on May 24,  1988.    Corments received have been attached to
the PPAK as an annex.
The valuable assistance provided during the preparation of the
report by the Government of Sri Lanka and the executing agencies and the
hospitality received during the field trips is gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
SRI LANKA
MARAWELI GANGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II (CREDIT 701-CE)
MAHAWELI GANGA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT (CREDIT 979-CE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       Sri Lanka is a tropical island with distinctly livided wet and dry
zones (see map). The vet zone encompasses the southwest quadrant of the
island, or about 302 of the land  area.   At the time of project appraisal,
the wet zone supported more than three-quarters of the nation's population
and accounted for about  822  of  the  cultivated  land.   The dry zone was
relatively undeveloped although it wso  there  that the an.ient Singhalese
kings developed a highly advanced and ingenious irrigation system.
2.       During most of the  project  implementation  period, Sri Lanka has
experienced an unprecedented economic growth. Per capita incomes were much
higher and unemployment much lower than a decade ago (before 1977). The
expansion of economic activity also bonefitted the population below the
poverty line. However, the Government is now confronted with the most
difficult economic (slowing growth, rising unemployment, precarious fiscal
and balance of payment situation) and political problems since it took
office in 1977.
3.       About 751 of Sri Lanka's  population  resides in rural areas, with
some 45Z of the total active labor force directly employed in agriculture.
While agriculture has declined as a percent of GDP it continues to make a
significant contribution to both export earnings and Government revenue.
4.       Bank lending for agriculture started in 1968 with three Irrigation
projects; it accelerated in the second half of the 1970s, and also became
more  diversified.    Apart  from more  Irrigation  projects,  It included
treecrop   rehabilitation,   rural   development,   dairy,   forestry   and
agricultural support  services.    As  of  December  31,  1987, lending for
agriculture amounted to about US$550 million, or Jus% under half of total
lending to Sri Lanka.
5.       The largest  share  of  agricultural  lending was for Irrigation,
US$222 million or 441 of total lending for agriculture; about 751 of it in
support of the Mahaweli program.    Five Mahaweli projicts were financed by
the Bank. The Bank's earliest irrigation projects primarily provided the
physical infrastructure necessary to distribute irrigation water, or to
protect and reclaim irrigated areas. Increased food production, In support
of the Government's self-sufficiency policies, was the main project
objective.
6.       The five loanslcredits in  support  of  the Mahaweli Gangs program.
were for discrete elements of the  program.   Except for the first project,



- viii -
which included a power station, the Bank has only supported the downstream
development of the Mahaweli program (irrigation and related supporting
services, as well as technical assistance).
7.       The Bank's first  financed  Mahaweli  project (1970) is completed.
Despite implementation delays of about two years, the project was regarded
as economically and socially successful. The main reasons for success were
considered to be sound project design, continued support from government
agencies, and the ability of farmers to adapt to the rigorous time frame
imposed by double cropping.    However,  certain problems remained, such as
cost recovery, monitoring and evaluation, effective water management, and
illegal occupation of  land.    Although  these  problems were addressed in
follow-up projects, they have remained critical issues until today.
Obiectives
8.       The main objectives of the overall  Mahaweli program are:  (i) the
reduction  of  unemployment  by   creating  short-term  and  long-term  job
opportunities; (ii) the increase of agricultural production, particularly
rice, to achieve food self-sufficiency; and (iii) the alleviation of power
shortages. The Mahaweli I: Project would complete the irrigation and
development in Mahaweli system H area (see maps), and provide productive
support and social services throughout the system area. In this context
the project would provide employment and substantial incremental production
of rice, as well as other output (pulses, chilies, Vegetables and
oilseeds).
9.       The Mahaweli TA Project aimed  to support the Government's efforts
to accelerate implementation of the Mahaweli development program by
assisting with studies for conveying and utilizing surplus Mahaweli Ganga
water to develop land in any of three alternative areas in order to select
the best plan for a future transbasin diversion project. Technical
assistance was also to be provided for detailed engineering and design for
downstream development of head works already committed to be constructed.
Finally, support for unspecified studies and designs, to be identified by
the Mahaweli Development Authority, were also;"included in the Mahaweli TA
project.
Implementation Experience
10.      Work on the  Mahaweli  II  Project was  started by the Government
without prior consultation with the  Bank.    The Government decided at the
end of 1977 to accelerate the project ahead of schedule but this resulted
in poor quality of works, excessive water conveyance losses and operation
and maintenance costs  higher  than  anticipated.   Project implementation,
however, improved in 1979/80 and progress as well as quality of works were
satisfactory. Implementation slowed down again in 1981, mainly due to
budget restrictions. In the end, instead of completing the project ahead
of schedule the Credit had to be extended twice.
11.      The Government's strong commitment to the project was reflected in
adequate levels of funds and staff allocated to the project during most
years.   Management  and  organization  of the Mahaweli Ganga development
scheme were excellent.



- ix -
12.      The  Mahaweli  TA  Project  was  successful  and  all  studies and
activities identified at time of approval were executed. Consultants were
selected expeditiously for the Transbasin study and fielded just two months
after  Credit  effectiveness.      Equally   fast  was  the  contracting  of
consultants for the Minipe Right Bank Review which led to the successful
completion of the largest irrigation canal in Sri Linka. Due to financial
and other considerations, funds for studies not identified during project
preparation remained uncommitted despite Credit extensions. In retrospect,
the envisaged implementation period of two years was unrealistic.
Results
13.      The Mahaweli II Project should  be considered successful in regard
to attaining major objectives such as land development, settlement, and
crop production but there is scope for further development. The project
created employment for a large number of unemployed and inched Sri Lanka
close to becoming self-sufficient in  food.    However, the project ERR has
been recalculated at -11 mainly due to much lower actual and forecast
prices for rice than the price forecasts at the time of appraisal.
14.      The Mahaweli  TA  Project  made  a valuable  contribution  to the
accelerated implementation of the Mahaweli program (AMP). It also provided
valuable on-the-job training of counterpart staff by the consultants during
their work assignments.
Sustainability
15.      The  Mahaweli  program  has   been  considered  a  cornerstone  of
development efforts by  all  Sri  Lanka  Governments.    The projects under
review have been succeeded by two more Bank-assisted projects. From the
side of Government there is full commitment to the program and the
development authorities have proven their management capabilities. Farmer
participation is also assured in light of lacking employmentifarming
opportunities elsewhere in the  country.    The  real  question is how this
commitment can be transformed into realistic and lasting sustainability.
Findinzs and Lessons
16.      The principal findings,  which  show  relevance  for other project
situations as well, that emerge from the evaluation of these two projects
are:
-  As shown by the problems  (negative  impact on costs, poor quality)
caused by the accelerated startup of the Mahaweli II Project and
the inability of Government to select the unidentified studies in
the Mahaweli TA Project, the Mahaweli Ganga projects once again
demonstrate the need for proper planning prior to starting work
(PPAM,  paras.  28  and  41,  Mahaweli  II  PCR,  paras.  3.02  and
7.02-7.03, and Mahaweli TA PCR, paras. 4.06-4.07 and 7.01).
-   Reliance on  small  contractors  is  unjustified  without  a proper
assessment of overall capacity of the contras ting industry and
competing  demands  for  its  services   at  tbe  time  of  project



appraisal. Coordination between various Baik activities is also
warranted in this context (EPAM, paras. 55-61);
Technical supervision was of high quality and staff continuity had
a positive impact.   However,  there  are  limits to what technical
supervision can be expected to solve in relation to "macro" issues
such as cost recovery and water charges (PPAMI, paras. 51-54);
Two years for a technical assistance project is unrealistic,
especially if it includes components that have to be defined during
implementation (PPAM, para. 42 and Mahaweli TA PCR, para. 7.02);
Project sustainability depends on sustaining the interest of
participating  farmers.    This  requires  better  consultation and
dialogues with farmers and  training  of farm leaders (PPM, paras.
45-48); and
While planning at the "micro" level (day-to-day management and
execution) was well taken care of, "macro" planning received less
attention. However, to ensure sustainability would require more
focus on long-term changes and the development of alternative
scenarios to meet such changes (PPM, paras. 49-50).

I. BACKGROUND AND SETTING
A. Introduction
1.       Bank lending to Sri Lanka (as  of  December 31, 1987) for 54 proj-
ects amounted to about US$1.2 billion (see also Annex 1). The lending
program is largely concentrated on agriculture and power with the remainder
scattered over other sectors as Table 1 below showst

2.       Bank lending for agriculture  started  in  1968.  Three irrigation
projects were approved in 1968-70, which fitted the Goverament's objective
of increasi'g food pr._uction,  but  they were  designed without a clearly
defined Bank scracegy for the agricultural sector as a whole. Sector know-
ledge was subsequently updated through an agricultural policy and programs
review mission which visited the country in 1974 to identify lending oppor-
tunities. Lending for agriculture accelerated in the second 'nalf of the
1970s, and also became more diversified.   Apart from more irrigation proj-
ects, it included treecrop rehabilitation, rural development, dairy, for-
estry and agricultural support services.    As  of December 31, 1987, gross
lending for agriculture amounted to US$550 million, or just under half of
total lending to Sri Lanka.



- 2 -
3.       As expressed in various documents,  the main element of the Bank's
strategy since 1974 has been to help alleviate the country's foreign
exchange constraints by supporting measures to increase agricultural output
and exports. Furthermore, the Bank saw its agricultural program as a vehi-
cle to obtain policy changes in the agricultural sector, including cost
recovery in irrigation. The Bank has also supported the Government's rural
development program to raise productivity, employment and living standards
of the rural population. More recently, the Bank has attached high prior-
ity to the maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing capital stock in
all productive activities.
4.       To date OED has evaluated 15 projects in Sri Lanka; evaluations of
another 7 are in  progress  (details  in  Annex  2).   In addition, OED has
undertaken an impact evaluatlon of the Lift Irrigation Projectl/ and
reviewed the World Bank/Sri Lanka relationship.2/ The Mahaweli Ganga Devel-
opment Project II (hereafter referred to as Mahaweli II) was the Bank's
sixteenth lending operation in  Sri  Lanka.    The Mahaweli Ganga Technical
Assistance Project (hereafter referred to as Mahaweli TA) was the third
lending operation in support of the Mahaweli program (see PPAM, para. 20).
B. Economic Development
5.       Policies pursued by  various  governments  have changed over time,
and as a result so  did  socio-economic  development.   Four periods can be
distinguished: 1956-1965; 1965-1970; 1970-1977; 1977 to present. All
governments in Sri Lanka have been committed to welfare, equality and the
alleviation of poverty and have seen economic growth as an important objec-
tive. However, strategies to achieve growth have differed. The periods
1956-65 and 1970-77 were characterized by a less open economy, emphasis on
import substitution, a diminished role for foreign aid and advice, nation-
alization, public enterprises and an expansion of government control. The
periods 1951-55, 1965-70, 1977 to the present relied more on private enter-
prise and price incentives, opening up the economy, stressing export devel-
opment, and attracting foreign resources--aid, foreign private investment
and foreign loans--with more emphasis on agriculture.3/
6.       Since 1977, Sri  Lanka  has  experienced an unprecedented economic
growth of 5.6Z per year. Per capita GDP is now 402 higher, in real terms,
and the rate of unemployment is much lower than a decade ago. Albeit at a
lower rate than the average, the population below the poverty line has also
benefitted from the expansion in economic activity. There are, however,

clear indications of a reversal in economic performance and the Government
is now confronted with the most difficult economic problems it has had to
face since it took  office  in  1977.    Growth is slowing, unemployment is
rising, the fiscal situation is precarious, and a balance of payments
crisis is not unlikely. The reasons for the deterioration of the economy
are complex. They can be related to both external and internal adverse
developments.
7.       Prices of Sri Lanka's  traditional  exports, tea, rubber and coco-
nuts, have been at their lowest  level  since World War II.  The deteriora-
tion in Sri Lanka's terms of trade  (about 30% since 1978),  thk 1uotas set
by developed countries on Sri Lanka's exports of garments, the more recent
stagnation in workers' remittances from the Middle East as a result of the
decline in the price of oil, the reduced flow of tourists, and higher for-
eign exchange expenditures related to national security have all contrib-
uted to further weakening of the balance of payments, and the Government's
capacity to respond vigorously to the deteriorating economic environment.4/
8.       While  these  developments  have   serious  implications  for  the
sustainability of the projects under review, they were not prevalent during
most of the periods these  projects  were  executed.   Neither is it likely
that they could have been predicted at that time.
C. Setting and Context
9.       Sri Lanka has an estimated  population  of about 16.1 million, 80X
of which is rural. Of the total land area of 16.2 million acres (about
25,300 sq. mi.), about 5 million acres are used for agriculture. The
climate is characterized by nearly constant temperatures and large varia-
tions in rainfall. The island can be divided into two distinct precipita-
tion zones (see also map 14076R attached to this report)s the west zone
(average annual rainfall over 75 inches), situated in the southwest quad-
rant and covering about 301 of the land area, and the dry zone (average
anrual rainfall ranging from 35 to 75 inches) covering the remainder of the
island. The wet zone supports more than three-quarters of the total popu-
lation and accounts for about 702 of the cultivated land.
10.      Rice is Sri Lanka's most important staple and export crops such as
tea, rubber and coconuts form the backbone of the country's economy. How-
ever, while export crops were largely and satisfactorily produced on
estates, production of fooderops was left to small farmers and was far from
satisfying the island's needs, necessitating substantial imports of basic
foods. For example, in 1968, 451 of the total value of imports was for
food: of this expenditure, rice accounted for about 351 and sugar about
101. Although there was considerable room for increasing agricultural
yields, the main prospect for attaining self-sufficiency in food supply
existed in the expansion and intensification of cultivated areas. Since

report: Sri Lanka--Issues in Macro-Economic and Industrial Development

there was a comparative scarcity of land for further cultivation in the vet
zone, the expansion needed had to take place in the dry zone. Sri Lanka
also needed more electric energy.   In 1968, the effective generating capa-
city of the national system was 261 MW, including 191 MW of hydro capacity.
The firm capacity was about 220  MW.    Since the projected demand for 1973
was already 296 MW, there  was  a  need to increase the nation's generating
capacity quickly.   The  development  of  the  Mahaweli Ganga, the island's
largest and almost unexploited water resource which cuts through the east-
ern portion of the dry zone, therefore, was seen by the Government as the
cost logical source of irrigation water for arable lands in the dry zcne,
ginerating more electric power to meet increasing demand, and creating
em2loyment opportunities.
11.      Because of its difficult  physical  environment and the prevalence
of malaria, the dry zone has developed slowly in modern times. Yet it was
here, rather than in the more inviting wet zone, that the ancient Singha-
lese kings developed a highly advanced civilization, which flourished by
means of ingenious and extensive irrigation modes (see also PPAM, para.
18). But various wars and neglect took their toll on these irrigation
systems. However, it was again in this zone that the major Mahaweli Ganga
Development Program (MGDP) was executed as Sri Lanka's bold attempt to
iMrove its eco*omy and way of life.
II. IRRIGATION AND MAHAWELI DEVELOPMENT
A. Irrigation Sector
12.      The Bank's involvement in  irrigation  in  Sri Lanka has been sub-
stantial. Not only has irrigation been the object of Bank funding from the
earliest Bank projects in the agricultural sector, but the Bank has played
an important role in shaping the MGDP (see PPAM, paras. 16-22). It has
been able to mobilize substantial cofinancing, and cooperation with other
donors in project preparation, appraisal and supervision has been good.
Although project implementation  generally  has  been satisfactory, serious
challenges remain with respect to cost recovery, water management, and the
rehabrlitation of existing  irrigation  infrastructure.    Also, with self-
sufficiency in rice approaching, crop diversification in irrigated areas
presents a formidable challenge.
13.      The largest  share  of  agricultural  lending was for irrigation,
US$241 million or 44 percent of total lending for agriculture; about 75
percent of it in support of the Mahaweli program, mainly downstream devel-
opment. Five Mahaweli projects were financed by the Bank (see PPAM, para.
20). Another five projects covered other types of irrigation in Sri Lanka.

14.      The Bank's  earliest  irrigation  projects  primarily provided the
physical infrastructure necessary to distribute irrigation wattr, or to
protect and reclaim irrigated areas.   Increased food production in support
of the Government's self-sufficiency policies were the main project objec-
tives. The Lift Irrigation and the Drainage and Land Reclamation projects
encountered substantial implementation delays, owing to civil unrest, the
change in Government, and procurement problems. Overall, the Lift Irriga-
tion scheme was a failure,51 while the Drainage and Land Reclamation
Project6l was judged to have fared much better.
15.      The later irrigation  projects  focussed  on the rehabilitation of
existing irrigation infrastructure, and addressed water management issues
and irrigation practices in order to achieve a more efficient use of water.
The Tank Irrigation Modernization Project: aimed at improving water distri-
bution systems, infrastructure and servtices in five major tank schemes in
the northern part of  Sri  Lanka.    Implementation took three years longer
than expected owing to management and funding problems, but at completion7/
project performance was judged to be satisfactory. The Village Irrigatlon
Rehabilitation Project supports the rehabilitation of 1200 village irriga-
tion schemes and modernization of about 500 other small schemes. Progress
has fallen behind appraisal targets partly due to security problem., but
the quality of works is generally satisfactory. Under the Major Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project work remains suspended  at three subprojects, but on
the four other subprojects good progress is being achieved. However, col-
lection of O&M charges from beneficiaries continues to be poor. Suitable

remedial action will be planned after study proposals on a feasible col-

B. The Mahaweli Ganaa Development ProRrsm
16.      The MGDP  has  been  the  centerpiece  of  Sri Lanka's development
efforts for the last 25  years.    Formulation of the program was initiated
during 1958-61 and  implementation  of  the  Master  Plan commenced in 1970
(Mahaweli II PCR, paras.  1.01-1.03).    Late  in  1977, the new government
decided to accelerate the implementation of the program.  At that time work
on the first phase of the MGDP was in progress, with part of the funds
provided by the Bank.    The  projects  of the Accelerated Mahaweli Program
(AMP) included five major reservoirs and hydroplants with a total potential
power capacity of 500-600 MW, and downstream development of about 112,000
ha. After consultation with the Bank, in late 1977, GOSL agreed to
undertake an implementation strategy study (funded by the Netherlands).
While that study was going on, GOSL approached bilateral donors for
financing. They responded favorably, and funding for the construction of
four dams and reservoirs was obtained (see also Mahaweli TA PCR, paras.
2.01-2.07).
17.      As noted above (PPAM, para. 10),  the main objectives of the Maha-
weli program related to three of the major problems that were facing Sri
Lankas (a) reducing unemployment by creating short- and long-term job
opportunities; (b) increasing agricultural production, particularly rice,
to achieve food self-sufficiency; and (c) alleviating power shortages.
18.      The acceleration of this large  investment  program has also to be
looked at in its historical and political context. Politically, the deci-
sion to accelerate was to a certain extent to provide compensation (through
increased employment and production) for the costs of substantial economic
reforms. Historically, the program pays tribute to the ancient civiliza-
tion of Sri Lanka with its magnificent irrigation works (see also PPAM,
para. 11). Every Sri Lankan knows of the philosophy of the ancient mon-
archs, most clearly expressed by the 12th century King Parakramabahu I who
said, 'Let not one drop of water reach the sea without first serving man'.
Large-scale irrigation works were built as early as the 1st century A.D.
High standards of irrigation technology enabled the monarchs to extend
waterworks throughout the dry zone by the 6th century A.D. So thorough was
their work that many of those systems are still in use today.
19.      From its inception, the Bank  has been closely involved with MGDP.
Over the last 15 years, there was substantial interaction at the technical
level, mainly through supervision of Bank projects. A close relationship
developed between the Bank and the Mahaweli Authority, and at the technical
level the Bank's advice has always carried substantial weight. In addition
to supervision, the Bank played a role in designing the overall development
program, and in coordinating foreign assistance. A full assessment of MGDP
and the Bank's involvement in it can be found in OED's special study: Sri
Lanka and the World Bank: A Review of a Relationship, cited earlier.



20.      The Bank has made five  loans/credits  (see Table 3) in aupport of
the MGDP for a total of US$184 million, or 16 percenc of total Bank Group
lending to Sri Lanka.    The  projects  were  for  discrete elements of the
program. Except for the first project, which included a power station, the
Bank has only supported the downstream development of the MGDP: irrigation
and related supporting services, as well as technical assistance.

21.      The Bank's first project (1970) has been completed and was audited
bw OED in 1981.81 Despite implementation delays of about two years, the
project was regarded as economically and socially successful. The main
reasons for success were considered to be sound project design, continued
support from government agencies, and the ability of farmers to adapt to
the rigorous time frame imposed by double cropping. However, certain prob-
lems remained, such as cost  recovery, monitoring and evaluation, effective
water management, and illegal occupation of land. Although these problems
were addressed in follow-up projects, they have remained critical issues
until today.
22.      Implementation of the second project  (Mahaweli II - 1977) and the
Mahaweli TA Project (1980) are the subject of this report. Implementation
of the Third Mahaweli Project (1981) was delayed and completion of the
project is  now  scheduled  for  December  1989.    The  Minipe  Right Bank
Transbasin Canal has been in operation since 1984. Construction of the
main and branch canals is more than two years behind the original schedule
due to long hauling distances of suitable materials, adverse weather and
larger than expected  rock  formations.    Downstream construction work and
settlement  activities  have  been  rescheduled  accordingly.    The Fourth
Mahaweli Project was approved  in  July  1984.   Loan and Credit agreements
have been signed, but have only become effective in early 1988 due to
delays in resolving questions concerning cofinancing.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION - MAHAWELI II PROJECT
A. Project Formulation
23.      Bank staff was concerned upon  receipt  of the eight volume feasi-
bility report that i.nvestment costs of about US$1,800 per ac were high and
that the proposed implementation rate of 14,000 ac per year was too opti-
mistic. An FAOICP preparation mission was mounted in 1974 to prepare a
much smaller project. The GOSL was unhappy with the Bank's decision to
support only a small project. An early 1976 post-appraisal mission discov-
ered that GOSL had already initiated  work on a large scale, i e., covering
about 71,000 ac and recommended that Government's efforts be encouraged and
increased pace maintained (Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 2.01-2.10). Under these
circumstances, a revised project was  proposed.   The Bank decided that the
changes required a new full appraisal which focussed on construction
methods proposed, procurement procedures, the implementation schedule, and
organizationlmanagement aspects (see Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 2.11-2.17).
24.      Negotiations  took  place  in March  1977.    Subjects  discussed
included procurement, audit arrangements, technical assistance and manage-
ment appointment. However, the major debate centered around cost recovery
issues (see also Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 2.18-2.20). The Board approved
the project in April 1977 but fin'lizing the cofinancing arrangements
resulted in delays in  effectiveness.    The  Credit agreement beeame ulti-
mately effective in December 1977 (see Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 2.21-2.25).
25.      The project as approved included the following components (quanti-
fied and tabulated in Mahaweli II PCR, para. 3.01)s
(a) Irritation and Land Development Works included completion of Kala-
vewa Right Bank Main Canal and improving four major tanks along
the canal; construction of branch and distributory canals, field
channels and other structures; improving natural drains (about 10
miles) and construction of secondary and tertiary drains; clearing
and land preparation of about 40,300 acres; and provision of vehi-
cles and equipment and a construction workshop for the construc-
tion, operation and maintenance of the works.
(b) Production Support included reorganization and strengthening of
agricultural extension services in the project area; provision of
storage, marketing and processing facilities; provision of vehi-
cles, equipment, farm implements and sprayers; and improvement of
some existing roads and construction of new roads.
(c) Social Infrastructure included provision of schools, additional
medical facilities and community development facilities as well as
construction of about 1,235 village wells and about 200 miles of
village roads.



(d)  Otiher Proiect C.mponents included  the  settlement of abouc 15,300
famllies in the main project area; and provision of consultants'
se-vices, studies and surveys.
26.      Project costs  were  estimated  at  US$80.0  million,  and funding
arrangements included: IDA, Canada, the Netherlands, UK, USA, EEC, and
GOSL. For further details on planned and actual financing arrangements see
Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 3.23-3.24.
B. Proiect Implementation
27.      The decision to accelerate  the  MGDP  (PPAM, para. 16) took place
shortly after Board apiroval of  this  project.   While it had an important
bearing on the shape on the Mahaweli program it also had a rather immediate
and chaotic impact on the implementation of the Mahaweli II Project (see
also Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 2.23-2.25).
28.      Work on the Mahaweli II Pro4ect was started by GOSL prior to Bank
involvement. Following the Government's decision at the end of 1977 to
accelerate the MGDP, the army and other public corporations were mov.'ed into
the project area to clear jungle and construct canals. However, this wa
done without due regard for proper planning and work standards. The result
was poor quality of works, excessive water conveyance losses in the canals
and operation and maintenance costs much higher than anticipated.  The Bank
rated the project as a  problem  project  in 1978.  Project implementation,
however, improved in 1979180 and progress as well as quality improved.
Implementation slowed down again in 1981, mainly due to budget restriction.
In the end, instead of completing the project ahead of schedule as
originally intended by Government, the credit had to be extended twice,
until June 30, 1985, due,  to  a  large  extent, to the need for additional
canal lining required as a consequence of poor design and standards prior
to the Bank's involvement.    However,  ultimately the project successfully
attained its major land development, settlement and production objectives
(for further details, see Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 3.02-3.22).
29.      The Mahaweli Agencies' procurement  actions for civil works caused
major problems throughout the project implementation period. Contrary to
the agreement reached before the project's approval, MDB expressed the view
that the private sector was not able to even undertake the agreed 502 of
the construction. In the end, all civil works were undertaken by 5 public
sector agencies, including MDB, the &Army and the River Valley Development
Board (RVDB).   The  September  1978  supervision mission observed that no
contracts were bid competitively, none were submitted to IDA for approval
and that some of the works were proceeding on the basis of oral agreements.
RVDB had been assigned the design, construction and supervision of irriga-
tion and drainage works in over one-half of the project area and was oper-
ating without a contract. With GOSL's decision to accelerate the MGDP, MDB
had no power to enforce proper planning or scheduling of work or to enforce
construction quality  standards.    Later  RVDB was  excluded from further
contracts because of poor quality of its construction work and because of
non-completion of some of the work.    From  1980 onward the public sector
agencies were phased out of the program and private contractors were



- 10 -
awarded remaining contracts.   Likewise,  a relatively large procurement of
1,050 two-wheel tractors was cancelled because IDA objected to MDB's award
process and because it was decided that farmers could buy tractors directly
from local suppliers. Other contracts for other items of equipment were
awarded late in 1984 following satisfactory ICB action by MEA (Mahaweli II
PCR, paras. 3.25-3.29).
30.      Cost recovery for land improvements  was to be accomplished by the
sale of the farm and house plots given to each settler, wherein the direct
costs of development would be charged and the settlers would receive clear
title to the land. However, at completion no payments had been made by the
settlers and ownership still rested with GOSL (Mahaweli II PCR, paras.
3.32-3.34). Collection of water charges began in 1984 after a publicity
and education campaign regarding recovery of O&M costs was carried out in
1983 (Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 3.35-3.36); while this was an encouraging
start, much remains to be achieved.
C. Project Administration
31.      The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) was set up by an Act of
Parliament in March 1979 to be the strong central planning and decision-
making body that was needed to meet the challenges of the ambitious Accel-
erated Mahaweli Program.   Its  two  principal  executing agencies were the
Central Engineering and Construction Bureau (CECB), responsible for the
large head works project3 and the Mahaweli Development Board (MDB), charged
with engineering and construction of downstream irrigation development
projects. Subsequently MASL set up a Settlement Division in July 1980 and
by Cabinet decision the Mahaweli  Econcamc Agency (MEA) was established in
1981 to be responsible for downstream development and settlement. In 1983,
MDB5s functions were taken over by its successor, Mahaweli Engineering and
Construction Agency (MECA), further streamlining the MASL organization and
improving the coordination between engineering, construction and settlement
(for further details see Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 4.01-4.05).
32.      Water management was controlled  by the Water Management Secretar-
iat (WMS) in accordance with an agreed plan, in close consultation with
MEA's Resident Project  Manager  (RPM).    Present imbalances between water
delivery and off-take by the system are now reduced to some degree by the
available storage capacity of the  tanks.    Improvements have been made to
reduce water wastage by users, modifications to canal linings provide
better seepage control, measurement structures improve reliability and
accuracy of water issues, and training of operators and farmers in effec-
tive and efficient water use has helped to improve water management in the
System (Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 4.06-4.11).
D. Prolect Impact
33.      Revised crop production estimates  confirm  that the production of
paddy exceeded the SAR estimate--not only in exceptionally good years, but
in average years as well.    On  the  other hand, production of other field
crops has remained below the appraisal estimates, with the exception of



- 11 -
chillies which has become the second most important cash crop, after paddy
(Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 5.01-5.08).
34.      Farm i_comes range widely (with a median  of about Rs 4,900 and a
mean income of about Rs 8,500), according to a sample survey conducted by
MEA in 1985, derived mainly from cultivation of fruits and vegetables,
plant nurseries and livestock produce, inclvding hiring out of draught
animals. Most families also have some non-farm income, including tractor
hiring, leasing-in and cultivation of farm land, and trading (Mahaweli II
PCR, paras. 5.09-5.12).
35.      The project financed a full package  of investments in part of the
H system and supporting services throughout the system area. Economic
analysis has been limited to the full package cost and benefits. The
reestimated rate of return is -12 compared to 21X estimated at appraisal.
Depressed rice prices in recent years and low forecast are the dominating
reasons for the  low  rare  of  return:    using  appraisal price forecasts
instead would give a 162 rate of return (for further details see Mahaweli
II PCR, paras. 6.01-6.03).
IV. MAHAWELI TA PROJECT
A. Prolect Formulation
36.      The MGDP was originally based on a Master Plan prepared jointly by
UNDPIFAO and Sri Lanka engineers in 1965-68 which envisaged a three-phase
development program of about 900,000 ac of irrigable land in the dry zone,
as well as about 500 MW  of  hydropower.   The new Government which came to
power in 1977 decided to accelerate the program. During the early months
of 1978 the Government consulted with IDA and contacted several donors for
assistance in the preparation of five major projects, including dams and
hydropower plants with an installed capacity of about 600 MW, and
development of about 290,000 ac of new lands, as well as downstream
development  and  other works   and   studies  (Mahaweli  TA  PCR,  paras.
2.01-2.03).
37.      As part of the  general  agreement  to accelerate the program, IDA
undertook to advise on the scope of studies. To this end, an Implementa-
tion Strategy Study was carried out, financed by the Netherlands, done in
1979 by consultant*a, to determine a specific action plan; its findings
differed signific*e.tiy from the original UNDPIFAO Master Plan. Ar.an the
important findings were that the system as proposed would have excess water
which could be used to irrigate lands elsewhere and that water diversion
northward could be done at substantially lower cost as compared -ith the
Master Plan proposals. This brought out the need for further feasibility
studies of the transbasin  diversion  plans.    There was also an Immediate
need for detailed engineering and design in the command area to be served
by the Victoria Project, since its construction was to start in early 1980
and the downstream development should be in place by the time the headworks
were to be completed in 1984. Accordingly, at GOSL's request, the proposed



- 12 -
technical assistance project was identified and jointly prepared by GOSL
with IDA assistance (Mahaweli TA PCR, paras. 2.04-2.06).
38.      Negotiations took place  in  Sri  Lanka  in  December 1979 and the
project was approved by the Board In January 1980. The credit agreements,
including an EEC Special Action Credit, were signed In April and became
effective in July that same  year.    Total project costs were estimated at
US$6.0 million. IDA would fund US$3.0 million and EEC would provide US$2.0
million equivalent for a Special Action Credit to be administered by IDA
(for further details see Mahaweli TA PCR, para. 3.01).
39.      The project's primary objective was to finance consr.ltants tos
(a) carry out reconnaissance level studies of transbasin diversion
plans to convey surplus water developed under the Accelerated
Mahaweli Ganga Program (AMP) to three alternative basins/areas for
irrigation use and power production, determine the viability of
each plan, and identify possible viable subprojects;
(b) review detailed designs of the Minipe Right Bank Canal (planned to
serve Systems B and C) and prepare terder documents suitable for
international competitive bidding and possible financing of this
canal by the Bank Group;
(c) assist the Mahaweli Authority in the priparation of final designs
and tender documents for irrigation and drainage systems and
social infrastructure in part of System C, which was being consid-
ered for Bank Group financing;
(d) carry out other studies/investigation plans or designs required
during the planning and implementation of the AMP; and
(a) provide training to counterpart staff and locally-hired personnel
engaged in the work.
B. Project Implementation and Inviact
40.      Most of the project  objectives were achieved (project implementa-
tion details are provided in the PCR, paras. 4.01-4.09). The project
helped Government in defining development options for possible use of sur-
plus Mahaweli water being developed by the various headworks projects
although the final report was not completed until the end of the extended
project period. It also contributed substantially to the timely completion
of the Minipe Right Bank Canal.   The  canal was financed by IDA (under the
Mahaweli III Project) and coAmir3ioned in April 1984. The assistance given
by  consultants   financed   under   the   Mahaweli   TA   Project  in  the
review/preparation of  designs  and  tender  documents  for  civil works in
System C enabled the Mahaweli III Project to be implemented as planned.
The training and guidance given to MASL staff in the design of irrigation
and social infrastructure and in the preparation of tender documents was
not only instrumental in completing such work on a timely basis in System C



- 13 -
but has contributed to the preparation of similar work in other project
areas by MASL staff trained by the consultants.
41.      The project was  least  successful  in  providing support to other
studies/investigations in the AMP. The main reason was that as a result of
a scaling back of the AMP, such studies were not identified by the Govern-
ment in time to utilize the funds available. Some assistance was provided
near the close of the credits in reviewing designs and tender documents for
the System B Right Bank project (also appraised by the Bank and approved by
the Board as Mahaweli IV). Because additional studies were not taken up as
envisaged, 38 percent of the IDA credit (US$1.14 million) and 14 percent of
the EEC credit was eventually cancelled.
42.      In retrospect, the two  years  provided for project implementation
was not realistic. Particularly the transbasin study, where various alter-
natives or options kept surfacing, continued to require further study.
Also, more time was needed to identify the other studies for AMP which had
not been identified at the time of project preparation. The credits were
extended three times for a total of three years, making this a five-year
project. Nevertheless, and this is unfortunate, there was a period of
nearly two years of project inactivity (during the third and fourth years
of the project), due mainly to the scaling back of development plans in the
Mahaweli Program and to a lack of consensus within MASL/GOSL on the
studies/work to be undertaken.
V. MAIN FINDINGS
43.      Government's commitment  to  the  implementation  of  the Mahaweli
Ganga Development Program has and continues to be strong and it succeeded
in attracting substantial external financing for the accelerated program
from foreign donors. However, the decision to speed up was not without
risk. Mahaweli must be reviewed within its overall development context and
rather than looking at individual components, the program should be
evaluated as a whole.   Obviously  it  is  still too early to determine the
full development impact of the program although a first assessment has been
attempted in the OED study:   Sri  Lanka  and the World Bank--A Review of A
Relationship, cited earlier in this audit report.
44.      On the other  hand,  the  project  completed  one  of the earliest
systems (System H) of the Mahaweli program.   As such what happens here has
been and can continue to be replicated elsewhere in the program. There-
fore, it is rather important to ensure a continued evaluation of the devel-
opment impact of this project. Serious consideration is therefore given to
an impact evaluation to assess sustainability and development impact of
this project in more detail.

A. The Second Dimension of Sustainabilitv
45.      The 1985 OED Report Sustainability  of  Projects:  First Review of
Experience defines project sustainability as 'the maintenance of an accept-
able net flow of benefits throughout the economic life of the project".9/
The report lists a number of factors which are necessary to achieve sus-
tainability such ass    (i)  Borrower  commitment  which  determines if the
policy environment will be positive and whether the project will be ener-
getically maintained and efficiently operated; (ii) continuity in project
organization and management; (iii) project design which must provide the
correct balance between the desirable and the feasible in its technical,
institutional and socio-economic dimensions.
46.      The Bank has been  concerned with project sustainability for many
years and project design, appraisal and supervision are encouraged to focus
on the sustainability issue.  However,  in most projects in general, but in
the Mahaweli Ganga projects in particular, two factors enhancing project
sustainability did not receive the required emphasis: first, the socio-
economic dimensions and second, the planning of future developments.
47.      It is generally recognized that continuous successful operation of
any agricultural development project will depend on sustaining the interest
of participating farmers.   There  is  general agreement that consultations
with farmers are necessary prior to planning or deciding on policies since
the ultimate success or the sustainability of any project depends on the
cooperation of the farmers.   While  such consultations are relatively easy
in developed countries because of the presence of active and often powerful
farmer organizations, these 'farmer lobbies' are usually non-existent in
the Third World. To ask for views from all farmers would be unrealistic
but there must be a way to listen to farmer representations and take cogni-
zance of their  needs  and  expectations.    Frank  discussions with farmer
groups before policies are decided and plans formulated are in support of
project sustainability.
48.      Since dealings/discussions with all project farmers are not feasi-
ble, special emphasis on training of farmer leaders/speakers becomes imper-
ative. A recent OED auditlO/ commented on a successful program introduced
in Malaysia which focuses specifically on training farm group leaders.
Some thought to this approach has been given not by the Bank but in Sri
Lanka by the Mahaweli Ganga Authority in a reportll/ which states:
'The end result of an irrigation or rural development project
should not be the provision of land and water for cultivation.
9/ See OED Report No. 5718, dated June 14, 1985, Executive Summary, page i.
10/ See Project Performance Audit Report, Malaysia: National Extension
Project, (Loan 1493-MA), OED Report No. 7287 dated June 13, 1988.

Lanka, July 15, 1987, by Dr. Abhaya Attanayake.

It should not only provide the much required water for culti-
vation and all the other social, religious and medical needs
but also post settlement needs of the farmers. It is neces-
sary to organize training programmes in agriculture, water
management enterprise and community development for farmers to
build a rural leadership which would give the necessary impe-
tus for settlers in development projects to take up the
responsibility of ensuring their own welfare. The ultimate
goal of a settlement would be to make the maA4mum use of land
through an all round development effort and farmer training.
It is important in that it would facilitate the organization
of farmers who would point out their own needs and wants and
also be responsible for the smocth functioning of the project.
In short, it would pave the way for the creation of a self-
contained community based on agricultural, religious and other
social needs and a well organized management system."
49.      The second aspect of  enhancing  the  chances of project sustaina-
bility is proper planning  of  activities.    While  planning at the "micro
level", i.e. planning at management level to cope with day to day opesra-
tions and adjusting to short term trends is well taken care of in the proj-
ects under review, a different picture emerges when looking at the "macro
economic" aspects which may have an impact on project sustainability and
where some indicative planning, providing for alternative solutions under
differing scenarios would be required.  As far as Mahaweli is concerned the
issue is not Implementation but sustainability. It is almost sure that the
high level of support and management cannot be continued forever. However,
no planning to face such realities is being undertaken even though sustain-
ability experience with earlier basin developments in Sri Lanka has been
far from satisfactory.
50.      In the audit's view it will be necessary to give more attention to
analyzing long-term markets, production, price trends, etc., and preparing
plans which could be implemented if certain anticipated trends materialize.
B. Bank Supervision
51.      The PCRs emphasize the high  standard of the Bank's project super-
vision, especially the continuity of staff assigned and their positive
impact on project implementation.    This  view  is  also shared by the Sri
Lanka authorities associated with the project and the audit agrees with
this assessment. However, some observers within the Bank have reservations
about the comprehensiveness of the supervision activities in regard to the
projects under review and the audit paid special attention to the super-
vision aspects.
52.      The above mentioned reservations were  based  on the fact that the
"continuity" of project supervision of the Mahaweli Ganga projects was
assured by assigning a highly qualified and motivated engineer and other
dedicated staff to this task. Due to the specialization of the supervisors
in charge Bank staff feared that supervision missions may have tended to



- 16 -
emphasize engineering/agro-technical aspects to the detriment of economicl
administrative problems.
53.      Their criticisms are based on the fact that supervision reports of
the Mahaweli Ganga projects mention that 'implementation has proceeded
without proper planning and coordination' or mention the 'failure to look
at trends in relation to social development and inequality, and to water
management". Concern was also expressed that the issue of water charges
remained unresolved for many years.
54.      In reviewing the supervision aspects the audit found no indication
that supervision missions were one-sided, i.e. emphasizing only technical
aspects. The examples listed in the Mahaweli Ganga projects, not tackling
problems such as water charges and failure to recognize socio-economic
trends cannot be considered to fall into the competence of supervision
missions. The mentioned issues are highly political and sensitive and the
audit finds that by bringing these issues to management attention and by
inviting management action the supervision missions adequately covered
their terms of reference.
C. Civil Works Contractors
55.      The Mahaweli II Project  had  a  sizeable civil works component as
can be seen from Table 4 below:
Table 4: CIVIL WORKS UNDER MAHAWELI II
Total        Private Contract
(US$ millions)     (USS millions)
Kalawewa Main Canal, etc.                    3.7                 1.85
Distributory Canals                          13.8               13.80
Roads, Social Infrastructure, Buildings      9.2                 4.60
Other                                        9.1                 8.25
Total     35.8                28.50
56.      This massive work program has to be seen in context with the over-
all turnover of the country's  construction  sector which amounted to about
'JS$120 million in the appraisal year (1977).121 The difficulty of coping
with the envisaged construction program was further exacerbated by the
Bank's recommendation that the major share of civil works contracts should
go to the "small contractors", whose share of the annual US$120 million
volume could be considered small in light of the work done by government-
owned or parastatal construction companies.
57.      It is difficult to understand why the Bank insisted on getting the
sa11 contractor sector involved since even the appraisal had reservations
121 See Sri Lanka Recent Economic Development and Policies for Growth,
Report No. 5628-CE, dated May 14, 1985.



- 17 -
(SAR, para. 5.05) which states: 'The private sector in Sri Lanka has very
limited capacity for civil works construction.'
58.      The apparent lack of  analysis  of  the  contractors sector led to
delays in project implementation and contributed substantially to the cost
overruns. The audit agrees with the statement of the Mahaweli II PCR
(para. 3.25, 3.28) that 'procurement actions for civil works caused major
problems throughout the project implementation period' and that contracts
to small private enterprises" caused many problems until the very end of
the project."
59.      There were two shortcomings in the appraisal approach of the proj-
ects' civil works component. First there was never a proper assessment of
the country's construction sector, its weaknesses and specifically its
annual capacity. Second, a lack of interaction not only between the Bank's
different technical departments but even within the Region's agricultural
divisions.   While  the  audit  agrees  that  a  developing country's small
contractor Internrise sector needs to be developed there is little appreci-
ation in the Bank on what the major constraints are that confront the
sector. The situation has also been encountered in other projects.131
60.      Small contractors  as  found  in  some--not  all--villages tend to
employ very few workers.   Due  to  transportation as well as housing prob-
lems, the circle of work activities is rather narrow--it hardly reaches
beyond a village.   Furthermore  construction  techniques  may not be up to
required standards, a fact which cannot be overcome by providing these
contractors with additional machinery.    Since  adherence to local bidding
procedures is the minimum condition regarding the Bank's procurement proce-
dures, many of these contractors are not capable of submitting cost esti-
mates in writing but present them orally which the Bank in turn would not
accept (Mahaweli II PCR, paras. 3.26).
61.      The interaction between Bank  divisions  for any project is impor-
tant and highlighted in this case by the, relatively speaking, small size
of the country's construction sector. Interaction is missing if looking at
projects individually--without seeing the Bank-promoted construction volume
in the aggregate. Since there is always a chance that the education, pub-
lic utilities and transport sectors will also require local contractors, _.n
annual assessment of these activities would be warranted prior to determin-
ing the appropriate civil works contract arrangements.

'Comments on Mahaweli Ganga Development project 11 Completion
Report (1987)  of the World Bank
The World Bank funded component of the Mahaweli Sys-Lem H develop-
ment  work  commenced  in  December 1977 and was completed In mid
19tIb. 'V'h.s was identified by the name "MahaweJi Ganga Project II"
and consisted of the following aotivities.
(1) construction of irrigation and road  infrastructure  and
provision of construction equipment in the new 114 and H5 areas
(39,000) acres;
(2) construction of boclal infrastructure in H4, Hb, H2, H7
and H9 areas (6b,000 acres);
(3) provision of farm machinery and operation and wain-
tenance equipment for areas mentioned in (2) above and HI ('(1,000
acres):
(4) provision of support for agricultural extention and re-
search,  including vehicl"e  and equipment for the areas mentioned
in (2) and (3) above as well ae H3, H6, HO, HI0, H1l and H12
(106,000 acres).
In March 1987, a Project Completion report was prepared by the
World Bank based on a draft prepared by PMU/MASL In June 1984 and
other date. obtained from the Financial Controller of MASL. The
draft  prepared  by  the  PMU/MASL did not include a benefit cost
analyals of the Stage II project either in financial terma or
economic terms. The World Bank carried out an economic analysis
of t.he project taking into account only the costa and benefits in
H4 and H5 areas.  This analysis reported in thn  VCR  yielded  an
economic rate of return (ERR) amounting to -1%.
This PCR does not elaborate in aufficient detail the assumptions
on which the economic price for rice, the maJor product of the
proJect was calculated. Further, the base year for the benefit
coat calQuJatjon is also not given. 'I'he only clues given are:
a/ that L!e economic prices of internationally traded itema
are based on IBRD commodity price forecasts, August 1986; and
b/ that the proJect has brought Sri Lanka's goal of tood
self sufficiency within reach (page 32).
The comparion v'f actual costs in current terms of two items
which were exclusively for 1H4 and H5 areas, namely irrigation in-
frastructure and on-farm works showed that the economic costs
reported were about 30% higher than the actual costs.  GiveA that
tne standard conversion factor used was 0.85 which should reduce
the economJc value of costa .n current prices, this implies an
increase of economic costs from financial costs by about 65%. Ap-
parently thie was brought about as result of expressing the ac-

tual coots incurred in constant terms.  The base year selected is
likely to have been 1986, the year of project completion. The
shadow pri(;e for a commodity varies according to  the  base  year
selected for calculation.
Tec et%jcnOmiC price of rius was apparently calculated on the
hba.i of the export optiurI under the assumption  that  once  self
sufficiency was achieved, the surplus would have been exported.
The cxpected EBIB at appraisal for this project waa 21%. The
Comp)etion report identifi-ed the  depressed  rice  price  in  the
world werket in the recent yearn and the low prJces projected for
the  future  aa the maJor reason tor the negative ERk  obtained at
shadow prices based on 1986 projections of the  World  Bank. The
report also mentioned that the ERR in 16% when the rice prices
uaed at appraical are applietd to the anialysis.
1. The government of Sri Lanka has declared crop diversification
as a major goal of the oational agricultuire development strategy.
Mahaweli  Axthority has aleco recognised this as a priority and is
presently engaged in promoting the cultivation of non-rice crops.
Further,  private profitability (aB well as social profitability)
of rice cultivation has declined in real absolute terms and in
rol Ativa terms againot other crops. Therefore, it is reasonable
to expect a signifcant departure from the present cropping orop-
ping pattern in System H at least in the Yala season. The es-
timateo of future with project cropping pattern used in the
Completion Report did not allow for this. Instead it was assumed
that the preeent (1984/85 crop year) cropping pattern will
prevail, during the entire life time of the project. As noted in
the report crop diverMification should result in higher economic
retturns from the project.
2. As rioted earlier, the shadow/economic price of rice used in
the analysis appearw to reflect the economic loss to the society
due to a reduction in exports. In our view, the realistic oppor-
tunit.y cost of rice in System H is given by the lose to the
socicty as a result of having to import rice. Although Sri Lanka
is nearing the threshold of self sufficiency, at the margin she
is likely to continue to be a net importer of rice. The declining
rcal profits from rice oultivatiotn and the resulting concern
about farmer living standarde together with the difficulty of en-
tering the world market has led to a significant shift in the
government agricultural policy. Apart from this the operation of
market forces by lowering the domestic rice prices in real terms
should force marginal farmers to move  u.t  of  rice  cultivation.
TYI brief, the following points suport the view that arop diver-
aification is more likelier than a situation of rice production
at levele exceeding local demand. a/ rice varieties which yield
grains of exportable quality have not been bred to suit local
conditions; b/ breeding Ruitable varieties takes a long time and

in any case they are likely to he low yielding relative to the
present  varieties;   c/  profits  from  rice  mono-culture  have
declined Jn re6a tern:s and relative to other crops inr the recent
times; d/ the coat of production of rlue in Sri Lanka too high to
be competitive In the wz,rld market, d/ given adequate extention,
nredit. and marketing facilities, most farmers would favour the
cultivation of other crops, a good example being t.he rapid oxpan-
sion of the area cultivated in chi'lIee in 6y;stem H.
The most reeont excercise of the government planners to analyse
t.he dom"t.tei demand and supply situation in relation to rice was
oarried  oAt  in Novomber 1984 (Ministry of P'inance and Planning,
1984,   XLLCef  SAl    Stiff1r4enav  =d  B==od;  ExiRort, ErQaPect&
Co]ombc').  Thic report estimated that Sri Lanka will he producing
kmell burpluees of rice from 1987 and that the surplus will  grow
to a substantial level by 1991. Thlree alternative consumption and
production estimates, i.e., lower bound, conservative and op-
timistic were 001  Eired. The three production estimates for 1987
were 129, 141 and 147 million bushels respectively. For 1991,
these were 142, 1b8 and 170 million bushels of paddy. In 1986,
only 120 million bushels of paddy was produiced in $ri Lanka. In
the followlng year, 1987, only 102 million bushels of paddy was
-aroduoed.  Although much of the sudden shortfall in production in
1967 can be attributed to adverae weather conditions and the dis-
turbances  in the North and East,  the l.owr bound productlon cc-
timates appear to be the moet realistic.  Thus in 1991  only  142
million buehels of paddy can be expected to be produced. The con-
servative  consumption estimate based on 10'( kgs./capita for 1991
was  lF1 millAon bushels. The actual consumption  in  1980  -  87
period  averaged  at  104 kgs./capita and therefore was closer to
the conservative estimate than the other two. Thus.  even in 1991
about 9 million bushels of paddy will have to be imported.
The economic price of rice used by the World Bank is Rs. 2.5 per
kilo gra'i for the year i985. Our calculation of the economiQ
pricse  for the import option is about Hu. 3.5 per kilo gram for
the Year 1986.  The difference in the two is due to the  cost  of
frieght apart from whiaL ever dlfrerenc-tii  owi,g to tthe differencee
in price projections between the two years.
Accordingly, even at the depressed present and projected future
prices the use of t,he more rea.listic ecoonomie price for the im
port option ohould yield a positive rate of return.
V,veri -i dom"oLlc riot production wae to improve in the post  1988
peri.od, reaching levels of production indicated by the conservate
or optimistic estimates given above, then self sufficiency would
be aohievad in the post 1991 period, Say from 1945 - 20(0'1 period.
Then assuming that rice exports become feasible, export option
prices  can be used only for that period.  For the earlier period
import option prices have to be used.  Thus even at shadow prices
based on 198bb projent.Jong the stage 11 would have a positive ERR.

3.  Economi /shadow  prices used in project appraisal aro usually
based on world market prices for them in order to abstract from
imperfections and distortions commonly found in domestic markets.
This Is expected to yield a more appropri ate scarcity value for
goods and services than the prevailing market  prices.  For  many
goods  and  services  the world market can be expected to be com-
petitive due to the preeence of a large number of buyers and sel-
lera. However, the international market for rice is very thin
wit.h only 5% of total milled production being traded interna-
tionally.  Further,  this market is highly fragmented and charac-
terised by large scale bilateral agreements. In other words this
market can hardly he considered an open competitive  market.  Ao-
c,ordingly, shadow prices derived on the baiui of observed world
market prices cannot be expee.ted to  reflect  the  true  scarcity
value of the commodity.  As such, results obtained in this manner
should be interpreted carefully.
4.  Food security of a nation is an important goal of governments
in both developed and developing countries. Various policy
measures  adopted  towards  this  goal  are  motivated  by  sound
economic. reasons  (protecting  the  consumers and producers from
cyclical f3uctuations In prices of  commodities).  Thie  explains
the subsidJsed and apparently inefficient use of scarce resouroes
for farming in many developedi countrieo.  Obviously the assurance
of sufficient availability of food at all times has  to  be  pur-
chaeed at a cost - that of higher than world market prices.
Hence, where food security is sought the shadow price for that
commodity should contain a premIum above its world market price.
Since food security/self-sufficiency is a national goal, the
Rhadow price of rice for Sri Lanika should be higher then that
bated on a simple border price approach.
'i.  Whtile economic benefit/cost arialysis is the standard tool  of
the  deveJopment bankers and other policy makers in the appraisal
of alternative projects the theoretical foundations  of  this  is
still controversial. Although the principle of shadow pricing
t.raded goods at their border price is widely accepted, this ap-
proach is not appropriate for all traded goods and services. A
good example is the case olf rice discursed earlier. The deriva-
tion of shadow prices of non-traded goods is a much more con-
troversial. issue. It has been demonistrated that the informational
constraints for shadow pricing non-traded goods are considerable
and that the potential welfare gains from correct shadow prices
can be signiflcantly eroded by quite small errors in the es-
timated shadow prices. Hence the advantages of shadow pricing as
agairnst the use of market prices are not clear. It is well known
that shadow pricing can be very demanding in terms of Jnforma-
t.ional requirements and that most analysts rely heavily on
various approximations and rules of thumb. The World Bank is no
exception in this regard.

Any attempt  to  measure  the  success  of  land  settlement  and
naricultural projecto which have important cocio-political objec-
tives in addition to economic product.lon goals by means of a
single index such as ErRR cannot. be  considered  reasonable.  The
oalculation  oif EXR  is  based  onjy  on  the economlc costs and
benefits of projects.  tJeually  indirect  economic  benefits  and
costs  are  aImo  ignored  and on.ly direct costs and benefits are
taken into account.   I'he PCR for the St.age II suffers  from  all
these shortcomings and as a reeult obtained a negative ERR for a
succesful project as admitted by the  authors  of  the  document.
.."Demptte the negative economic rate of reWurn, the project can
oertainly be classified as a succesful one. Major objectives in

achieved  and  there  is  much  promise  for   further   develop-

MAHAWELI GANCA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT rr

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01    The Mahaweli Canga Development Program has been the centerpiece of
Sri Lanka's development efforts for the last twenty-five years. Successive
Governments have viewed che Program as the main vehicle to reduce unemploy-
ment, imports of food stuffs, and energy deficiencies and to provide settle-
ment opportunities to landless people. A large amount of financial support
was generated from international donors when the present Government decided
in 1977 to accelerate the Mahaweli Program. At that time implementation of
the present Mahaweli Ganga II project was just starting up.
1.02    Formulation of the Mahaweli Canga Development Program was initiated
during 1958-1961, when the Government undertook extensive investigations of
the water resources of the Mahaweli Ganga river, with the assistance of
USAID. A Bank Group mission reviewed the results of the investigations in
1961 and recommended a study of a proposed transbasin diversion scheme and
a number of supplementary investigations.  Subsequently, a full Master Plan
study was carried out by the Government during 1964-1968 with the assistance
of a UNDP/FAO-CP team. The Master Plan enJisaged the development of about
900,000 acres irrigated agriculture and the installation of about 970 MW of
hydropower capacity from multipurpose reservoirs in the north-eastern dry
zone of the country. Irrigation development would cover about 650,000 acres
of undeveloped land (jungle and brushwood) and about 250,000 acres of exist-
ing irrigated land where irrigation infrastructure would be rehabilitated and
improved and the supply of water would be augmented. As proposed in the
Master Plan, development would be divided into three phases, each including
several projects, for stepwise implementation over a 30-year period.
1.03    Implementation of the Master Plan comenced in 1970 with the con-
struction of diversion headworks, diversion tunnels and power plants at
Polgolla and Bowatenne to improve wvter supply to about 130,000 acres of
existing irrigated land and to provide full irrigation supply to about 90,000
acres of new land (Project r, Stage r).  Construction of the head works and
diversion tunnels at Polgolla and Bowatenne and that of a 40 MW powerplant at
Polgoll4 were in part financed from IBRD Loan 653-CE and IDA Credit 174-CE
(USS 14.5 million each), approved by the Board on January 30, 1970.1/ The
IBD/IDA financed project included also feasibility studies for downstream
1/ See Mahaweli Canga Development Project, Stage I; Project Performance
Audit Report, December 28, 1981.

development of the System H area. The project was completed in 1978. Con-
struction of a 40 MW power plant at Bowatenne was financed under a separate
project agreement by the Asian Development Bank and OPEC.
II. PROJECT PROCESSING
Project PreParation
2.01    An eight-volume feasibility report for the H System, entitled
"Iahaveli Canga Development, Project I, Stage II", was submitted by consult-
ants in September 1972. As proposed by consultants the project would consist
of:
(i) irrigation development in 71,000 acres, of which 17,000 acres of
existing paddy land (rainfed or irrigated from small village
tanks), gardens and land under shifting cultivation, and 54,000
acres of new land; and
(ii) settlement of about 15,500 individual farm families and the
integration of some 8,000 families living already in the area.
2.02    Water from the Mahaweli Ganga r.7as expected to be available by mid
1975 and would be channeled into the existing Kandalama and Kalawewa tanks.
Construction of two main canals commencing from each tank would start in 1973
and the construction of distributary and field channels was scheduled to keep
pace with the settlement of the farmers from 1975. It was proposed to settle
the area fully by 1979 to reach full production levels by 1987.  Project
investment cost was estimated at about Rs 766 million (about US$128 million)
and the Economic Rate of Return was estimated at about 12 percent.
2.03    Bank staff had several problems with the proposed project, chief
amongst them:
(i) the very high investment cost of about US$ 1,800 per acre, caus-
ing a marginal rate of return; and
(ii) the proposed rate of implementation of about 14,000 acres per
year, which was considered overly optimistic.
The Bank therefore advised that the project should be re-formulated.
2.04    A PAO/CP preparation mission was mounted in late 1974 to prepare a
much smaller, first phase, system H project, covering only 14,000 acres of
new land (Zones H7 and H9)and 4,000 acres of existing irrigated land (Zones
H6 and H8), all located downstream from the existing Kandalama tank and the
new Dambulu Oya tank.  The same FAO/CP mission also prepared an Irrigation
Modernization project located in other areas of Sri Lanka.

First Appraisal (1975)
2.05    In April/May 1975 a Bank mission appraised a project, composed of the
following cwo parts:
(i) Mahaweli Canga Development Project, Stage It, Phase I, comprising
14,000 acres of new land in Zones Ht and H9 (as proposed by
FAO/CP) and 12,000 acres of new land in Zone H2, below the
Kalawewa tank; (estimated cost US$ 42 million, or about US$ 1,600
per acre), and
(ii) Irrigation Modernization Project, comprising five existing tank-
fed irrigation schemes, covering an area of about 31,500 acres
outside System H (estimated cost US$ 18 million).
2.06     The decision meeting (July 9, 1975) concluded that the two parts of
the project were unrelated and decided to process them as separate
projects 1/. Both FAO/CP and Bank staff favoured irrigation modernization
because of expected higher rates of returno Government, on the other hand,
gave a higher priority to the Mahaweli Canga project and was decidedly
unhappy with the Bank's decision to split the H System project into two
phases. At the time of appraisal, Government had already started development
of 6,000 acres below the Kalawewa tank with its own resources. The appraisal
mission commented adversely on the quality of ongoing construction work in
System Ho The mission also expressed concern over the availability of suffi-
cient irrigation water for the entire System H area and recommended that
additional studies should be undertaken.
2.07    In September, 1975, the Government again requested the Bank that the
scope of the System H project be expanded to include the entire 71,000 acres,
as proposed in the feasibility study.  Earlier, the Government had unsuccess-
fully approached a number of other donors (Canada, US, UK, Netherlands)
requesting them to finance separate parts of the H System.  All four donors
had, however, participated in the Bank's appraisal of the project and shared
the Bank's view that Governsent's plans for implementation were overly
ambitious. Government's request was therefore not accepted.
2.08    Agreements were reached on financing contributions and terms for the
project during a meeting of all donors which was held in Washington in Decem-
ber 1975. In order to consult with Government prior to negotiations, the
Bank decided to send a post-appraisal mission for the Mahaweli Ganga project
to Sri Lanka in January 1976. To its surprise the post-appraisal mission
discovered that:
1/ The Irrigation Modernization Project, renamed "Tank Irrigation Modern-
ization Project", Credit 666-CE was approved by the Board on November 30,
1976.

"During the last few months, GOSL has stormed the proposed project
area of 26,000 acres with equipment and men from ten governmental
organizations and contractors and it is likely that they will com-
plete civil works in 15,000 acres by the end of 1976 and all 26,000
acres by mid-1977. So far, all efforts has been for civil engineer-
ing works only. We have, therefore, proposed to reformulate the
project co comprise civil works and land leveling in new areas H4
and HS, altogether 39,000 acres, and agricultural development,
including supply of farm tractors and agricultural supporting serv-
ices together with village infrastructures in all Stage rr areas of
71,000 acres. COSL accepted this and we shall guide them with
checklists in preparing a report for our appraisal around early
April (1976)."
2.39    In its report of March 26, 1976, the post-appraisal mission concluded
that GOSL's speedy implementation of the irrigation works should be
encouraged and the pace maintained. However, the mission also observed a
severe shortage of fp.rm equipment in the area and that construction of social
infrastructure was lagging behind the irrigation infrastructure and settle-
nent of the new farmers. The -mission considered whether or not it should
recomend retro-active financing of ongoing civiL works in the originally
appraised Stage I area (26,000 acres). But since IDA procurement procedures
had not been followed in contracting the works and GOSL did not want to stop
the works and re-tender in accordance with IDA requirements, the mission
recommended against retro-active financing.
2.10    The mission proposed that the revised project should include:
(i) construction of irrigation and road infrastructure and provision
of construction equipment in the new H4 and HS areas (39,000
acres);
(ii) construction of social infrastructure in the new H4 and H5 areas
and in the three Stage I areas appraised in 1975, i.e. H2, H7
and H9 (total 65,000 acres);
(iii) provision of farm machinery and operation and maintenance equip-
ment in areas indicated under (ii) above plus the H1 area,
developed in 1974/75 (total 71,000 acres); and
(iv) provision of support for agricultural extension and research,
including vehicles and equipment in areas H1 through H9, includ-
ing the H3, H6 and H8 areas, developed between 1946 and 1954
(total 87,300 acres).
The total cost of the revised project was estimated at about US$ 120 million,
including US$ 32 million in taxes and duties and a foreign exchange component
of US$ 35 million.

Second Appraisal (1976)
2.11    The project was appraised again in May/June 1976 by a team of four
IDA staff and a consultant, none of whom had participated in the first
appraisal.  Representatives of Canada, Netherlands, UK and USA, participated
in various stages of the appraisal. The re-appraised project included aLl
the components outlined above in paragraph 2.10, except that the provision of
extension services was also extended to H10, Hll and H12 areas, develoced
between 1954 and 1964.  The total coverage of the extension component thus
became 106,000 acres. The mission focussed its attention on a number of
subjects, briefly discussed below.
2.12    Construction Methods.  In view of the limited employment oppor-
tunities in the area, the mission recommended that some works be done by
manual labour, instead of machines as proposed originally. These work items
were ti) clearing of under-vegetation and small trees; (ii) land shaping on
slopes of less than 2 1/2Z, and (iii) construction of field bunds. Although
financial costs were about the same, economic costs for manual execution of
works were only about two-thirds that of machines.
2.13    Procurement Procedures.  Clearing of jungle (except large trees) and
construction of distributaries, field chanaels, farm ditches and drains would
be carried out by small contracts following Local Competitive Bidding (LCB),
or on a "piece work" basis. In view of the limited capacity of the private
sector, it was further proposed that up to 50Z of the capital intensive
works, i.e. clearing of large trees, construction of main and branch canals
and roads and buildings, would be allocated under negotiated contracts to
public agencies, provided that (i) unit prices would not exceed those in the
lowest evaluated LCB bid for similar work; (ii) prequalification standards
acceptable to IDA would have been met by all participants (whether LCB or
negotiated contract); and (iii) IDA would approve all public sector contracts
before they were awarded.
2.14    Implementation Schedule.  Completion of different project components
was to be scheduled as follows:
Irrigation Infrastructure and Settlement                3 years
Social Infrastructure                                   4 years
On-farm Works                                           5 years
Conditionality was proposed to ensure proper sequencing of various
activities, chief amongst them that no settlers would be brought into an area
earlier than three months before the expected delivery of water.
2.15    MD8 Organization.  The mission proposed, and Covernment agreed, to
divide 51DB's organization into two parts, i.e. (i) Engineering Design and
Construction and (ii) Operations, each under a Ceneral Manager who would
report to the Chairman, 1DB. The Operations Department would have three
sections, i.e. (i) Agriculture, (ii) Settlement and Community Development,
and (iii) Irrigation Operations and Maintenance. This set up was expected to
result in a better feed back from the field to the planning of new areas and
to reduce the heavy emphasis on engineering at the management level of 1DB.



- 38 -
2.16    Field Organization.  In order to ensure proper coordination between
agricuLtural extension, irrigacion and community developmenc, it was proposed
to establish a project management team consisting of a Resident Project
Manager (RPM), reporting directly to the General Manager, Operations and
three Deputy RPM's, i.e. Agriculture; Engineering; and Settlement and Com-
munity Development. Government had earlier decided to establish a separate
extension district-for the System H area (as recommended by the first
appraisal mission) under a Project Agricultural Extension Officer (PAEO) who
would report directly to the Deputy Director, Extension, in the Department of
Agriculture. The PAEO, ex officio, would be Deputy RPM, Agriculture. A
Project Advisory Committee (PAC) would be established under the chairmanship
of the RPM, with senior officers and farmers' representatives as members.
2.17    The second appraisaL mission produced its green cover report by
November 1976. A meeting with the four co-financiers was held in December
1976 to decide on contributions and on conditionality for external financing.
An important issue all along had been the recovery of Operations and Main-
tenance (0&M) and capital costs.  Recovery of OEM costs was provided for in
the "Land Betterment Charges Act", passed by the Sri Lanka Parliament in
October 1976. The Bank was led to believe that passage of the Act would
immediately be followed by detailed regulations to implement the Act. But by
October 1976, it had become clear that regulations would not be issued until
after the elections, scheduled for mid-1977, in view of strong opposition to
water charges voiced in Parliament during the debate on the Act. The Bank
considered for a while whether or not promulgation of detailed regulations
should be made a condition for negotiations. But in consultation with the
other donors, the Bank decided against this in order to avoid the risk of
delays in capitalizing on the heavy investments already made under the
Mahaweli Ganga I Project. The Bank and the other donors therefore agreed
that Government should be required to complete by January 1, 1978, all
administrative and other measures necessary for imposition and collection of
appropriate charges. Part of the capital co_ts would be recovered under the
provisions of the "Sale of State Lands Law" under which the land would be
sold to the settlers.
Negotiations
2.18    Negotiations were held from March 7 - 15, 1977, in Washington.  The
Government delegation was composed of the Secretary of Ministry of Irriga-
tion, Power and Highways and the Director of Economic Affairs. Repre-
sentatives of the Netherlands and UK attended the sessions. The proposed
cost recovery plan was one of the main subjects discussed during nego-
tiations. Other subjects discussed included procurement and audit arrange-
ments, technical assistance and appointment of an additional General Manager
for MDB's Operations Department.
2.19    Recovery of Capital Cost.  The Sri Lanka delegation said that under
the Sale of State Lands Li>-aof 1973, the Covernment was in the process of
selling State lands to settlers for cash or on a 20-year mortgage at 4i
annual interest. Sales notices had been served to 90,000 settlers throughout



- 39 -
the councry with the option to purchase irrigated land developed under past
schemes. In the project area, 4bout 68,000 acres or over 95% of the total,
was State land. The balance had been, or was expected to be, acquired by
Government by the end of 1971. Land sales would be completed in accordance
with the sectlement schedule. The average sales price, based on the cost of
improvements provided to the land, would amount to about Rs 3,550 per acre
(about Rs 8,900 per family).
2.20    Recovery of O&M Costs.  The Government delegation said that the
preparation of detailed regulations for implementation of land betterment
charges was nearly complete. The regulations would be submitted for approval
to Parliament following the 1977 national elections. Actual collection of
the land betterment charges would begin after the 1978 Yala harvest.
Board Approval
2.21    An IDA Credit of US$ 19 million was approved by the Board on April
21, 1977. A summary of estimated project costs follows below:

The foreign exchange component was estimated at US$ 32.6 M, or 41% of total
cost, net of taxes and duties.

The contributions by Canada, UK and US were for tied procurement of equipment
and for construction of civil works under paralleL financing arrangements.
The Netherlands contribution was untied in joint financing with IDA. Sub-
sequently, a further contribution of 2 million Units of Account (about
.US$2.4M) was granted by the Commission of the Eurovean Communities to help
GOSL defray the cost of local expenditures.
Credit Effectiveness
2.23    Due to delays in finalizing arrangements for the US contribution,
the IDA Credit became effective only on December 29, 1977. Meanwhile,
national elections had been held in July 1977 and the main opposition party
had won a large majority of seats in the National Assembly. The new Prime
Minister (subsequently elected President of the Republic) had made a commit-
ment during the election campaign to accelerate the implementation of the
Mahaweli Program, making it the cornerstone of his development policy for the
country. The main objectives of the proposed acceleration of the Mahaweli
Program were (i) immdiate reduction of unemployment, particularly among the
young people, and (ii) rapid reduction in the import requirements for staple
food stuffs and petroleum products in order to save foreign exchange.
2.24    In a letter to the President of the World Bank (November 22, 1977),
the Prime Minister stated that if the Mahaweli Program was to be implementcd
over the scheduled period of 30 years, the benefits to be derived from the
scheme would hardly have even a marginal impact on the expectations of the
educated unemployed youth, whose numbers were fast increasing as a result
of free education. The Prime Minister noted that the insurrection of 1971



- 41 -
was a serious set back to the progress of the country's development program
and that the situatior would become explosive once again in the not too
distant future, if not checked in time. The Government considered it an
imperative need to implement all the projects in the Master Plan in about six
years, in order that it would have the desired impact to make the country
self-sufficient in its food requirements and to provide employment for ataut
one million people who were presently unemployed. The Government was com-
mitted to settle about 22'.O00 families on the new lands to be opened up for
agricultural production and to provide those families the social infrastruc-
ture requirements, such as health, education, transport facilities, etc., in
addition co agricultural inputs to achieve maximum production.
2.25    The accelerated Mahaweli Program was estimated to cost about US$2
billion over five years and the Government therefore decided to mount a
high-level mission to seek international support. The Bank took a cauLious
but supportive attitude toward this new development, noting that it repre-
sented a rare political commitment to a productive endeavour which also had
sufficient charisma to induce public :ovings efforts. This episode was to
shape future developments of the Mahaweli Program and is referred to in some
detail because it was to have an immediate, and rather chaotic impact on the
implamencation of the Mahaweli II project.

Overview
3.02    As explained above, Government started development of System H under
the Mahaweli Program with its own financial resources. The elections and
related civil disturbances of mid 1977 had temporarily delayed construction
works in System H. Effectiveness of the IDA Credit at the end of 1977 coin-
cided with the new Government's decision to aScelerate the Program. With
regard to System H, the Government issued an order that all works should be
completed within one year. MDB was put under great pressure to comply with
this unrealistic time schedule. The Army and other public agencies were
moved into the H4 and HS areas to clear the jungle and build the canals
without regard to proper planning and work standards. The September 1978
supervision mission reported a large number of deficiencies in planning and
execution of the works and rated the project as a problem project. Much
damage was done during the initial period of construction. Due to the poor
quality of the works, water conveyance losses in the canals were much- larger
and operation and maintenance costs much higher than originally planned.
Project implementation started to improve in 1979 and by 1980 both the
progress made and the quality of construction works were satisfactory.
Implementation slowed down in 1981, mainly due to budget restrictions. Lap-
ses in the quality of construction works were again observed during the early
1980's. Instead of completing the project ahead of schedule, as the Govern-
ment had decreed, the IDA credit had to be extended two times until June 30,
1985. This was to a large extent due to additional canal lining require-
ments, part of which could have been avoided if the canals had been properly
designed and constructed in the beginning. Also, the Government had tended
to delay all concrete canal lining work to the end of the implementation
period, against tae counsel and recommendation of supervision missions to
implement such work much earlier.
Revisions
3.03    There were no major revisions in project contents.  There was,
however, a substantial increase in the project's social infrastructure com-
ponent, mainly because of the addition of police stations, post offices, and
living quarters for all teachers, which had not been provided for in the
original project. Similar provisions were later also made for the Mahaweli
III and IV projects.  Several minor tanks in the H4 and H5 areas were
rehabilitated instead of being breached as planned at first. It was also
decided to metal and tar the principal roads in the project area, including
72 miles in 14 and H5; the original plan provided for gravel roads.  The
target for the construction of drinking water wells was changed from one well
for 20 families to one well for six families. All the above changes could
easily be accommodated within the available project funds.
Implementation Schedule
3.04    The Kalawewa Right Bank main canal was completed one year behind
schedule in December 1980, and the last of the six branch canals one year



- 43 -
later in December 1981. At the time of the project's scheduled completion
date, i.e. June 30, 1982, about 80X of the civil works had been completed.
All works were fully completed by June 30, 1985, or three years behind
schedule. A total of 90 schools, eight health centers, 300 buildings for
agriculture activities and staff, and 600 buildings for O&M were completed
throughout System H. During the entire project implementation period the
time lag between jungle clearing and construction of irrigation infrastruc-
ture on one hand and on-farm development and construction of social
infrastructure on the other hand was much longer than originally planned. In
some instances, particularly in the H5 area, delays of up to five years
occurred between initial jungle clearing and the development of on-farm
irrigation and drainage systems and land preparation. As a result, substan-
tial expendicures had to be made to clear vegetative regrowth from the area.
The settlement program frequently ran far ahead of the first delivery of
irrigation water and the completion of schools and clinics, causing undue
hardship to the settlers. The major reason for the poor phasing of various
development activities during the first two years was Government's determina-
tion to accelerate the Mahaweli Program, focussing primarily on jungle clear-
ing, construction of main and branch canals and settlement. In later years,
shortages of local funds delayed implementation progress. Late delivery of
equipment and spares and organizational changes in the Mahaweli agencies also
caused some delays.
Settlement Program
3.05    Settlement in the new areas fell short of appraisal targets:
Zone                         Appraisal                  Actualp June 30, 1985

3.06    The shortfall was, amongst others, due to decisions to (i) retain
and rehabilitate minor tanks which originally were intended to be breached;
and (ii) retain land already planted with coconuts. More detailed mapping
and design surveys also found more land to be outside of gravity command than
originally anticipated. All farm families were allocated 2.5 acres of
irrigable land and 0.5 acres non-irrigable homestead sites, as planned. In
addition, some 3,600 non-farm families were settled in System H who received
homestead plots only.  Among the families settled in H4 and HS, about 701
were resettled from within the area; 201 were selected on the basis of elec-
toral or district quota; and 101 were evacuee families.
3.07    Some encroachments by illegal settlers have occurred in the H4 and
H5 areas, particularly in the parts reserved for forest plantings. However,
it i.s believed that such illegal settlement amounts to not more than about 3Z



- 44 -
of the irrigable land in H4 and HS. The Surveyor General's Department is
surveying all farm Lots in the new H areas in order to offer all settlers the
opportunity to purchase and receive free title to the Land, while at the same
time regularizing or evicting the illegal settlers, depending on each par-
ticular case.  During appraisal, it was estimated that about one quarter of
the land in HA and HS was privately owned or had been leased out by the
Government. In order t: 3ettle the planned number of families, privately
owned land had to be acquired. Land acquisition notices were issued for some
15,000 acres. However, relatively slow progress has been made in paying
compensation to the owners. As of June 30, 1985, about Rs 34 million had
been paid out for about 14,800 farm Lots. Compensation for another 8,650
farm lots still had to be paid and the rate of progress in mid 1985 suggested
that this would take another 12 to 18 months.
3.08    The original consultants feasibility report had recommended a model
farm size of three acres, with actual size of the farms depending on the size
of the farm family. Consultants had also recommended that all farms should
include both low lying lands (suicable for rice only) and uplands.
Presumably to avoid complications in the settlement program, standard 2.5
acre lots of farmland (highland or lowland or a mixture of both) were dis-
tributed regardless of the size of the families. This was a correct decision
since the composition of families changes quickly.
3.09    From the beginning, some of the settlers have leased out part of
their land. In the absence of a survey, it is not known why land is leased
out or how widespread this is being practiced. However, financial and land
preparation difficulties are considered to be the principal causes. The
situation should be closely monitored and the causes identified with a view
of avoiding social imbalances in the project area and inequitable distribu-
tion of benefits among the settlers.
3.10    Every effort was made to provide the settlers with basic needs during
their initial stay in the area, including: temporary housing for the heads of
households; initial jungle clearing; housing grant; provision of tools; paddy
seed and planting materials; and food rations distributec by the World Food
Programme, in accordance with plans made during preparation/appraisal of the
project. Nevertheless, many settlers experienced considerable hardship in
the first few years after settlement due to:
(i) initial land clearing had preceded settlements by a long period
and jungle regrowth hampered topographical surveys and land
marking;
(ii) some of the on-farm development work lagged behind settlement due
to shortage of machinery and labour at the right time;
(iii) water deliveries were not made within the period specified and
flow of water to some fields was impeded because parts of the
newly constructed irrigation network were defective; as a result
there were sometimes long delays between settlement and cultiva-
tion of the first irrigated crop; and

(iv) delays in construction of social infrastructure.
3.11    Pr ject staff have suggested that the emphasis on construccion
activities during the early years of System H and the relatively tate invol-
vement of the Mahaweli Economic Agency (MEA) may have negatively affected the
well-being of part of the settler population. In the new B and C Systems,
construction and development activities are better synchronized. System H
project staff continue to explore possibilities to improve conditions for the
settlers, for exampLe by providing assistance in the procurement of building
materials for their houses.
Social Services
3.12    The population .f the new H areas increased in accordance with the
appraisal projections and had reached about 138,000 persons at the end of
1983. But a survey of six villages in the new areas indicated that for
unexplained reasons the student population was almost 50X higher than
projected. This resulted in serious strains on the education facilities
provided for by the project. There are, at present, shortages of both class-
rooms and teachers. The construction of health facilities was completed as
planned, except that some of the dispensaries were upgraded. However,
according to the present Public Health Care (PHC) system there should have
been a higher number of the lowest level of health facilities (dispensaries,
maternity homes, etc.} and a lower number of rural hospitals and Divisional
Health Centres. Medical staffing of the new facilities was in 1984 about 5Z
below PHC standards.  The new H areas are now fairly well served with water
wells for domestic use following the decision to increase the ratio from one
well for 20 families to one for six families. UNICEF has provided covers and
hand pumps for about 700 wells. UNICEF also has provided funds for con-
structing tubewells throughout System H to provide a perennial supply of
water to areas where shallow wells do not provide adequate or suiteble water.
Agricultural Extension
3.13    The project has supported agricultural extension services in all H
areas, both old and new. In the new H areas, extension officers are respon-
sible to the project management and not to the Department of Agriculture as
in other parts of the country (see paragraphs 4.03 - 4.05).  The Department
of Agriculture supports extension work in all H areas through training of
extension workers and contact farmers at the Maha Illuppallama research
station. Buildings, equipment and vehicles for training activities of the
research station were provided by the project. Compared with appraisal
estimates the actual number of senior agricultural staf. in the H area
(project agricultural extension officer; subject matter specialist; agricul-
tural officer) is about twice as large and the number of field staff (agricul-
tural instructor; KVS) only about one half. The shortfall of field staff
does not seem to have affected the quality of extension services in the area.
The extension program emphasizes timely cultivation, fertilizer application
and weed control in paddy. The high crop yields achieved in the project area



- 46 -
after a relatively short period of development reflects well on the effec-
tiveness of the excension services. As for the future, both agricultural
research and extension should place greater emphasis on aspects of water
management and on the cultivation of field crops other than rice.
Agricultural Credit
3.14    The objeccive of cultivation loans is to encourage the use of modern
crop inputs and cultivation practices and to provide the borrowers with some
relief from village money lenders. National schemes for the provision of
cultivation loans have been made available in the Mahaweli areas through
three commercial banks, i.e. the Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon (both
state owned) and the Hatton National Bank (privately owned). The banks do
not operate in the same area; for example H4 area is served by the Peoples
Bank and HS by the Hatton National Bank. The Central Bank has been setting
the interest rates at well below market levels and has been refinancing up to
1002 of disbursement for rhe scheduled repayment period of 270 days. The
commercial banks have to carry the repayment risk. The risk has been very
substantial during recent years. This has Led to a major reduction in the
use of credit for cultivation in the H areas. In H4 area, for example, the
number of loans made and the amounts disbursed in the 1984/85 Maha season
were less than one third of the previous Maha season.  Repayment for the
1983/84 season was only 38% as of June 30, 1985, while repayment for the
following 1984/85 season had already reached 63Z on that date (see table 1
for details). Repayment performance had been falling since 1980/81. Maha
1983/84 recoveries were particularly poor because of excessive rains and crop
failures in many places. Farmers had to repay their previous loan in full
before they could qualify for a new one; in addition they required the signa-
tures of two guarantors for the loan.
Use and Supply of Crop Inputs
3.15    Actual fertilizer use for paddy in the newly developed H areas is
fairly consistene with the recommendation of the Department of Agriculture.
Substantial amounts are also used on some other high-value crops such as
chillies, but use is low on low value crops such as cowpeas.  Fertilizer use
is still being subsi dzed by the Government.  Agro-chemicals for use against
pests and weeds are a* Kuseod widely; they are in part produced in Sri Lanka
and in part imported. Ad    te supplies of seeds are regularly available
from the Department of Agriculture and from licensed seed farmers in System H.
3.16    MEA acts as agent for the supply of major farm inputs and arranges
for transport from suppliers warehouses to stores located in the project
area.  From there the inputs are sold to the farmers on cash terms or on
credit. The system has worked well and MEA has been performing an important
role, since in the early years few private traders had established themselves
in the new settlement areas. In 1983/84 MRA handled all seed supplies, about
70% of fertilizer supplies, and about one-half of the agro-chemicals used in
the project area. In 1985 changes were made in the system to ease HEA's
logistic problems. Fertilizers and agro-chemicals are now supplied directly



- 47-
to the farmers by agents of private suppliers on direct payment.  MEA manage-
ment correctly sees MEA's role in the input trade as temporary and is
encouraging the private sector to take over a greater share.
Marketing of Crop Produce
3.17    Contrary to expectations at appraisal, the Paddy Marketing Board
(PMB) purchases only a small part of the marketable output of paddy and other
crops produced in System H. Studies conducted during the 1982/83 crop season
indicated that only about 10 of paddy production was purchased by PMB. MEA
data for Maha 1984/85 show that PMB purchased less than 5X of the paddy
produced in that season. In 1982/83, well over 50Z of the paddy production
was sold by the farmers. Private sector trade appears to have an edge over
the Government's buying system because prices offered have generally been
higher than the official guaranteed purchase prices. It would appear,
however, that PMB's presence has helped maintain floor prices for paddy in
System H. The original plan to establish a PMB processing complex in System
H was cancelled. Milling of rice for home consumption is done in small
privately owned mills.
3.i8    Little information is available on marketing of other field crops
but it is believed that the greater part of the crops produced is consumed in
the home. Purchases by MEA have been insignificant. However, MEA has
assisted with the purchase and export of chillies to the Middle East and by
helping establish Export Promotion Villages (EPY). These EPV's have
registered with the Esxport Development Board enabling them to benefit from
export schemes formulated by Government; MEA recognizes the important role it
has in helping to identify and promote the cultivation of profitable field
crops other than rice in the new areas.
Project Cost
3.19    It has been difficult to determine with some degree of precision the
actual cost of the project at completion. In part, this is due to the fact
that the project, as defined at appraisal, was only one part of a larger
ongoing effort in System H. Other parts were financed entirely by the
Government of Sri Lanka. This, together with the sudden acceleration of the
Mahaweli program in 1977/78 and the reorganization of MDB into MASL, MECA and
KEA, has caused numerous bookkeeping difficulties. The best estimate avail-
able at this time indicates an actual project cost of about Rs 1,496 million
(US$86.2 m), including duti - and taxes, compared to the appraisal estimate
of Rs 731.6 m (US$100.5 m). Excluding duties and taxes, the estimated actual
project cost is estimated at Rs 1,457 m (US$84.0 m).  Contrary to the
appraisal estimate, project goods and services were, for the most part,
exempted from taxes and duties.

3.21    Expressed in Rs, the estimated actual project cost is more than twice
as high as the-SAR estimate. However, expressed in US$, actual project cost,
net of taxes and duties, was about the same as estimated at appraisal. More
detailed actual costs estimates are given in Table 2. It appears that the
actual cost of land clearing, on-farm dvel:-c-1p_nt and construction of irriga-
tion infrastructure, expressed in Rs, corresponded quite closeLy to the SAR
estimates. However, the actual construction costs of roads was about six
times, and that of buildings about four times as high as estimated at
appraisal. The increased cost of the roads was mostly due to changes in
specifications (asphalt instead of gravel) and that of buildings was mainly
due to increased numbers of such buildings (staff houses, schools, health
facilities, etc.). Operation and maintenance (O&i) costs incurred by MEA in
1981 and 1982 also are included in the actual total cost estimate.
3.22    About 701 of total project expenditures were incurred for works in
the H4 and HS areas, where a comprehensive package of development was sup-
ported by the project. Project costs per net cultivated acre for the H4 and
HS areas totaled about US$ 1,860 as shown below:

the project cost, net of taxes, and commercial banks, buyers of equipment and
Government aoout 47%. On the basis of confirmed actual contributions by
external donors and the estimated actual cost data given in para 3.19, it
appears that external donors actually financed 54X of project cost and
Covernment and other local sources 462. Details follow below:

3.24    Parts of the contributions of all five original donors lapsed or were
cancelled at project completion. Only about US$11.3 m of the IDA Credit was
actually disbursed and the remaining balance or abuuc uS57.7 m was cancelled
on February 6, 1986, the date of the last disbursement. On the other hand,
additional contributions were received from EEC (about US$2.2 m equivalent)
and the USA Sector Support program (about US$10 m). The total amount of the
two supplementary contributions, i.e. about US$12.2 m, and the total amount
of the original contributions that were cancelled, i.e. about US$11.9 m, are
about equal.
Procurement
3.2S     The Mahaweli Agencies' procurement actions for civil works caused
major problems throughout the project implementation period. As a result of
the policies of the previous Covernment, favouring public sector execution of
civil works, the private sector had only a very limited capacity at the time



- 50 -
the credit was negotiated. In view of this situation, the Government had
reluctantly agreed with IDA that 50% of the contracts for the construction of
the Kalawewa Right Bank canal, the branch canals and the village tanks and
50% of jungle clearing and land preparation would be awarded to private
contractors under LCB while the other 50% would be awarded to public agencies
under negotiated contracts. After IDA credits' approval, M1DB expressed the
view that the private sector did not have the required equipment capacity to
undertake as much as 50% of construction work requiring the use of heavy
machinery. IDA responded by recommending that project financed machinery be
made available to private contractors to improve their capacity for execution
of the works. M1DB did not change its position on this and in fact never
complied with IDA's recommendation. In hindsight, required LCB procurement
for this work probably should have been made a condition of disbursement
under the credit.
3.26    All civiL works including construction of main, branch and dis-
tributary channels, jungle clearing and the construction of the first lots of
boildings were undertaken by a total of five public sector agencies, includ-
ing 11D, the Army and the River Valley Development Board (RVDB). The latter
agency was given by far the largest share of the works, including the con-
struction of the Kalawewa Right Bank Canal. The September 1978 supervision
mission observed that no contracts were bid competitively, none were sub-
mitted to IDA for approval and that some of the works were proceeding on the
basis of oral agreements. RVDB had been assigned the design, construction
and supervision of irrigation and drainage works in over one-half of the
project area and was operating without a contract. Following Government 's
decision to accelerate the Mahaweli Program, M4DB apparentLy had no power to
enforce proper planning or scheduling of work or to enforce construction
quality standards. The mission insisted that a list of all civil works
contracts be prepared and submitted to IDA for review, showing details of
contracts and costs.
3.27    It took almost two years before the situation was more or less
regularized. By mid-1979, most of the civil works contracts had been higned~
and 14DB was starting to exercise more control over the other Government
agencies carrying out construction contracts. By the end of 1979, IDA recom-
mended that RVDB be excluded from further contracts because of poor quality
of its construction works and because of non-completion of some of the work.
From 1980 onwards, when most of the project's large infrastructure work
aLready had been completed, the public sector agencies were phased out.
Contracts for all remaining buildings and road works were awarded to private
contractors.
3.28    Small and medium size contracts for land development works had been
awarded to small private contractors from the beginning of the project.
These also caused many problems until the very end of the project, despite
the fact that IDA had agreed to disburse on the basis of Statement of Expen-
ditures for small sized contracts (see section on Disbursements).
3.29    Most of the equipment procured under the project was financed by
other cofinanciers. The IDA financed equipment, procured between 1978 and



- 51 -
1982, included mainly tires, spare parts and miscellaneous equipment. A
relatively large procurement of 1,050 two wheel tractors was cancelled
because IDA objected to the final recommendation for award after MDB had
changed its recommendation two times. In che end, MDB decided not to proceed
with the purchase because farmers could buy the tractors directLy from local
suppliers. Contracts for various items of operation and maintenance equip-
ment were awarded in late 1984 following satisfactory IC8 action by MEA.
Disbursements
3.30    Because the EEC grant was fully used in earLy 1981 and since substan-
tial savings in the IDA's and other donors' contributions were anticipated
(following the devaluation of the Rupee), IDA and the Netherlands Government
agreed in June 1981 to a request by Government to increase the disbursement
percentages against civil works as follows:
Old Percentages      New Percentages
IDA   NIO   EEC        IDA     Nro
(a) Irrigation Infrastructure and
Land Development and Roads         25     10   55         48       10
(b) Social Infrastructure and
Buildings                         47      13   30         65       30
3.31    Disbursements against civil works constructed in the initial project
years were substantially delayed because of inadequate documentation. In
1982, IDA agreed to simplify the procedures by allowing withdrawals against
contracts below Rs 500,000 through Statement of Expenditures (SOE). Separate
audits by independent auditors were required to certify the SOE's. However,
the Mahaweli Agencies were very slow in submitting required audit reports.
The first audit reports on SOS's revealed deficiencies in the procedures
followed by the Nahaweli Agencies, such as signing of contracts after works
were completed, unauthorized change orders, etc. In view of these qualifica-
tions IDA reduced reimbursements against the concerned SOE's.
Cost Recovery for Land Improvements
3.32    There has been broad agreement between Government and the Bank on the
principle of charging the beneficiaries under the project for the works and
services provided. This was to be accomplished by the sale of the farm and
house plots given to each settler, wherein the direct costs of development
would be charged and the settlers would receive clear title to the land.
However, so far no payments have been made by the settlers and the land
ownership stIll rests with GOSL. The iY7, SAR estimacet  ene cost of on-farm
works and other assistance to the settlers in System H to be about Rs 8,880
per family. It was proposed that the farmers pay back over 20 years the
principal amount, including 4% interest on the remaining balance. This would
result in an annual charge of about Rs 650 per farmer.



- 52 -
3.33    Until the early 1980's land in the new H areas (HI, H2, H7 and H9)
was alienated through notices published by the Land Commissioner under the
sale of State Lands Law of 1973. Agreements were signed between Government
and the farmers fixing tne costs to be paid by the settlers at Rs 7,862.50
for the 2.5 acre irrigatk4 -!its and Rs 1,015 for the 0.5 acre homesteads.
The farmers were informed that the payment could be made in one installment
or in ten annual installments, inclusive of interest at 41 per annum on the
outstanding balance. Lands recently occupied by settlers in H4 and H5 have
been alienated on the same basis, but no agreements were signed between the
Government and the farmers with respect to the costs to be recovered.
However, they were verbally informed at the time of settLement that the same
costs, mentioned above, would apply to their cases. Alienations in H4 and
H5, other than those to resettlers, have been made under the more recent Land
Development Ordinance Act of 1981. But again, no agreements have been drawn
up between Government and individual farmers regarding the costs to be
charged.
3.34    Government and the Bank reviewed the situation again during appraisal
and negotiations of the Mahaweli Ganga IV project in 1983/84. At that occa-
sion, Government gave assurances to the Bank that it would transfer the land
rights to the farmers at rates sufficient to recover the costs of settlement
assistance (housing, grant, tools, and seed/seedling materials), land clear-
ing, on-farm development, field canals, field drains, and any other improve-
ments agreed to between the Government and the Bank. The cost of on-farm
works and settlement assistance was estimated at that time at about Rs27,500
per farm/family. However, so far no payments have been made by the settlers
in any of the Mahaveli schemes.
Water Charges
3.35    In contrast to the lack of recovery of costs of capital development,
an encouraging start was made in 1984 with the collection of water charges
After years of deliberations, and with due regard to the political sen-
sitivities involved, Government finally made a number of firm decisions in
1983. These included amendments of the Irrigation Ordinance, e.g. (i) to
streamline action against water charge payment defaulters; and (ii) to
empower Covernment Agents to repair damaged irrigation works and recover the
costs from the offenders. At the same time, water charges for gravity
irrigation schemes were fixed at Rs 200 per acre to cover the current average
O&M costs. In the initial year i.e. 1984, only as 100 per acre (one half of
the established rate) would be charged. The rate would gradually be
increased in succeeding years so as to recover as 200 per acre by 1989.
3.36    Publicity and education programs regarding the recovery of 06) costs
were carried out in System H in the latter half of 1983.  The assessed amount
of water charges for 1984 was about is 5.8m of whic  8is 4.2 m (73Z) nad been
collected as of June 30, 1985.  Legal action under the Irrigation Act was
taken against farmers who did not pay water charges.

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Mahaweli Agencies
4.01    Until 1979 the organization of the Mahaweli Development Board (MDB)
conformed, with some minor variations, to the description given in paras 1.16
and 1.17 of the SAR. In view of the size of the System H project, two Resi-
dent Project Managers (RPM) were established in the field instead of one -
this was later further expanded to three.
4.02    In 1979 Government concluded that it required a strong central plan-
ning and decision-making body to meet the challenges of the ambitious
Acceleraced Mahaweli Program. Therefore the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka
(MASL) was created by an Act of Parliament in March 1979. MASL's two prin-
cipal executing agencies were at first the Central Engineering and Consult-
ancy Bureau (CECB) and the Mahaveli Development Board. The CECB was made
responsible for the large head works projects (Kotmale, Victoria, Madura Oya
and Randenigala dams and reservoirs) and MDB was charged with engineering and
construction of downstream irrigation development projects. Subsequently
MASL set up a Settlement Division in July 1980 and by Cabinet decision of
November 1981 the Mahaweli Economic Agency (MEA) was established. The
responsibility for downstream development and settlement were given to MEA,
leaving MDB with its previous responsibility for engineering and construction
of the irrigation and drainage systems. In 1983 the functions of MDB were
taken over by its successor, Mahaweli Engineering and Construction Agency
(MECA). This change further streamlined the MASL organization and served to
improve the coordination becween engineering, construction and settlement.
4.03    Prior to the establishment of MASL and MEA, a multiplicity of exist-
ing agencies provided agricultural and other support services in the new
settlement areas. For example, the Department of Agriculture was responsible
for agricultural extension services to the settler families. The project's
Agricultural Extension Officer also acted as Deputy Resident Project Yanager,
Agriculture. He was under the administrative control of MDB, but reported
directly to the Department of Agriculture. It was felt that the dual control
system led to inefficiencies. Therefore, when the Settlement Division was
established in July 1980, MASL decided to unify, on an experimental basis,
the management of all settlement, agricultural and other support services in
the h5 area.
4.04    As set up in the 15 area, a Unit Manager is in charge of settlement
and agricultural production for a hamlet of about 150-200 farm families. He
is responsible for the delivery of all settlement and agricultural require-
ments, including settlement support, extension of agricultural know-how,
water supply, supply of crop inputs, credit and marketing assistance. The
Unit Manager is assisted by two field assistants who are either seconded
Department of Agriculture field staff or recruited directly by KEA.

4.05    The new management system was considered a success and in 1981 it was
extended to the Hl, 2, 7 and 9 areas. Since then the new approach has been
adopted in the other Mahaweli Schemes as well. As for the future organiza-
tion and management of support services in System H, no firm decisions have
been taken as yet. For the time being the unified management system is being
followed in the completed zones of the project.
Water Supply and Management
4.06    Since water is in short supply in System H, particularly during the
Yala season, effective water management must be developed to maximize
agricultural output and ensure equitable water allocation to all farmers.
Effective water management also is required throughout the entire Mahaweli
Canga Basin to realize the greatest benefit to the country from multi-purpose
use of the water developed under the Accelerated Program, whether for irriga-
tion, power, fishery, or recreational uses.
4.07    A Water Management Panel (WMP), chaired by the Director Genaral of
MASL, manages all water resources in the Mahaweli project areac and is
responsible for bulk water releases from the main reservoirs for the purposes
of power generation, irrigation and other uses. The WMP is provided with
technical expertise by the Water Management Secretariat (WMS), established in
1983. The WMS controls al' water releases down to System level in accordance
with an agreed plan, using .Lmulation models to monitor water availability
and requirements, and to update the plan in accordance with actual conditions
of river flow and precipitation. At System level, MEA's Resident Project
Manager (RPM), in close consultation with the WMS, is responsible fir water
issues from the main and b-anch canals; the Block and Unit Managers .n turn
are responsible for issues at distributary and field levels.
4.08    All operational units, set up to manage the supply and distribution
of water in the Mahaweli Canga schemes, have performed well during the ini-
tial years despite some unusual climatic conditions. Some of the seasons
were particularly difficult ones because of excessive droughts or rains. The
variable weather patterns and occasional water supply shortages during the
Yala seasons make it often difficult to operate an efficient system in a
manner that benefits all farmers equally.
4.09    The Water Management Secretariat has coped quite well with preparing
seasonal operating plans, including monthly deliveries to the project reser-
voirs. However, there is scope for fine tuning the water supply and water
demand on a weekly and preferably daily basis. The present imbalances
between water delivery to, and water off-take by the system are now reduced
to some degree by the available storaRe capacity in the tanks.
4.10    Progress has also been made in improving the water delivery system
from the headvorks to the irrigation sub-systems, blocks and units. Water
schedules and releases are in part based on weekly to ten-day water demand
estimates sent up by the field units. MEA's Flow Monitoring Unit plays now a
central role in providing data for water management in the system. Efforts



- 55 -
should continue to improve the prediction of needed water delivecies. This
will require collecting, analysing and processing of data on cropping pat-
terns, soil types, weather conditions and irrigation methods and practices.
4.11    Water duties in System H were high in che initial years, which is
normal on newly irrigated soils. Improvements have been made to reduce water
wastage by the users. Modifications of the irrigation system such as lining
of canal sections where excess seepage has occurred, providing becter control
and measurement structures to improve reliability and accuracy of water
issues and training of operators and farmers in effective and efficient water
use have all helped to improve water management in the System.
Demand Irrigation Pipe System Pilot Project
4.12    In early 1979, at the recommendation of the water management consult-
ant, MDB committed itself to implement a proposed pilot project involving the
installation of 850 acres of an automated concrete pipe system capable of
delivering water under a socalled Limited Rate Demand Irrigation Schedule
(DIS).  The objective was to determine (i) what the proposed system would
cost relative to the standard earth ditches and rotation schedule; (ii) what
the unrestricted water use would be; (iii) what improved cultural practices
might be used and what the resulting crop yields would be; and (iv) what
social benefits might develop.
4.13    Due to implementation problems and delays, only about 365 acres of
the 850 acres planned were completed.  Six irrigation seasons have been
monitored between Maha 1961i82 and Nana  9084/180 5, d a iumuer oh conclusions
have been made in the consultant's final report, 1/ including:
(i) it was not practical to obtain costs from actual construction
figures; it is estimated that project cost at the distributary
channel level are about double the cost of the present gravity
system;
(ii) water use was initially high, but during the last few seasons
about the same as in control blocks; several groups showed
appreciably lower use rates;
(iii) paddy yields were between 131 and 291 higher than in the control
blocks; and
(iv) social benefits are high, e.g. distribution of water amongst
farmers is more even and tail-end problems do not occur.

4.14    The experience gained sofar has been valuable but it is too early to
draw definite conclusions. The benefits of such a system would perhaps be
more evident with vegetables and other high value crops where better water
control and timely deliveries are essential. It would be in the project's
interest to keep the pilot scheme operational for some years and to monitor
its performance closely under more stabilized conditions.
Performance of the Borrower
4.15    Throughout the project period the Government remained strongly com-
mitted to the Mahaweli Program and thus to the implementation of this
project.  This commitment was reflected in the levels of financial and staff
resources being made available to the scheme. Adequate funds were allocated
to the project in all years, except in 1981 when Covernment was forced to
impose some restrictions mainly due to the overall size of the Mahaweli
Program at that time.  Staff posted on the project generally performed well
and vacancies were never left unfilled for long.
4.16    On the down side, Government's strong commitment to the program led
to over ambitious programming of works during the early years.  This resulted
in poor phasing and loss of quality for part of the works. It also strained
the Mahaweli Development Board's capacity to administer the program,
reflected in the shaky financial records of investments during the initial
years. To the Government's credit, it should be added that the necessary
lessons were quickly learned. The establishment of MECA and MEA as separate
work organizations under MASL has much improved the implementation of the
program. KASL also deserves credit for its determination to devise and
introduce a workable system to recover part of the operation and maintenance
cost from the settlers.  On balance the performance of the Borrower can be
characterized as very commendable.
Performance of IDA
4.17    IDA also performed well during appraisal and supervision of the
project. Civen its knowledge of Government's capacity to implement the
scheme, IDA appeared justified in cautioning against over-ambitious program-
ming and insisting on a reduction in the size of the project during prepara-
tion and first appraisal in 1975. However, IDA also showed flexibility in
reconsidering its position in 1976 after Covernment had shown its strong
determination to proceed quickly with the works and decided to implement the
project as proposed originally in the feasibility studies. Lack of under-
standing of Government's position at that time could have resulted in IDA and
the other donors withdrawing or suspending their support for the program.
This would almost certainly have led to disruption if not the demise of the
program.
4.18    IDA staff succeeded in influencing implementation of the Mahaweli
program for the better after the initial confusion had subsided. Working
relations between IDA and Covernment staff were always good. There was good
continuity of staff assigned to the project from appraisal to project comple-
tion. IDA staff also maintained close relations with other co-financing

agencies. Representatives of other donors participated in all supervision
missions, i.e. U.K. eleven times; USA nine times, and Canada and the Nether-
lands eight times each.

5.03    A number of observations can be made concerning the data given above:
(i) During the Maha season almost the entire farm area is cultivated
with irrigated rice.  Rice is the staple food crop; quality seeds
are freely available; the surplus production is readily
marketable; it is a low risk crop since pests and diseases are
well researched and the crop also requires less ready cash and
Labour than some of the potential alternative other field crops
(OFC). Only a small part of System H is grown with rainfed OFC.
Cultivation of irrigated OFC was practiced to some extent in
1982/83 and 1983/84 but not at all in 1984/85 when rainfall was
abundant.
(ii) The 1984 and 1985 Yala seasons were both very successful because
of abundant rainfall. Between 75 and 1001 of the farm area was
cultivated with irrigated crops in those two years. However,
during the preceding low rainfall years 1981 and 1982, only 201-
301 of the then cultivable area was planted with irrigated crops
and no irrigated cultivatior was permitted at all in H4 and H5 in
1983. Shortage of irrigation water during the Yala season,
because of limitations in the diversion capacity of the Bowatenne
tunnel and inadequate storage capacity in System i1 itself, are
the reasons for the erratic cropping intensities during the Yala
season. According to the 1985 studies of Operating Policy
Options of the Mahaweli Water Resources Management Project by
Consultants, a reliable annual cropping intensity of 1651 can be
supported in the H System under the present conditions. improved
water use practices, i.e. cultivation of less demanding crops
than rice and reduction in wastage of water, could raise the
cropping intensity to 190.
(iii) The appraisal report projected 482 irrigated OFC and 361
irrigated rice during the Yala season. But actually the propor-
tion of irrigated OFC has always been mdch smaller than that of
irrigated rice, except in 1982. In that year there was a severe



- 59 -
shortage of water and project authorities exercised strict con-
trol over the cropping patterns.
Crop Yields
5.04    Paddy.  Information on paddy yields is collected by the Department
of Census and Statistics and by the MEA. The former estimates are based on
crop cutting-surveys and the latter on farmer interviews. Typically, MEA's
estimates are about 25% to 35% higher than those prepared by the Department
of Census vnd Statistics (see Table 4). it is also noted that substantial
variations in yields occur from one year to another, depending mostly on
moisture conditions. A summary of 'AR estimates and reported actual yields
is given below (m ton paddy per acre):

Crop Production
5.06    Paddy production in alL new H areas reached about 135,000 m ton in
1984/8S, according to Department of Census data.  This is equivalent to about
-2 of Sri Lanka's total annual paddy production (about 2.4 million ton in
1983 and 1984). According to MEA data, the annual production of other field
crops in the new System H areas increased from 6,000 m ton in 1982/83 to
about 15,000 m ton in 1984/85. Only about 1,000 to 2,000 m ton was grown in
the Maha season and the balance in the Yala season. Chillies is the most
important other field crop in System H, both in Maha and in Yala.
5.07    The Department of Census does not collect crop production data for
the H4 and HS areas separately; MEA does, but its crop yield and production
estimates have consistently been higher than the Department's estimates, as
noted above. Separate estimates for H4 and US are required to compare cur-
rent estimates of crop production with the appraisal estimates, which refer
to the HW and HS areas only. MEA's information on crop areas in H4 and HS
(which can be considered approximately correct) and average yields for the
last three years for all H areas, as reported by the Department of Census,
have been used in the revised estimates. Further, a cropping intensity of
1652 has been assumed, as suggested in the consultants study (see para 5.03).
Details on the SAR estimate and the revised PCR estimate on crop production
in H4 and HS, based on the assumptions discussed above, are given in Tables S
and 6 and are sumarized below:

Total                        64,000         55,270
5.08    The-revised estimate confirms that the production of paddy exceeds
the SAR estimate - not only in exceptionalLy good years, but in average years
as well.  On the other hand, production of other field crops has remained
below the appraisal estimates, with the exception of chillies which has
become the second most important cash crop, after paddy.
Farm Incomes
5.09    Settler families cultivate 2.5 acres of irrigated land and reside on
a 0.5 acre homeplot where they grow vegetables, spices and fruit trees and
where they may raise animals. Farm incomes that typical settler families
derive from their irrigated land can be estimated by using the information on
crop areas and production, discussed above and the estimates on crop produc-
tion cost, given in Tables 7 and 8. MEA has undertaken a survey to estimate
incomes from home plots.
5.10    As discussed in paragraph 5.07 cropping intensity on irrigated land
would in a normal year reach about 95Z during Maha and about 702 during Yala,
or 165 for the year. It has been assumed here that farmers in Zones H4 and
HS cultivate 4.15 acres per year, of which about 3.375 acres are planted with
rice; 0.45 acres with chillies, 0.175 acres with pulses and 0.10 with other
crops (soy beans, maize, vegetables). Table 9 shows the financial results
for a typical settler family, using 1984/85 prices, and is summarized below:
Rs
Gross Value of Production                             24,439
Cash Crop Production Costs                            10,002
Net Value of Production                               14,437
Cash crop production costs include the present irrigation watercharge of Rs
100 per acre, but no charge for development of the land is included. The NVP
corresponds to about Rs 5,775 per acre of irrigated land per year and to
about Rs 87 per family labour day. During appraisal in 1977 the average net
farm income from growing crops on irrigated land was estimated at about Rs
6,390.  In 1984/85 terms, the SAR farm income amounts to about Rs 15,725 or
about 10 over the present estimate.



- 62 -
5.11    A special sample survey conducted by MEA in 1985 disclosed that
incomes from homesteads range widely around a median income of about Rs 4,900
and a mean (or average) income of about Rs 8,500 per homestead. Income from
homesteads is derived mainly from cultivation of fruits and vegetables, plant
nurseries and Livestock produce, including hiring out of draught animals.
5.12    Most families also have some non-farm income particularly those with
older children (for example, seven of the eleven families surveyed by MEA for
the homestead survey had some non-farm income). Non-farm incomes ranged
widely around a median of Rs 2,550 per annum and a mean income of about Rs
10,900. Reported sources of non-farm income are tractor hiring, leasing-in
and cultivation of farm land, and trading.
VI.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01    The project financed a full package of investments in the H4 and H5
areas.  In other areas of System H the project financed only parts of the
package (see paragraph 3.01). The economic costs and benefits have therefore
been analyzed for the H4 and 85 areas only, both at appraisal and for this
PCR (Table 10). The main assumptions made in the analysis follow below:
(i) A Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.6 was applied at
appraisal and 0.85 for this PCR. During appraisal separate
conversion factors were applied for capital-intensive works,
skilled labour and unskilled labour. No separate conversion
factors were estimated for this PCR.
(ii) All Investments Costs incurred under this project were included
in the economic analysis, except for the cost of social
infrastructure (schools, health facilities, etc.) for which
estimates of benefits cannot be readily quantified (both SAR and
PCR). Stage I investment costs (i.e. Polgolla diversion works)
were treated as sunk costs.
(iii) Incremental Crop Production estimates were based on the follow-
rng:
- with project: actual crop production data until 1984/85
(Table 3) and estimates on future crop areas, yields
and producton as explained in Chapter V (Tables 5 and 6);
- without project: crop areas as estimated at appraisal and crop
yields estimated to equal 80S of with project crop yields.
(iv) Incremental production costs:
- with project: labour and input requirements as detailed in
Tables 7 and 8;



- 63 -
- without project: input requirements estimated at 80Z of with
project estimates for fertilizer use and pest and weed control;
at 100l of with project estimates for labour and other input
requirements-
(v) Economic Prices of internationally traded commodities based on
IBRD Commodity Price Forecasts, August 1986; for locally traded
goods mid-1985 prices were used in the analysis (Table 8).
6.02    The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the project under the assump-
tions outlined above is -1X. At appraisal the ERR was estimated at 21Z. The
depressed rice price of recent years, and also projected for the future, is
the dominating reason for the low ERR. At appraisal it had been estimated
that the 1985 rice price would be about 20X higher than the 1976 price (in
constant terms). But the actual 1985 rice price was almost 501 lower than
the 1976 price. Using the rice prices projected at appraisal results in an
ERR of 16X. Using the rice prices projected in mid-1985 when the credit was
closed gives an ERR of 71. It should also be noted that only benefits from
agricultural production were included in the analysis, as at appraisal.
However, part of the investment costs, particularly in road construction,
will also result in benefits in other sectors of the economy of the project
area.
6.03    Future increases of incremental agricultural benefits irrespective
of rice prices are quite possible and could be brought about by:
{i) increases in irrigated areas through water conservation and/or
changes in cropping patterns away from rice (see paragraph 5.03);
and/or
(ii) increases in rice yields above the average yield for 1983-1985,
used in this analysis.
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
7.01    Government's comitment to the implementation of the Kahaweli Ganga
Development Program has been very strong throughout the planning and con-
struction period of the System H project. Government in fact rejected early
suggestions by Bank preparation teams to give higher priority to the
rehabilitation of existing schemes, and to extend the implementation period
for the project. Furthermore, finding itself under considerable political
pressure, Government decided in 1977 to accelerate the implementation of the
entire Mahaweli Program, including System H.
7.02    Government succeeded in attracting substantial external financing
for the Accelerated Program from foreign donors. The decision to speed up
implementation was not without cost, however, particularly in System H where
conqtruction had just started. The cost included amongst others:



- 64 -
(i) Lack of Proper Phasing of project activities; for example jungle
clearing and construction of infrastructure ran several years
(in some places upto five years) ahead of on-farm development and
construction of social infrastructure; large parts of the project
area had therefore to be cleared again of jungle regrowth; many
settlers were brought into the area far too early.
(ii) Loss of Quality of works because of lack of authority and ade-
quate supervision of contractors by the Mahaweli Development
Board.
(iii) Unacceptable Procurement Procedures as most of the civil works
were let to incompetent parastatal agencies; works were fre-
quently let without proper contracts being drawn up or signed.
(iv) Poor Accounting Practices as the administrative capacity of the
Mahaweli Development Board was inadequate to handle a workload
which had increased manifold within a short period.
7.03    When the problems, cited above, became apparent Government moved
quickly to reorganize and strengthen MDB. The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lank
(MASL) was established in 1979 as a central planning and decision making body
under the Ministry of Mahaweli Development. The Central Engineering and
Consultancy Bureau (CECB), the Mahaweli Engineering and Construction Agency
(MEA) and the Mahaweli Economic Agency (MEA) were subsequently established as
separate work organizations, replacing MDB. Coordination between engineer-
ing, construction and settlement activities has been much improved since that
time and the early mistakes in System H were not repeated in Systems
developped subsequently (C and B).
7.04    Despite the negative economic rate of return, the project can cer-
tainly be classified as a successful one. Major objectives in terms of land
development, settlement, and crop production were achieved and there is much
promise for further developments. The project has created useful employment
for large numbers of people and has brought Sri Lanka's goal of food self
sufficiency within reach. The poor economic rate of return is almost
entirely due to the depressed rice prices of recent years. The low rice
price, together with frequent shortages of irrigation water during the Yala
season, underscore the urgent need for experimentation with other field
crops, preferably those which demand less water. Recent experience with the
cultivation of chillies has been successful and the crop has become an impor-
tant contributor to farm incomes.
7.05    An encouraging beginning has been made with the collection of water
charges. Assessment and collection is the responsibility of MEA staff. The
per acre rates are scheduled to increase to full 06M cost recovery level
within the next few years. Recovery of capital costs has, however, not yet
been started.
7.06    Coortlination between the ezternal donors has been very good
throughout the implementation period. All donors participated frequently in
supervision missions organized by IDA and relationships were always construc-
tive.

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
2.01     The basic concept underlying the Mahaweli Ganga Development
Program CMGDP) stemmed from the need to overcome two major problems facing
Sri Lanka at that time, unemployment and excessive imports of agricultural
products, particularly rice. The Program, based on a Master Plan prepared
jointly by UNDP/FAO and Sri Lanka engineers in 1965-68, envisaged develop-
ment of about 900,000 ac (365,000 ha) of irrigable land in the dry zone,
as well as about 500 MW of hydropower. It was divided into three phases,
each including several projects, for implementation over a 30-year period.
Initial construction of the Program began in 1970, with Bank Group financ-
ing (Loan No. 653 and Cr. 174-CE), including the transbasin diversion
beadworks at Polgolla and Bowatenna and other associated works, completed
in 1978. Under a second project, financed by IDA (Cr. 701-CE) and five
cofinanciers in late 1977 and completed in 1985, development of 70,000 ac
(28,000 ha) of land in System H was accomplished.
2.02.      The new Government, which came to power in 1977, realixed that
at the ongoing rate of construction of the MCDP and the population growth
rate in Sri Lanka, the Program would not have much impact on the country's
economy in terms of meeting existing serious food shortage and unemploy-
ment problems. General agreement was reached between the Covernment and
the Association on the desirability of accelerating the Program. The
Association undertook to help mobilize international financial support for



- 78 -
the Program and to advise on the scope of the studies and investigations
required to carry it out. To this end, an Implementation Strategy Study
(ISS) was carried out by Netherlands financed consultants (NEDECO) to
determine a specific action plan, and the Association engaged consultants
(SOGREAH) to act as general consultants to provide technical assistance to
GOSL in the planning and preparations of final designs and tender docu-
ments for the major features.
2.03     After a review of available financial resources, construction
capabilities and trained technical personnel, the Government decided to
accelerate the construction of five major projects, comprising five dams
and hydropower plants with an installed capacity of about 600 Mh, and
development of about 290,000 ac of new lands. During the early months of
1978, the Government consulted with the Association and contacted several
prospective donor countries for assistance in the preparation of the five
projects. Expressions of interest were received for these projects as
well as for downstream development and other works and studies.
2.04     NEDECO's final report was completed in August 1979, several
months after bilateral-financed consultants had started feasibility
studies of four of the major projects. NEDECO's findings differed sig-
nificantly from the UNDP/FAO Master Plan -- in part due to updated infor-
mation and in part due to the use of more advanced analytical techniques
and assumptions (e.g. with regard to water availability, water require-
ments, regulation capability of the reservoir system and alternative water
conveyance systems). Two of the significant NEDECO findings were:
(a)  the Victoria, Haduru Oya and Kotmale reservoirs together could
supply enough vater to fully irrigate existing irrigated lands
and the new areas proposed for development under the AMP, thus
permitting the water developed by the Randenigala and
Moragahakanda reservoirs (and several small reservoirs) to
irrigate lands elsewhere in the North Central River Basins
(NCRB) or the Northwest or Southeast Dry Zones (NWDZ or SEDZ);
and
(b) if surplus Mahaweli water were to be diverted to the NCRB
area, a different plan could be developed for conveying the
water northward which would substantially lower the cost as
compared with the conveyance system proposed under the
UNDP/FAO Master Plan.
2.05     In view of NEDECO's findings and the Government's desire to
construct Randenigala and Moragahakanda projects as soon as feasibility
could be established, there was immediate need to carry out stuties of the
transbasin diversion plan, as well as to determine the areas for which
water developed by these projects could best be utilized.  There also was
need to carry out promptly the preparation of final designs and tender



- 79 -
documents for the development of the downstream works (irrigation and
social infrastructure) in the command area to be served by the Victoria
Project (System C), since the construction of the Victoria Project was
expected to begin in early 1980 and the ongoing study carried out by the
Government (assisted by its consultants, Hunting Technical Services, Ltd.
(HTS)) was only a feasibility-grade study of the area. By end 1984, when
the headworks for the Victoria Project were expected to be completed. the
downstream development for the project Ahould be in place so as to maxi-
mize benefits from the investment. Since the Government's experienced
engineering and technical staff were fully committed to other ongoing
works, it was believed necessary to prc;.Jc technical assistance for the
above work as well as for other studies and investigations which might be
required for expeditious implementation of the AMP.
2.06       Accordingly, at the Government's request, the proposed techni-
cal assistance project was identified jointly by the Government of Sri
Lanks and the Association. It was prepared by the Government with IDA
assistance. A mission visited Sri Lanka in November 1979 to discuss the
project and the draft terms of reference for technical assistance prepared
by IDA. A Staff Appraisal Report was not required. Negotiations were
held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on December 27, 1979 and the project was
approved on January 29, 1980.
2.07      The project's objectives were to support the Government's
efforts to accelerate the implementation of the Mahaweli Canga Development
Program by providing consultants' services, vehicles, equipment and sup-
plies to the Government for: (i) preparation of a reconnaissance-level
study of plans for conveying and utilizing surplus Mahaweli Canga water to
develop land in any of three alternative areas (or any combination of
them) in order to select the best plan for a transbasin diversion project;
(ii) on-going review of designs and tender documents for the Right Bank
Canal planned to serve Systems C and B; (iii) preparation of final designs
and tender documents for construction of civil works and social
infrastructures (e.g., village and township centers and roads) in Zones 3
to 6 of System C; and (iv) other studies and designs of projects in tne
Mahaweli Program to be undertaken by the Mahaweli Development Authority
(MDA) during implementation of the Program. Training of local staff was
included in all the above studies. The proposed project was to be carried
out over two-year period beginning in 1980.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
3.01       Total project costs were estimated to be about US$6.0 million.
During financing discussions with GOSL and the European Economic Community
(eec), it was agreed that the EEC would provide US$2.0 million equivalent
for a Special Action Credit to be administered by IDA to finance consult-
ants' services for the ongoing review of the designs and tender documents



- 80 -
for the Right Bank Canal and for preparation of final designs and tender
documents for System C (US$1.5 million), as well as vehicles, equipment
and supplies for the entire technical assistance project (US$0.5 million).
Retroactive financing of up co US$200,000 equivalent (dating back to
December 1, 1979) was agreed for the ongoing review of the Right Bank
Canal documents. The IDA Development Creeit of US$3.0 million would
finance the consultants' services for the study of a transbasin diversion
project (US$1.5 million) and the other studies and designs of projects
under the Mahaweli Program (US$1.4 million), as well as the training for
local scaff (US$0.1 million). The Government's contribution of US$1.0
million would finarre counterpart personnel, offices, and houses for
consultants.
IV. PROJECT UNDERTAKINGS AND RESULTS
Transbasin Diversion Stu.y
4.01    The consultants for this study (Joint Venture Mahaweli Transbasin
Diversion - JVMTD) were selected expeditiously and were appointed and
fielded just two months after credit effectiveness. The team provided
proved to be exceptionally competent and the studies progressed rapidly,
even though delays in data collection (mapping and aerial photography) and
in appointing technical counterpart by GOSL somewhat delayed the consult-
ants' work. The consultants first review report, which identified alter-
native development options and study constraints, was prepared on schedule
and set the stage for further work to be carried out and key decisions
required by GOSL. Delays by the Survey Department in completing required
topographic mapping when due and additional areas incorporated in the
study caused a postponement in the consultants' planning report by about
two months, which ended the first phase of the study - some nine months
after its initiation (June 1981). The consultants' contract was amended
during this period to incorporate -he addendums requested by GOSL.
4.02    Several key decisions were made during review of the consultant3'
planning report: (i) due to the apparent low rate of return resulting from
the preliminary studies and the high energy requirements envisaged, no
further consideration would be given to either pump or gravity irrigation
conveyance schemes to serve a portion of System M or the NCRB; (ii) work
would be termizated on studies relating to the Kelani Diversion (diversion
to the Mahaweli service area); (iii) the fixed diversion policy of 875 McM
annually at Polgolla would be maintained; (iv) additional studies would be
made to determine the effect on Polgolla diversion capability by raising
Kotmale Dam to its original proposed level of 731.5 meters a.s.l.; and (v)
studies would be made of the conveyance of Mahaweli Canga water to two
additional existing schemes not included in the planning report, the Cal
Oya scheme and a small area to the northwest of Anuradhapura. During the
remainder of the study the consultants would concentrate on completing



- 81 -
water balance calculations, agricultural benefits and preliminary designs
and cost estimates, particularly in relation to the NWDZ and SEDZ schemes,
which appeared to be marginally viable.
4.03    The consultants' Draft Final Report was completed in December 1981
and reviewed in March 1982. The study showed that development of about
14,500 ha in the SEDZ (mainly for rice) was economically feasible (ERR
above 12X) an5 about 10,000 ha in the NWDZ (mostly for sugar cultivation)
under the fixed Polgolla diversion policy, was marginally viable (ERR
about 10%). During 1982 and 1983, GOSL requested the consultants to carry
out further studies and sensitivity analyses to refine these schemes and
improve their viability, and the consultants contract was amended accord-
ingly. The date for completing the Final Report was delayed pending the
outcome of these studies and the credit closing date was extended. Very
little progress was made during 1983-84. Additional analyses and studies
to review implications of a modified Polgola diversion policy were
requested in mid 1985, which were completed in March 1986. This resulted
in rates of return for development in the NWDZ of between 10-12X. The
consultants' Final Report has been printed and is being assembled in
Colombo, but has not yet been released.
Minipi Right Bank Canal Review
4.04    The Government engaged Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Cibb),
through Hunting Technical Services Ltd. (HTS), to make a detailed review
of the Minipe Anicut and the Minipe Right Bank Canal and prepare
specifications and tender documents for the canal suitable for interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB). Due to the urgency of this work to
enable IDA financing of the canal under the proposed Mahaweli III preject,
soon to be appraised, this work was started prior to effectiveness of the
EEC credit and was partly retroactively financed. The consultants sta-
tioned two engineers in the 14ahaweli Development Board (MDB) office to
assist with this work. The contract documents, specifi.ations and bid
drawings were prepared by the consultants in their head office in consult-
ation with 1DB.  Excellent progress was made, enabling a contract to be
awarded for construction of the Right Bank Canal shortly after appraisal
of the Mahaweli III project. The consultants assisted with the prepara-
tion of working drawings for construction use and were able to keep pace
-with the contractor's requirements, finally phasing out the two eng.neers
working with MDB in September 1981.  The Right Bank Transbasin Canal was
successfully comoleted and commissioned and is largest irrigation canal,
concrete lined its entire length, in Sri Lanka.
Design of Infrastructure in System C
4.05    In as much as the UTS consultants had carried out the feasibility
studies for developing System C under grant financing from the United



- 82 -
Kingdom in conjunction with the financing of Victoria Dam and Reservoir,
which develops the water from System C, the Government engaged HTS to
assist lDB in preparing final designs, specifications and tender documents
for the irrigation and social infrastructure. Although some differences
arose between MDB and HTS on criteria to be used in the designs midway
during the working period and some of MDS's design drawings had to be
redone, the issue was resolved and the work was completed satisfactorily.
The designs prepared are being utilized in the development of System C
under Credit 701-CE (Mahaweli III), cofinanced by Japan and the Kuwait
Fund; the project is well underway and completioii is expected by 1988.
Support for Other Studies/Investigations
4.06    It was envisaged at the time of project preparation that there
would be a need to carry out other studies and designs in support of
implementation of the AMP that could not be identified at that time, and
US$1.4 million of the IDA credit was allocated for that purpose. The
studies anticipated included geophysical investigations of dam sites and
tunnel and main canal alignments, hydraulic model studies of spillways and
irrigation outlets, testing of foundation and construction materials, and
detailed planning and design studies. Unfortunately, such assistance was
not requested by the Government until the last year of credit effective-
ness, even though the credit was extended a total of three years to enable
GOSL to identify and carry out the studies!investigations needed.
4.07    Because of delays by the Saudi Fund in financing as agreed (i) the
main and branch canals for the System B Right Bank Project (Mahaweli IV -
with cofinancing by Canada and the Bank Group) and (ii) the consultants
selected to assist in carrying out this work, it was agreed to use techni-
cal assistance funds to finance the consultants to review and update the
final designs and tender documents for the canals, to enable early tender-
ing of this work when financing problems were resolved. On October 23,
1984 the credit was extended nine months to September 30, 1985 for this
purpose. The consultants were appointed in May 1985 and completed the
assignment successfully in late 1985. Significant design modifications
were made and the canal construction work is ready for tendering when
project financing permits.
Trainina
4.08    Considerable on-the-job training was provided to counterpart staff
and local employees by HTS, JVMTD, and the Cibb consultants during the
course of thei work assignments. Such training included all aspects of
irrigation system and social infrastructure planning and design, prepara-
tion of cost estimates, specifications and tender documents for both local
and international competitive bidding, river basin planning at both recon-
naissance and feasibility level, and basic computer techniques. In addi-
tion to this training, two study tours were organized for senior staff of



- 83 -
MASL, the first to Egypt by three senior officers to review irrigation and
drainage work (and problems) resulting from Aswan Dam development and work
in the Nile Delta. The second tour, for four senior officials, was to
South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand to familiarize these officials
with water management/allocation aspects of multi-purpose projects and
i           operation and maintenance procedures and practices being carried out for
large irrigation projects. The tours provided a good insight to
problems/difficulties which might be encountered in development of the
AMP.  The JVMTD consultants also provided training abroad for three
engineers for three months during January-April 1982.
1-zrformance of Consultants
4.09     Overall performance of the three consulting firms/consortiums
providing services and assistance to MASL under the project was exception-
ally good.  The personnel appointed were competent and highly motivated.
As a result, critical studies and designs were completed successfully and
when required, which enabled the implementation of key projects in execu-
tion to be carried out without delay. The designs produced with consult-
ants' assistance were of good quality and embodied modern design tech-
nologies and concepts. Although the final report for the transbasin
diversion study was not completed until near the end of the credit closing
period (and the fina' printed copy still has not been provided to IDA),
the quality of the studies carried out was excellent and delays were due
to additional refinements and study alternatives requested by GOSL to
further define development options.
V. LEGAL UNDERTAKINGS AND COMPLIANCE
5.01    The specific major legal un vrtakings of the credits with the
Government were relatively simple, involving primarily (i) the carrying
out of the project with diligence and efficiency e-.d the prompt provision
of funds, facilities and services as required; (i) employment of consult-
ants under terms of reference and with qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to IDA, and to facilitate
the work of such consultants; (iii) appointment of qualified counterpart
personnel to consultants; (iv) all goods and services financed from
proceeds of the credits to be used exclusively for the project and all
documents, reports, etc. to be furnished to the Association as reasonably
requested; (v) maintenance of adequate records and preparation of project
completion report and audit reports on timely/agreed basis; and (vi)
Borrower and Association to exchange views with respect to evaluation and
implementation oF recommendations and conclusions in report documents.
5.02    The performance by the Borrower in fulfilling the above undertak-
ings was, for the most part, satisfactory. Possible exceptions were
observed in (i) and (v). Delays in identifying other
studies/recommendations in support of the AMP resulted in extending the



- 84 -
IDA credit a total of three years and in the cancellation of U5$ 1.14
million. In fact, there was a period of nearly two years (1983-84) when
relatively little work was accomplished. The other exception concerns the
audit covenants. Delays in carrying out required audits and in preparir;
annual audit reports resulted in only one audit being made for the entire
five-year project implementation period. The audit report (received in
December 1985) covers all reimbursements made to just beyond the formal
closing date, however the IDA and EEC accounts were not closed until June
1986, some eight months later. Reimbursement applications and supporting
documents within this extended period have yet to be audited.  In regards
to (iv) above, although IDA oarticipated in most of the principal review
meetings concerning the findings and recommendations of the consultants
for the transbasin diversion studies, the consultants' Final Report has
yet to be published and given to IDA.
5.03    Although it was believed at the time of preparation of this
project that a follow-on project would be needed to prepare final designs
and specifications for subprojects identified under the Transbasin Diver-
sion Study, development of such projects may be delayed indefinitely and a
follow-on credit is not needed at this time.
VI. IDA SUPERVISION
6.01    In terms of frequency and staff continuity, the project was well
supervised. During the period of relatively little project activity, no
full supervision missions were mounted; rather, the IDA project of-ficer
routinely checked on implementation progress and the consultants'
activities while in country under other terms of reference, which resulted
in complete continuity being maintained by IDA supervision staf'
throughout the implementation period. Supervision missions participated
in most of the principal reviews of the findings of consultants for the
Transbasin Diversion Studies and provided recommendations on further
action to be taken. Continuing encouragement also was given to MASL to
initiate other studies in support of the AMP for which financing had been
provided in the IDA credit.
VII.  CONCLUSIONS
7.01    The project financed under these credits played a significant role
in assisting the preparation and implementation of the AMP, particularly
the Minipe Right Bank Canal (the largest irrigation canal in Sri Lanka)
and System C, both of which IDA later financed. Through the Transbasin
Diversion Study, the project was of great benefit to the Government in
identifying viable projects for future use of surplus water developed
under the MGDP. All studies and the assistance given to the Borrower in
preparing designs and tender documents were successfully completed as
envisaged. The only significant delay experienced and the aspect of the
project where improvement could have been made was in identifying and

carrying out other studies/investigations in support of the AMP. However,
the fact that such assistance was not requested is evidence that this
project component was not particularly needed.
7.02    The principle lesson learned from this project is that the two
years provided for project implem'entation was not realistic. A five-year
implementation period for future technical assistance credits is believed
to be more appropriate, particularly where studies of development alterna-
tives are involved which usually require further detailed review of
various options or plans to fully delineate the most viable option or
desirable use of a limited natural resource.
