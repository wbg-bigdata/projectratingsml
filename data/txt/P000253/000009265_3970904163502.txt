WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT
(Credit 706-IW; Special Action Credit 49-UV)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the West Volta
Agricultural Development Project, for which Credit 706-UV was approved
in December 1977 in the amount of US$ 3.6 million. Total project cost
was estimated at US$ 18.9 million. An EEC Special Action Credit, amounting
to US$ 3.0 million equivalent which was declared effective in September 1980,
made possible a one-year extension of the project to June 1983.
The Credit was closed in June 1983. The PCR was prepared by the
West Africa Projects Department, based on the Government Project Completion
Report which was developed in part with the help of a Bank mission in May
1982. This project has not been the subject of an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.
The draft PCR was sent to the Government of Upper Volta for comments
in March 1984. However, no comments have been received.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government of Upper Volta
and by the project staff met during the PCR mission is gratefully acknowledged.

UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURA. DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT
(Credit 706-UV; Special Action Credit 49-UV)
Highlights
This Project succeeded the Bank's first agricultural project in
Upper Volta, the Cotton Project (Cr. 225-UV) and was the seventh Bank
operation supporting the rural sector in Upper Volta.
The project's main objective was to improve rural living standards
by promoting more productive farming systems and better cultivation techniques
for the area's main dryland crops, cereals and cotton.
Credit effectiveness was delayed twice, for administrative reasons,
with the project finally becoming effective in December 1977, five months after
the original date.
The project was successful in extending the work of the preceding
Cotton Project to stimulate more general agricultural development in the
area. The agricultural impact of the project was significant in that some
42,500 farm families participated directly in the project, together with
27,500 who benefited indirectly.
Most of the physical targets were met, with a total incremental
production of 62,000 tons of cotton (11% above appraisal) and 70,000 tons
of cereals (22% below appraisal) (para. V A-B), as well as construction of
a new 20,000-ton ginnery at Dedougou (para. 4.11), 72 grain stores in
75 villages (para. 4.12), and a training center at Bobo-Dioulasso (para. 4.13).
Components not directly under the control of the two ORD's (Organisme Regional
de Developpement) were less successful, however, with only 13% of the irrigation
component met, reflecting organizational problems (para. 4.10). The support to
the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) (para. 4.05) and the pilot settlement
project (para. 4.14) were not implemented.
The project's major institutional achievements have been to organize
and train the extension staff under the Training and Visit System and to
separate commercial functions from extension (para. VII B).
The total project costs for the six-year period amount to 5,239
millions CFAF (16% above appraisal estimate), of which IDA-CIDA (International
Development Association - Canadian International Development Agency) provided 27%,
Abu Dhabi Fund (ADF) 25%, the Government of Upper Volta 25%, EEC 12%, and Swiss
Aid 11% (Table 3.3). There was a cost overrun of about 28% in the construction
of the ginnery, while the total cost for input supplies was about double the
appraisal estimate. Otherwise, expenditures remained in line with appraisal
estimate. The overall economic rate of return is estimated at 33% which compares
closely with the original estimate of 32% (para. VI).

Some important lessons can be drawn from the project, including the
need to:
- conduct a baseline survey and develop a strong monitoring and
evaluation unit (paras. 5.03, 5.08, and 5.14);
- reinforce the links between farmers, extension and research
(paras. 7.07 and 7.08);
- carefully place increased emphasis on the integration of
livestock and agriculture (para. 7.08);
- develop fertilizer formulations suitable for cereals (para. 5.14);
- foster village group development (paras. 4.15 to 4.18).
In sumaary, the project, as a major effort at integrated agricultural
development, has been successful in effecting improvements in the agriculture
of the project area and has provided considerable experience in design and
implementation of services to promote rural development. This approach can
be replicated, if suitably trained and experienced senior staff are available.



UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Credit 706-UV)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUMMARY
(i)      The West Volta Agricultural Development Project (WVADP) followed up
the Bank's first agricultural project in Upper Volta, the Cotton Project
(Credit 225-UV), which provided finance to expand the area and to improve the
yield of cotton, Upper Volta's most important export crop. The narrow nature
of that project was criticized and the WADP was designed to correct this and
to encourage more widespread agricultural development.
(ii)     The Government of Upper Volta commissioned a consultant firm to
prepare the project using funds provided under the previous project. After an
in-depth pre-appraisal mission in May 1976, WVADP was appraised in October
1976. The main elements of the project, as finally appraised, were provision
for: (a) strengthening the Permanent Secretariat of the Coordinating
Committee for Rural Development (SP/CCDR) within the Ministry of Rural
Development with a technical assistant and creation of a Financial and
Administrative Unit (FAU); (b) staff, equipment and vehicles for the two
implementing Regional Development Organizations (ORDs); (c) extension,
agricultural credit and inputs to increase cotton and fooderops production;
(d) construction of small-scale irrigation schemes; (e) building a 22,000-ton
ginnery and 75 village grain stores; (f) creation of a training center; (g)
improving women's livelihood; and (h) studies and surveys followed by pilot
projects to help new settlers. The project was to be carried out over five
years, from 1977/78 to 1981/82, and the total cost was estimated at CFAF
4,633.3 million (US$18.9 million). Financing was to be provided by: IDA,
US$3.6 million (19%); IDA-administered Canadian grant, US$2.9 equivalent
(15%); African Development Fund (ADF), US$5.5 million (29%); Swiss Aid,
US$3.6 million equivalent (.19X); and Government of Upper Volta, US$3.3
million (.18%).
(iii)    Effectiveness was delayed twice, with the project finally becoming
effective on December 28, 1977. Project lending moved very quickly during the
first two years, and at midterm of project implementation it became clear that
the project would need additional financing to cover: (a) cost overruns in
the construction of the ginnery; (b) the need for agricultural credit; and
(c) the shortfall due to currency realignment. At the same time, progress in
the processing of the follow-up projects indicated that new funds would not be
made available until several months after completion of the ongoing project.
To cover these additional financing needs and to finance the additional
interim period before the start of the follow-up projects, an European
Economic Commanity (EEC) Special Action Credit was signed on February 8, 1980
and declared effective on September 4, 1980. These additional funds, coupled
with the appreciation of the US dollar, have enabled a one-year extension to
project credits to June 30, 1983. The physical components were completed end



-2-
of 1982. The two follow-up projects, Hauts-Bassins (Credit 1285-UV) and Volta
Noire (Credit 1284-UV) were approved on August 26, 1982 but are not yet
effective.
(iv)     The WVADP has been successful in extending the work of the previous
project to stimulate more general agricultural development in the area. The
project's major institutional achievements have been to organize and train tl'e
extension staff under the Training and Visit System, to separate commercial
functions from extension and to continue to see that annual inputs have been
made available; these elements have combined to bring about the successful
meeting of production goals. One of the major features of that extension
system has been the ability to take into account the socio-cultural
characteristics of local communities and to build upon extension activities in
the existing traditional village groups. At the same time, the ORDs have
undertaken successful initiatives in promoting those village groups which are
now participating in marketing, input and credit administration. The number of
participants was 10% below estimates, some 42,500 farm families or 40% of the
total farm population having been directly reached by the extension system
whilst 27,000 families benefited indirectly.
(v)      Most of the physical targets of the project have been met with a
total incremental production of 62,000 tons of cotton (111% of appraisal
estimates) and 70,000 tons of cereals (78% of appraisal estimates), and the
construction of 72 village grain stores (96% of appraisal estimates), a
training center at Bobo-Diooulasso and a new 20,000 ton ginnery at Dedougou.
However, two out of the three components financed directly by the Swiss
Cooperation Funds and not directly under the control of the two ORDs, were
less successful, with only about 13% of the irrigation component met,
reflecting organizational problems; mixed results achieved by the women's
component; whilst the settlement pilot project was not implemented as
detailed terms of reference were not agreed upon between Government and the
Swiss Aid. Finally, the strengthening of the SP/CCDR within the Ministry of
Rural Development got nowhere as no request was ever forthcoming for the
technical assistance and the component never started.
(vi)     Total cost for the five years (1977/78 to 1981/82) was CFAF 4,664
million compared to CFAF 4,633 million at appraisal. Two components were not
implemented - assistance to the Ministry and studies and surveys. On the
other hand, there was a cost overrun in the erection of the ginnery of about
CFAF 220 million or 28%, and the total cost for inputs supplied was about
double the appraisal estimates. Inputs were to be financed entirely by
Government. Otherwise, expenditures remained in line with appraisal
estimates. Financing for an interim period -o bridge the gap before the
follow-up project, was obtained through an EE' Special Action Credit of US$3.0
equivalent. The total project costs for the six-year period amount to 5,239
CFAF million, of which IDA-CIDA represent 27%; ADF, 25%; Government of Upper
Volta, 25%; EEC, 12%; and Swiss Aid, 11%.
(vii)    The overall rate of return, using the appraisal opportunity cost of
labor, is estimated at 33% after actual cotton production figures have been
adjusted downwards to offset favorable climatic and other factors which
boosted production in the early years of the project. This compares closely
with the original estimate of 32%. It was the purely agricultural elements
which were implemented most successfully, and it is these elements which enter



-3-
into the economic rate of return. The components which were disappointing or
not implemented are generally the peripheral components.
(viii)   The follow-up projects reflect the lessons learnt from the WADP.
Particaular attention has been given to the need for agricultural development
projects to recover their ongoing costs. The separation of the input
distribution system from extension activities has been complemented by the
introdu^,tion of a cost recovery margin on inputs.  Village groups'
responsibility will be fostered, integration of livestock and agriculture
promoted, and a program of adaptive research set up. The ORD menitoring unit
will also be reinforced and a more comprehensive baseline survey will be
undertaken. Finally, the fertilizer subsidy issue, including the search for
alternative and/or cheaper fertilizer formulations, will be further addressed
under the forthcoming Food and Fertilizer Project.

I. BACKGROUND
Sector Background
1.01     Economic growth in Upper Volta is necessarily closely linked to
progress in the agricultural sector. which employs 80-90% of the population
and comprises almost 40% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and almost all
experts. However, soils are poor, rainfall is low and uncertain, and the
potential for irrigation is economically limited, requiring costly investments
to development. Improving agricultural productivity is necessary for
maintaining food secu-ity and increasing national income and is thus a
challenging task.
1.02     Although the country is relatively flat, there are pronounced
regional differences in climate and soils. The low and erratic rainfall (600
mm) in the north results in unreliable harvests and greater reliance on
livestock for survival, and consequently low population densities. On the
central plateau, crop farming is at a subsistence level because of population
pressure, over-exploited soils and unreliable rainfall. In the southwest, soil
and rainfall conditions (reaching 1,200 mm) are more favorable, population
density lower, and production more market-oriented.
1.03     Agricultural production over 1961-79 has performed as well as could
have been expected, given the severe constraints. Fooderop areas, which
account for almost 90% of cultivated land, have increased less than the net
annual growth in rural population. In contrast to most other foodcrops,
sorghum production has grown more rapidly than population, reflecting in part
the residual effects of cotton fertilizer in crop rotation, as well as direct
fertilization. Overall, the country has continued to satisfy all but a small
share (5%) of its consumption of fooderops from local production in years of
normal rainfall. But this has only been achieved through increasing dependence
on the southwest as a source of food surplus, which tends to limit the
resources available in that region for gr3wing the country's major export
crop, cotton. This dependence must continue, however, in the short term,
whilst adaptive research attempts to develop improved approaches for
increasing productivity over wide areas of the center.
1.04     Cotton yields have risen markedly in the last decade and output rose
from 36,000 tons in 1970 (from yields of about 380 kg/ha) to over 78,000 tons
(from yields of about 960 kg/ha) by 1979, due to cultivation shifting to more
fertile areas and to the use of fertilizers and insecticides, coupled with
extension programs. Since 1979, cotton area has fallen, indicating that close
atention needs to be paid to the relationship of cotton and cereals prices,
including reviewing whether current taxes on cotton, which are not high,
should, nevertheless, be reduced.
Sector Strategy and Bank Group Lending
1.05     The Government's strategy in agriculture has given priority to: (a)
improving the productivity of rainfed agriculture; (b) promoting migration
from the densely populated and relatively infertile central nlateani ta tbe
more fertile and less densely populated areas in the southwest; (c) expanding
irrigaLion and swampland production scilemes; .=d (d) ensuring nationaL food
security. In line with this strategy, Bank Group lending for Upper Volta has
emphasized development of rainfed agriculture for food and cash crops in the
southwest, small-scale land development schemes to expand the agriz^ltural



-5-
production base in the central plateau, and testing a larger scale swampland
production scheme in the southwest.
1.06     Since 1970, IDA has financed eleven projects in the rural sector, of
which five have been completed. The Cotton Project (Cr. 225-WV), US$6.2
million, 1970) demonstrated that an improved technology, within the means of
small farmers, could be spread widely and rapidly. The project's Audit Report
noted substantial improvements in farming practices and yields. The First
Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 496-UV, US$8.0 million, 1974)
the Drought Relief Project (Cr. 442-UV, US$2.0 million, 1973) and the First
and Second Rural Development Fund (RDF) Projects (Cr. 317-UV, US$2.2 million,
1972, and Cr. 640-UV, US$9.4 million, 1976) aimed at financing small discrete
works with community participation. The project audits described the Drought
Relief and First RDF projects as highly innovative and successful in
implementing diversified and scattered subprojects. The second RDF project,
completed in December 1981, continued the development of bottomlands, wells
and anti-erosion works on the central plateau. A third RDF project was
approved by the Board on March 30, 1982, while the two Volta Noire and Hauts-
Bassins Agricultural Development Prcjects (follow-up to the ongoing WVADP)
were approved by the Board on August 26, 1982.
1.07     The ongoing IDA-assisted agricultural projects are: the Livestock
Development Project (Cr. 557-UV, USS6.0 million, 1975); the Forestry Project
(Cr. 982-UT, US$14.5 million, 1980); the Niena Dionkele Rice Development
Project (Cr. 1013-UV, USS6.5 million, 1980); and the Second Bougouriba
Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 1097-UT, US$16.0 million equivalent,
1981). They are being implemented satisfactorily, although the swamp drainage
Niena Dionkele Pilot Project had at the onset technical problems of water
availability and rice varieties, and the Livestock Project had difficulties
wilth its group ranch component, ivich neceseitated a redesign and a reduction
in the credit by US$3.0 million.
Project Background
1.08     WVTADP was a follow-up project which succeeded the Bank's first
agricultural project in Upper Volta, the Cotton Project (Cr. 225-UV). The
latter, which achieved a rate of return of 37%, limited its objective to
promoting cotton production, and its narrow nature was criticized in the PPAR.
Moreover, the emphasis on supply and collection services tended 'o divert the
project field service from extension work proper. The WVADP was designed to
correct this and to encourage more widespread agricultural development.
1.09     WVADP was appraised in October 1976, Credit 706-UV was negotiated in
April 1977 and approved by the Board on May 3, 1977, with retroactive
financing to January 1, 1977. The Credit was signed on May 23, 1977 and
declared effective on December 28, 1977. An EEC Special Action Credit was
sianed on February 8, 1980 and declared effective on September 4, 1980. The
project was closed on June 30, 1983.
1.10     This Project Completion Report was prepared from several sources of
information: project files, the Staff Appraisal Report, Development Credit
Agreement, supervision mission reports, project quarterly reports,
correspondence file, interviews with past and present project staff, working
papers on the Hauts-Bassins and Volta Noire Agricultural Development Projeote,



-6-
produced as part of the preparation of the follow-up project, and the
Government Project Completion Report elaborated in part with the help of a
Bank mission in Nay 1982.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     Preparation. The Government of Upper Volta commissioned a consultant
firm to assess the accomplishments of the West Volta Cotton Project (Cr. 225-
UV) and to prepare a follow-up project. The preparation report was financed by
funds provided under the West Volta Cotton Project. The consultants'
preliminary findings were presented in September/October 1975, and were
discussed with Bank representatives and Government. It was recommended that
the follow-up project include:
- integrated agricultural development;
-  strengthening of the management at the two ORDs;
-  strengthening the Permanent Secretariat of the Ministry of Rural
Development by establishing an autonomous unit to supervise
financial and administrative matters; and
- a uniform accounting system to be set up for both ORDs and clear
guidelines established for preparing applications for
reimbursement.
2.02     A preappraisal mission comprising six persons, including three Bank
staff, one consultant and two ADF members, visited Upper Volta from May 3 to
June 1, 1976 and was able to substantially appraise the project. The project
was to continue to support activities introduced under the West Volta Cotton
Project and to increase the efficiency of the extension workers, whose
responsibilities will include cereals and other foodcrops. Cotton pilot
schemes  for irrigation and settlements of spontaneous immigrants were to be
included and managerial capacity and 'echnical knowledge of the MDR and of the
ORDs strengthened. The project was formally appraised in October 1976 and the
mission reaffirmed the findings of the preappraisal mission.
2.03     Project Area.  Centered in southwest Upper Volta, the project area
would coincide with that of the Cotton Project covering the two ORDs of Volta
Noire and Hauts-Bassins. It is bordered by Mali to the west, Banfora ORD to
the south, Bougouriba to the southeast, Central West ORD to the east and
Ouahigouha ORD to the north. The project area would cover some 58,000 km2,
about 20% of the country's total, and contain about 1.0 million inhabitants,
16% of the country's total, representing about 88,000 family units. The
average population pressure is low a. about 20 persons/ha. The project area
has a Sudanian climate and average rainfall varies from about 800 mm in the
north to 1,200 mm in the south. The two ORDs can be divided into four soils
and rainfall regions: north, central north, central south, and south. The
north and the south are essentially cereal areas, while 95% of all cotton is
grown in the central north and central south.



-7-
2.04     Project Design. The project was conceived to improve rural living
standards by promoting more productive farming systems and better cultivation
techniques for the area's main dryland crops, cereals and cotton. By actions
to improve the situation of women, it would also help to develop the
irrigation potential through small-scale simple water control schemes. The
project would finance the following over a five-year period from 1977-81:
(a)   strengthening the Permanent Secretariat of the Coordinating
Committee for Rural Development (SP/CCDR) in the Ministry of
Rural Development with a technical assistant and support staff
for the coordination and planning of agricultural projects, and
through the creation of a Financial and Administrative Uni.
(FAU) to establish and maintain an accounting system, and to
monitor the project's progress;
(b)   providing the ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou with the
staff, equipment and transportation necessary to implement an
agricultural development program;
Cc)   providing incremental seasonal inputs such as fertilizers,
pesticides, insecticides and seeds;
(d)   constructing small-scale irrigation schemes totalling 1,120 ha;
(e)   building a 22,000 ton ginnery together with storage;
(f)   building some 75 small village grain stores;
(g)   creating a training center for project staff and farmers, which
would also serve the Livestock Project at Samorogouan (Cr. 557-
UV);
(h)   carrying out studies and surveys, followed by pilot projects to
help new settlers; and
(i)   carrying out a pilot scheme to improve the situation of women
in about 40 villages:
In order to reach more farmers under the proposed project than under the
previous one, and at the same time raise the quality of extension work, a
fundamental reorganization of the ORDs and a full retraining of the extension
service is essential.
2.05     Project Execution. The overall responsibility for the project would
rest with MRD. The existing "Comite de Coordination du Developpment Rural"
CCDR, which includes representatives of all ministries involved in rural
development, would coordinate and oversee, through its Permanent Secretariat,
project activities at the ministerial level, and a qualified technical
assistant would assist the planning section of the Permanent Secretariat of
the CCDR. In the field, five agencies would be responsible for project
implementation: the two ORDs for providing inputs and extension services,
Office National des Barrages et Irrigation (ONBI) for the irrigation work,
Service d'entretien des Routes Secondaires (SERS) for the road construction



program, and the Equal Acces to Education for Women (EAEW)
for promoting women's activities.
2.06     Negotiations were held from February 28 to March 7, 1977. During
negotiations, two major issues were raised:
(i)   Government explained that farm inputs for cotton growing (seeds
and fertilizers) were being financed through the rediscount
facility at the Central Bank and that it would be best to
continue with present arrangements which worked smoothly. Thus,
the provision of short-term credit, as proposed under the
project, would not be necessary; IDA's contribution was reduced
by US$700,000 and Government's contribution was increased by
this same amount; and
(ii)  Government also asked the Association to provide a revolving
fund to be used to help pre-finance project costs; the
Association agreed to an advance to this revolving fund of
US$400,000.
The project was approved by the Board on May 3, 1977 and the IDA and Canadian
Credits were signed on May 23, 1977. The Swiss Senate approved the financial
aid for Upper Volta of SF 9.5 million on June 13 and the House of
Representatives passed this legislation on June 20, 1977. ADF credit became
effective on November 10, 1977.
III. COST AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
3.01     Total costs at appraisal had been estimated at CFAF 4,633.3 million
(US$18.9 million equivalent at the exchange rate of US$1 = 245), including
contingencies. Foreign exchange costs represented 47% of the total (US$8.9
millicn). Financing was to be provided by: IDA, US$3.6 million (19%); IDA-
administered Canadian grant, US$2.9 equivalent (15%); ADF, US$5.5 million
(29%); Swiss Aid, US$3.6 million equivalent (19%); and Government of Upper
Volta, US$3.3 million (18%).
3.02     The Canadian grant was to be administered by IDA whilst other
cofinancing was to be on a parallel basis: ADF was to contribute to
strengthening ORD headquarters, extension services, and the training program
and constructing the ginnery, and Swiss Aid was to finance motorcycles for
Bobo-Dioulasso ORD extension agents, production inputs for the 1,120 ha
irrigated area, village grain storage, women's activities, irrigation schemes,
and studies and surveys for spontaneous settlement. Government's share is
equivalent to the estimated taxes which are US$1.7 million, plus the
incremental costs on fertilizers and insecticides estimated at US$1.6 million.
3.03     Annex 1, Table 1, shows a comparison between appraisal estimates and
actual expenditure, on a yearly basis, and the totals for the five-year
project are summarized below.

3.04     Two components were not implemented - assistance to the Ministry of
Rural Development (item 1 in para 3.03 above) and Studies and Surveys (item 11
above), the latter being a Swiss Aid component. On the other hand, there was a
cost overrun in the erection of the ginnery of about CFAF 220 million (item 7
above), and the total cost for inputs supplied was about double the appraisal
estimates. Inputs were to be financed entirely by Government. Otherwise,
expenditures remained in line with appraisal estimates.
3.05     The technical assistance to the Ministry was supposed to be a
continuation of a similar component under the First Bougouriba Agricultural
Development Project (Cr. 496-Uv) 1/; before any disbursements could be made by
the project under review, it became obvious that the effort under Bougouriba I
was getting nowhere. Providing adequate technical assistance to a Government,
at the right level, in sufficient strength and with a clear understanding of
purposes and results expected, is one of the most difficult exercises, and we
still have a long way to go.
3.06     At midterm of project implementation, it became clear that the
project would need additional financing to cover: (a) cost overruns on the
construction of the ginnery; (b) need for agricultural credit for oxen and
equipment to meet the high demand occasioned by the project's success; and (c)
the shortfall due to currency realignment (the average exchange rate during
the first three years of the project was CFAF 220 for the US dollar, against
CFAF 245 at appraisal). At the same time, progress in the processing of the
follow-up project indicated that new funds would not be made available until
several months after completion of the ongoing project. To cover these
additional needs, and to finance the additional interim period before the
start of the follow-up project, a special credit of US$3.0 equivalent from EEC
funds was processed (Special Action Credit No. 49, January 31, 1980).
3.07     Because of the expanded need for inputs (total costs for the project

The lower figures disbursed by IDA-CIDA and ADF as compared to those in Table
3.04 reflect the lower exchange rate that prevailed for the CFAF in relation
to the US dollar during the first three years of project implementation.
Although it picked up from April 1981, the average disbursement rate has been
220 CFAF to the US dollar against CFAF 245 = US$1.0 at appraisal and the
Canadian dollar even lower. The lower figure for Swiss Aid disbursements is
mainly due to the fact that the studies and surveys (CFAF 225 million entirely
financed by the Swiss) were never carried out.
3.09     Auditing was carried out regularly by a firm which was originally
retained as a consultant for setting up the accounts and procedures of the
Financial and Administrative Unit of the project. In their final report on Cr.
706-UV, they state that:
(a) withdrawal requests had been established as per IDA guidelines;
(b) goods and services covered by these requests originate from
countries members of IDA and Switzerland;
(c) such goods had been received and services actually rendered; and
(d) all goods and services (including on-force account) financed by
IDA have been used within the project framework.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION
A.       Effectiveness and Start-Up
4.01     The Credit Agreement included three conditions of effectiveness:
(a)   that the Association has been informed by the African
Development Fund that all conditions precedent to initial
disbursement of its loan to the Borrower for the project,
except the effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement,
have been fulfilled;
(b)   that all conditions of effectiveness of the Canadian Credit
Agreement, except the effectiveness of the Agreement, have been
fulfilled; and
(c)   that the Special Account has been opened.
4.02     The original date of effectiveness was postponed twice from the
original date of August 29, 1977 to October 31, 1977, then to December 31,
1977. The reasons were twofold:



- 13 -
(i)   There were delays in publishing the "Journal Officiel",
document authorizing and ratifying the Credit Agreement and its
legal binding upon the Borrower; end
(ii)  conditions of initial disbursement under the ADF loan were not
totally satisfactory.
To avoid further delays in making the Credit effective, this last ADF
condition, namely, the sending of the bidding documents for the cotton
ginnery, was waived and the Credit became effective on December 28, 1977.
B.       Physical Implementation
General
4.03     The WVADP has been successful in extending the work of the previous
Cotton Project to stimulate more general agricultural development in the area.
It has successfully established a well-trained and enthusiastic extension
service. Most of the physical targets of the project have been met with a
total incremental production of 62,000 tons of cotton (111% of appraisal
estimates) and 70,000 tons of cereals (78% of appraisal estimates) and the
construction of 72 village stores, a training center at Bobo-Dioulasso and a
new 20,000-ton ginnery at Dedougou. However, the irrigation component, not
directly under the control of the two ORDs, was not successful, while the
support of the MRD and the settlement pilot project were not implemented.
Summary of Project Performance
4.04     Table 4.1 below summarizes the project's cumulative results when
compared with appraisal estimates for the five years of the project. Details
are given at Annexes 4, Tables 1, 2 and 3.
Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Rural Development
4.05     It was intended to provide support to the Ministry of Rural
Development and the CCDR through technical assistance and support. Despite
frequent reminders, no request was ever forthcoming for this assistance and
the component never got started. Early in 1981, the Ministry indicated that
they would not be submitting a request during the life of the project, and
requested reallocation of the unallocated amount in the IDA credit to meet the
expected overruns on other categories and especially on Civil Works (ginnery)
which was not included in the EEC Credit. The funds were reallocated and have
enabled the other components to continue until September 30, 1982.  The FAU,
however, was set up in Bobo-Dioulasso, and has achieved mixed results (para
7.10). Since the beginning of 1980, it has functioned more or less
successfully, and, in particular, is has been able to produce good information
on the financial situation of the project and on budgets.
Agricultural Development Program
4.06     Agricultural Extension. During the project, the extension service was
successfully reorganized in line with the Training & Visit System, which
emphasized regularity of visits to farmers' groups and separation of the
extension function from the supply and service function.  This is generally



- 14 -
agreed to have increased extension agents' efficiency, in terms of the number
of farmers reached, and also efficacy, in terms of the success in transmitting
the extension message. This, in turn, has been reflected in good production
figures, which are generally in line with the appraisal estimates. By PY5,
some 42,000 farmers were estimated to have benefited directly from the
extension services, or 90% of appraisal estimates (see Section VII), whilst
27,000 families benefited indirectly (para 7.07).
4.07     Medium-Term Agricultural Credit. Under the Cotton Project, a
revolving credit fund was established at the National Bank for Development
(BND) to provide seasonal and medium-term credit to farmers in the project
area. Upon completion of the Cotton Project, funds from BND's revolving credit
fund and from other potential sources were estimated to be sufficient to meet
increases in demand for medium-term credit under the present project. These
assumptions were not holding true. In 1977, BND withdrew from financing
agricultural credit because it was dissatisfied with the level of repayments
it was receiving from the ORDs throughout the country, a situation which
reflected the slowness of the ORDs to pay over credit recoveries to the BND as
well as slowness of beneficiaries to repay. A limited amount of medium-term
credit funds (US $400,000 over three years) was then provided to the project
area ORDs by the Economic Community but these have been insufficient to meet
demand. Farmers repayments of these loans have been about 80 percent, which
is considered satisfactory and which reflects slow rather than non-payment.
With additional funds from the EEC Special Action Account supplementing the
Economic Community funds, about 1,000 sets of oxen and equipment were financed
under strict control.  To upgrade the established control systems for
agricultural credit funds, separate account were kept by the ORDs for the
credit component and the accounts were supervised by the FAU. To facilitate
recovery, credit to purchase oxen and equipment were made available to members
of village groups, upon the recommendation of the group. Credit recovery then
became very successful (see table 4.4). End of 1980, terms and conditions of
all agricultural credit in the country were harmonized by the Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole (CNCA) that was es'-ablished on August 21, 1980. Animal
traction cultivation was one of the technological improvements encouraged by
the project with a medium-term credit. Table 4.2 below and Annex 3, Table 1,
indicate the evolution under the project and show the increasing interest in
adopting animal traction.

Animal traction credit funds provided under the project are summarized in
Table 4.3, but there were no projections for this type of credit in the
appraisal report. However, the project has reached a stage where the demand
for medium-term credit to purchase animal-drawn equipment exceeds supply
possibilities.

be as follows starting in 1978/79.

Further development of ox-drawn cultivation has been included under the
follow-up Hauts-Bassins and Volta Noire Projects, which also provide funds for
animal-traction related agricultural implements.
4.08     Seasonal Credit and Other Input Supply. Annex 3, Tables 2 and 3, show
the quantities of improved seed, fertilizer and insecticides issued under the
project against appraisal estimates. The expected uptake of fertilizers on
cotton and foodcrops did materialize, and farmers' interest in cereal
fertilization developed in the project with the advent of the FAO fertilizer
demonstration program. Virtually all fertilizers and insecticides have been
procured during the project by the cotton marketing agency, SOFITEX (the
successor, in 1979, to the "Association en participation" between Government
and the French firm CFDT). The procurement procedures adopted by SOFITEX are
satisfactory and resulted in competitive prices. The distribution and delivery
of inputs have generally been timely and efficient. In 1980/81, the ORDs
initiated a cost recovery program for the Supplies and Credit Services and a
margin of CFAF 5/kg was introduced for fertilizer cash sales. However,
financing of subsidies on fertilizers used on cereals has become a problem
area. SOFITEX supplies all required fertilizers and insecticides, whether
used on cotton or cereals (except for limited quantities of urea, procured by
the Department of Agriculture). After delivery of the fertilizers, an analysis
is done by the ORDs to determine the usage of fertilizers on cotton and
cereals. Fertilizers are heavily subsidized, and while SOFITEX carries the
subsidy on fertilizer used on cotton, Government is required to pay the
subsidy for fertilizer used on cereals. The Government has been unable to
finance the cereal fertilizer subsidy from its ordinary income and it has paid
them from extraordinary resources, particularly from Fund for Price
Stabilization for Agricultural Products (CSPPA). According to the CSPPA, the
amount due SOFITEX was CFAF 817 million including CFAF 660 for the 1982 crop
year.
4.09     Concerning improved seeds, the uptake did not materialize, farmers'
interest developing late in the project with the advent in 1979 of the
Foodcrop Project ("Projet vivrier") prepared in outline by CILLS and financed
by FAC/CCCE. The Foodcrop Project financed a multiplication farm for improved
cereals seeds, additional extension agents, and the construction of additional
village grain stores, using a low-cost design and self-help. It has been
complementary to the West Volta Project and employed the same extension
methodology. Building upon the Fooderop Project work, improved seeds
production and distribution are major themes of the follow-up Hauts-Bassins
and Volta Noire Projects.
4.10     Small-Scale Irrigation Schemes. Three different types of irrigation
developments were supposed to be established under the project:
(a)  bottomland development - 1,000 ha,
(b)  vegetable production   -   100 ha, and
(c)  irrigation below dams  -    20 ha.
These were to be implemented by ONBI and financed by the Swiss. However,
differences of view have arisen between ONBI and the ORDs. OWBI argues that
the ORDs have overcharged for tractors and not made them available, and that



- 17 -
they have failed 'o mobilize and organize farmers for the work. The ORDs
refute this. They claim that ONBI has frequently failed to turn up at specific
bottomland areas when farmers have been organized and waiting. The net result
has been very low levels of impleme ttation and of usage, as shown in Table 4.5
below:
Table 4.5: IRRIGATION PROGRAM

Estimates          Implemented           Cultivated

(a)  Bottomlands             1 000                  132                   7
(b)  Vegetable Production      100                   28                   18
(c) Below Dams                  20                   20                  20
It should be mentioned that no work was carried out before 1979 and surveys
indicated that about 22% of the bottomland areas were cultivated the first
year and only 5% the second year as a result of major dikes breaking due to
topographical errors. No production induced by this component has been
estimated. The vegetable production and irrigation belou dam components
achieved better results, with 18 ha cultivated in 1981 producing 62 tons of
green beans.
Civil Works
4.11     Ginnery. The ginnery was constructed at Dedougou, although with a
slightly reduced capacity of 20,000 tonnes, and at higher than estimated cost.
It was designed in such a way that it can later be expanded to a capacity of
30,000 tonnes at a relatively modest cost. It was completed only in early
198!, and was used in production for the first time in the 1981/82 campaign.
The ginnery was financed by the ADF and it was handed over to SOFITEX in
return for shares for Government. It raised SOFITEX capacity to 95,000 tons of
seed cotton which should be adequate for the next five years, although
Government will review the situation in 1984.
4.12     Village Grain Stores. This is another Swiss-financed component, and
despite a very slow start, 72 stores were completed by the end of the project,
compared with appraisal estimates of 75. There is a marked difference between
the two ORDs in this aspect of the project.  In VoXta Noire, the stores are
being used and managed properly. In Hauts-Bassins, however, only one of the 34
stores is being used, and little interest has been shown in the others. Why
this should be so is not clear, but is probably due to a lack of vi-llage
instruction by this ORD. The other problem related to this component is cost.
In Hauts-Bassins ORD, these stores were constructed by local contractors and
costed about CPAF 1.5 million each. In Volta Noire, these stores were
constructed under force account, with village labor; however higher quality
construction was achieved at lower cost (CPAF 0.85 million). When operated



- 18 -
properly, 'these stores serve a useful function and as cereal surpluses
increase in size, they will become more and more necessary. As a result of a
survey conducted by the ORDs, an outstanding number of villages have expressed
an interest in having such stores.
4.13     Training Center.  The training center at Bobo-Dioulasso was built in
1979 and became operational by the end of 1980. It has a capacity of 60
trainees at any one time, including dormitory facilities. It has provided
training for the two ORDs of the project as well as the Niena Dionkele and
Bougouriba projects. It is functioning well, as is evident from the quality of
extension staff, and the facilities have been constructed to satisfactory
standards. The courses run were as follows:
Ci)       2 f.ve-day courses for coordinators;
(ii)       20 two-week courses for extension officers and subsector
chiefs;
(iii)       23 three-week refresher courses for extension officers and
subsector chiefs; and
(iv)       3 four-week courses for department heads and sector
chiefs.
In addition, certain special courses were run, such as:
(v)  a special course on irrigation and bottomlands; and
(vi) a course on monitoring and evaluation.
The breakdown of the training courses is given in Annex 2, Table 1.  Despite
the evident success, however, it is considered that the capacity available
could be more fully utilized, and it would therefore make sense to turn it
into a regional 'raining center for all ORDs in the South-West region, and to
cater to other types of courses, such as accounting.
Settlement Component
4.14     This Swiss-financed component has not been implemented. Under a
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance before the project started, a
satellite survey was conducted to identify possible settlement areas. This
component was supposed to 'ake this one stage further, and identify, using the
satellite photography as a guide, possible areas for settlement, and then set
up five pilot schemes. This would require external consultants' input and
terms of reference were to be prepared. However, lack of Government enthusiasm
to do this, coupled with a lack of follow-up, resulted in these terms of
reference being produced only near project completion.
Women's Component
4.15     This is the third Swiss-financed component. It is more a social than
economic component. Its prime aim was the training and provision of village
"animatrices" and "monitrices". They were to assist in various areas,
including health and nutrition, and in organizing women's groups for various
economic and collective activities. It was an important and ambitious
component. After a very slow start, it made good progress and achieved
considerable success. 37 Villages were provided with centers where basic
introduction to health, nutrition and sanitation was taught by "monitrices",



- 19 -
35 of whom were recruited and trained by the project compared to 20 estimated
at appraisal. 28 Villages were equipped with a kit of basic medical supplies
managed by the village association; 16 villages were provided with maternity
centers managed by traditional midwives, 60 of whom receive a one-month
training course compared to 30 estimated at appraisal. 27 Village associations
were given a grain grinding mill, the earnings of which are used for
activities as determined by the women's association. However, the functional
literacy program failed to achieve its goal.
Other Project-Related Developments
4.16     The other noteworthy, major development is the progress that has been
made in the formation of village groups. While it has always been a policy to
encourage the formation of these groups, only modest progress had been made
until 1979/80. There was then a strike of extension agents over pay and
status, and this coincided with the harvesting and marketing time for cotton.
Until that time, collection, grading, and transportation of seed cotton had
been arranged by the extension agent in cooperation with SOFITEX. When the
strike occurred, villages were faced with a difficult situation, and at this
point, many village groups were rapidly formed to deal with this problem, and
operate a marche auto-gere" or cooperative marketing arrangement, by whichi
they collect, sort and grade the village co'ton output ready for collection by
SOFITEX. There are now 38 such groups in Volta Noire and 151 in Hauts-Bassins.
For these tasks, the village groups receive a payment from SOFITEX equal to
the marketing costs saved by SOFITEX through this new arrangement. In 1981,
64% of the total cotton production was marketed through the project village
groups.
4.17     This development has been able to expand in other very important
areas. Many of these groups have now also taken over the ordering and
distribution of inputs for both cotton and cereals. This releases the
extension agent of other duties to enable him to concentrate more on his major
task of agricultural extension. Where this practice has been instituted, it is
working satisfactorily.
4.18     In addition, the village groups have set up credit committees to
screen and put forward applications for medium-term credit. The most
interesting aspect of this is that the group takes collective responsibility
for the repayment of such credits, and is careful in its selection of
candidates. Further, many of the groups are operating collective fields, the
product of which is sold, and the funds used for village development purposes.
Finally, several groups are also acting as cereals purchasing agents, either
on behalf of OFNACER, or else on their own behalf. In the latter case, they
are purchasing excess grains at the time of harvest, storing them in the
village grain stores provided under the projects, and reselling the cereals
later in the year to families who become short of cereals.
4.19     This development is of importance to the future of projects in this
area, both in terms of costs and of structures. It offers many opportunities
in terms of reducing ORD costs, and of increasing farmer/extension agent
ratios. It will also call for careful support and training, for those who hold
responsibility in such groups are handling large sums of money.

financed under the Upper Volta Rural Roads Project (Cr. 579-UV). However,
increased agricultural production resulting from this project justified the
roads. Table 4.6 below lists the roads that have been constrticted or
reconstructed by the road brigades within these ORDs. Two of these roads (Nos.
2 and 3) are technically outside the project area. However, the total is in
line with the original targets, and in addition, an average of 800 km of roads
have been maintained each year.

V. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
Incremental Output
5.01     At appraisal it was assumed that about 46,500 farmers participating
in project activities would obtain substantial direct income benefits through
using project services and inputs, and that the project's main direct economic
benefits would be an increase in production of cotton and cereals.
5.02     Cotton areas were estimated to grow from 48,500 ha in year 0 to
69,400 ha in year 5, an increase of 43%; yields were expected to rise from 896
kg/ha to 949 kg/ha; and total production was estimated to increase from 43,455
tons to 65,870 tons, an increase of 52%. As for cereals, mainly a combination
of millet and sorghum, the area under production was estimated to increase
from 125,150 ha to 160,850 ha, as a result of spontaneous settlement; yields



- 21 -
were expected to rise from 711 kg/ha to 918 kg/ha, and total incremental
production in PY5 was estimated at 32,280 tons, an increase of 28%.
5.03     Some 42,000 families (or about 90% of appraisal targets) are
estimated to have received a significant share of project inputs and attention
having a direct effect on agricultural production. Assessing project
achievements in this field has been more difficult for cereals than for
cotton, for which reasonably reliable statistical information was recorded
both by the project and by the marketing agency SOFITEX. For cereals, data is
generally more sketchy and no comparative figures were available as a baseline
starting point.
A.       Cotton Production
5.04     Cotton was cultivated in the project area well before the project
started, as records go back to 1960; Table 5.1 below is relative to the
principal cotton parameters from 1970-81. Final detailed figures are presented
in Annex 4, Table 1.

From 1970 to 1976, the land under cotton rose from 35,146 ha to a record
60,413 ha, and yield from 469 kg/ha to 769 kg/ha peaking at 1,018 kg in 1975.
In 1976, total cotton production reached 46,447 tons.
5.05     In 1977, the first project year, the project area was dramatically
affected for the second consecutive year by a severe drought. Cotton planting

was also seriously hampered by a very low germination percentage due to the
late 1976 rainy season which spoiled seed. The total acreage dropped by almost
35% compared to 1976 data and total production followed the same trend.
Fortunately, lower production at farmer level was compensated by an increase
of 37% in the price of seed cotton. First quality was bought at CFAF 55/kg and
second quality at CFAF 35 (compared with CFAF 40 and 35 in 1976). In 1978,
farmers expanded cotton areas only prudently, while in 1979 the cotton area
exceeded all expectations. In 1981, there was a setback in acreage mostly
attributable to the huge defection of cotton farmers, especially in the Volta
Noire ORD. Farmers shifted to cereals for three reasons:
(i)        dry spells in June, more severe in Volta Noire, preventing
the completion of the cotton program;
(ii)       cereals' very favorable comparative prices; and especially
(iii)      migrants' willingness to help reconstitute the cereal
granaries of their relatives in the north after a poor
1980 campaign.
It is difficult to forecast the extent to which this phenomenon will occur in
the future, but taking into account some recurrence, and the recurrence of bad
weather at regular intervals, it is believed that the total land under cotton
in the project area would average 50,000 ha in the next few years depending on
climatic conditions. These were the assumptions taken into consideration for
the two West Volta follow-up projects.
5.06     Average yield in the project was expected to rise from 896 kg/ha in
1976/77 (PYO) to about 949 kg/ha in 1981/82 (PY5). Actual yield rose steadily,
interrupted only by the severe drought in 1977/78 (PY1) and reached over 1,000
kg/ha in PY2, PY3 and PY5. This success hinges on the ability of the extension
service, reorganized In line with the Training & Visit System, to put before
farmers an attractive technical package based on an integrated approach
instead of focussing on a single crop, but hinges also on the village groups
who played a major role in the distribution of inputs.
5.07     The incremental production attributable to the project is the
increment over the without-project situation. Since this was a follow-up
project, the increment attributable is that over the estimated sustainable
output of the previous project. In the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR)
of the Upper Volta Cotton Project (Credit 225-UV, Report No. 2793), the
sustainable production after 1977/78 was not taken at the 1976/77 level of
46,447 tons, for these two ORDs, but rather at the reduced level of 37,400
tons, which is the average of the production of years 4-7 of that project,
1974-77. Given that years 4 and 7 were below this level, and years 5 and 6
above it, this seems an entirely reasonably course of action. However, it is
only fair to point out that the appraisal report for the West Volta project
used a much higher base figure of 43,455 tons, estimated in 1976. At the time,
it was not apparent that this was an exceptional, non-sustainable output, and
therefore the total levels of produc-ion forecast were also not sustainable.
The incremental production to be attributed to the project, judged in
comparison with the estimated sustainable outpt taken at the level of 37,400
tons, surpassed the appraisal targets by 11% (see Table 5.2 below).

B.       Cereals Production
5.08     Whereas cotton production figures are accurate and reliable, since
they are derived from deliveries of seed cotton to SOFITEX, figures on cereals
are harder to estimate. The two basic reasons are that a large part of these
cereals are for home consumption, and that the marketed portion tends to pass
through private traders rather than the official marketing agency, OFNACER.
Because of this, it is not possible to take global production figures and
break these down between project and non-project production. The approach has
therefore been to analyze incremental inputs applied to cereals and supplied
by the project, and estimate the impact of these inputs.
5-09     Two main sources of information are available to enable this exercise
to be undertaken with reasonable accuracy. Firstly, there are good data
available from FAO trials in the area over a long period of time. These are
farmer trials, rather than research station trials, and yields and response
rates can be taken as reliable, after some adjustment downwards to allow for
incorrect application of techniques and differences in soils and rainfall.
Secondly, the supervision mission to the project in February 1981 requested
that a survey be undertaken of a sample of project and non-project farms to
estimate yields and output for various crops. This survey also produced good
information. Finally, the information on the application of inputs on cereals,
and on the number of farmers reached by the extension agents, has been
supplied by the ORDs and is reasonably accurate.
5.10     There are five separate technical areas that have been assessed.
These are:
(a)        animal traction - increase in areas and yields;
(b)        cultural practices - largely sowing in line and weeding;
(c)        chemical fertilizers - both applied directly and the
after-effect following cotton;
(d)        use of pesticides for Seed and Crop Protection; and
(e)        use of selected seeds.



- 24 -
For the last two factors, we have decided that it would not be appropriate to
attribute any gains in production from these two sources to the project.
Whilst pesticides are used, they are not project-supplied and selected seeds
have been available in only very small quantities. It is therefore only the
first three factors that concern us.
5.11     Detailed calculations are given in Annex 4, Tables 2 and 3. In Table
5.3 below are presented the summary results.

5.12     Overall, the results are lower than the appraisal estimates although
the overall production increase is still impressive and the project has
achieved 78% of its original objective, which can be considered a very
satisfactory result for cereal production. A large part of the difference
between the outcome and the appraisal estimate may be because in the
evaluation no specific account has been taken of "new farmers". In the
appraisal, nearly 7,000 additional tons of production was expected from this
source, but in our evaluation methodology this cannot be identified
separately. In the appraisal, increments are assumed to take place over an
average base year output, and new farmers are assuufied to have a much lower
base production. Whilst our observations have confirmed the assumption that
new farmers are quick to accept and implement new techniques, we were not able
to confirm that they started from a very low base.
Technological Change
5.13     At appraisal a dietinction was made between four different groups of
farmers, namely the traditional, intermediate, advanced, and new farmers, who
were assumed to adopt various yield-improving techniques at various stages.
For cereals, mainly a combination of sorghum and millet, yield increases were
expected to be due to better cereal growing techniques and a wider use of a
pure, high-yield local variety, in particular more of the sorghum variety
Gnefing, and for miIIet, M12. These improvements were expected to result in
yield increments ranging from 100 kg/ha to 400 kg/ha for the four different
groups of farmers. For cotton, traditional farmers were not expected to use
either fertilizers or insecticides, and yield increases were assumed to be due



- 25 -
to improved cultivation techniques while intermediate, advanced, and new
farmers will also increase their fertilizer and insecticide use to
applications of an optimum of 100 kg/ha compound fertilizer and 10 X/ha of
insecticides (four sprayings). These improvements were expected to resul. in
an average yield increment of 150 kg/ha.
5.14     During project implementation, cultivation practices of farmers
improved, not only in the case of cotton, whose cultivation, in general, is
characterized by greater attention to sound cultivation practices and higher
use of fertilizers and insecticides, but also in the case of cereals, in
particular, sorghum and maize. However, the distinction between four groups
of farmers based on the level of technology proved to be theoretical, a
consequence of the lack of a baseline survey. For cotton, very well
researched and tested inputs and methods were available which increased yields
when applied as directed. Fertilizer and insecticide recommendations were
especially widely accepted and are considered to have been the most
significant inputs, together with the use of work oxen for plowing (see Annex
3, Table 2). For cereals, fertilizers and animal traction have been the most
significant inputs. Concerning fertilizer, whose consumption exceeded by far
appraisal estimates (see Annex 3, Table 3), the conclusion is based on the
evidence of research resuIlts, FAO/project demonstrations and farmer behavior.
Although the value of fertilizer was appreciated by farmers before the project
began, there is no doubt that FAO/project field demonstrations, input supply
system, and technical advice all contributed to the rapid increase in
fertilizers purchases and a rise in yields. In spite of the appreciation for
significant yield increase that can be obtained, it is most important to point
out that the recommended compound fertiIizer is too acidifying to be
repeatedly used on the naturally acid soils of Upper Volta, unless the
acidifying effect is buffered by applying large quantities of organic manure
or lime.  Adverse effects of cotton fertilizer was flagged by IRCT 1/ in 1976,
indicating a loss of organic material and phosphorus content by 20% after 6
years use of the fertilizer. In 1978, IRAT 2/ warned that the acidification
of the soil is an unavoidable phenomenon which will pose serious problems on
the economic use of fertilizers. The scientific explanation is that a
lowering of the pH can reduce availability of phosphorus and can cause
aluminum toxicity, calcium or magnesium deficiencies and manganese toxicity.
In the case of Upper Volta, Al-toxicity is thought to render the soil
unsuitable for cropping of cereals. Since the above-mentioned precautionary
measures, such as using quantities of organic manure or lime are seldom or
never taken by the farmer, the use of the compound fertilizer results -- after
a remarkable increase in yield during the first seasons--in a gradual decline
in yields the subsequent years and may eventually lead to an irreparably
degraded soil. Thus, there is an urgent need of (i) a better integration
between livestock and agriculture to foster the organic manure production and
(ii) the development of alternative, less acidifying, fertilizer formulations.
5.15     Concerning cotton insecticides, its consumption is linked to the
cotton hectarage. Because the total area shown under cotton during the

- 26 -
project was 38,000 ha below appraisal targets (Annex 4, Table i), the
insecticides consumption also fell short of the appraisal estimates. However,
the project technical contribution is reflected by the increase in:
- the amount of spraying per ha,
- the application rate per ha, and
- the use of ULV treatments instead of conventional treatments.
The third most important technical change due to the project is that the use
of work oxen for plowing, an established practice before the project period,
was accelerated by the improved availability of equipment and of medium-term
credit, resulting in a significant increase in the area on which animal
traction was used. For agricultural equipment, the figures are presented in
Table 4.2 above and in Annex 3, Table 1. No project contribution is taken for
seed dressings and chemicals to control pest in storage which were cheap, easy
to apply and generally very acceptable to farmers, as these inputs were also
well known prior to the project and were essentially distributed by the
private sector.
Vl. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
6.01     The overall economic impact of the project has been good.  It has
contributed to technological change and increased agricultural production
(Chapter V) and to institutional development (Chapter VII). However, a number
of these benefits are difficult to quantify, therefore only direct benefits of
increased farm production have been included in evaluating the economic impact
of the project. The data used in the analysis are presented in Annex 6, Table
1, and the major underlying assumptions are as follows:
(a) Production
There are reliable data on cotton production figures compiled by the
ORDs and SOFITEX. Data on production of fooderops are less certain
(see para 5.08) and activities of the very poorly staffed project
monitoring unit were often limited to summarizing, without great
accuracy, approximate data collected by the extension officers. It
would appear that both the SAR and project management failed to
appreciate the need for an internal capacity to establish reliable
baseline data, to monitor project progress toward achieving targets
and goals, and to continually reappraise and plan project
implementation in light of accumulated experience. A strong
monitoring capacity, including an effective management reporting
system and timely availability of agronomic data, would seem crucial
for managing a project of this type. Thus these estimates, in the
absence of reliaLle baseline data, could not be used in analyzing the
economic impact of the project. It was therefore necessary to better
evaluate the incremental production of fooderops as a direct result
of the project's activities. The mission which visited Upper Volta
in October 1981 to appraise the follow-up Hauts-Bassins/Volta Noire
Projects carried out an elaborate analysis on the increased
agricultural production, taking into account the inputs supplied by



- 27 -
the project (see para 5.10), both physical and advisory, and
attributing specific production increases to these factors according
to trials data achieved by FAO, SAFGRAD and CNRA - Bambey, with
certain downward reductions (supervision report dated January 19,
1982). Incremental production measured in that way was used in the
project economic evaluation.
(b) Prices: AIl benefits and costs are expressed in
constant 1982 CFAF. International prices from 1982
onwards are corrected for foreign exchange
fluctuations based on Bank and IMF estimations. Price
projections for cotton, cereal, and fertilizer are in
Annexes 6, Tables 2, 3, and 4 and are based on World
Bank Commodity Price Data.
(c) Costs:
(i)        Feeder roads costs (construction and maintenance) financed
under the Upper Volta Rural Roads project (Cr.579-UV) are
included in the economic analysis. The justification for
the roads was increased agricultural production from this
project, therefore, it is assumed that if this project did
not exist, the roads would not be included in the roads
project.
(ii)       Labor has been costed at its opportunity cost (in 1982
CFAF). The average wage paid to labor during peak period
is about CFAF 300/manday plus food, valued at CFAF
100/manday, giving a total of CFAF 400/manday. AII non-
peak labor was valued at 50% of this value which is CFAF
200/manday. Given that 40% of labor is peak demand and
60% non-peak, the weighted average wage rate is about CFAF
280/manday in 1982 prices.
(iii)      Recurrent ORD costs, needed to maintain the current level
of output, are projected at 30% of PY5 costs adjusted to
1982 prices and include (a) the agricultural extension
staff needed for a follow-up section only; (b) some input
distribution costs and (c) associated management
overheads. It is also assumed that:
-   marketing of cotton is carried out by SOFITEX;
marketing of o'her crops is via local markets, private
traders,"Office National des Cereales (OFNACER) and
'Soci6t6 VoltaYque de CommerciaLisation (SOVOLCOM);
and
-   the existing input distribution system, relying
heavily upon SOFITEX and village groups would suffice
with credit recovery mainly as a deduction from
payments for cotton.
6.02     Based on these data the economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated at
51%, as compared to 32% at appraisal. However, it is considered that this
result is overgenerous to the project since, particularly for cotton, climatic
and other factors in the development years of the project (especially 2 and 3)
were unusually favorable. In order to obtain an estimate which more nearly
reflects the actual impact of project activities, an adjusted estimate of



- 28 -
cotton production was made. Approximately 28% of long-term production is
estimated to have resulted from project activity. It was assumed that this
proportion was built up to steadily during the project period. Based on this
revised estimate (Annex 6, Table 2). the ERR is 33%, i.e. virtually identical
to the appraisal estimate. This result was achieved despite the fact that
physical targets were not fully met, because the real prices of the
agricultural commodities produced, i.e. cotton and sorghum/millet, were above
appraisal estimates.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Organization and Management
7.01     The appraisal report states that overall responsibility for the
project would rest with the Ministry of Rural Development, and that the CCDR,
which includes representatives from all ministries involved in rural
development, would coordinate and oversee activities at the ministerial
level. In the field, five agencies were to be responsible for project
implementation:
(a)  the two ORDs were to be responsible for providing inputs and
extension services for both rainfed and irrigated crops;
(b)  ONBI was to carry out the irrigation works;
(c)  SERS was to carry out the road construction program financed under
the Feeder Roads Project (Cr. 579-UV); and
(d) the women' s activities were to be promoted by two regional centers -
one in each ORD - which would report to the EAEY project's main
office in the capital.
Due to the general shortage of qualified technical staff needed for project
implementation, the ORDs, ONBI and SERS were to be strengthened by tne
following internationally recruited specialists: two technical advisors and
two extension specialists in the ORDs, one training assistant for SERS, two
irrigation engineers for ONBI and one technical assistant for CCDR, who would
replace the technical assistant already financed under the Cotton Project.
7.02     From inception, CCDR never functioned properly and the technical
advisor was never appointed; CCDR ceased to exist in PY2. The Secretary
General to the MRD was then in charge of coordinating the activities of the
ORDs with the technical departments of the Ministry. Coordination between
departments within the same ministry or between different ministries proved to
be difficult, resulting in implementation delays and unsatisfactory results in
the ONBI small-scale irrigation schemes and women's health and education, both
financed by Swiss Aid and controlled by Ouagadougou-based national bodies.
7.03     The end of the Cotton Project had no effect upon the personnel within
the ORDs, whose national staff remained unchanged. The first two ORD directors
appointed by MRD kept their positions until end 1981; the Volta Noire ORD
director performed satisfactorily except for stock accounting, but faced



- 29 -
serious staffing problems during the first 18 months of the project because
three key positions remained vacant at the department chief level. Helped by
better high-level agricultural technicians, the performance of the Hauts-
Bassins director was also satisfactory, overall, except for stock accounting.
7.04     Concerning technical assistance, performance was gVod as regards the
two extension specialists who remained throughout the project. Thanks to their
competence and flexibility, they successfully implemented the key project
component, namely the Training and Visit System, and drastically improved
their counterparts' capabilities. Unfortunately for the training center, one
of the counterparts was appointed Director General of another ORD at beginning
1981. The very capable technical advisor to SERS performed well, despite the
early teething troubles of this organization, which impeded implementation of
its work program for more than a year. The two irrigation engineers were
recruited end of 1978, one for one year and one for two years, after which the
Voltaics took over. Given the late start of this component, due to the lack of
material and its poor organization and coordination with project management,
their performance cannot be judged objectively. The two technical advisors
provided by CFDT under the Cotton Project remained unchanged for the follow-up
project. Instead of promoting both cotton and cereal production as required by
their terms of reference, they were mainly employed for cotton production,
where they performed well. Beginning of 1981, they were both replaced under
terms of reference which correctly ensure they will have responsibilities
relating to all agricultural matters. Whilst the Hauts-Bassins ORD technical
advisor performed well and will continue under the follow-up Hauts-Bassins
Project, the performance of his colleague in the Volta Noire ORD was extremely
poor. He was due to live on the project premises but never did so and was
replaced only when the project was completed, more than a year after the ORD
director and the Bank agreed that his activities should be discontinued.
B. Extension Method
7.05     The Training and Visit (T & V) System, initially developed as a
systematic program by Daniel Benor, was introduced in a modified form in the
project in 1978. The general feeling is that the T & V system is now
efficient and very well accepted by both the extension staff and the farmers,
who have shown great interest in the new approach to the extension problems
and in audio-visual methods. These results are due to the flexibility of the
two expatriate extension specialists, who have modified the system and adapted
it to:
(a) the family and family structure in Upper Volta;
(b) the characteristics of African farmers;
(c) the low level of education of the extension agents; and
(d) the need to gradually free the extension worker from non-extension
activities.
7.06     Staffing. Two expatriate extension specialists were recruited and
each of the IS sector chiefs were assisted by an extension coordinator w.1o
carried out one of the most crucial tasks of the system. Six subject matter
specialists CSMS) were also to be seconded to the extension staff in a role
portrayed as pivotal. In the absence of a real'specialist, their role was
fulfilled by the heads of other technical departments, who refused to be



- 30 -
seconded to the extension staff. The SKS carried out their training
responsibilities satisfactorily, but did not succeed in improving the
research/extension linkages, which remained one of the weakest spots of the
system. The picture is more favorable with respect to the extension agent, who
appreciated both their new training program and the well-defined working
schedule. The extension staff expanded in size, at appraisal, to 237 extension
agents compared to 190 at appraisal, but decreased when compared to the total
farmers in the region (see Table 7.1). However, appraisal estimates on the
projected financed key personnel in extension service, and the number of
villages and farm families it is anticipated to reach were only indicative,
because official data relative to the population survey carried out in 1974/75
were not yet released at appraisal.
7.07     Farmers' Response and the Role of the Extension Agent. A major
feature in the West Volta extension system has been the ability to take into
account the socio-cultural characteristics of local communities and to build
extension activities upon existing traditional village groups. Farmers'
response has been highly positive; they appreciate the improved method of
knowledge transfer and regular visits in the fields. It is generally admitted
that cooperation between farmers and extension agents has greatly improved,
that field work is being carried out in a more timely and efficient manner,
and that a much faster adoption of new technology is apparent from the group
approach compared with previous emphasis on individual contacts. Furthermore,
the groups are taking on additional tasks, such as input supply and marketing.
Extension agents played a key role in the selection of the contact farmer and
the definition of groups on an area basis as well as a group motivator.
During project implementation, group selection on an area basis, It is a major
change compared to appraisal based upon a selection within the village, was
found to be the best practical method for extension purposes. Indeed, farmers
selected on a village basis often work in different scattered areas which
impede the group extension approach. As a consequence of the ne.: selection
procedure, farmers per group were to be reduced but groups per agent were
Increased (see table 7.1). It is estimated that  42,500 farmers, or 40% of
the total farm population, have been directly reached by the system, whilst
27,000 benefited indirectly when attending regular village extenpion worker
field visits and on-the-spot farmer training. Judged against the existing
technical recommendations, the extension approach has been undoubtedly sound
and the overall results satisfactory; nevertheless, it is agreed What women
have been neglected and should be brought into extension activities more
actively. Table 7.1 below shows the actual extension ratios achieved.

Technical Recommendations and Research/Extension Linkages
7.08     Properly focussed and well conducted research is a basic need for
sound technical recommendations relevant to farmers' needs and for effective
extension.  In Upper Volta, considerabIe research work has been carried out on
both cash crops, such as cotton, and subsistence crops. The critical
difference between the research on cash crops and that on domestic food
staples was that in the former case, the application of research results was
demonstrably profitable and, under the management systeMs available, readibly
applicable. Thus, comprehensive packages were developed before project
inception for cotton and even maize and were largely successful. There can be
no doubt that higher yielding varieties and an improved fertilizer regime have
played a very large role in raising seed cotton yields from only about 300 kg
1/   The first 18 groups, which received full extension service during
the first two years (1979 and 1980) of the T & V System, have now been
replaced by 18 new farmer groups. See page 47.
2/   Number of farm families estimated to be reached by the extension
service directly and indirectly. At appraisal, it was assumed that only
about 70% of farmers reached would adopt extension service activities in
increased yields.



- 32 -
in 1970 to close to 1,100 kg/ha in 1981, equivalent to an improvement of about
10% per annum. In contrast, the food crop results, obtained under cuIltural
conditions that differed widely from traditional practices, and failed to take
into account the socio-cultural and material constraints under which the
"ypical farmer operated, were very frequently either unacceptable or
inapplicable. For instance, ICRISAT's initial optimism regarding the transfer
of hybrid sorghum varieties from India has been tempered by the disappointing
performance of these varieties under on-farm conditions in Upper Volta.
Problems of disease, rainfall variability, and poor soiTs have proven tougher
than expected and varieties which do yield well are sometimes susceptible to
bird damage or are not palatable to consumers. Despite the dearth of new
technical recommendations adapted to the traditional farming strategy,
comprehensive recommendations, including especially seed dressing, improved
cultu.ral methods, animal traction, fertilizer use and insecticides for stored
products were advocated.  Farmers relying on a flexible strategy which very
effectively accommodates itself to the capricious rainfall and numerous other
constraints, adopted these practices selectively for crops they judged were
better grown in mixes (cowpeas, millet and sorghum). The overall cereal
production is considered as being very satisfactory (para 5.10 to 5.12).
7.09     Nevertheless, one should not overlook the fact that no extension
system can survive for long unless it is capable of bringing new improved
technology relevant to farmers' need.s and adapted to farmers with varying
resources and to different ecological zones or soil types. Technology has now
reached a level where new breakthroughs are necessary. This requires not only
availability of appropriate research resuIlts, but also (i) good extension-
research linkages for a more effective extension; (ii) agents knowing how to
present their advice in an appropriate manner; (iii) a rapid feedback from
farmers, putting pressure on research to be more responsive to their needs;
and (iv) a better and especially more coordinated farmer systems research and
on-farm adaptive research guided by farmer constraints identified in the field
and subsequently quantified to ascertain that further research to eliminate or
limit the constraints would be justified. Concerning the first two
conditions, they have undoubtedly been the weakest parts of the present
extension system.  Improved research extension linkages wouIld enable the
extension staff to put more emphasis on the characteristics of the various
inputs offered for farmers' selection, so that they can judge if these inputs
have a role to play in their farming strategy. Concerning the feedback
element, it has often been limited to farmer willingness to accept new
technology, since the research-extension linkage has been "top down" rather
than "bottom up". To improve this situation, there is obviously a role for
the good extension worker and the good subject matter specialist in helping
the researcher design better research programs. Any researcher interested in
solving farmers' problems must welcome such interaction. The role of the SMS
will surely become even more important as farming practices become more
sophisticated, more input-oriented and, therefore, more complex in both
technical and economic terms. Thus, if the SMS is a weak link in the chain at
present, he is likely to be an even weaker link as farming advances. It would
be useful for projects to focus more on this aspect and for supervision
missions to deal specifically with this topic, including some discussions on
SMS training and the standards achieved in the job they are doing. Concerning
Farming System Research (FSR), it has received mounting respect from
economists and agriculturists during the last five years, but reports reveal
some divergence of opinion as to the activities which properly constitute



- 33 -
"farming system research". However, the project has never been involved in
this type of research nor in an adaptive research program that is designed to
select technologies to suit a particular zone or farming situation and to
determine whether such technologies would be profitable to the farmers of the
area concerned. Thus, these types of research should deserve greater
attention in the future, keeping in mind that adaptive research could only be
done when there were proven technologies to adapt, but that it also requires a
high level of experimental skills and a sound knowledge of the farmers'
production system. Critical priorities for adaptive research are:
-    production, use and conservation of organic matter, thanks to a
better integration of livestock and agriculture,
-    use of land preparation technologies such as closed ridges, aimed at
increasing the moisture storage capacity of lighter soils,
-    use of better farm tools and small farm machinery suitable for
subsistence farming, and
-    development of alternative compound fertilizer for cereals.
7.10     Training.  Whereas the importance of research as a source of
appropriate extension messages and as support for the training services has
been stressed, the emphasis on continuous training of staff, by both formal
and informal means, has been a key tenet of the T & V system implemented in
the West Volta Project. To familiarize top and middle level staff with the
new approach to agricultural extension work and to assure support for its
implementation, orientation courses of one to three weeks were held in the
early stages of the project. Other training programs were designed especially
to provide for the needs of the department heads, sector and subsector chiefs,
credit and extension agents, communications and mass media staff and other
agricultural support staff. A total of 68 training programs were attended by
1,429 participants (Annex 2, Table 1), and there is a broad consensus that T &
V's continuous training is the only realistic method of achieving adequate
standards in extension. The importance of technically, economically and
socially acceptable messages has been identified as a recurring problem,
whiIst other issues concern better training of the trainers of SNS and how to
evaluate the quality and effectiveness of training.
C. Accounting and Reporting
7.11     The project built upon the Vest Volta Cotton Project (Credit 225-UV),
which experienced difficuIties in preparing project accounts and having them
audited. To remedy this situation, an international firm of auditors was
appointed in 1975 and the new project was to create an independent Financial
and Administrative Unit (FAU) located in Bobo-Dioulasso charged with
instalIing and monitoring proper financial and administrative controIs at the
ORDs and in other IDA agricultural projects in the area. An expatriate
technical advisor was to be appointed for the FAU.
7.12     However, since project inception, it was unclear whether FAU had
control or only an advisory and coordinating role vis-a-vis the ORDs. Para
6.06 of the Appraisal Report talks only about accounting, reporting and
monitoring, but Annex II requires FAU to ensure the controI of expenditures



- 34 -
(including presumably ORDs). Subsequent developments aggravated the situation
because:
(a)  the first FAU director, by emphasizing his supervisory rather than
his technical t'sistance role, failed to gain the cooperation of the
ORDs;
(b)  the two FAU short-term consultants, who spent three months in Upper
Volta in 1979, did not meet the requirements of their terms of
reference to produce an analysis of the financial situation of the
ORDs and to implement certain improvements in accounting
procedures; and
(c)  the performance of the first two senior technical advisors was
unsatisfactory from project inception until mid-1979.
As a result of these weaknesses, during the first two years of the project FAU
failed to achieve its role and establish itself as an effective operational
unit.  In August 1979, the Association drew Government"s attent.on to the need
to improve the accounting and financial situations of the two ORDs and a
second internationally recruited technical advisor was seconded to the ORDs to
bring these accounts into order.  In June 1980, the services of the FAU senior
technical advisor were terminated by Government. Nothwithstanding these
initial shortcomings, FAU has filled an indispensable role, given the
complexity of the project and the lack of a project authority. It has
coordinated project funding and processed disbursement claims satisfactorily,
and has rewritten the project accounts, so as to provide fuIll analytical
accounting by component and source of finance.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01     Preparation and Appraisal.  The WVADP was prepared and appraised at a
time when the Bank had Iaunched very few projects of the kind.  Bank
performance was, however, satisfactory in designing a package which integrated
main dryland crops, cereals and cotton, input distribution, village stores,
spontaneous settlement, and a new type of extension and training system, as
well as promoting actions to improve the situation of women, to develop the
potential of irrigation through small-scale simple water control schemes and
to strengthen both the RuraI Road Agency and the Ministry of Rural
Development.
8.02     The physical targets which were set proved to be attainabIe both for
cotton, where reliabIe information was collected, and for cereals, despite the
sketchy data available. However, the distinction between four groups of
farmers based on the level of technology proved to be theoretical, whilst the
so-called new farmers expected to be affected by the extension service could
not be isolated from the rest of the farmers in the absence of any migrant
control and demographical survey.
8.03     Weaknesses in project design were the limited understanding of the



- 35 -
traditional farming system, the absence of a thorough baseline survey, which
turned out to be the major constraint in assessing incremental cereal
production, and the lack of both an Adaptive Research Unit and a strong
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. Moreover, the lack of Government enthusiasm
to implement the settlement component, was not recognized at appraisal.
Concerning the latter, detailed terms of reference were not agreed upon
between Government and the financing sources.
8.04     Supervision.  From October 1977 to January 1983, ten supervision
missions visited Upper Volta with regard to the project. Supervision teams
show an appropriate mix of skills and did include three specialist consiltants
in the fields of training, finance, accounting and administration, and
monitoring. Relations with both West Volta management and Government were
always good, frank and cordial. The other co-lenders were cooperative when
approached, and retied mostly on the Bank mission to keep track of project
performance.
8.05     Timewise, the supervision absorbed a total of about 500 mandays, one-
third of which was spent in the field. Bank staff and consultants made a
positive contribution in terms of project-related technical assistance, which
is estimated at about 50% or the time spent in the field, i.e. about 85
mandays. Project technical assistance was related to the following
components:
(a) Finance and Administration. The Financial and Administrative Unit
(FAU), staffed by a Bank technical advisor, received substantial help
from the supervision missions in terms of drawing up a work program,
providing glidelines and a framework for budgets and reports, and
preparing terms of reference for appointing a local firm to supervise
the FAU account;
(b) Training. A special mission consisting of two Bank staff was out in
the field in 1980 to review the effectiveness of the newly-introduced
Training and Visit System and also to suggest improvements to be
made;
(c) Monitoring and Evaluation. Bank staff helped determine what steps
are needed to improve the collection and analysis of project data,
drafted the outline of a special field survey aimed at assessing
cereal production in each ORD, and participated in the establishment
of criteria to determine the project impact on agricultural
production;
(d) Agricultural Technical Aspects. It is generally felt by Bank staff
members that project management do not keep themselves sufficiently
abreast of the status of international/national agricultural
research, and need assistance in implementing the resulting
recommendations in agriculture. This is an important but time-
consuming task done by Bank staff within the scope of a supervis an
mission.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNT
Conclusions
9.01     Overanl, the WVADP has been successfu.L in extending the work of the
preceding Cotton Project to stimulate more general agricuILturaE development in
the area. The West Volta Project succeeded in broadening the extension
message to cover fooderops, as well, while maintaining the impetus on cotton
production.
9.02     The agriculturaI impact of the project was significant in that some
42,500 farm families participated directly in the project, together with
27,000 who benefited indirectly when attending regular extension worker field
visits and on-the-spot farmer training. Most of the physical targets have
been met, with a total additional production of 62,000 tons of cotton (11%
above appraisal) and 70,000 tons fo cereals (22% below appraisal); the
construction of 72 out of 75 village grain stores; a training center at Bobo-
Diou.tasso;  and a new 20,000 ton ginnery at Dedougou.  Components not directty
under the control of the two ORDs were less successful, however, with only 13%
of the target of the irrigation component met, reflecting organizational
problems. The component for support of the Ministry of Rural Development and
the component to carry out studies and surveys, followed by pilot projects to
help new settlers, were not implemented.
9.03     The project's major institutional achievements have been to organize
and train the extension staff under the Training and Visit System, to separate
commercial functions from extension, and to continue to see that annual inputs
have been available; these elements have combined to meet production goals.
At the same time, the ORDs have undertaken successful initiatives in promoting
informal cooperatives known as village groups, which are participating in
marketing, input and credit administration, and supporting communal
activities.
9.04     The project has also maintained accounts in a satisfactory manner, as
vouched for by the auditors, Coopers & Lybrand.
Lessons Learnt
9.05     Some of the important lessons which may be drawn from the project
include:
-    the need for a baseline survey and a strong Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit; (paras 5.03, 5.08 and 5.14)
-    the need to reinforce the links between farmers, extension and
research in order to encourage two-way flows of information--this
implies more adaptive research in order to refine and improve the
technological packages; (paras 7.07 and 7.08)
-    the need to further increase the extension service coverage;  indeed,
extension has been successful in spreading the technical package but
at relatively high agent/farmer ratios, which could not be
permanently sustained; (para 7.07)



- 37 -
-    the need to carefully place increased emphasis on the integration of
livestock and agriculture; (para 7.08)
-    the need to better address the question of soil fertility, to monitor
closely the acidifying detrimental effect of cotton fertilizer, and
to look at alternatives and/or cheaper fertiIizer formulations best
suitable for cereals; (para 5.14)
-    the need to address the fertilizers subsidy issue, because subsidies
have risen beyond the capacity of Government to finance; (para 4.08)
-    the need to foster village group development; (paras 4.15 to 4.18)
-    the need to give increased attention to financiaL management, both
for controlling overexpenditures and in further ensuring the success
of the cost recovery program, which the ORDs initiated in 1980/81;
(paras 4.08 and 7.03)
=    the provision of adequate technical assistance to Government at the
right level, in sufficient strength, and with a clear understanding
of purposes and results expected, is one of the most difficult
exercises (paras 3.05 and 4.05).
9.06     In summary, the project, as a major effort at integrated agricultural
development, has been successful in effecting improvements in the agriculture
of the project area and has provided considerable experience in designing and
implementing services to promote rural development. Their approach is
replicable, if suitably trained and experienced senior staff are available.
The rate of return is estimated at 33% as compared to 32% at appraisal. The
lessons learnt from the project have been key elements governing the design of
the foIlow-up projects, as well as of the proposed Food and Fertilizer
Project.

1/  At appraisal it was assumed that fertilizer would be applied on cotton only and that cereals would benefit from
the residual effect of cotton f.rtilixation. However, additional input requiresnta for irrigated crops veVe
estimated to amount to about 487 tons of fertilizer over the 1977-81 period.
