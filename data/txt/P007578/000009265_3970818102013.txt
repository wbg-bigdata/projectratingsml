EIGHTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA)
Guarantor:         United Mexican States
Beneficiary:       Agricultural Trust Funds in the Bank of Mexico (FIRA)
Amount:            US$300 million equivalent, including a capitalized
front-end fee of US$748,130.
Terms:             Fifteen years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:   Funds would be provided to FIRA in the form of equity.
The proceeds would be relent by FIRA on terms and condi-
tions that vary with the income level of the beneficiaries
and purposes of the subloans, as specified in the General
Interest Rate Agreement negotiated recently with
Government.
Project
Description:     The project is a credit program which would seek to in-
crease agricultural productivity and production with a
view to increasing exports and self-sufficiency in food
and protecting real farm income. It would continue to
develop FIRA's institutional framework for efficient allo-
cation of financial resources and assist to improve agri-
cultural policies through the reduction of interest rate
subsidies. The low-income producers' component, would
comprise about one-half of the total investment program.
A program of training and demonstration would provide sup-
port to credit operations. About 105,000 families or
580,000 beneficiaries would benefit from the project.
Project Risks:      Since FIRA is a reasonably efficient and mature insti-
tution, the project presents no special risk in terms of
the technical and financial soundness of various invest-
ment opportunities that would be financed under the pro-
gram. The main risk would be that political pressures
would impede progress in eliminating interest rate subsi-
dies, especially in the case of a resurgence of inflation
causing a further deterioration of FIRA's financial posi-
tion, a continued drain on Government budget resources,
and a continued misallocation of production factors.

I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Agriculture in the Economy
1.01      Mexico's agricultural sector contributes about 10% of the gross
domestic product, employs about one-third of the country's active labor force
and contributes about 6% to the country's exports. Between 1945 and 1955,
agricultural production growth rates annually averaged about 6%, but declined
to about 4.4% between 1955 and 1965, and to less than 3% between 1965 and
1980. During the latter period, production increases from newly irrigated
land slowed down and agricultural terms of trade gradually worsened. How-
ever, agricultural production increased at an annual average rate of about
8.5% in 1981 and 1982. The increase was the combined result of favorable
weather conditions, higher farmr-gate prices and large input subsidies under
the Government-sponsored Mexican Food Program (SAM).
1.02      The reduced agricultural production growth before 1981, coupled
with inu- .asing internal demand, resulted in increased food imports and dete-
rioratio- in the agricultural trade balance.  In 1979 the country experienced
its firvt agricultural trade deficit, and in 1981 the deficit was over
US$1 billizn. However, since 1982 the agricultural trade deficit has
reversed primarily due to reduced imports influenced by substantial
devaluations.  Since 1970, corn, wheat, soybeans, sorghum and powdered milk
have been the principal food imports, representing about 7.6% of total
imports i:a 1980. During the same period, cotton, coffee, fruits and
vegetab..es constituted the main exports (Annex 1).
Production, Trends and Past Agricultural Policy
1.03      Mexico's basic crops, which include maize, beans, wheat, rice,
sorghum, soybeans and sugarcane are produced on about 75% of the cultivated
area (Annex 2). Production has varied strongly from year to year with a
basic growth trend of 1.5% to 2.5% over the 1970s, i.e., well below the popu-
lation growth rate. Government intervention in the price setting and marke-
ting of these crops gradually grew stronger over the decade. With the pres-
sure to protect the consumer against increased food prices during a period of
gradually increasing inflation, the terms of trade worsened. As a result,
imports of these crops increased strongly, i.e., maize imports increased from
736,000 tons in 1970 to 3.8 million tons in 1980 and sorghum imports from
10,900 tons in 1970 to 2.8 million tons in 1981. From 1980 to 1982, the
Government attempted to reverse this trend, by substantially increasing
farm-gate prices and introducing a range of input subsidies in the context of
SAM. Farmers responded positively but, as consumer prices for the basic
products were adjusted more slowly than producer prices, consumer subsidies
also increased and the Government program became too costly to maintain after
1982.



- 2 -
1.04      The production of export crops (mainly coffee, fruits and vege-
tables), which has remained relatively free from Government intervention in
trade and prices, showed an annual average growth of about 12% between 1975
and 1979. In the ensuing three years, exports of these crops stagnated,
mainly due to an increasing overvaluation of the Mexican currency. However,
indications are that since 1982, growth has resumed. Regarding livestock
activities, beef production grew at an annual rate of 7% between 1975 and
1982, and pork, poultry meat and egg production at even higher rates, between
10% and 12% annually over the same period. These growth rates were
sufficient to cover increased domestic demand and Mexico's traditional beef
exports were basically maintained. Milk, however, which is produced under
controlled prices, grew at only about 1.8% per annum during this period.
Milk imports in the ten years before 1982 rose at an annual rate of about
20%, and presently equal about 16% of total production in fluid equivalent.
1.05      Growth in related sectors has been mixed: (a) the agroindustries
subsector grew rapidly through the decade of the 1970s (10 per annum), and
in 1979 accounted for about 18% of the industrial sector's output; (b) the
forestry sector which comprises about 21 million ha of commercial wood is
underexploited, producing only about 9 million m3 of wood products in 1981;
and (c) the fisheries subsector has shown significant growth in recent years,
rising from an annual catch of about 0.25 million tons in 1970 to about
2 million tons in 1982. Approximately 30% of the value went into exports
(mainly shrimp) and about 50% of the total catch into fish meal.
Present Government Agricultural Strategy
1.06      At the end of 1982, when the new Government took office, there was
an urgent need to reassess and reorient agricultural development policies.
After substantial devaluations, domestic farm-gate prices had deteriorated in
real terms. Strong price increases, especially for the basic commodities,
were required if farmers were to maintain and increase production levels. On
the other hand, in order to lower high inflation levels, there was a need to
contain increased food prices. Also, in view of high public sector deficits,
the Government's agricultural subsidy policy needed to be overhauled.
1.07      The Government's strategy, as outlined in the National Development
Plan for 1983-1988, aims at accelerated agricultural growth. The policy
emphasizes the importance of agriculture in increasing Mexican exports and
production of import substitutes. The stated policy over the medium-term is
to guarantee farm prices which are consistent with international prices.
However, in the short-term, emphasis is being placed on adequate compensation
for the increased cost of production and a reasonable profit margin to produ-
cers to determine price levels. Prices for basic crops (i.e., mostly the
controlled sector) increased about 120% in nominal terms during 1983 and
further increases, averaging about 35%, have been made in 1984. The basic
staples, such as maize and wheat, are now priced at current international
levels. Input subsidies have been strongly reduced. Subsidized prices for
key inputs (i.e., fertilizer and seeds) are now only available to



- 3 -
rainfed-maize production to small farmers holding less than 20 ha each.
Interest rates on agricultural subloans, which until now were fixed and gene-
rally negative in real terms, will be made variable and are to approach
positive levels gradually, in accordance with a timetable that fo,-ms part of
the General Interest Rate Agreement between the Government and the Bank. The
movement in rates will be referenced to the latest average cost of funds to
multipurpose banks (ACF)1/. Irrigation water rates were increased on an
average of about 200% during 1983, which implied an increase in real terms at
the time, and further adjustments are expected to be made towards the stated
goal of achieving operationL and maintenance costs recovery, under a gek'eral
strategy to improve the use and management of Mexico's water and soil
resources. Improvement and rehabilitation projects would be undertaken in
existing irr'gation areas, and new investments would be decided on
selectively, stressing small and medium-scale irrigation projects in region.,
with a lesser degree of development. The Government is also taking steps to
decencralize planning, programming and implementation of rural development
projects to state and local levels and to improve interagency coordination.
Agricultural policy dialogue between the Government and the Bank has been
intense in the recent past, and both have agreed to a continuous policy
dialogue in the future.
Agricultural Credit
1.08      Within the context of its agricultural development policies, the
Government has used credit as an important instrument for achieving growth
and equity objectives. First, it has encouraged growth in agricultural lend-
ing by making public funds available (through the Bank of Mexico or from the
budget) to various financing agencies, such as the Agricultural Trust Funds
(FIRA), to discount subloans made by Mexican banks. Second, it has signifi-
cantly promoted credit to low-income producers by (a) financing operating
subsidies of the state-owned National Rural Credit Bank (BANRURAL
para. 1.16); (b) providing technical assistance and loan recovery guarantees
to commercial banks that lend to low-income producers (para. 1.17);
(c) obliging such banks to hold part of their legal deposits in the Bank of
Mexico in low-income producer loans (para. 1.17); and (d) since 1976, increa-
singly, financing subsidized interest rates on loans to such farmers. The
result has been a dramatic growth in outstanding agricultural credit from the
commercial and public banks from Mex$ 17.7 billion in 1970 to Mex$ 218.5
billion in 1981-an average annual increase of 10.4% in real terms.
Low-income producers accounted for about 50% of the total loan portfolio in
1981.
1.09      While agricultural credit grew continuously up to 1981, growth came
to an abrupt end in 1982, when institutional credit to agriculture fell
nationwide by about 28% in real terms; again in 1983 it fell by about 25%.

bonds, notes, and certificates of deposit, excluding checking and
savings accounts. This rate is published monthly by the Bank of Mexico.



- 4 -
The decline occurred because (a) as a result of high inflation, recuperations
on the existing loan portfolio were inadequate to cover the demand for funds;
and (b) the Government was unable to finance the large subsidy required to
bridge this gap. In addition, because of strong devaluations, many
traditional US sources of short-term financing outside the domestic banking
system disappeared. It was estimated that in 1983, the banking system
satisfied significantly less than the agricultural credit demand.
1.10      FIRA.  The Bank of Mexico is the trustee for the three agricultural
trust funds, which are integrated for management and accounting purposes and
administered as FIRA: (a) the Trust Fund for Crop, Livestock and Poultry
Credit (FONDO), which dJscounts to participating commercial and public banks
short-term subloans for crops, livestock and agroindustry; (b) the Special
Agricultural Trust Fund (FEFA), which discounts medium- and long-term sub-
loans for crops, livestock and agroindustry; and (c) the Technical Assistance
and Loan Guarantee Trust Fund (FEGA), which defrays to participating banks
part of the cost of subloan evaluation and technical assistance for
low-income producers, and guarantees the commercial banks' contribution to
these subloans.
1.11      FIRA and the Bank have a long and good relationship, having satis-
factorily completed six projects with the ongoing Seventh Agricultural Credit
Project (providing a total financing of USS925 million), substantially on
schedule. In addition to being one of the main providers of financial
resources to the Mexican agricultural sector, FIRA provides significant tech-
nical assistance to commercial banks and to farmers, through its training
programs and demonstration centers. Throughout the years, FIRA has earned a
good reputation, and its management is experienced and of high quality. How-
ever, some fine tuning of its operations will be needed, especially in the
field of FIRA's medium-term planning, in order to optimize use of scarse
resources. Moreover, FIRA's technical assistance program needs to be
expanded, to promote producers' adoption of new and improved technology and
to strengthen its monitoring and evaluation procedures. FIRA's organization
and management, and its planning and programming, training and demonstration,
monitoring and evaluation functions are described in Annex 4.
1.12      FIRA has been a relatively sound financial institution.  Its conso-
lidated financial statements at end-December 1983 showed assets amounting to
about Mex$ 146 billion (US$912 million) (Annex 4, Table 2). These assets
were financed mainly by the Bank of Mexico, by external loans for which the
Government absorbed the foreign exchange risk, and by equity. FIRA's loan
portfolio at the end of 1983 amounting to Mex$ 137 billion (US$856 million)
represents about 95% of its total assets. During the five-year period
1977-1981, FIRA increased its lending to agriculture at ar. annual average
rate of over 20% in real terms. However, lending in 1983 of about Mex$ 123
billion (US$767 million) was about 23% below the 1981 level in real terms
(Annex 4, Table 3). All subloan repayments are recuperated on due dates from
participating banks through the Bank of Mexico's current accounts; as a



result, FIRA suffers no arrears. Arrears to participating commercial banks
on subloans discounted by FIRA are estimated to be about 22.
1.13      FIRA has consistently earned annual profits in nominal terms
(Annex 4, Table 4). In 1983, FIRA's average interest Income was 20.7%, and
its cost of funds 18.5%, providing a net financial income of 2.2%. However,
this net financial income was lower than the previous three years' average of
4.1X, reflecting an increased cost of funds without a corresponding increase
in on-lending rates. FIRA's operating costs before recoveries, comprising
technical assistance, demonstration centers and administration was a low 2.72
of average loan portfolio in 1983. Recoveries derived from production income
of demonstration centers and from Government compensation to FIRA for
technical assistance reduced operating costs in 1983 to 1.32 of average loan
portfolio.
1.14      Until end-1981, FIRA's annual operating profits were sufficient to
avoid decapitalization of its equity. This position was reversed when infla-
tion rose to 99% in 1982 and 81% in 1983, while interest rates on subloans
were fixed. In addition, prevailing rates for current lending were not
raised sufficiently to adjust to the high inflation levels of the period.
However, the decapitalization of the loan portfolio was largely absorbed by
the Government through (a) Bank of Mexico rediscounts of about 602 of FIRA's
discounts at varying rates of interest, allowing FIRA a fixed margin of 32 to
3.5%; and (b) Government guarantees which absorb exchange losses on almost
all foreign indebtedness. At end-1983, the accumulated losses (1981 to 1983)
on existing FIRA foreign indebtedness to be absorbed by the Government
amounted to about Mex$ 70 billion (US$437 million). After deducting the
Government subsidy, FIRA suffered decapitalization at an average of about 302
per year during 1982 and 1983.
1.15      For the next four-year period (mid-1984 to mid-1988), FIRA has
adopted an overall lending target of about US$3,556 million (Annex 4,
Table 3). This would allow it to increase its level of lending by 52 per
annum in real terms. Targeted lending for short-term, and for medium- and
long-term investments would amount to about 62X and 38%, respictively, of the
total investment which is in line with its ongoing program. FIRA's Invest-
ment program is reasonable, inasmuch as it reflects the Government's prio-
rities to promote agricultural growth and focus on diversification of produc-
tion, export expansion and efficient Import substitution and is well within
its capacity and that of the participating banks to carry out. However, to
sustain such a lending program, FIRA would have to mobilize substantial addi-
tional internal and external financial resources. FIRA's proposed lending
prcgram would be financed partly by Bank of Mexico financing, equivalent to
about 402 of its total lending. The remaining balance would be generated
from FIRA's own resources and through external borrowings. During the period
1984-1988, FIRA's financial gap, after allowing for the repayment of USS442
million of foreign indebtedness becoming due, would be USS790 million. The
Bank's proposed loan of US$300 million would allow FIRA to reduce thls gap to
US$490 million (Annex 4, Table 6).



1.16      BANRURAL. BANRURAL, a public entity and the largest bank in
Mexico, incorporates 12 subsidiary regional banks with 630 branches and about
27,000 regular employees. Its lending operations, which increased from
MexS 24 billion In 1970 to Mex$ 74 billion in 1981 and MexS 169 billion in
1983, consist mainly of short-term credit (822 of 1983 lending) primarily to
low-income producers (about 90;; of total). Its short-term credit covered a
cultivated area of 7.3 million ha In 1983, equivalent to 36.4% of all culti-
vable lands ln Mexico compared to 232 in 1978. BANRURAL's operating costs
are high (about 16X of loan portfolio) and a hlgh percentage of Its loans are
In arrears or unrecoverable; as a result, the bank is heavily subsidized. In
1981, the Government allocated from Its budget about Mex$ 54 billion
(US$2.2 billion), consisting of an equity contribution of Mex$ 14 billion and
an operational subsidy of Mex$ 40 billion. The operational subsidy allowed
the writing off of about 20X of its lending operation as unrecoverable and
the coverage of operating costs In excess of revenue. While BANRURAL as a
financial institution is considered too weak at this tim for direct Bank
financing, it Is allowed to participate in FIRA's discounting system because
FIRA exercises, through Its own control mechanism, sufficient selectivlty and
supervision to obtain good performance. BANRURAL subloans discounted through
FIRA generally perform well with only about 62 estimated to be In arrears.
BANRURAL discounts are currently only about 122 of total FIRA discounts to
participating banks.
1.17      Commercial Banks.  The commercial banks, which were nationalized on
September 1, 1982, continue to operate in a manner slailar 'to their previous
role as private banks. Because of the support extended by FIRA in terms of
funds, training of staff and other support services, many comercial banks
have established agricultural credit departmnts with agricultural techni-
cians, who are graded and authorized to evaluate and approve subloans at
varying levels. Lending operations by comercial banks traditionally concen-
trated on commercial producers and agroindustries. Consequently, the Bank of
Mexico, In order to encourage lending to low-Incom producers, stipulated
that 0.72 of total deposits of multipurpose banks and 22 of deposits In
comerclal banks must be held in the form of agricultural loans to low-incone
producers. In addition, FEGA provides guarantees (about 802 of subloans) and
reimburses technical assistance for subloans to low-incom producers.
Lending by commercial banks through FIRA to low-Income producers now averages
about 282 of total subloans discounted as compared to about 10 In 1980. The
commercial banks discounted about Max$ 109 billion (about US$680 million) of
subloans wlth FIRA in 1983, representing 832 of FIRA's total discounts (over
952 of all FIRA short-term and over 602 of mediumterm discounts). This has
resulted in FIRA financing about 532 of the agricultural loan portfolio of
the comercial banks as of December 31, 1983, as compared to a range of 422
to 462 In the three previous years.
Previous Bank Projects
1.18      In the past ten years (FY1974-1983), Bank participation in the
agricultural sector mounted to USS2,523 million distributed among 19



projects, of which three were credit projects (FIRA V, VI and VII) with Bank
financing totalling US$765 million.
1.19      In December 1982, the Bank issued a combined completion report on
the Fifth and Sixth Credit Projects (Report No. 4240). The overall conclu-
sions were as follcws:
(a)  FIRA's performance has been impressive and has had a strongly
positive impact on agricultural production and institution
building;
(b)  specific components set aside in Bank loans for low-income
producers have helped to focus lending more on this farmer
category. Also, lending, which was initially mainly for
livestock, has become progressively more diversified;
(c)  FIRA, supported by the Bank, was in the process of developing
a monitoring and evaluation system to measure lending impact,
and has over the past three years effectively decentralized
its lending operations, as a result of which most of its field
offices have a reputation for excellence;
Cd)  the gap (since 1976) between FIRA's interest rates and commer-
cial interest rates progressively widened as no provisions
were made for periodic adjustments during implementation.
This caused (i) an accelerating demand for credit; and (ii) a
slow deterioration of FIRA's sound financial position; and
Ce)  FIRA's capabilities for sectoral analysis, planting and
programming and internal control of subloans was inadequate in
the face of strongly expanded demand.
1.20      The Seventh Project, which is expected to be completed in
mid-1984, was designed taking into account the experiences and lessons gained
through the previous projects. There is a significant improvement in quality
control of subloans financed through FIRA (Annex 4, para. 3). An Operating
Regulations and Procedures Manual and a data base system have been developed
and a monitoring and evaluation system has been satisfactorily organized.
FIRA's capabilities for in-depth sectoral analysis and medium-term planning
and programming could, however, still be improved (para. 1.11). In addition,
interest rate adjustments have not been sufficient to cover the gap between
agricultural on-lending rates anid inflation.
1.21      Completion reports on two irrigation projects (Panuco, Loan 969-ME,
and Sinaloa, Loan 970-ME) have been issued. The lessons learned from these
projects, which have been confirmed by the audits are: (a) the evaluation of
irrigation projects should consider the alternative of developing rainfed
agriculture; (b) a strong extension service is necessary for the development



-8-
of agriculture; (c) projected agricultural production targets should be based
on tested models; (d) large civil works ccmponents require advanced
preparation before appraisal; and (e) phasing should be considered for
projects with long implementation periods.
1.22      Implementation of ongoing projects is currently slow because of
limited counterpart fund availability. In addition, disbursements have
lagged substantially because of insufficient budget and because the
Government's financial control and reimbursement procedures are cumbersome.
The Government is reassessing some of the ongoing projects and, in
cooperation with the Bank, is reviewing the financial control procedures for
simplification. In 1982 and 1983, the higher devaluation rate over the
inflation rate and stringent budget constraints further slowed down execution
of ongoing projects and disbursements. The Bank is implementing a Special
Action Program in which for 1983 through mid-1985 disbursement percentages
for Bank financed projects have increased. This would accommodate some of
the budgetary difficulties the Government experienced in maintaining its
counterpart share in the investment programs and would accelerate
disbursp'ents.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
2.01      The Government of Mexico has requested Bank assistance in financing
the proposed Eighth Agricultural Credit Project to support the Government's
National Development Plan (para. 1.07). The proposed project would provide
much needed resources to assist the Government in maintaining and increasing
short-term and investment lending to agriculture, which is crucial to sustain
and promote increased agricultural production. The proposed project is
further justified as (a) FIRA has developed a good reputation as a well-run
institution with experienced management and a good tecbnical assistance
program; and (b) the Government has agreed to introduce a variable interest
rate system and significantly adjust upward ongoing interest rates for new
subloans under ongoing credit projects so that most of them, over a
determined period, will become positive (para. 3.04). This will arrest the
recent deterioration in FIRA's financial position, provide a more efficient
allocation of investment resources and ensure the availability of funds to
meet future lending requirements. The preparation report for the proposed
p-_ject was compiled by FIRA staff with Bank support. A list of studies and
working papers relating to the project is given in Annex 6.
B. Project Objectives and Description
2.02      In accordance with the Government's overall development plan of
promoting agricultural growth and reducing fiscal deficits, the objectives of
the proposed project would be to:



- 9 -
(a) increase agricultural productivity and production with a view
to (i) increasing exports, (ii) improving food
self-sufficiency, and (iii) increasing farm income;
(b) continue to strengthen FIRA's institutional framework for
efficient allocation of financial resources; and
(c) improve agricultural sector policies by reducing interest rate
subsidies and restrict them to special target groups.
2.03      In order to achieve these objectives, the proposed project would
provide:
(a) investment credit and short-term loans to farmers for crops,
livestock and agroindustries, representing a credit line of
about 21% of FIRA's total lending program (the Bank loan would
represent about 8% of the total lending program);
(b) technical assistance to farmers to enable appropriate transfer
and adoption of improved technology;
(c) support services to continue the training of technical staff
from FIRA and participating banks and strengthen FIRA's medium-
and long-term development planning; and
Cd) policy changes for (i) the introduction of a more realistic
definition of subloan beneficiaries, and (ii) a gradual reduc-
tion and eventual elimination of subsidized interest rates,
except for low-income farmers.
2.04      The proposed project would be carried out over a four-year period,
and most project requirements, including interest rates, subproject appraisal
and supervision requirements, preparation of investment programs, and
monitoring and evaluation would apply to FIRA's total lending program. About
50% of the proposed loan would be directed to low-income producers.
Investment subloans to beneficiaries would, as in the past, be based on
technically and economically sound development plans, and constitute
approximately 70% of the total credit line. Because of the increased demand
for working capital credit, incremental short-term financing would also be
provided, constituting about 30% of the total credit line. About 52% of the
investment portion of the credit line would be for annual and perennial
crops, 35% for livestock and 13% for agroindustries.
C. Detailed Features
Crop Lending Program
2.05      Investment lending for crops would cover the complete range of pro-
duction types from annual to perennial cropping under rainfed and irrigated



- 10 -
conditions in the country. Crop investment subloans would include a wide
diversity of loan size, type of borrower and ecological conditions. In rain-
fed annual cropping areas, subloan beneficiaries would be mainly small pri-
vate farmers or ejidatarios cultivating such crops as maize and beans. Sub-
loans under irrigated annual cropping programs would encompass all produ-
cers. Perennial-crop subloans in rainfed and irrigated areas would be
diverse, including coffee, tropical fruits, apples, rehabilitation of coconut
and cacao plantations, and production of table grapes and avocados. Based on
initial estimates, it is unlikely that the project would significantly
increase coffee production in Mexico. Investment items for the crop lending
program would include, inter alia, land improvement, equipment and machinery
purchases, civil works construction, including supporting infrastructure for
irrigation and storage, and establishment of fruit orchards and industrial
crop plantations.
Livestock Lending Program
2.06      Of the investment lending for livestock, about 55% would be for
beef and dual-purpose production, 15%.for dairy production, and 30% for other
livestock operations. As in the case of crop investment subloans, there
would be a wide diversity of loan size, type of borrower and ecological
conditions in livestock subloans. Lending for beef production would be allo-
cated throughout the country, and investment items would include purchase of
breeding stock, renovation and/or establishment of pastures, construction of
buildings, fences and handling facilities and provision of water supplies.
Dual-purpose livestock production would be supported on all types of farms,
both in the humid tropics and in the temperate highlands. Intensive milk
production would be promoted primarily on medium-size private family opera-
tions in the central and northern regions. Swine subloans, primarily to
small- and mediumrsize private operations, would continue to be for high
technology breeding and fattening operations based on purchased feed located
in the central plateau region. Poultry investments would be made largely in
high technology operations in the northern and central plateau regions of the
country.
Agroindustries Lending Program
2.07      About 13% of FIRA's investment lending would be to the agro-
industrial sector, particularly to small- and medium-scale producers. The
portfolio of agroindustrial investments would continue to vary widely, inclu-
ding sawmills, fisheries, feedmills, grain elevators, milk processing plants,
and slaughterhouse facilities. However, the project would not finance
marketing components of subprojects as these would be financed under the
Marketing Project (Loan 2262-ME).
Short-term Lending Program
2.08      Short-term subloans under the project would be provided for the
entire range of crop, livestock and agroindustrial activities. Furthermore,
as a large proportion of Mexico's low income producers are unable to take up



- 11 -
investment loans, but do require working capital support to procure essential
cash inputs, the project would provide at least 60% of project-financed
short-term subloans to this group. The project would finance only incre-
mental short-term lending, with incrementality defined as additional over
FIRA's total short-term leading of the previous year. By end-November of
each year, FIRA would provide the Bank with an estimate of its incremental
short-term lending for the subsequent year, which would form the upper limit
of the Bank's short-term loan reimbursements. Any deviations between actual
and estimated short-term lending over the year would be taken into account in
determining next year's disbursement limits. During negotiations, the
borrower provided assurances that (a) the above procedures to determine
incremental lending will be adhered to; and (b) at least 60% of project
financed short-term loans will be allocated to low-income producers.
Technical Assistance
2.09      FIRA's well-run technical assistance program would be expanded to
promote the adoption of new and improved technology among farmers and to
maximize the effectiveness of on-farm credit. During the project period,
FIRA would develop intensive technical assistance packages to support all
major areas of agricultural production. These packages are currently
available for maize and milk, and would therefore be the products initially
emphasized. Both these products have experienced significant increases in
imports in recent years (paras. 1.03 and 1.04) but have good economic
potential for increased production domestically.
2.10      In the case of milk, the program would emphasize support to low
input, pasture-based systems on family holdings using technical packages
generated at the demonstration centers. Over the four-year project period,
about 40 groups of producers (10 farmers per group) would be identified in
each of four geographic regions. Investment plans would be prepared for
financing through credit. Administratively, technical assistance would be
organized under four regional coordinators, each with a team of one
veterinarian for each 20 groups, and one technician for every four groups.
The program for family operations is conservatively estimated to raise
calving percentages from 65% to 75%; raise cow culling rates from 11% to 15%;
increase the lactation period from 270 to 300 days; and increase the milk
yield from 2,800 liters to 3,500 liters per lactation on the central
plateau. The full-development impact of this program is estimated to
increase milk production by about 12 million liters/year.
2.11      The maize program would essentially follow a similar organizational
pattern to the milk program with six regions being targeted. The groups of
maize producers would be organized into units of 500-700 ha each. for adminis-
tration by technical staff; the total number of beneficiaries is estimated at
about 22,000. The full development impact of the complete program is esti-
mated to increase average yields by one ton per ha and maize production by
about 200,000 tons per year. The total technical assistance cost of the



- 12 -
maize and milk targeting program is estimated at about US$7 million over four
years. After investments are made, FIRA and participating banks would
provide technical assistance on an intensive basis, the cost of which would
be partly borne by the sub-borrower in the first three years of the program,
and thereafter, totally financed by the sub-borrower.
2.12      Direct training of farmers would focus primarily on the transfer of
new technology through FIRA's demonstration centers and FIRA's and
participating banks' technical staff visits. The number of demonstration
centers would increase from 88 to 109 at full development. Those devoted to
maize would increase from 40 to 54; those devoted to milk and livestock
production from 15 to 22. Since the centers are the focal point for training
farmers, the new centers would be established in strategic locations close to
major production areas. Project financing to support the new centers would
include civil works, land improvement and development, crop and forage
establishment, agricultural machinery and equipment and livestock.
Support Services
2.13      Training of Technical Staff.  FIRA has a competent and successful
training division, through which it would continue to maintain a strong
training program under the project for its staff and technical personnel of
the participating banks (Annex 4, para. 5). The project would expand the
ongoing training programs by: (a) training of technical staff in the
adoption of technological innovation by farmers; and (b) fellowships and
overseas training, including two-year scholarships for post-graduate degrees
where staff expertise requires strengthening. The primary focus of training
would be to educate trainers through formal courses with effective follow-up
to revise course content and teaching methodology. It is anticipated that
20% of the technical staff to be trained under the project would be from
FIRA, 40% from participating banks and 40% from other sources including SARH.
2.14      Development of Planning and Programming.  Until now, FIRA's
investment planning has been limited to annual programs with only very broad
multi-year targets, mainly based on expected overall increases in lending.
In view of existing and predicted scarcities in lending resources, there is a
need for more longer-term planning to efficiently allocate available monies
within the framework of the Government's investment priorities and needs
of the sector. Priorities for investments would be viewed in terms of
products, producer groups and regions. There would be continuous dialogue
with key Government agencies to determine the role of credit as an instrument
in the agricultural development plan. From the dialogue above, FIRA would
determine, on an ongoing basis, its growth objectives and the future focus of
its lending program. At the Bank's request, FIRA prepared a position paper
outlining (a) FIRA's background showing the linkage between current
objectives and policies with the Government's agricultural priorities; and
(b) FIRA's future direction as a development institution. This position



- 13 -
paper, which indicates the direction of FIRA's longer term investment
program, will serve as a basis for the elaboration of such a program.
2.15      Provision of Consultants.  The project would provide a total of
about seven staff-months of consultant support in monitoring and evaluation
(four staff-months) and planning and programming (three staff-months). The
monitoring consultant would be required to assist FIRA in simplifying the
technique for gathering and computing information, making it more readily
usable by the managers, and advising on related training procedures (Annex 4,
para. 6). The planning and programming consultant would assist FIRA,
including the training of its staff, in its in-house exercise to strengthen
its capabilities in analyzing and developing medium- and long-term
development plans.
D. Project Costs
2.16      Project costs are estimated at US$763 million, including price
contingencies (Table 2.1), representing US$520 million for medium- and
long-term lending, US$227 million for short-term lending and US$16 million
for productive support. About US$299 million, or 39% represents the esti-
mated foreign exchange component. The proposed project would represent a
credit line equal to about 21% of FIRA's overall lending program (US$3,556
million) for the project period; 46% of the medium- and long-term investment
programs (US$1,139 million) and about 9% of the overall short-term program
(US$2,417 million).
2.17      Project costs include no allowances for import duties, since the
Government's policy exempts agricultural equipment and materials from import
duties. Sales taxes are estimated at about 6% of project costs (US$46
million). Base cost estimates are evaluated at mid-1984 prices and incor-
porate allowances for international inflation; current Government exchange
rate policy is to compensate any excess of domestic inflation over
international inflation by devaluations of the peso. The contingency for
international inflation is estimated at 3.5%, 8%, 9%, 9% and 9% per annum for
1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988, respectively.
E. Financing
2.18      The proposed Bank loan of US$300 million, amounting to about 39% of
the project cost, would cover the entire foreign exchange cost. Financing
provided by FIRA, participating banks, and the beneficiaries would amount to
34%, 14%, and 13%, respectively (Table 2.2). Participating banks would be
required to finance from their own funds at least 10% of subloans to
low-income producers, 15% to medium-income producers and 20% to commercial
producers. Participating banks would, however, lose their eligibility for

project participation, if the repayment of loans discounted by FIRA is in
excess of 15% in arrears.
2.19      The proposed loan would be made to Nacional Financiera S.A.
(NAFINSA), a Government agency designated to borrow from the Bank, at
standard terms for Mexico.  The proceeds would be transferred to FIRA as
Government equity and the Government would repay the principal amount of the
Bank loan together with interest and other charges.  While this would partly
offset the erosion of FIRA's equity (para. 1.14), FIRA is expected to suffer
an accumulated cash shortfall of US$490 million, during the project period,
mainly the result of US$442 million of foreign indebtedness falling due for
repayment (para. 1.15 and Annex 4, Table 6). During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that it will (a) require participating banks
to finance from their own funds the percentages of subloans shown above;
(b) cause participating banks to lose their eligibility for project
participation where arrears of subloans discounted by FIRA are in excess of
15%; (c) ensure that the proceeds of the Bank loan would be transferred to
FIRA as equity; and (d) provide the necessary resources to offset FIRA's cash
shortfall.
F. Procurement
2.20      Bulk purchasing under ICB would not be feasible, since the
agricultural lending activities would be implemeni.'-d over a four-year period,
be widely distributed geographically, cover a variety of farm and ranch
investment activities, and involve a large number of sub-borrowers. An
adequate selection of machinery, tractors and other agricultural equipment
and inputs is available to sub-borrowers through local and international
suppliers. Tractors up to 125 hp are manufactured in Mexico under franchises
from five major international firms, and adequate competition and
satisfactory service and maintenance facilities are assured by the range of
choice offered and the extensive network of dealers. As in earlier projects,
FIRA would require sub-borrowers to obtain quotations from several sources of
supply, whenever practicable, for goods, civil works and imports of breeding
livestock to be financed under subloans. Vehicles and equipment
(US$1 million) for the demonstration and technical assistance programs would
be procured through local competitive bidding. These procedures are known
and generally acceptable to the Bank. The services of consultants to be
financed under the project would be arranged in accordance with Bank
guidelines.
2.21      Machinery and equipment for agroindustries would be purchased by
private producers or groups of producers through commercial channels. FIRA
would make available to prospective sub-borrowers a list of (a) suppliers of
agroindustrial machinery from Bank member countries and Switzerland; and
(b) the suppliers' agents or representatives in Mexico. FIRA would apply

suitable procedures, to ensure that goods and services procured under the
project are competitive in quality and price and are appropriate for the
needs of the sub-borrowers' enterprises. FIRA would advertise locally and
notify all embassies of Bank member countries and Switzerland of the details
of the agroindustrial component of the project, giving broad particulars of
the types of machinery likely to be required. During negotiations, the
borrower provided assurances that it will cause FIRA to carry out procurement
as described above.
G. Disbursements
2.22      All project subloans would be committed during three and one-half
years, and proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed over approximately
four years. The Bank would reimburse FIRA (a) 63% of its discounts for dis-
bursed project subloans; and (b) 20% of the total cost of the support ser-
vices component. Disbursements for the lending program and civil works for
the demonstration program would be made against corresponding certificates of
expenditures and summary supporting documentation. All additional relevant
documentation would be retained by FIRA and be available for inspection by
the Bank during the course of project supervision missions.
2.23      To facilitate prompt disbursements, the Bank would advance US$30
million into a Special Account, to be opened in US dollars in the Central
Bank. The account would be available for reimbursing FIRA, through NAFINSA,
for the Bank's share of the project cost. The Bank would replenish the
Special Account upon the borrower's request on the basis of the withdrawals
made. As the proposed project would be a continuation of Bank support to
FIRA's lending program, the Bank would retroactively finance subloans dis-
counted by FIRA after full Bank disbursement of the ongoing Seventh Project,
to a maximum of US$20 million, provided that these subloans are in compliance
with the conditions of the proposed project.
2.24      Disbursements against statements of expenditures under FIRA loans
have been satisfactory. The following estimated disbursement schedule
(Table 2.3) by the Bank assumes that the date of effectiveness of the pro-
posed loan would be August 1984. The four-year disbursement period is based
on the Bank's experience with FIRA over seven credit projects. Through six
projects, FIRA has disbursed on time or ahead of appraisal estimates, consis-
tently above the regional average for credit projects: the Fifth Project was
disbursed within 3 1/4 years in accordance with the appraisal estimate, and
the Sixth, within 2 1/2 years, nine months ahead of the estimate. The
Seventh Project, which was appraised for completion within 3 years, is
expected to be completed in 3 1/2 years, with the six-month delay arising
from a temporary non-compliance with the loan agreement, with respect to the
revision of interest rates, over a one-year period. Thus, the estimated
project disbursement period, although shorter than the average for agricul-
tural projects in Mexico, is expected to be realistic.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Execution
3.01      FIRA would be responsible for project execution and would channel
funds through participating public and commercial banks. FIRA has esta-
blished a good reputation for its organization and technical competence
through seven previous Bank-financed projects. The proposed project would
continue to support FIRA's institution building by strengthening its delivery
of technical assistance, development planning, and its monitoring and evalua-
tion capabilities for measuring the impact of its lending.
B. Sublending Procedures
Beneficiary Categories
3.02      Currently, agricultural producers are classified for credit pur-
poses in three groups: (a) low-income producers whose principal income is
derived from farming: their total annual income, including income from other
sources, should be less than 1,000 times the relevant regional minimum daily
rural wage; (b) medium-income producers whose total annual income is between
1,000 and 3,000 times the minimum daily rural wage; and (c) other producers
whose total annual income is in excess of the upper limit for mediumrincome
producers. Minimum daily wages are established for over 100 economic regions
throughout the country and currently range between the equivalent of US$2.60
to US$3.60 equivalent. Using the above income thresholds, the percentage of
farmers included in the low-income producers category is high, embracing
approximately 78Z of the farmers throughout the country. As low-income
producers would continue to receive an interest rate subsidy, It is necessary
to ensure that this category would include only the poorest farmers, so that
the total cost of this subsidy would fall within the Government's proposed
overall limit for agricultural subsidies (para. 1.07). As part of the
general interest rate agreement, a study of beneficiary categories would be
carried out by mid-January 1985, to form the basis for a revised definition
after discussion with the Bank.
Interest Rate Structure
3.03      The Government's interest rate policy for agriculture, which is
designed to spur investments and assist low-income producers, carries a high
level of subsidy. Both the commercial and public banks adhere to the same
on-lending rate structure, differentiated into the three categories by income
groups as outlined above. Currently the on-lending rates for medium- and
long-term investment credit are: (a) low-income producers, 27.5%;
(b) medium-income producers, 362; and (c) commercial producers, 62Z, with a
preferential rate of 45.5% if they produce -basic products.- Where the



- 20 -
credit is short-term, 12 Is added to each of the above rates. Credit for
agroindustrial purposes attracts another 0.52. Agricultural credit rates
became strongly negative in 1982 and 1983, as Inflation was 992 and 81X,
respectively. The 1984 lnflation rote Is projected In the range of 50S to
602 and is expected to decline to about 25X in 1985 and decline further
thereafter. ACF (para. 1.05), which Is the basic standard to which lending
rates are adjusted, rose to about 572 ln 1983. The current level of Interest
rate subsidies, as measured by the difference between ACF and the nosinal
rate charged to sub-borrowers amounts to about 502 for low-income producers;
352 for medium-Income producers and 172 for commerclal producers of 'basic
products", but positive for other commrcial producers. The Governmnt is
aware of the distortions 3nd risks associated with negative real lending
rates, including: (a) artificial escalatlon of the effective demand for
credit; (b) erosion of the capital base of the lending institutions;
(c) misallocation of resources; and (d) increase in the substitution of funds
at the producer and institutlon levels. However, the Covernmnt maintains
that it would be undesirable to raise all agricultural lending rates to the
level where they would be positive in real terms. In periods of high
inflation, this would place an intolerable burden on the c-shflow of
borrowers of term loans and deprive the Government of one of the few
instruments It has available to assist low-income farmers through Interest
rate subsldies.
3.04      The Bank and the Government have negotiated a general Interest rate
agreement relating to ongoing credit-related projects financed by the Bank.
This agreement provides for the gradual adjustmaent of existing Interest rates
so as to reduce subsidies and move towards positive rates. It also provides
for the Covernment and the Bank, after periodic consultatlon, to correct any
future distortlons that may result from unforeseen changes in the economy.
The applicable Interest rates for agricultural credit included ln the overall
agreement would be variable and would progressively increase as a percentage
of ACF as shown in Table 3.1. Wlth the AC? expected to range close to Infla-
tion levels during the project period, and with Interest rates moving
progressively towards positive real levels, FIRA would earn operating profits
sufficient to slow down decapitalization in the short term, and to avoid it
In due course. As a result, a major source of Government subsidy outlays
would progressively disappear.
3.05      As a part of the general Interest rate agreement, the
appropriateness of the ACF as a central reference rate would be reviewed In a
special technical study that will be one of the bases for consultation in
February 1985. During negotiations, the borrower provided assurances that
Interest rates will conform to the rates stipulated in the general agreement
on interest rates, which was recently agreed with the Bank.

2/  Basic products for Bank financed projects would only include maize,
wheat, sorghum, beans and rice.
3/ Rates as a percentage of ACF, or as ACF plus additional points.
3.06      Currently, participating banks are allowed a discount margin
between the on-lending rate to the sub-borrower and that paid to FIRA,
ranging from 2% to 6.5%. This margin, which is currently adequate, would be
reviewed together with the interest rates every six months. During nego-
tiations, the borrower provided assurances that margins allowed to the parti-
cipating banks will be discussed and agreed with the Bank before revision.
Subloan Appraisal and Supervision
3.07      Over the years, FIRA has developed sound subloan appraisal and
supervision procedures (Annex 4, para. 3).  Under present F''RA procedures,
participating bank technicians have the authority to approve subloans not
exceeding Mex$ 5 million (US$31,250), with _ small number of bank technicians
(60 as of December 1983) authorized to approve up to Mex$ 10 million
(US$62,500). Subloans above these limits are appraised in consultation with
FIRA technicians and require the further approval of (a) FIRA's State
Representative, for subloans ranging from Mex$ 10-25 million (US$156,250);
(b) FIRA's Regional Representative, for subloans from Mex$ 25-50 million
(US$312,500); (c) FIRA's Director General, for subloans from Mex$ 50-60
million (US$375,000); and (d) FIRA's Technical Committee, for subloans in
excess of Mex$ 60 million (US$375,000).
3.08      Under the proposed project, FIRA would be required to obtain prior
approval from the Bank for project subloans in excess of US$800,000 equiva-
lent, which also applies to individual subloans resulting from group acti-
vity. No subloan would be made for on-farm investment if the amount of the
proposed subloan, together with the aggregate amount outstanding under
previous FIRA-financed subloans to such a borrower, exceed Mex$ 30 million
(US$187,500). FIRA's recently introduced Operating Regulations and



- 22 -
Procedures Manual provides the necessary guidelines (p3ra. 1.20). During
negotiations, the borrower provided assurances that it will cause FIRA to
adhere to the above subloan appraisal and supervision procedures.
Reporting Requirements
3.09      FIRA has developed an efficient system of timely reporting to the
Bank. Quarterly progress reports summarizing project performance, subloan
disbursements by categories (beneficiaries, principal activities and subloan
size) and FIRA rediscounts are routinely submitted to the Bank no later than
60 days after the end of each quarter. Detailed reports (which include sub-
project costs, subloan commitments and disbursements by categories; lending
by activities and regions; type and number of beneficiaries; Bank partici-
pation in subloan financing; FIRA rediscount and investment breakdown of sub-
loans by activities) are prepared semiannually and submitted to the Bank no
later than three months after the end of each six-month period. FIRA also
sends to the Bank annually: (a) a summary of reports submitted to it by the
participating banks, showing a summary of subloans outstanding, amounts due
for repayment and overdue payments on outstanding subloans; (b) a summary
statement of changes in its own staffing on an overall and regional basis;
Cc) a statement on the progress of its training programs and a summary of the
activities carried out on its demonstration farns; (d) a review of the scope
and effectiveness of the technical assistance activities to low- and
mediumrincome producers financed through FEGA; and (e) the status of tech-
nical staffing in participating banks. During negotiations, the borrower
provided assurances that it will cause FIRA (a) to continue to adhere to Bank
reporting requirements; and (b) to submit a Project Completion Report
prepared in accordance with Bank guidelines within 12 months of the Closing
Date of the loan.
C. Accounts and Auditing
3.10      FIRA has consistently presented timely annual audited accounts.
The accounting system of FIRA trust funds is satisfactory. FIRA would main-
tain separate project records, as established for the ongoing project (Loan
1891-ME). FIRA's accounts have been audited during recent years by external
auditors, and all audit reports of its accounts have been unqualified. In
addition, the Bank of Mexico's internal audit department periodically reviews
FLRA's financial activities and accounts.  An audit, satisfactory to the
Bank, would be made of the accounts, statements of expenditures (SOEs) sub-
mitted to the Bank, and financial statements of FIRA for each fiscal year.
An audit of the Special Account maintained by the Central Bank (para. 2.23)
would also be carried out. The audits would be in accordance with sound
auditing principles consistently applied by independent and qualified
auditors appointed by the Controller General and the Bank of Mexico.
Certified copies of the statements audited, together with the report of the
auditors, which would also comment on the SOEs, would be submitted to the
Bank no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year. Adequate
accounts and records would also be maintained within all the participating
banks so as to identify all transactions pertaining to FIRA xediscounted



- 23 -
subloans. Bank supervision missions would have access to such accounts and
any other documents pertaining to lending operations within the project.
During negotiations the borrower provided assurances that FIRA will adhere to
the Bank's accounting and auditing guidelines.
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Illustrative Investment Plans
4.01      Subloans to individual farmers, farmer groups and cooperatives
would be made for a wide range of activities for crops, livestock, and agro-
industry, and would be similar to those made under previous projects. FIRA
has a favorable record of evaluating and supporting subloans; the completion
report of the Fifth and Sixth Projects concluded that such lending increased
production and farm income, and supported low-income producers to upgrade
their farming operations. Financial rates of return for crops, calculated
from the monitoring data, ranged from 18% to 30%, whereas for livestock
enterprises, they ranged from 13% to 56%. Six investment plans represen-
tative of FIRA's lending have been selected to illustrate the development
concept, technical change, and financial and economic results. Table 4.1
summarizes the financial and economic results of each investment plan, which
are further detailed in Annex 5, Tables 1-6.
4.02      The underlying assumptions used in estimating the economic results
from the project are as follows: Ca) agricultural production figures are
derived from representative farm operations; (b) production costs are priced
at local 1984 constant market prices; and (c) economic prices are derived
from estimates of border prices for commodities produced by farmers, adjusted
to farm-gate level, while prevailing farm-gate prices were used for other
products (non-tradables). The lifetime of the investment in each model is
assumed to be 15 years.
B. Project Benefits
4.03      It is projected that about 105,000 families, or about 580,000 bene-
ficiaries, would benefit directly from the project. Secondary benefits
would also accrue from processing and agricultural service activities. At
full development, it is estimated that, based on previous experience,
incremental production of basic crops (maize, beans, wheat, rice and sorghum)
would increase by about 0.9 million metric tons annually; cotton, soybeans,
and safflower by 100,000 tons; milk by 16 million liters, beef and pork by
120,000 tons, and eggs by 110,000 tons. The impact on yields of key
commodities at the farm level estimated below (Table 4.2), approximate the
countrywide trends shown in the completion report for the Fifth and Sixth
Projects.

4.04      The incremental production of basic crops alone would amount to
foreign exchange savings of about US$140 million per annum at full deve-
lopment. Likewise, increased production of export crops would contribute to
annual foreign exchange earnings in excess of the above savings on incre-
mental basic crops. As indicated in Table 4.1, the project would cause an
increase of net cash income to beneficiaries. Most investment plans are
expected to have a financial rate of return in the range of 18% to 35%, with
economic rates of return ranging from 191 to over 100%. Economic rates of
return are higher for several products because domestic producer prices are
below border price levels. This is consistent with findings of the
completion reports of the Fifth and Sixth Credit Projects.
4.05      The project woul' continue institution building.  Strengthening
FIRA's analytical and medium- and long-term planning capabilities would allow
a better allocation of investment resources over the longer term. Expanded
technical assistance would emphasize the promotion and adoption by farmers of
available improved technologies. Further support to the Monitoring and
Evaluation Division would increase FIRA's capabilities to measure impact
needs, including the adoption rate of available technology.



- 26 -
C. Project Risks
4.06      Since FIRA is a reasonably efficient and mature institution, the
project presents no special risk in terms of the technical and financial
soundness of various investment opportunities that would be financed under
the program. The main risk would be that political pressures would impede
progress in eliminating interest rate subsidies, especially in case of a
resurgence of inflation causing a further deterioration of FIRA's financial
position, a continued drain on Government budget resources, and a continued
misallocation of production factors. However, the Government gave firm
assurances that it will adhere to the general interest rate agreement
(para. 3.04), which significantly reduces these risks.
V. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations the borrower provided assurances that:
(a) (i) the procedures to determine incremental short-term lending
will be adhered to; and (ii) at least 60% of the project
financed short-term loans will be allocated to low-income
producers (para. 2.08);
(b) (i) participating banks will finance from their own funds the
percentages of subloans outlined in para. 2.18; (ii) partici-
pating banks will lose their eligibility for project partici-
pation where arrears of subloans discounted by FIRA are in
excess of 15%; (iii) the proceeds of the Bank loan will be
transferred to FIRA as equity; and (iv) the Government will
provide the necessary resources to offset FIRA's cash shortfall
(paras. 2.18 and 2.19);
(c) FIRA will carry out procurement as described in paras. 2.20 and
2.21;
(d) interest rates will conform to the rates stipulated in the
General Agreement on Interest Rates which was recently agreed
with the Bank (para. 3.05);
(e) margins allowed to the participating banks will be discussed
and agreed with the Bank before revisions (para 3.06);
(f) FIRA will follow the subloan appraisal and supervision proce-
dures outlined in paras. 3.07 to 3.08.



- 27 -
(g) FIRA will (i) adhere to Bank reporting requirements; and
(ii) submit a Project Completion Report prepared in accordance
with Bank guidelines within 12 months of the Closing Date of
the loan (para. 3.09); and
(h) FIRA will adhere to the Bank accounting and auditing guidelines
as outlined in para. 3.10.
5.03      With above assurances, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$300 million in standard terms and conditions prevailing at the
time of Board presentation.

MEXICO
EIGHTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Trust Funds (FIRA)
1.        FIRA's organization and management, planning and programming,
training and demonstration, and monitoring and evaluation are discussed
below.
Organization and Management
2.        The Bank of Mexico is the trustee of the Government for the three
trust funds, which are integrated for management and accounting purposes, and
administered as FIRA. Two technical committees, one for FONDO and FEFA and
the other for FEGA, are the governing bodies of the funds. These are
composed of ten members, and each is headed by a senior official of the
Ministry of Finance. FIRA is managed by a General Director, who is the
Fiduciary Delegate, a Sub-Director General, and assisted by five
sub-directors who are in charge of the following departments: Programming
and Operations of Credit; Finance; Project Evaluations and Technical
Assistance; Field Office Systems; and Administration and Control. FIRA
has, in addition to the Central Office in Mexico City, nine regional offices,
38 state offices, 90 agency offices and a total staff of about 1,700, of whom
71% are located in the field. On recommendation of the Bank under the
ongoing Seventh Credit Project, FIRA decentralized decision
making-particularly with respect to budgeting, program planning and
execution-to regional and state levels.  It also expanded the nationalized
banks' facilities for providing technical assistance to their clients. The
role of the FIRA regional technicians changed, whereby there is (a) less
emphasis on their direct involvement in providing technical assistance to
borrowers; and (b) more emphasis on their role of assisting technicians from
participating banks in identifying and organizing farmer groups. Where
necessary, the regional technicians provide training and technical back-up to
these technicians.
3.        To facilitate improved control and faster subloan processing, FIRA
introduced revision panels (-Mesa de Apoyo'), located in each region for
on-the-spot reviews of subloan documentation submitted by participating banks
for discount. Subloans discounted, which are processed through the local
Bank of Mexico branch, are summarized and forwarded to its headquarters for
overall review, processing and control.
Planning and Programming
4.        FIRA has made significant strides in streamlining, strengthening
and decentralizing its planning and programming efforts. The role of the
field offices has increased, giving the regional offices greater
responsibility in the formulation, implementation and control of its
investment programs. FIRA has prepared a detailed framework, including
guidelines, for carrying out credit demand analysis by products and areas,



- 32 -
Annex 4
Page 2 of 2
and for preparing lending programs by principal activities. Training has
been given to personnel at the field level, especially in the area of credit
analysis using computer programs and on the format for analyzing and
aggregating data for the preparation of the annual investment program.
However, it requires further strengthening in medium- and long-term
development planning. Every July, FIRA prepares a tentative investment
program, based on previous experience, the Government's policies and
development targets, and availability of resources. In September, this
information is sent to the regional and state offices for modification and
adjustment and returned to the central office for finalizLtion and approval
by the Technical Committee. Quarterly and annual reports are prepared by the
regional offices to evaluate the results on a continuous basis, and the
findings are reported to the central office and the Technical Committee.
Training and Demonstration
5.        FIRA operates a well-established system of 88 training and
demonstration farms, and 231 centers specializing in a wide range of
agricultural activities including: basic crops, milk, forage, fruits, beef,
small animals, irrigation and agroindustry. In recent years there has been
good coordination between FIRA and the Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources (SARH) for research and extension services. In 1983, about 100
SARR extension staff received training on these units, and the quality of the
research program is good. In addition, FIRA operates an intensive training
program for its staff, the technical staff of participating banks and
farmers. In 1983, a total of 712 courses were offered to about 8,500
participants, 3,500 of whom were reported to be low-income producers.
Additionally, FIRA complements the participating banks in providing direct
technical assistance to low-income producers. Its staff provides technical
support to the participating banks in preparing, evaluating and supervising
the farm development program of subloan beneficiaries.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.        The Monitoring and Evaluation Division of FIRA is organized in
three offices: the Office of Credit Impact Evaluation, the Office of
Internal Systems Analysis, and the Office of Information. The current
methodology (Registros Continuos), using a sample of 500 subprojects financed
by Bank and IDB loans, collected subproject information on a continuous basis
for a six-year period ending in December 1983. This enabled FIRA to measure
the adequacy of its technical services, the financial results of its lending
program, and the socio-economic impact of its lending. Beginning in 1984,
FIRA will introduce a new sample of about 1,000 subprojects, representative
of FIRA's total lending program. While the basic methodology will remain
unchanged, the technique for gathering and computing information will be
simplified and the results will be more suitably tailored to the users of the
information.

Illustrative Investment Plans
1.        The illustrative farm investment plans, with cash flows given in
Tables 1-6, are based on FIRA's current lending experience. The models in
the demonstration program would follow the principles laid out in para. 4.01
using the combined experience of FIRA demonstration centers, National Agri-
cultural Research Institute and National Livestock Research Institute re-
search stations.
Investment Plan No. 1: Rainfed Annual Crops Farm (165 ha)
2.        Plan No. 1 represents a typical farming system in the rainfed areas
of the temperate central states, with about eight beneficiaries per subloan,
and about 155 ha of the 165 ha of the cropland under maize, beans and
sorghum. Under the development program the crop mix would not change but the
productivity of key crops, would increase through land clearing, levelling,
subsoiling and generally improved land preparation and cultivation practices
with better control of pests and diseases, and use of fertilizer. The total
investment cost is estimated at about US$30,000 of which machinery and equip-
ment comprises 92%, buildings and installation 7%, and land preparation 1%.
Machinery and equipment includes a tractor (70-80 hp) equipped with a set of
implements to permit clearing of the 10 ha of new land, subsoiling, timely
land preparation and cultivation. The long-term loan reflects a repayment
period of seven years with no grace period.
3.        The proposed investment plan is expected to raise the cropping
intensity from 94% to 100% with no change in the cropping pattern. At full
development in year 4 of the plan, crop yields would increase as follows:
maize 1.7-2.4 tons/ha; sorghum 2.8-3.2 tons/ha; and beans 0.8-1.1 tons/ha.
The labor requirement is expected to increase from about 1,530 man-days to
about 1,630 man-days per annum at full development, and net farm income would
increase from about US$5,200 (before the project) to about US$13,600 at full
development (Annex 5, Table 1). The financial rate of return is estimated at
23%, and the economic rate of return at 27%.
Investment Plan No. 2: Irrigated Annual Crops Farm (130 ha)
4.        Investment Plan No. 2 depicts a 130 ha farm unit with about seven
beneficiary families located in arid or semi-arid irrigated regions of the
northwest of Mexico. Under present conditions the cropping pattern includes
cotton, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, beans and safflower. The development
program calls for a small increase in the total cropped area from 170 ha to



- 41 -
Annex 5
Page 2 of 4
174 ha per year with productivity increases being derived through better land
preparation techniques and more effective use of inputs. The total invest-
ment cost is estimated at about US$43,600, of which machinery and equipment
comprises 89%, and land improvement, buildings and other installations, 11X.
Machinery and equipment would include a tractor (70-80 hp) equipped with a
set of implements to permit land clearing on 4 ha as well as to allow effi-
cient and timely land preparation and cultivation. An input storage and
tractor/implement shed would be constructed and a small water pump and elec-
trical lines would be installed.
5.        The proposed development plan is expected to raise the cropping
intensity on the non-cotton area from 135% to about 140%, but the cropping
pattern would not change. At full development in year 4 of the plan, crop
yields would increase from present levels as follows: cotton 2.6-3.5
tons/ha; wheat 4.5-5.2 tons/ha; sorghum 5.0-6.0 tons/ha; soybeans 2.3-2.7
tons/ha; beans 1.5-1.8 tons/ha; and safflower 1.9-2.2 tons/ha. Total labor
requirements are expected to increase from present levels of about 2,550
man-days to about 2,720 man-days per annum, and net farm income would in-
crease from US$23,500 to about US$38,600 at full development (Annex 5,
Table 2). The financial rate of return is estimated at about 31% and the
economic rate of return at 54%.
Investment Plan No. 3: Beef Ranch (4,200 ha)
6.        Investment Plan No. 3 illustrates the prevailing beef production
system in the arid or semi-arid regions of the northwest of Mexico with about
two beneficiaries per subloan. It represents an extensive pasture operation
in a region which traditionally has been an exporter of feeder cattle to
other regions of the humid tropics of the Gulf States of Mexico and also to
the USA. Fattening operations do, however, exist in large numbers in the
region. Consequently, the production plan includes pasture improvement on
about 85 ha to be sown to Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), thereby increas-
ing the carrying capacity by subdivisional fencing, and purchase of addi-
tional cattle. The total investment cost is estimated at about US$80,800 of
which livestock comprises about 39%; construction and installations 22%;
pasture establishment 21%; and machinery, equipment and miscellaneous 18%.
Construction and installations include storage, fencing, cattle handling
facilities and water facilities. The long-term loan has a repayment period
of nine years with one year of grace.
7.       In the development program, the carrying capacity of the entire
ranch would be increased from current levels of 17.5 to 11.3 ha per animal
unit, which would include an increase in the number of breeding cows from 150
to 220 head, through the purchase of in-calf heifers. In addition, in order
to utilize the increased carrying capacity, steers would be purchased
annually for fattening. Through better herd management and health



- 42 -
Annex 5
Page 3 of 4
practices, production coefficients are expected to improve as follows:
calving percentages would increase from levels of 50% up to 60%; cow culling
rates would increase from levels of 10% to 15%; and sales of liveweight
cattle would increase from 22.4 tons to 43.4 tons per year at full develop-
ment in year 6. It is also assumed that the farming system would continue to
employ two permanent family members and that temporary labor would increase
from current levels of about 430 man-days up to 670 man-days per annum. Net
farm income is expected to increase from current levels at about US$20,900 up
to about US$37,900 (Annex 5, Table 3). The financial rate of return is
estimated at 18%, and the economic rate of return at 22%.
Investment Plan No. 4: Dual-Purpose Milk Production (490 ha)
8.        The dual-purpose livestock plan ts based on an existing ejido
operation in the tropics of the Gulf of Mexico with natural pastures of
African Star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) and about 12 beneficiaries per
subloan. In addition to improving management and fertilization of existing
pastures, about 15 ha of Brachiaria decumbens pasture would be established,
and a rotational system of grazing of all pastures, with very limited supple-
mentation of concentrates during the dry winter season would become the
feeding system. The essence of the program would be to utilize appropriate
low cost technology including improved herd management, breeding programs
(mostly Brown Swiss x Zebu breeds), health care, pasture fertilization and
rotation and purchase of steers during the peak grass season to maximize
pasture productivity. The total investment is estimated at about US$54,700
of which livestock comprises 51%; construction 17%; pasture establishment on
15 ha 10%; and purchase of machinery and equipment and miscellaneous items
22%. Construction would include a milking shed, subdivisional fencing, and
cattle handling and water facilities.
9.        As a result of these investments, pasture feed quality is expected
to improve and the carrying capacity is expected to increase from about
1.0 to about 1.5 animal units per ha and the number of breeding cows from 140
to 205, through the purchase of in-calf heifers. As indicated above, in
order to utili a the improved carrying capacity, steers would be purchased
(an additional 100 in years 1-4) to be fattened primarily from grass. Under
improved conditions and with technical assistance provided by FIRA, (a) milk
yield per lactation is expected to increase from current levels of about
450 liters to 800 liters with total milk sales increasing from 45,000 liters
to about 145,000 liters per year by full development; and (b) the calving
percentage is expected to increase from 60% to 70% and sales of steers are
expected to increase from about 210 per year to about 370 per year. It is
also assumed that the number of full time staff would increase from seven to
eleven persons, including milking personnel and cattlemen. The net farm
income is expected to increase from about US$32,500 to US$74,700 (Annex 5,
Table 4) and the value of the herd would increase about 60% from its

Page 4 of 4
predevelopment value. The long-term loan reflects a grace period of two
years and a repayment period of five years. The financial rate of return is
estimated at 35% and the economic rate of return at 19% because of the rela-
tively high value of milk in Mexico compared to border prices.
Investment Plan No. 5: Commercial Egg Production (260,000 birds)
10.       Investment Plan No. 5 illustrates a typical medium- to large-scale
egg unit in the temperate areas of the central plateau of Mexico. The
260,000 bird operation would be a high technology, high feed input operation
with technical coefficients of: 66% of birds in production at any time;
14.2 kg of eggs produced per bird per year; 12% mortality and culling during
the key production cycle; and a feed conversion ratio of 2.8:1 kg of egg.
Investments would toLa' about US$230,000 of which: 83% would cover the con-
struction and equipping of six layer sheds; 11% would cover equipment and
vehicles; and 6X would be general work.
11.       With the investment, the net farm income would reach about
US$309,700 (Annex 5, Table 5), labor demand about 19,700 man-days per annum,
and total egg production per year about 5,000 tons by full development. The
demand for eggs in key urban areas is high; however, depending on the price
structure some of the production of this unit may end up being exported to
the USA. The subloan has a repayment period of four years, with no grace
peri3d, and the financial rate of return is estimated at about 35% and the
economic rate of return at over 100%.
Investment Plan No. 6: Feedmill
12.       Investment Plan No. 6 consists of a livestock feedmill, constructed
to support either a cattle or poultry opezation. The feedmill would service
the needs of an association of about 11 producers at an output of about
20 ton/hour (17,000 tons per year) and would compound feed at cost to its
members who would use, as far as possible, ingredients from their own farms.
For the purposes of the investment plan, ingredients have been valued at
market value (e.g., sorghum at US$212 per ton) and the compound feed has been
valued at its value in the market place (US$203 per ton). The ratio would be
changed regularly to reflect the availability of feed ingredients in order to
ensure a least cost formulation. Non-members would be required to pay the
full commercial cost of compounded feed.
13.       The investment would consist of civil works (mill area of 2,000 m2
and silo construction), machinery and equipment (20 tons/hr capacity; 4 metal
silos of 5,000 ton capacity each), and electricity generation and transport
equipment. The total investment cost is estimated at about US$287,000
(Annex 5, Table 6), and the long-term loan reflects a repayment period of
four years. The financial rate of return is estimated at about 26% and the
economic rate of return at about 28%.
