1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

The Vietnam Customs Modernization Project (VCMP) was appraised in April, 2005. Over the previous
decade, GDP grew at more than 6.5 percent per year on average, and the poverty rate halved. Exports
were a key driver of growth, rising by over 25 percent per year at that time. The Government of Vietnam
(GoV) had made progress on a wide-ranging reform program which rested on three main pillars: (i)
furthering the transition to a market economy; (ii) socially equitable and environmentally sustainable
growth; and (iii) building modern governance. Transitioning to a market economy was tied to Vietnam‟s
integration with the world economy and entailed significant trade liberalization and a greater role for
private economic activity. Towards its goal of building a modern system of governance, GoV released in
September, 2001 a Master Plan for Public Administration Reform (PAR) in which the reform of Customs
was afforded a high priority. Vietnam Customs Administration was considered slow, unresponsive and
vulnerable to corruption. The challenge for the Customs Administration in this context was to change
significantly, shifting its mindset from a culture of domestic protection and control of all transactions,
aggravated by an over-reliance on bureaucratic systems and procedures, to one that would facilitate
foreign trade and promote private sector development.

A Customs Law was passed by the National Assembly in June, 2001, and was followed by regulations
dealing with the organizational structure of the General Department of Vietnam Customs (GDVC) of the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) and various customs procedures. GDVC however lacked a long-term reform
and modernization vision with clear strategic goals and enabling resources. Subsequently GDVC
prepared a Strategic Plan for Customs Reform and Modernization for 2004-06 but was not successful in
fully implementing the plan.

The rationale for Bank involvement derived from its program of support for the Comprehensive Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). Among other things, the program was intended to foster
Vietnam‟s trade integration and in particular accession to the WTO. VCMP was seen as timely and to fit
neatly with the CPRGS higher development objectives.

1.2     Original Project Development Objective and Key Indicators

The VCMP higher level Project Development Objective (PDO) was to: “facilitate trade, increase revenue
collection, improve the production of foreign trade statistics, and enhance community protection and
national security by improving the effectiveness, efficiency, accountability and transparency of the
Customs Administration. In addition, the project was to be a key factor in facilitating Vietnam‟s accession
to the WTO and securing the gains from greater integration into the world trading system?. VCMP was
expected to meet its higher level development objective through the following intermediate objectives: (i)
introducing modern Customs systems and procedures based on internationally agreed standards and best
practice; (ii) improving the organizational structure and strengthening the human, financial and physical
resource capacity of the GDVC; and (iii) introducing appropriate information and communication
technology to improve effectiveness, increase transparency and lower transaction costs. The system level
key performance indicators of the PDO and the intermediate output indicators are detailed in Section F of
the Data Sheet and monitoring arrangements are shown in Annex 6, Tables 6.1 and 6.2 respectively.
There were no formal changes to the PDO or Key Performance Indicators during the project.

1.3    Main Beneficiaries

The direct beneficiary of the project was the GDVC of the MoF. At the time of appraisal GDVC
comprised a central office with 11 departments, 33 regional offices and 184 branch offices and sections
nationwide, currently employing over 8,000 staff. Reform of Customs had commenced in 2001 and was
expected to lead to: (a) modernization of GDVC to meet its obligations as a contracting party to the
Revised Kyoto Convention on Harmonization and Simplification of Customs Practices of World Customs
Organization (WCO) due to become effective in 2007; and (b) adoption of a range of agreed international
standards and good practice approaches to modern customs administration.

1.4    Original Components

Component 1: Customs Systems and Procedures ($4.2 million or 5% of project costs). Component 1
was designed to assist the GDVC introduce a range of modern systems and procedures that would reduce
clearance times, enhance transparency and predictability for traders, and lower transaction costs.
Specifically, it was to support the development and implementation of: (i) a modern, transparent and
accessible legal framework; (ii) modern procedures such as risk management and post clearance audit;
and (iii) harmonized and simplified business processes based on international standards such as the
WCO‟s Revised Kyoto Convention. The component also aimed to improve the level of compliance
through a more dynamic approach to Customs enforcement in reducing informal trade and commercial
fraud through an enhanced compliance and enforcement infrastructure based on the effective use of
intelligence and improved research and analysis capabilities. The linkage of the component and
subcomponents to the PDO are summarized in Table 1 below.

Component 2: Organizational Restructuring and Management ($26.8 million or 35%). Component 2
supported rationalization of the organizational structure of Customs. It included restructuring at the
headquarters, regional and branch level offices, designed to strengthen managerial control, improve
decision making and provide an appropriate focus on a range of important „value added‟ functions,
including strengthening the strategic planning capacity of the GDVC and its performance management
and monitoring systems; enhancing resource management capacity; improving the capacity of the
Customs Training Academy; and launching a comprehensive integrity/anti-corruption action program.
This component also provided for acquisition of a quantity of non-intrusive detection equipment and for
the refurbishment of existing facilities to fit the new business approach and accommodate ICT equipment.

Component 3: Information and Communication Technology ($41.4 million or 53%) Component 3 was
designed to provide the GDVC with a modern ICT environment and physical infrastructure, including: (i)
development and implementation of a comprehensive and modern Customs Information System that
would support the redesigned Customs processes, the collection of data for management, planning and
statistics purposes, and improved access to information; (ii) the procurement of hardware and
infrastructure development necessary to the rollout of the new system; (iii) the funding of
telecommunications equipment and infrastructure; (iv) support for the nationwide system rollout and the
training of customs officials at all levels; and (v) measures to improve the capacity of GDVC to manage
the new system and ICT infrastructure.

Component 4: Project Management Support ($4.6 million or 6%). Component 4 provided support to the
Project Management Unit (PMU) and project-related coordination bodies including the Customs
Modernization Department. The component was intended to ensure that adequate technical support was
provided to the PMU during all stages of project implementation.

Annex 2 provides a table that shows the status of various project components at the time ICR was being
prepared.

1.5     Revised Components and Reasons for Cancellation

At the Borrower‟s request in December 2010, VCMP was terminated and the entire project was cancelled,
including the remaining physical subcomponents under Components 2 and 3. As a result, in view of the
considerable knowledge transfer and capacity building achieved by the completed elements, VCMP was
transformed in effect into a technical assistance project focused on Components 1 and 2 and preparations
for Component 3. At the project‟s termination, 97 percent of the credit proceeds remained unutilized
although preparation for the cancelled infrastructure investment phase was preceded by an extensive and
largely successful institutional development phase, leading to significant changes in the management and
operational procedures used by GDVC. Under the project design, these were to be strengthened and
consolidated by implementation of the proposed ICT system.

Prior to the project‟s cancellation, several options had been explored. For example, following a Mid-Term
Review in September, 2010 the GDVC considered the possibility of simplifying and restructuring VCMP,
together with an extension of three years. At that time about one half of the technical assistance program
had been completed although only 3 percent of the Credit proceeds had been utilized. Restructuring
appeared feasible: (i) because GDVC no longer wished to use the Credit proceeds for the remaining
technical assistance which it felt capable of undertaking with its own resources; and more importantly, (ii)
because the preparation of bidding documents for ICT system and equipment procurement (estimated to
require about 75 percent of the credit proceeds) was almost complete 1.

The reasons for cancelation of VCMP were many fold. First, GDVC wanted to have more certainty of
deploying the ICT system before 2015, and had misgivings about: (i) managing the ICT system
procurement and implementation process following the Bank‟s procurement procedures without incurring
further delays, and (ii) how to adequately support the ongoing operation and maintenance of the ICT
system thereafter (particularly given the widening of functionality to support the national single window
initiative).

Second, in late 2010 the Standing Committee of the National Assembly voted to allow certain revenue
collecting agencies, including GDVC, the incentive to retain 1.9 percent of their total tax collection to be
used for routine and capital expenditures for a period of 5 years with a special allocation dedicated solely
to finance modernization efforts. MoF advised that based on 2010 estimates the proportion to be retained
for modernization purposes was approximately $50 million. In light of such additional significant
budgetary resources the GDVC wanted to seek an alternative solution that would: (a) provide a fast-track
to deliver the required ICT infrastructure and make suitable arrangements for its maintenance and further
development; (b) allow GDVC to seek bilateral assistance for any remaining technical assistance needs
via established bilateral relationships with regional Customs administrations; and (c) not entail further
delay in use of the undisbursed credit funds and allow them to be released for other GoV‟s priority
development purposes. A bilateral agreement on Japanese assistance to develop an IT system for
Vietnam Customs has since been arranged between the GoV and Japan Customs.

The termination of the project was therefore due to the erosion of GDVC‟s confidence in completing the
infrastructure investment within an acceptable time frame employing Bank‟s procurement policies, (b) the
need for additional capacity to support a National Single Window function consequent to Vietnam‟s
ratification of the ASEAN Single Window Agreement in 2007; (c) the emergence of funding

 Bidding documents (BDs) for mobile scanning equipment valued at about $10 million had been cleared by the
Bank and draft BDs for the ICT system package valued at about $45 million were expected to be submitted in
January 2011.

                                                     3
arrangements allowing GDVC to consider alternative self-financed project; and (d) the GDVC‟s
assessment that long term support and maintenance was necessary post implementation and that their
needs might best be served under a bilateral cooperation agreement with a regional Customs partner.

The Borrower gave notice on December 7, 2010 of a forthcoming request for cancellation of the
undisbursed credit hence terminating the project prior to the credit closing date of June 30, 2011.
Component 3 concerning the ICT infrastructure and parts of Component 2 concerning other equipment
and works subcomponents together with various technical assistance subcomponents (as highlighted in
Table 1 above) were cancelled. The total final project cost was about US$ 3.2 million of which the
disbursed IDA credit was about US$ 2.2 million equivalent and an amount of about SDR 44.1 million
(US$ 69.4 million equivalent at current exchange rates) would be returned to the Vietnam country
program IDA allocation pool.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The VCMP was approved by the Bank Board on March 2, 2006. Although VCMP was fundamentally
concerned with institutional development, about two thirds of the project estimated cost was related to
procurement of software, hardware and installation for a national ICT system infrastructure. A Specific
Investment Loan (SIL) instrument was adopted as the implementation vehicle. With the assistance of a
PHRD grant (TF053144, US$ 996,500), project preparation through to appraisal in April, 2005 was
completed in 12 months, although no resettlement or environmental safeguard issues were involved 2.
Considerable preparation assistance was also provided by the Bank in addition to the PHRD grant
supervision, including: (i) study tours by GDVC staff to one past and one current, large-scale Bank
financed customs modernization project elsewhere in the world; and (ii) all senior GDVC management
team attending a Bank-designed fully residential Senior Management development program focused on
reform and modernization planning and implementation for customs with content based on the WCO‟s
Customs Capacity Building Framework.

The PHRD grant was effective in: (a) analyzing GDVC‟s institutional capacity and needs, and (b)
preparing draft ToRs and related documents to assist GDVC with early procurement activities; (c)
transferring knowledge of customs modernization and project management, thereby assisting the
Beneficiary in design and preparation of the project components as well as through implementation
capacity building. Significant attention was paid in the project design to lessons from these sources,
which emphasized the importance of: (a) a conducive policy environment; (b) an accurate diagnosis of
modernization needs; (c) upstream capacity enhancement; (d) instruments to make reform measurable; (e)
enhanced cooperation among donors; (f) adequate human and financial resources; and (g) adequate
private sector participation. Further lessons were drawn from the closed Vietnam Payments System and
Banking Reform Project (FY96) concerned also with major institutional reform and complex ICT system
procurement, and successfully completed after an often-times problematic 8-year implementation period.
Other source of lessons learned comes from an on-going Public Finance Management Reform Project
with a major Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS). TABMIS was approved
by the Board in May, 2003, and was expected to close in August, 2008. But it was extended for the first
time until August, 2011 and for the second time with additional financing until February, 2013.

  The elapsed time between PCN and Board Presentation for VCMP was 20 months compared to the normative
average of 28.6 months for other FY06-approved investment operations (6 operations, not including PRSC V and
VCMP) and the Vietnam portfolio FY94-06 lifetime average of 27.2 months (covering 54 operations approved from
FY94 through FY06, not including quick disbursing operations).

                                                     4
2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation

The pertinent external factors affecting implementation progress were as follows:

(i)     Implementation Planning

The VCMP was the second largest customs modernization project assisted by the Bank to date, and was
relatively complex in scope and content. The Borrower‟s Project Implementation Plan (PIP) at appraisal
proved excessively ambitious in terms of scope as well as the sequencing and timing of procurement. In
aggregate, the project design required the procurement of some 52 packages over 12 months and their
implementation over 54 months. In addition, the Borrower agreed to include in the Credit Agreement a
large number of covenants concerning delivery of key outputs. It is worth noting that the implementation
period for investment operations in the Bank‟s Vietnam portfolio is about 8 years, including extensions.
The appraisal team estimated that a reasonable implementation time for VCMP would have been 7 years
but the Borrower felt it was able to manage a four-and-a-half-year schedule in anticipation of a closing
date extension being granted if necessary.

The PIP was eventually amended in 2007 following discussions with the second Bank supervision
mission. The process of preparation of the ICT system bidding documents and the preceding re-
engineering of Customs business processes (BPR), as well as the earlier efforts in developing the terms of
reference for these tasks, were excessively prolonged but provided important knowledge transfer
opportunities that increased GDVC‟s capacity to undertake other parallel modernization activities as well
as underpinning its forthcoming efforts to procure a suitable ICT system. Mirroring the PIP
implementation schedule was the disbursement schedule which skewed disbursement of major
expenditures towards the latter stages of the project.

(ii)    Ownership and Leadership

The VCMP concept and content were fully adopted by GDVC‟s senior management through exposure to
international practices by study tours and training by experienced leaders of modernized customs
administrations, as well as the technical assistance afforded by the PHRD grant. However, as the
increasingly detailed process of finalizing terms of reference, reviewing policy recommendations, and
preparing bidding documents became stalled through the need to obtain full agreement of all internal
stakeholders, particularly those from highly technically complex areas of Customs operations. The
creation of a high-level, Customs Reform and Modernization Committee (later becoming an established
department of GDVC), responsible for overall planning and coordination of institutional change including
VCMP activities, was a positive step but poor coordination mechanisms between PMU and the functional
departments of GDVC severely hindered the decision making process and in some cases the existence of
the Customs Reform and Modernization Department simply presented another layer of approval and
decision making.

(iii)   Project Management Organization and Capacity

At the time of project effectiveness, the GDVC had some experience in implementation of major capital
works but none in Bank requirements and procedures. The GDVC had the resources and delegated
authority but initially not the experience nor the flexibility to manage the exigencies of a complex
institutional development and investment project. The PMU was formed in accordance with statutory
requirements as a „stand alone‟, enclave unit and as such was separated from the day-to-day functions of
GDVC. Due to fruitless efforts to recruit a qualified international advisor, technical capacity for various
assignments was often lacking. Throughout the project, Bank staff advocated close cooperation and

                                                    5
partial integration of the PMU with key GDVC departments, such as its Customs Modernization
Department responsible for planning and coordinating overall GDVC institutional change, and its ICT
unit which was expected to shoulder responsibility for endorsing the ICT procurement decisions and
providing downstream operation and maintenance of the system to be established by the project. In
practice cooperation was uneven, consensus based decision making processes were cumbersome, and the
PMU lacked authority to unilaterally make procurement decisions relevant to substantive policy changes.

Initially, the PMU work plans underestimated the typical exigencies of procurement processing and of
obtaining satisfactory outputs. Capacity suffered from insufficient assistance from experienced advisors
which proved difficult to obtain and retain, and whose advice was not always palatable to GDVC. The
PIP and procurement plans were subsequently rationalized but delays accumulated, especially in the BPR
activity scheduled to commence in 2006 but actually begun in March, 2010 due to the failure of the initial
bidding process when no bidders met the technical requirements.

(iv)    Procurement and Management of Technical Assistance

The PIP procurement plan assumed that, with appropriate expert support in place and key ToRs already
developed under the PHRD grant, rapid processing of myriad small contracts in parallel with ICB
procurement would be possible. The procurement plan submitted at appraisal included 52 contracts,
mostly small individual consultancy packages. Eighteen months into the project, the plan was revised
down to 24 contracts through bundling of related tasks, including two goods contracts totaling 75 percent
of the project costs. Advice received at the time of Appraisal from the Bank‟s Procurement team
suggested smaller individual consultancy assignments were likely to be easier to manage for an
inexperienced team. Procurement processing by the PMU proved extremely slow due to long delays in
securing internal agreement for terms of reference for consulting assignments, requests for proposals,
evaluation reports, in obtaining internal approvals for procurement decisions, and in negotiating and
finalizing contracts. Reasons for the delays included: (i) unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement
policies and procedures; (ii) underestimation of the skills and effort required to manage procurement; (iii)
risk aversion by project officials; (iv) lengthy, internal approval processes regardless of devolved
authority from MoF in July, 2007; and (v) inexperience in conducting financial negotiations with
international consultants leading to unrealistic expectations of their ability to reduce expected daily rates
of world class experts through negotiation.

The PMU faced particular difficulty in selecting highly qualified consultants due to the limited customs
consulting market, both in terms of the number of respondents as well as their qualifications and
experience. Out of a total of 28 consultancy packages advertised, eight had to be re-advertised (some
more than once) and nine of them still failed to identify individual consultants with satisfactory
qualifications. The failure of the initial bidding process in 2007 to identify a qualified contractor for the
critical BPR task led to revision in 2008 of the terms of reference to reduce the expected scope of the task
as well as combination with the ICT bidding document preparation task. Selection on that basis by QCBS
methodology during 2009 was successful but prolonged contract negotiations led to mobilization of the
contractor only in April, 2010.

The PMU also experienced difficulty in managing and retaining appointed international consultants.
Outputs from seven of eight assignments were considered to have met GDVC‟s full expectations. In
some cases appointees resigned early (including the initial project advisor and the legal and restructuring
specialists) and three were terminated.




                                                     6
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(i)     M&E Design

An extensive monitoring framework including 22 indicators was designed to capture project outputs. The
six system level indicators relevant to the PDO are shown below in Annex 6 and the intermediate results
indicators are shown in detail in Section F of the data sheet and monitoring arrangements are shown in
Annex 6. All system level indicators are quantitative measures except „Increased Transparency of
Customs Operations.‟ It is not now possible to fully attribute the specific impact of project outputs from
non-project related factors particularly given the GDVC‟s extensive non-project financed parallel
modernization program.

The intermediate results indicators are chiefly project driven and related to simple progress monitoring of
component deliverables including reports, and training outputs, and against implementation targets for
software and equipment provision. These intermediate indicators are in addition to GoV‟s statutory
ODA-funded project progress monitoring and reporting system – known as the Aligned Monitoring Tool
(AMT) – introduced in 2006 by MPI and endorsed by donors, which was applied by VCMP. MoF was a
pioneering user of AMT.

(ii)    M&E Implementation

Surveys carried out in 2004 and 2005 were available at the inception of the project to provide baseline
data for system level indicators. An additional survey was conducted during June, 2010. The survey
indicated that GDVC‟s customs modernization activities, such as the risk management approach and
selectivity as well as non-VCMP initiatives, such as e-declaration and e-customs, were strongly supported,
and positive results from these initiatives are well recognized by GDVC‟s clients. A majority of
respondents (among Customs‟ commercial clients only) agreed that:

           Customs and import–export rules and regulations are clear and transparent;
           Implementation of customs procedures is clear and simple;
           Time for customs procedures completion is quick;
           Customs staff has adequate capacity to meet job requirements; and
           Customs staff attitude is reasonable; and costs are reasonable.

Although it is impossible to precisely separate results directly due to VCMP from other ongoing reform
initiatives implemented by GDVC over the period of the project, it is clear that satisfactory results were
evident in several system level indicators. During the project period there was a large increase in trade
volumes while customs staffing levels remained relatively constant. Reductions in main import clearance
times and the percentage of consignments subject to physical inspection are also positive. However,
many intermediate indicators though established were not met: (i) introducing modern Customs systems
and procedures; (ii) improving the organizational structure and strengthening the resource capacity of the
GDVC; and (iii) introducing appropriate information and communication technology and during the
course of the project significant progress was recorded in all of the above areas.
In terms of detailed Performance Monitoring the VCMP led to the internalization by GDVC of
performance indicator methodology as an important monitoring tool for its modernization program. A
Bank specialist provided advice to GDVC in May, 2009 on survey and sampling methodology and
indicator quality improvements. Consequently an M&E consultant was recruited in 2010 and has
submitted recommendations for establishment and utilization of a list of national and site level
performance indicators relevant for GDVC operations.



                                                    7
(iii)   M&E Utilization

The GDVC recognized the utility of the project output indicators and established a dedicated team to
manage these and other indicators, with a view to using performance measurement as a management tool.
From 2007 the VCMP was also subject to the standard progress monitoring requirements of GoV‟s ODA
project monitoring and reporting system, the so-called AMT supported by Vietnam‟s major donors
including the Bank. Project progress data entered into the AMT is monitored by MoF‟s Dept of
International Cooperation and MPI‟s Foreign Economic Relations Dept. It is unclear that the delays
indicated by the AMT data were appropriately acted upon by the monitoring agencies.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project was not expected to and did not touch upon any safeguard policy issues other than fiduciary
compliance with the Bank‟s Procurement and Financial Management Guidelines.

(i)     Procurement

The main procurement challenge was the large number of consultant recruitments required by the project.
The Procurement Plan underwent major revision during 2008 through repackaging from the remaining 45
smaller contracts into 24 consolidated packages. With increasing experience the PMU proved adept at
producing more reliable plans. Some 28 draft IC and QCBS packages were reviewed in all. Due to
project termination 18 consulting contracts and five relatively small goods contracts totaling about $1.3
million were awarded.

The project procurement performance was down rated to Moderately Unsatisfactory in 2008 in the last
ISR prior to the cancelation. The rating was chiefly due to delays in processing consultant recruitment.
Project procurement did not significantly deviate from the Bank‟s procurement guidelines due in large
part to careful scrutiny by Bank staff.

Late in 2010, in attempting to accelerate progress, the MoF explored with the Bank the possibility in
principle of financing of the ICT software and equipment component of the project through direct
contracting with a source which MoF understood could provide a suitable system based upon a recently
developed and operational ICT model used by a neighboring customs administration. The model had not
been appraised by the Bank and no specifications or purchasing terms were available. The MoF was
advised that the DCA terms would not permit sole source procurement, and nor would restructuring the
project to include co-financing with a donor, which permitted tied procurement, be acceptable to the Bank.

(ii)    Financial Management

Effectiveness covenants requiring the appointment of a qualified financial management specialist and
adoption of a financial management manual acceptable to the Bank were met without delay. A Special
Account and a counterpart funds account were opened on schedule and an initial advance of US$ 250,000
from the credit proceeds deposited to the former on credit effectiveness. The total cumulative advance
deposited to the Special Account was US$ 500,000. Final disbursements are expected to total about SDR
1.43 million (about US$ 2.24 million equivalent) or 3.1 percent of the credit proceeds (see Annex 1, Part
(c) for details).

The PMU‟s accounting unit was fully staffed at the outset and operated according to statutory accounting
procedures but was initially unable to produce Financial Management Reports (FMR) in the required
format (due to software inadequacies) or satisfactory disbursement. In 2007, MoF devolved full financial
management control to the PMU in accordance with GoV‟s revised Project Management regulations. In

                                                    8
addition revised internal audit arrangements were put in place using the GDVC Planning and Finance
Dept‟s internal audit procedures. There were no significant deviations from the Bank‟s Financial
Management. Financial management arrangements and internal controls were generally sound
throughout implementation. Internal audit reports were unqualified. Financial Management performance
was rated Satisfactory in Jun 2007 and maintained in 2008, but down-rated in early 2009 to Moderately
Satisfactory mainly due to late submission of the audited financial statements for 2007 and poor
disbursement. The Moderately Satisfactory rating persisted until project termination.

External audits were provided for 2007, 2008 and 2009 and were all unqualified. One matter was noted
by the auditors in their 2008 management letter concerning mobilization of a contractor prior to contract
execution. An audit waiver was given for the 2006 financial statements based on the July 31, 2006
effectiveness date however the eventual period for the 2007 audited financial statements was from March
2, 2006 (date of signing credit agreement) until 31 December 2007. Only the 2008 audited financial
statements were submitted to the Bank by the due date. Submission of the 2007 financial statements was
3 months overdue due to the late initiation of the procurement process by the PMU. This auditor contract
was set for only 2 years (2007 & 2008) requiring commencement of a further procurement process in
2009 to engage an auditor, contributing ultimately to a one month delay in the submission of the 2009
audited financial statements.

2.5 Post Completion Operation/Next Phase

No significant facilities were created by the project requiring operation and maintenance. However, the
project did support the momentum for Customs reform that continues in GDVC‟s 2011-2015 Reform and
Modernization Plan and for which GDVC would like to obtain specific support from the Bank.
Notwithstanding cancellation of the Bank‟s remaining VCMP assistance to the GDVC, its aim to
implement an effective ICT system before 2015 may still be realized through state budget resources.
Bank In addition the GDVC has indicated it would appreciate advice and assistance from the Bank in a
range of additional modernization areas. In this regard and as a result of a formal request the Bank has
already approved a major piece of technical assistance to be financed via a MDTF.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project was of relevance to Vietnam‟s modernization effort at the time of its design and remains so at
the time of this ICR. In recently reaching middle income status, Vietnam has achieved accession to WTO
and confirmed its export-led growth model, enhancing trade competitiveness remains therefore an
essential element of Vietnam‟s Social and Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020). The
development objectives of VCMP remain relevant to Vietnam‟s economic development in increasing the
effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and accountability of the Customs Administration, and improving
Vietnam‟s trade competitiveness.

Design of the project was relevant to the development objectives, but was complex and demanding in
terms of internal coordination and procurement requirements. The project was terminated prior to
achieving its key components but not before outputs relevant to the institutional development objectives
had been achieved.




                                                    9
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Borrower‟s cancellation of the remaining credit in infrastructure investment after various technical
assistance components completed with their effectiveness reveals that the original high level PDO was
supported by partial completion of only two of the former three intermediate objectives. The third
intermediate objective - introducing appropriate information and communication technology – was
dropped although the extensive BPR and bidding document preparation activities will contribute in a very
meaningful way to the eventual procurement of an appropriate ICT system. It is extremely doubtful
whether such preparatory work necessary for the eventual procurement of a modern ICT system could
have been completed by the GDVC without the project‟s contribution. The evaluation of the project
outcomes is therefore prepared in the context of a restructured project at closure.

The key performance indicators showed that the system level improvement targets were exceeded in all
cases by the end of the project although as is frequently the case in institutional development settings it is
now not possible to fully attribute the impact of project outputs from non-project related factors.

3.3 Efficiency

Project Expenditures: Credit disbursements under VCMP amounted to US$ 2.2 million or 3.1 percent of
the credit proceeds. Total costs were about US$ 3.2 million. Expenditures were chiefly for technical
assistance inputs and one vehicle. The minor costs incurred were reasonable and the outputs achieved
were in most cases found highly relevant and useful. The economic rate of return to customs
modernization is considerable and the modest project expenditures were highly efficient in contributing to
GDVC‟s ongoing institutional performance improvement.

IDA Resource Utilization: The fact that over 97 percent of the credit proceeds laid idle for five years prior
to project restructuring raises a question of inefficient use of scarce IDA resources. In the case of VCMP,
economic opportunity costs of at least SDR 71.7 million (about US$ 112 million equivalent) have been
forgone by GoV in view of cancellation and are significant but could have been considerably higher if the
project was eventually cancelled later. Moreover, as the procurement schedule was skewed toward the
end of the project, much of this lost economic opportunity cost was factored into the initial project
calculations and the economic rate of return was still considered sufficient to justify the credit. In
addition, insofar as the modest project expenditures on institutional development have undoubtedly
usefully, it contributed to reducing cargo time releases.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

This ICR rates the overall outcome of the restructured project as Unsatisfactory in consideration of: (a)
excessive implementation delays; (b) the failure to restructure the project at an earlier time; and (c) the
absence of the ICT system infrastructure under the cancelled Component 3.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

The VCMP has contributed positively to the higher level themes of the CPRGS and CAS in facilitating
Vietnam‟s transition to a market economy well integrated with the world economy, not least through
providing credence for Vietnam‟s accession to WTO, and in supporting modern governance by increasing
public administrative efficiency and reducing scope for corruption, as well as supporting private sector
development. The VCMP in concert with other parallel institutional development initiatives has
contributed through capacity building and knowledge transfer to the significant GDVC performance
improvements since 2006 as measured by KPIs in 2010. VCMP and the preceding PHRD grant have had
a considerable positive effect on overall modernization and reform efforts and the institutional

                                                     10
development of GDVC. Completed elements of the institutional reform and development components
have produced outputs now. GDVC remains committed to obtaining the advice it requires to modernize
and strengthen its capacity and still regards the Bank as an important development partner and a source of
credible advice on reform and development issues.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Although VCMP succeeded in delivering only a small part of the intended outputs, these appear to have
proved particularly effective in contributing to the improving efficiency of GDVC and in particular to its
performance in reducing cargo release times. GDVC remains committed to further efficiency
improvements as reflected in its Customs Reform Strategy 2011-20. GDVC‟s plans include
implementation of the ICT facilities proposed under VCMP before 2015 but though alternative financing
arrangements. In light of GDVC‟s future plans, the impact of the restructured VCMP while not
quantifiable appears sustainable.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance - Overall Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

(i)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry - Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Although the project was timely and relevant to Vietnam‟s development priorities, and its complex design
was technically well grounded in accepted international standards and on past lessons learned, project
preparation relied heavily on the inputs provided by the consultancy firm hired under the PHRD grant.
The project appraisal was thorough but failed to ensure that a realistic implementation plan was adopted
from the very beginning of the project. This was compounded by poorly conceived credit agreement
conditionality that had the effect of delaying progress in certain activities where project inputs were
required before action could realistically have been taken. While special attention was given to preparing
GDVC staff (including study tours and specialized training) the impact of the internal coordination
challenges associated with the GDVC‟s consensus decision making approach were not adequately
estimated and factored into the agreed project design. Indeed, the ultimate impact of these issues on
implementation progress was underestimated by both sides.

(ii)    Quality of Supervision - Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

There was continuity in task team leadership and some continuity in task team membership. The task
team should be recognized for its considerable efforts and flexibility in addressing the challenges faced by
GDVC despite limited resources for supervision of such a complex project and for the proactive manner
with which it sought to deal with arising issues but which were eventually unsuccessful in moving the
project forward as scheduled. There was no QAG assessment of supervision of VCMP.

Supervision Intensity: The agreed supervision plan developed at design stage was sound but mission
frequency was low in the initial years of implementation. High Risk-rated projects warrant intensive
supervision and the DCA conditionality implied semi-annual reviews of project implementation plans.
However, while interaction between the task team, both in Hanoi and at headquarters, and GDVC
occurred regularly, field supervision missions, albeit well staffed, were short and limited to one each year
at 8-12 month intervals for the critical first three years of project implementation. In February, 2008, the
PMU requested the Bank to increase its supervision intensity to allow for greater interaction and guidance
from the Bank‟s content matter specialists. Five missions including three advisory missions by individual
specialists (in information systems planning, performance monitoring and project management) were


                                                    11
mounted in Year 4 (2009) to good effect. The belated Mid Term Review was the only mission mounted
in 2010.

Project Documentation Accuracy: While all supervision missions were well documented and the related
Implementation Supervision Reports (ISR) and Aide-Memoirs record the issues and the actions agreed,
the aggregate implementation delay was rarely highlighted as a critical issue, much less a significant
problem. Perhaps in view of this, the ISR record includes few substantive country or sector management
comments on the implementation problems. Management‟s attention became more focused and proactive
following classification of the project in 2009 as a portfolio „Problem Project‟ based on the perceived
disbursement lag. From mid 2009 onwards, once it became clear that key procurements could not be
completed before the scheduled closing date, the task team and key counterparts discussed the need for a
project extension. A decision was taken at the time not to formally raise the probability of an extension as
it would likely lead to some relaxation in the sense of urgency and momentum that had recently been
displayed by the PMU.

Mid Term Review: The mid-term review originally proposed for June, 2008 was deferred and eventually
held in September 2010, the eve of planned project completion at end-2010. By early 2008 the mounting
delay to the ICT component had become a major concern to the supervision team, while numerous other
implementation issues had revealed themselves and the procurement performance rating had been
downgraded. Given the project cancellation, it is clear now that the deferment of the Mid-Term Review
was a missed opportunity to take stock and appropriately restructure the project.

(iii)   Justification for the Overall Rating - Moderately Unsatisfactory.

The project was timely and relevant but the ambitious design and five year timetable proved to be
unrealistic from an implementation standpoint.       The flaws revealed themselves early in the
implementation phase. The standard of supervision reporting lacked some sense of urgency given
mounting procurement delays, and sector and country management were not sufficiently engaged early
enough to ensure the IDA resources were more productively used.

5.2 Borrower Performance - Overall Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

(i)     Government Performance - Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Commitment at the highest level of government to the objectives of the project remains strong in view of
GoV‟s export-led growth strategy, its administrative reform goals and its determination to apply the rule
of law and promote good governance. The MoF, as the supervising agency for the Customs
Administration, has a strong interest also in the revenue producing performance and efficiency of GDVC,
but has little comparative advantage in the management of ODA-funded, major investment project
implementation. However, as well as engaging in dialogue with the Bank on policy and project issues,
MoF has attempted through measures such as delegation of project management and procurement
authority, and formation of a Modernization Department in GDVC, as well as support to GDVC, to be
responsive to the emerging project implementation capacity issues although the measures had little
evident positive impact.

GoV‟s project monitoring capacity remains weak. In 2007, GoV instituted the AMT project monitoring
system to be used by ODA-funded projects. The VCMP submitted progress reports in the AMT format
quarterly although the quality of the data was uneven. The VCMP reports were available to MPI‟s
portfolio monitoring unit in its Foreign Economic Relations Dept and to MoF‟s International Cooperation
Dept as well as to the Bank. It is not clear however that the delays evident in the AMT reports led to
remedial action on GoV‟s part until VCMP was included in the Bank‟s “Problem Project? list reported to

                                                    12
MPI in 2009. The Task Force took steps to support improvements in VCMP performance in 2009 and
more recently to review and advise on the extension/termination options.

(ii)   Implementing Agency Performance - Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The GDVC leadership, staff turnovers notwithstanding, continues to be strongly committed to reform and
modernization of Customs and is open to assistance in reaching its targets. Nevertheless, ownership of
VCMP and the motivation to meet its challenges appears to have been difficult to sustain during the long
delays in implementation and in light of intense reform activities being undertaken by the GDVC in areas
not covered specifically by the project. GDVC was, however, inexperienced in large project
implementation particularly using Bank procurement processes and contributed to implementation delays
by failing to proactively improve the decision making processes of VCMP in ensuring the GDVC task
forces provided prompt and timely review of the ToRs, draft reports and bidding documents.
Consequently, fiduciary compliance was uneven especially in the early years. Irrespective of quality,
slow progress at project start up and early revision of implementation plans is a common occurrence in
the portfolios of all Vietnam‟s donors. However, implementation progress as noted earlier was very slow
throughout the project period although PMU staff, worked tirelessly to adhere to GoV‟s commitments
under the DCA, to solve problems and to ensure that objectives and outputs were consistent and well
coordinated. Professionalism and skill increased steadily and semi-annual work plans and reports of
increasing quality were submitted to the Bank as required.

6. Lessons Learned

(i)    Project Ownership

Project ownership by the beneficiary is a fundamental requirement for successful outcomes. The GDVC
has not abandoned its objectives but chosen to adopt a different financing path to meet their ICT needs
other than through the VCMP. The reasons for doing so are complex and largely exogenous to the project
but reflect in part the limited capacity of GDVC to manage the exigencies arising from the large and
complex tasks required to deliver the VCMP outputs within the project period while working within the
Bank‟s procurement requirements. Capacity constraints included cumbersome internal decision making
processes, limited project management experience and a shortage of qualified international expertise in
the customs domain.

While GDVC‟s ownership overall remains strong, the implementation challenges faced by the VCMP,
including the rigors of the Bank procedures and the inadequacies of the technical assistance found
available in the market, created large considerable uncertainty as to the feasibility of commissioning a
sustainable ICT system before its planned deadline of 2015 and the sustainability of the system absent a
strong operations and maintenance partner.

(ii)   Project Implementation Design Quality

A realistic, detailed implementation plan is an essential underpinning of any investment project. The
VCMP was prepared relatively quickly with the assistance of a PHRD grant, but project implementation
arrangements were not fully adequate and implementation schedule was overoptimistic without clear
sequencing and no provision for delay. The project heavy skewed toward infrastructure investments it did
not contain a full technical definition of the main ICT component as this was to be developed during the
BPR and bidding document preparation.




                                                  13
The basic implementation sequence was to commence comprehensive technical, procedural and
institutional changes in the GDVC, followed by the automation of re-engineered business processes. It
was recognized that broad institutional change of the scale envisaged (representing 10 percent of the
project costs) would require an extensive lead time. Moreover, procuring an advanced ICT system to be
deployed nationwide – was another complex process normally requiring a lengthy time frame frequently
prone to delays in Bank experience. The strategy of requiring the PMU to develop a rolling
implementation schedule through updated semi-annual work plans was, despite considerable input by
Bank missions, unsuccessful in light of the PMU‟s inability to match its procurement process to the
planned timetables. In the final years, in anticipation of a possible credit closing date extension, the PMU
began using project critical path planning software technology to develop more realistic detailed
implementation schedules based on its early experience with procurement and decision processing.

In response to the needs for procedural simplification, GoV had by 2007 moved to streamline its project
approval process and VCMP was not encumbered in that way. VCMP‟s ambitious and complex
implementation plan, however, allowed little or no „float time‟ to absorb delays but incurred significant
accumulated delays as procurement efforts floundered despite revision of plans on two occasions. Steps
to restructure and simplify the project and adjust the implementation schedule possibly occurred too late
during implementation.

(iii)   Project Management Unit Format and Capacity

The VCMP PMU proved unable to manage the planned institutional development program in such a way
as to meet the implementation schedule. Due to delays it was not fully tested in managing an
infrastructure investment program. The project content included an extensive program of upstream
institutional development entailing 10 percent of the project costs. Following GoV statutory regulations
for investment projects (Decree 17/2001/ND-CP) the enclave (or „stand-alone‟) PMU format was adopted.
This format was reinforced by new regulations introduced in 2007 (MPI Circular 03/2007/TT-BKH)
which provided significant independent authority to Project Owners and their PMUs through delegation
of administrative and financial responsibility.

The enclave format has merit in regard to investment project management not least in simplifying the
fiduciary duties of the parties but is less effective in fostering institutional development which typically
benefits from an integrated format in which the unit is embedded in the institution‟s own functional
structure. However, the GoV regulations provide for an integrated PMU format only for technical
assistance projects valued less than VND 1 billion (about US$ 62,000 equivalent). The project PMU
design included interdepartmental coordination and consultation arrangements which over time proved
ineffective in securing prompt approvals. Moreover, once the Modernization Department was established
a number of project activities were incorporated into their wider reform program (at times supported by
other donors) which made the PMU‟s task of coordinating activities with operational units and the
Reform and Modernization Department significantly more difficult.

In keeping with normal practice in World Bank assisted projects in Vietnam, procurement training was
provided; in the VCMP case by Bank staff and the ILO Institute in Turin, Italy. The inputs of qualified
project advisors mobilized intermittently proved.

(iv)    Supervision and Monitoring

Supervision. The „disconnect‟ between the PAD Supervision Plan, the normative levels of supervision
intensity and the actual supervision intensity for the project was significant, particularly in view of the
risk rating of the project and the steady deterioration of procurement progress over time. The plea by the
PMU in 2008 for intensified supervision by the Bank reflects the Borrower‟s expectations of that role and

                                                    14
the value they perceived from interactions with missions especially in light of the absence of the
anticipated consultant advisors. In response during 2009 the task team provided inputs by various
technical specialists who to varying degrees were able to help GDVC and the PMU overcome obstacles.

Monitoring. Project progress was monitored by Sector Management and the Country portfolio
management team through the ISR system reports, and by MPI and MoF through the AMT reports which
were also available to the Bank task team and portfolio management team. Although the disbursement
delay indicated by the reporting systems was overstated the implied implementation delays were real and
growing, but action to declare VCMP a „Problem Project‟ was not taken until mid-2009.

The aides-memoir of the early missions identified emerging implementation issues and although helpful
suggestions were made the measures proposed were not always fully successful. ISR reports lacked some
detail and did not sufficiently highlight the consequences of increasingly serious delays and project
management weaknesses. Post-mission management letters prior to 2010 duly highlighted the issues and
duly requested attention to them but did not lead to sufficient follow up to ensure appropriate actions were
taken, reflecting a shared view that an extension request was inevitable.

The GoV‟s AMT reports do not generate implementation problem flags and therefore require analysis or
annotation by the reporting agency to quickly discern emerging problem status. There were no obvious
interventions by MPI or MoF in VCMP resulting from the AMT reports until the Bank‟s alert. The
foregone opportunity costs or reductions in project benefits resulting from delay are a significant source
of inefficiency in Vietnam‟s development efforts. Full use of the AMT system could help reduce such
losses and help strengthen GoV‟s project management capacity.

Annex 3. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Introducing Modern Customs Systems and Procedures

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

A Modern Legal Framework; Through a review of the existing legislation and preparation of a Legislative
Management Planning Framework together with training workshops the project has strengthened the
capacity of GDVC‟s Legal Department to undertake preparation of a legal database and update Customs
legislation in conformity with senior legislation and international agreements as well as to underpin the
reform measures adopted by GDVC. The Legal Department has since developed and drafted several
decisions, decrees and circulars to support reformed and modernized practices; reviewed and revised a
large body of legislation to cancel redundant clauses, simplify provisions and eliminate inconsistencies,
and incorporate WCO-compatible provisions; and created a feedback mechanism to help identify need for
further changes and improvements.

Modern Procedures for Intervention by Exception; GDVC has employed limited risk management
processes and procedures since 2006 and recognizes the need for expanded and strengthened
decentralized systems but was dissatisfied with the consultant‟s recommendations for a Compliance
Management Strategy. GDVC is carrying out the remaining work at corporate, regional and branch levels
with its own resources using terms of reference developed by the project. Work in progress is expected to
strengthen policy and planning capacity, develop risk management profiles, criteria and evaluation
standards, establish an information system, and monitor performance of and collect feedback from
decentralized implementation teams. Separately, GDVC is preparing a post-clearance audit operational
manual and is pursuing a trader cooperation initiative.

Harmonized and Simplified Business Procedures; The important task of business process re-engineering
required GDVC to examine, rationalize and modernize its manifold business processes entirely. While
significantly delayed for reasons described above it was eventually completed at the end of 2010 and
including draft bidding documents for a two-stage ICT system procurement [although not yet adopted by
GDVC consequent to cancellation of VCMP]. The BPR provides an enterprise level approach to
delivering modern customs systems and procedures in line with international standards and best practice
approaches. The content was prepared principally as a prerequisite for the functional and technical
specifications to be incorporated into the ICT bidding documents but has had a much wider impact and is
now informing the GDVC‟s future reform strategy and key modernization initiatives. This task was also
supplemented by a separate input provided by the Bank through a consultant who in conjunction with the
VCMP IT advisor designed a Discovery Workshop to help acquaint GDVC staff with the market for
COTS solutions and the features of the various solutions available at the workshop.

Measures to Enhance Transparency and Consistency; GDVC adopted a comprehensive integrity and
anti-corruption plan in 2006 together with implementing regulations in 2007 consistent with the WCO
Arusha Declaration on Integrity in Customs. Client perception surveys indicate a slight improvement
since in GDVC performance on integrity issues although clients are often part of the problem. The
absence of a modern customs brokerage system in Vietnam is a cause of significant inefficiency. The
project has prepared terms of reference for a customs broker industry development strategy study for
which GDVC intends to recruit consultants in the near future although earlier recruitment efforts proved
fruitless in identifying qualified firms or individuals. GDVC in the meantime with its own resources has
initiated a private sector brokerage industry implementation plan. GDVC is piloting and monitoring a
broker licensing program including 84 firms and 224 individual agents operating in 11 Regional
Departments to date, as well as trial single window facilities in Haiphong and Ho Chi Minh cities.
Complementing the Implementation Plan is GDVC‟s intention to provide improved advance rulings on


                                                   21
standardized goods valuations, classifications and origins determinations. Terms of reference for
development of an advanced rulings system have also been prepared by the project. The preparation of
such terms of reference by GDV staff and their advisors is an important means of knowledge transfer in
itself.

Measures to Support Compliance and Enforcement. In adopting a policy of intervention by exception
GDVC is developing a risk management capacity that must rely on modern statistical sampling and
analytical methodology. GDVC has acquired in the meantime some experience in information gathering,
research and analysis through ongoing risk management pilot projects funded by other donors. The
preparation of relevant terms of reference for further capacity building has proved a moving target and
two early attempts to recruit qualified consultants proved fruitless.

Component 2. Improving Organizational Structure and Strengthening Capacity

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Organizational Restructuring; Broad principles for restructuring GDVC and its regional and branch
offices to become a leaner and more efficient organization were developed under the PHRD grant.
Further recommendations for GDVC headquarters reorganization were made by an international
consultant recruited under VCMP. Based on those recommendations GDVC has proposed to MoF new
regulations on functions, tasks, powers and the organizational structure of GDVC. GDVC is also drafting
similar regulations for its various departments and branches. GDVC intends to further explore its options
in light of the abovementioned business process re-engineering recommendations.

Human Resource Management; GDVC‟s Personnel and Organization Department is now implementing a
Human Resource Development Strategy and some of the related policy and procedures developed in 2007
by consultants under the project. GDVC is required however to adhere to statutory public service
procedures for personnel management.

Human resource development; Complementing the successful HR development strategy is a GDVC
human resource training strategy study to be accompanied by a training capacity strengthening study for
the Customs Training College. The training strategy developed by consultants in 2007 is being applied
by GDVC‟s Personnel Department in various units but the training capacity study is pending the
definition of ICT system training needs following the above mentioned business process re-engineering
task recommendations.
Financial resource management; This component was found redundant in light of the introduction of
MoF‟s statutory accounting and internal auditing systems for state agencies.

Physical resources; This component included three subcomponents concerned with procurement of: (a)
equipment control and maintenance infrastructure; (b) refurbishment of ICT system security facilities; and
(c) contraband detection equipment. Implementation of subcomponent (a) was curtailed as redundant in
light of MoF‟s statutory asset management regulations. Subcomponent (b) was contingent on
implementation of the ICT system to be provided under VCMP but now cancelled. Subcomponent (c)
now cancelled would have assisted GDVC to procure mobile scanners, X-ray equipment and close circuit
monitoring systems intended to combat contraband smuggling. The project assisted GDVC to prepare
specifications and bidding documents for the required equipment and provided considerable knowledge
transfer. Bidding documents had been cleared by the Bank and procurement was planned for early 2011.
The cancellation of VCMP has prevented proceeding with procurement. However, GDVC is planning to
turn to other donors for assistance in procuring and deploying these assets.




                                                   22
Management Support; The project included provision for technical assistance to strengthen GDVC
capacity in: (a) strategic planning, (b) performance monitoring, (c) client services standards; (d) trade
statistics collection; and (d) change management, and assisted GDVC in the preparation of terms of
reference and proposal documents for Individual Consultant assignments. GDVC encountered great
difficulty in compiling short lists of qualified specialists and was able to recruit consultants for
subcomponent (b) and (d) assignments only. The report of the performance monitoring consultant
recruited in Sep 2010 has not yet been submitted. The Statistics Situation Report and Statistics
Development Strategy 2010-15 Report recommendations were well received and have been implemented
in GDVC‟s operational units. A new import and export statistical reporting system was implemented in
Jan 2009. GDVC coordinates with other trade related agencies and the General Department of Statistics
in statistical reporting and analysis of imports and exports under the framework of an inter-agency
working group regarding imports and exports trends, balance of payment forecasting, and price inflation
management.

Integrity and good governance; Although GDVC was able to prepare satisfactory terms of reference for
preparation of a National Integrity Strategy and a development plan, as well as a suitable short list of
qualified consultants, recruitment failed at negotiations with the selected candidate. The assignment was
advertised a second time with simplified terms of reference but failed to attract qualified respondents and
has been curtailed as a priority for GDVC for the time being.

Component 3. Information and Communication Technology

Rating: Cancelled - Not Rated

The principal expenditure component of the project concerned the acquisition and deployment of modern
information technology and infrastructure to automate GDVC‟s business processes and administration.
As originally conceived, the project called for the identification of a COTS solution with a 10% - 15%
capacity for customization to meet Vietnam‟s needs followed by procurement of the necessary ICT
hardware and lastly a phased roll-out and installation to the regions and branches. The decision not to
develop a bespoke customs ICT system was not universally welcomed by all GDVC personnel,
particularly those from the ICT group who has successfully developed a range of separate applications
that provided basic ICT functionality for declaration processing and revenue collection. Moreover, delays
in the BPR and ICT bidding process as well as parallel support provided by other donors resulted in the
GDVC pursuing a range of e-customs initiatives separate to the project. It was envisaged, however, that
the functionality offered by these applications would be incorporated into the VCIS once it became fully
operational.

The GDVC, in wishing to have more certainty in the timetable for commissioning the ICT system before
2015 and bearing in mind the internal debate that had gone on during project preparation on whether to
build or buy, had misgivings about its ability to manage the ICT procurement and implementation process,
and therefore preferred to seek an alternative ready-made solution already operational in another Asian
country. Several new generation products have been developed by regional countries and are claimed to
have a functional advantage over the system initially envisaged under the project in that they already offer
single window capability. Vietnam is committed to establishing a Single Window facility as part of its
ASEAN regional commitments. While the BPR and bidding documents were adjusted to incorporate
capacity to contribute to Vietnam‟s single window ambitions, political developments, particularly the
government‟s decision to appointment the GDVC as lead agency for the single window initiative no
doubt also influenced the GDVC‟s decision to sole source an already functioning system or to at least
share implementation risk by entering into a PPP type arrangement. The Single Window concept will,

operating model, legislative requirements, income sharing mechanisms, etc. The GDVC has therefore
requested the Bank to provide technical assistance support to assist them in this area and an MDTF Trade
Development Facility grant has already been approved for this purpose. In addition, utilizing funding
from the Bank‟s multi-donor financed Trade Facilitation Facility, Vietnam will be one of the beneficiaries
of a sub regional trade facilitation program designed to provide practical advice and a forum for
information sharing on single window implementation issues between Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam and
other larger ASEAN countries.

Component 4. Project Management Assistance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The PMU experience with technical assistance and investment project management was limited and
capacity was constrained by cumbersome domestic procedures. Considerable assistance to the PMU was
provided for under VCMP Component 4, including international advisors experienced in project
management and ICT procurement, and national consultants experienced in procurement, financial
management and disbursement. In addition VCMP supported the PMU operating costs including
translation support and annual audits, and provided a project vehicle.
Due to procurement delays the availability of the scheduled advisory assistance was not well
synchronized with project needs and in some cases the assistance was not fully effective or well managed.
The initial project management advisor recruited in Sep 2006 resigned after three months citing personal
reasons. The replacement adviser was recruited in Jan 2008 and served for 18 months. At that point the
PMU‟s priority for advice lay in ICT systems procurement and a qualified specialist was recruited in Sep
2009 for that purpose but whose input was scheduled periodically. The majority of the PMU‟s day-to-day
support was provided by its national consultants in dealing with clearance and monitoring requirements of
the DCA but continuity suffered from frequent turnover among these consultants.

The VCMP provided considerable assistance to GDVC in the planning and procurement of its ICT
requirements through the funding of technical advisors to the PMU and consultants to support the
preparation of bidding documents under Component 1. As a supplementary contribution the Bank
provided an expert to collaborate with the ICT advisor to design and hold a „Discovery Workshop‟ at
which potential vendors of existing customs information systems could present the capabilities of their
respective products in context of a standardized formal enquiry to help GDVC participants systematically
identify and understand the functionality, configurability, robustness and scalability of ICT solutions
currently available. This was an important learning experience for GDVC and bidding document
preparation was able to proceed. Draft bidding documents for two-stage procurement of the turnkey
package of software and hardware required were scheduled for submission for Bank review in January
2011. If satisfactory, the availability of the documents could have underpinned a request for an extension
of the credit closing date to permit procurement and implementation of the ICT system expected to take
about three years.

Some Factors Affecting Disbursement

The main cause leading to low disbursement rate of IDA loans and counterpart fund is due to the actual
implementation of the main project tasks (procurement activities) are incompatible with the plan.
Specifically:

In the implementation process, most procurement activities of the project mainly focused on selection of
individual consultants and consulting firms to provide consulting services for the project (technical
assistance to project). With the fact that consultancy resource on customs in the world is very limited, on
the other hand due to the strict regulations of the World Bank and Vietnam's bidding laws, some packages
must be rebid several times due to number of bidders participating in the bidding less than the
requirement or could not select the bidder to meet the requirements set forth. For example, some
packages:

     -    The Legal Framework (Customs Legislative Management Planning Framework Package -
          Individual Consultant): The contract value is $ 143,262 implementing time from 09/04/2007 to
          03/31/2009. In the implementation process, After finishing Part I, the consultant has proposed to
          change the content of Part II of TOR from “Developing legal database and writing final report of
          package? into “Developing legal database and editing English translation of customs legislations?
          and at the same time he imposed a condition: if agree he will continue if not he himself will
          terminate the contract. The PMU has coordinated with the Legal Department which is the directly
          beneficiary unit of this package of GDVC on this issue and not agree with the requirement of
          consultant. The PMU has terminated the contract with the consultant and in 2008 the two parties
          agreed to terminate the contract ahead of time. Total contract value is made: $ 79,946 (only 55%
          of the initial contract).
     -    Intervention by Exception Package (Consulting Firm): The contract value of package is
          US$ 582,049.86 and VND 280,229,391, implementation time from April 27, 2007 to October 27,
          2007. In the implementation process , after completing stage I, the product of consultant did not
          meet requirements on quality and time specified. Based on the contract, with the consent of the
          World Bank and the GDVC, PMU has terminated contract with consultant. By December 31,
          2008, both sides have completed the liquidation of contracts with total contract value is made:
          US$ 115,500 (only 20% of the initial contract).
     -    Business Process Re-Engineering & Development of Bidding Documents for VCIS (Consulting
          Firm): this is the most important package of project because of the project outputs will be the



                                                      30
        inputs of in many other packages. Therefore, the time of bidding procedures, contract negotiation
        and signing of contracts took place nearly three years.

According to 1st Procurement Plan, PMU has carried out the bidding for this package in 2006. However,
at that time there was only one firm who submitted their RFP. Furthermore, having evaluated the
technical aspects of their bid, the firm was disqualified and thus making this bidding become a failure. In
2007, PMU has conducted a second time bidding for this package. In this bidding, one firm successfully
passed the minimum technical requirement, however, regarding financial evaluation, the bid price offered
by them amounted to US$ 1,421,660 that was too far exceed than the planned allocation of US$ 809,766.
The PMU then proposed and received approval to its revised allocation plan of US$ 1.5 million from
GDVC, MOF and WB. The contract negotiation process lasted six months, to April 2009, winning bidder
results and draft contract was approved. To November 2009; PMU and the contractor signed the contract
value was $ 1,531,146.81. Through 4 times adjustment, duration of the package extends from 12/11/2009
to 03/30/2011. Since the project must be closed in accordance with the Credit Agreement, the
performance of the contract value only 50% of the initial contract.

In the first 6 months of 2011, the PMU will make remain payments of 35% of the contract value of
BPR/ICT package and two packages of auditing services for fiscal year 2010, 2011. Accordingly, loan
disbursement is US$ 494,107.95 and counterpart fund is: 1,898,007,000 dong.

Factors Affecting the Project Performance

Positive Factors

The positive factors affecting the introduction and implementation process of the project are as follows:

    -   The process of deep and strong integration of Vietnam with international and regional is dynamic
        to promote reform and modernization of the customs office;
    -   The policy and the Government's determination to implement radical administrative reform in the
        apparatus of state agencies have created pressure for the state agency to simplify administrative
        procedures under the direction of streamlining, efficiency and optimum;
    -   The development of international trade in recent years along with the increase in export turnover
        requires customs authorities to have the appropriate changes to meet the needs of management
        and trade facilitation;
    -   By the positive achievements reached in the renovation process as well as through an open policy,
        encouraging investment and expanding trade in Vietnam, the foreign governments and donors
        have been particularly care for financing the integration process and development of Vietnam. As
        an agency plays an important position in international trade, the customs office has also received
        active support from donors in the process of reform and modernization of customs;
    -   The Interest, close steering of the competent authorities, the support and assistance of relevant
        ministries, and the effort of GDVC itself has created conditions for project to carry out assigned
        tasks.

Negative Factors

There was limited pool of consultants (both international and national) and no guarantee of quality in
Customs field. As a matter of fact, almost all consultancy packages could not select qualified consultants.
Out of a total of 27 consultancy packages that were advertised, 8 of them have had to be re-advertised,
some even had to be re-advertised for third time (like Performance Indicators Package); and 9 of them
could not find suitable consultants. Out of 6 international consultancy packages that were implemented,
three of them (two individual and a firm), namely (i) Organizational Restructuring; (ii) Legal Framework;


                                                    31
and (iii) Intervention by Exceptions have been terminated before time because of the quality of the output
failed to meet the requirements, or because of the two sides failed to reach a common consensus on the
scope of work. Most international consultants are customs officers who have retired or former customs
officials 10 - 15 years ago so the ability to update new knowledge as well as the reform and modernize
process was limited, even too late. In addition, the consultants having previously held management
positions, often did not have the specific area of expertise, so the advice given often at a policy level,
while the requirements of Vietnam Customs are specific, practical, intensive so difficult to achieve the
assigned tasks and both parties often cannot reach agreement with each other. A recent example is the
BPR/ICT package between consultants and other specialized departments of GDVC often have to argue
about the scope of work and in many cases the consultant proposals do not satisfy the requirements set
forth

The initial approach of the project is not reasonable. Although the funds allocated for the consultancy
package about 10% of project budget, the projects must focus on the implementation of technical
assistance components as prerequisite for procurement activities in the next stage leading to low project
disbursement rate, although the project has made great efforts. Through the practical implementation and
when international consultants came to work, it is recognized that the package cannot be done
immediately due to lack of conditions. The reason is the tasks of the packages having close relationship
with each other: the outputs of this package will be the inputs of the other packages when a package is not
yet implement then there will be many other packages lack of foundation to implement. For example,
only after the "Re-engineering procedures" and implement "ICT system" there will arise a need to adjust
the legal basis, arrangements clearance chain, organizational structure, allocation and human resources
training, ... to suit the new working environment.

Analysis Against the Objectives and Project Design

Compared to Objectives

Overall, VCMP has contributed to support the process of joining the World Trade Organization in
Vietnam. The introduction and implementation of the project reflects the political determination of
Vietnam on customs reform and modernization in order to further facilitate international trade, and is
regarded as a necessary condition for Vietnam to join the World Trade Organization. The goal of joining
the World Trade Organization has been completed. Currently, Vietnam Customs still do best efforts to
reform and modernize customs operations and has achieved some encouraging achievements which the
World Bank and the business community acknowledged.

The introduction and implementation of project has contributed to the customs reform and modernization.
The approach of the project is not only pointing out current shortcomings but also clearly describe the
future model of customs that customs authorities should reach to. This has created conditions for the
customs administration to determine policy development as well as develop action plan basically. Besides,
the process of project implementation has attracted a number of leaders and experts involved in project
implementation. Considered from this angle, the project has helped raise general awareness about the
requirements in the custom reform and modernization in general and the tasks to be implemented in
particular. Thus, reform and modernization activity received high support from the entire administration.
The major objectives set out in the project, such as Institutional, Business, Management has essentially
been met and there are many changes. The functional departments of the administration studied the
consultancy outputs seriously, acquired knowledge and put it into practical application. Specifically as
improving the legal system, simplification of administrative procedures, determine the overall system
architecture of information technology applications in customs management, developing compliance
management strategy, human resource development strategy, training strategy, Statistics Development
Strategic Plan and Vision (2010-2015), set up the effective performance indicators etc..


                                                    32
Although the above positive contributions, project has some limitation derived from the objective causes
leading to the fact that after nearly five years of project implementation total packages deployed at 28/52
(including the packages proposed in the feasibility study report and the new proposal packages), mainly
technical consultancy packages with small contract value and most of them supporting project
implementation unit. The number of technical packages fully carried out all is limited (05 packages).
Most important packages and having great value have not been implemented, such as Procurement of
Container Mobile Scanners package, and procurement of ICT systems package. Therefore, the project
was listed in a Problem Project list of loan projects of World Bank which are slow in progress and have
not achieved objectives set forth. Disbursement rate is particularly low: As of June 30, 2011, the
disbursement rate is estimated at 3.4% of the total project budget as set at appraisal.

Compared with Project Design

The project design was comprehensive, multi-purpose, and multi-dimensional. Therefore, the deployment
of resources was dispersed. Although GDVC paid attention to increasing project staff, but PMU still
cannot meet the requirements when project have to deploy a batch of packages at once. Therefore, the
PMU has faced many difficulties in coordination, resource allocation and effective project management. .

The project design did not specify the precedence and the organic relationship between the tasks of the
project. Only when the actual implementation and international consultants came, it is recognized that the
packages cannot be done immediately due to lack of conditions. Because the tasks of the packages having
close relationship with each other: the output of a package is the input of other packages. When a
package is not implemented then there will be many other packages lacking a basis for deployment. For
example: BPR Package and procurement of IT system package will decide the next task of the Legal
framework package, organizational restructuring package, Training package, Administrative Framework
package.

Although the funds allocated for the consultancy package were about 10% of project budget, the initial
approach focused on the implementation of technical assistance components as prerequisite for
procurement activities in the next stage which led to the low disbursement rate, although the project has
made great efforts.
Timeline of project was originally for 5 years but the practice shows that the amount of time it is not
possible for a project so comprehensive and complex in technique and having information technology
components accounted major capital ratio. This fact was pointed out in the mid-term review mission
report of the World Bank.

The Impact on Administration and Region

After five years of implementation, the project has contributed to the customs reform and modernization,
shows that:

    -   The project has helped the GDVC having an overview of a modern model of customs need to
        reach and the tasks required to achieve objectives set forth.
    -   Through the project implementation, raising awareness across the administration about the
        necessity to reform and modernize to meet the requirements of development and international
        integration of the country.
    -   The project has shown a good approach and manner to implement the reforms and modernization
        activities in key areas.




                                                    33
    -   Through the implementation activities, the project has attracted the resources in administration to
        participate in the project activities, collaboration with international consultancy study, looking for
        useful solutions to improve and raise performance in areas where the project reach.
    -   The project has made useful suggestions for developing and implementing programs and plans
        for reform and modernization of administration as well as some instructions in areas such as legal
        systems, process and procedures, resource management, training, etc, particularly in the
        application of IT and risk management techniques.

Sustainability

Project implementation process clearly shows the link and attachment, agreed both on the objectives and
actions between reform, modernization and development of the VCMP and Customs Administration. The
activities of projects are both suggestive and mutual development of activities of the GDVC.

Implementation practice of the project is not rigid but flexible. That showed in the timely adjustment of
project implementation plan so that the project's resources can be used effectively, to meet the
requirements in each period and long-term objectives of project.

It is recognized that the impact of the project is not only reflected in change in policy, action, or by the
specific products but also in raising general awareness about the tasks in the reform and modernization,
especially for the staffing directly involved in coordinating the project implementation. This is considered
significant long-term impact of project.

Evaluation of the World Bank and the Borrower

The World Bank

Approach, Design and Project Implementation

To meet the requirements of customs operations reform and modernization; customs modernization
project using assistance of the World Bank was born. The project is the result of a series of studies,
surveys, assessment of Vietnam's economic development, particularly in the field of international
economic integration and export-import activities, as well as practical operation of customs office and the
need to reform and modernize at the current time.

The World Bank has actively supported the reform and modernization process of customs authorities
since the project proposal was formed. Through the Task Team, the World Bank has cooperated actively
with the GDVC to conduct situation analysis and assessment of the customs organization to determine the
limitation and obstacles hindering performance. From the results collected, a feasibility study report was
launched as a basis for projects formulation.
Overall, this is a particularly large project, large in scale and technically complex. With ambitious to
redesign a customs office to become a modern, dynamic office, efficient operation in the shortest time,
most content of management, business, infrastructure investment are included in the project design.
Therefore the World Bank provided a large credit, worth about $ 66 million in the form of concessional
loans.

However, the project implementation has revealed the deficiencies affecting the quality of the project.
The design was: too comprehensive and unbalanced; did not anticipate all the complexities and
difficulties in implementing the project; time frame set for the project is not feasible to implement the
project; progress of project implementation slowed the process of customs reform and modernization;



                                                     34
lacked flexibility for the restructuring of project; project focused on policy issues but not concerned with
solving practical problems on management activities as well as customs business.

Monitoring Quality

In the implementation process, the project was placed under close supervision from the World Bank.
Every year, World Bank appointed supervision missions to work with project owners, investors, project
management unit and other concerned units to evaluate project implementation and make
recommendations related. Besides, the project maintains periodical, regular and irregular reporting at the
request of the World Bank and other agencies to ensure the information about the project is regularly
updated, created conditions for the direction, administration and project management. Along that project
activities are monitored through the planning and implementation of the procurement plan, and
disbursement for each phase. These activities are promptly reported to the World Bank for supervision as
required.

Performance

Besides the contributions to the formation and putting the project into operation, the World Bank always
had the active backing for the project implementation process. Training equipped project staff with
knowledge and skills on project management. In resolving difficulties and problems on administrative
procedures, the consultants always receive the attention from the World Bank. In many cases, the World
Bank has actively contacted and communicated with relevant authorities in clearing obstacles.
Besides the positive aspects mentioned above, the World Bank was not close enough to capture changes
in the reform activities as well as the needs arising from the practice of customs work. This led to World
Bank persisting with the initial orientation and delayed in the adjustment and restructuring of the project
to suit the new situation.

Borrower

Role of Government

The Government of Vietnam has played an active role and initiative in preparing and implementing
project. This reflects the high level of commitment to economic reform in Vietnam in general and of
customs field in particular. The close cooperation and dialogue mechanism between the Government of
Vietnam, the authorities of the Government of Vietnam and World Bank have created favorable
conditions for the assistance of the World Bank to Vietnam.

From very early before the project went into operation, the Government has made important directives to
form the basis of reform and modernization of customs activities. Along with the introduction of the
project, the Government has appointed the focal point and the authorities responsible for organizing and
coordinating the project and regularly report on the project.

Implementing Agencies

To implement the project, the project owner has established the Project Management Unit as regulation to
the operation of the project. Organization structure of project management boards are continuously
strengthening to ensure effective operation of the project. During the implementation process, whereas it
needed a hub unit with overall responsibility for reform and modernization, project owner has submitted
the agency to establish the Customs Reform and Modernization Committee. The birth of this Committee
has received the support of World Bank so that resources do not disperse and focus under the
administration of a single entity.


                                                    35
Performance

After the initial period of embarrassing operation due to lack of experience of receiving and deploying a
large scale project like this, the PMU was gradually strengthened in both personnel and professionalism.
This enables the project to operate well and more professionally. Coordination mechanisms between the
project and the departments within the administration is also gradually improve and promote efficiency
and attract intellectual and collective resources to perform project tasks.

Besides the above advantages, the difference in procedures between the World Bank and Vietnam also
causes some difficulties which influence the progress of project implementation.

Lessons Learned

From the results of project implementation in recent years, the GDVC draws some lessons learned as
following:

-   The mobilization of ODA fund and enlist support from outside to serve the development objectives of
    the country is necessary especially when Vietnam is a poor country.
-   The research, recommendations and suggestions of the consultant is necessary and helpful to the
    process of customs reform and modernization, helping to shorten development time, cost savings,
    especially when there are excellent experts.
-   To implement a big loan projects, diversity in objectives and technical complexity requires that the
    beneficiary agencies should be prepared carefully in all aspects, with determination, with a flexible
    coordination mechanism in all matters of the project, and it is impossible to operate without a team of
    experts who are well equipped with knowledge and experience in project implementation.
-   When implementing a large project, the design and forecasting phase are particularly important, thus
    the deployment process will not be rushed and avoid unforeseen risks.
-   The identification of key tasks, as well as sort out key priorities of project activities, will help
    optimize resources, avoid spreading implementation of many activities at once.
-   In the specific case of this project, the recruitment of international consultants for consultancy
    package under consulting contracts revealed many weaknesses. In other words, for the
    technical/policy advice needs the channels of bilateral cooperation, or multilateral technical
    cooperation will be more efficient rather than using loan to implement consultancy tasks.
-   Raising awareness about the important role of projects in the administration, as well as the need for
    active participation, coordination of functional departments and individuals related to performing the
    tasks of the project has a key role in determining the success of the project.
-   Minimize the differences in domestic regulations with the provisions of the loan will also facilitate
    the implementation of project activities, particularly the approval procedures, procurement and
    bidding process to help deployment package quickly, cost savings.
