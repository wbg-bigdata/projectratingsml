MEMORANDUM AND RECOMAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TB INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE   tE FE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Tanzaia for SDR17.3 million (US$24.5 million equivalent) to help finance an
Agriculturd Sector Management Project. Ile proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with
a maty of 40 years.
2.    Country/Sector Badkground. From 1978 to 1985, Tanzaniaes agricultural sector grew at 2.6
percent per annum in ;nstant 1976 prices. Following the Economic Recovery Program launched In
1986 (succeeded by the Economic and Social Action Program in 1989), the agricultural sector grew
on average by 4.9 percent per annum during the period 1986 to 1991. lbis recovery has been an
importan boost to the economy since agriculture accounts for abort 60 percent of GDP, 80 percent of
recorded export earnigs and 90 percent of employment. In addition to favorable macroeconomic
policy reforms, agricultura growth has been triggered and sustained by sector reforms, partcularly
the liberalization of marketing and pricing of food grains and non-traditional export. However, a
greater pace of reform is required to sustain this growth, underpinned by a significant improvement in
instutional capacity, which has been a constraint to increasing the depth and scope of refom.
3.    Weak institutional capacity to formulate and implement agriculural policy reforms has been
partially addressed in the past through technical assistance, either through festanding projects or
components of projects. However, the results were unsatisfactory becase the Government did not
follow through on policy change. The first IDA technical assistanmce project in the agricultural sector
(Cr. 1206-TA) was apprcvred in 1982, and the second (Cr. 1524-TA) in 1984. Both projects were
Iended to strengthen policy management, the monitoring of project implementation and the
performance of parastatals under the Mnistry of Agriculture. Support for these actities was
continued under the Tanzania Agibura Adjustment Program (rANAA, Cr. 2116-TA) approved in
1990. Although there have been some inutl improvements, policy management and planning
capacities have not been effectively udlized to provide an enabling environment to the private sector
because the country's economic policy framework continued to favor the promotion of the public
sector. Ihis weak istiional capacity has been bolstered by considerable exterdal assistance.
Recendy the Government has introduced a more liberal and progressive policy which will achieve
widespread reforms in the public sector leading, inter alia, to parastatal restucturing and privatization
resulting in elimnatig government involvement from most of the productive sectrs and services tiat
the private sector can operate more efficiently. Assistance is needed to provide support to this next
phase of reforms which is ewpected to be more institutionally demanding in terms of design,
implementtion and evaluation.
4.    The process of formulatng these key reforms began in October/November 1992 with a joint
Government-World Bank Agricultral Sector Review. The review focused on fonmulating agriculturai
strategies and policies aimed at enhancing food security, rural incomes and agricultural export
eanings in a sustainale environment. Ihe main policy  rust is to curtai direct government
lntervention in production and marketing, expand the reform program to include restruct    of
traditional export crop marketng, and reform the laws and regulations that hinder development of the
private sector and restrict competition with parastatals and cooperatives. While work on these



2
policies and stratgies is under way and discussions witia Government are ongoing, there is song
support within the Government for an Institutional Development Strateg (IDS) designed to transform
the role of Government from direct intervention to facilitating the private sactor to generate
agricultural growth. The proposed project would constitute the primary instrument to implement this
sateg which has been formalized by the Government through a letter of institutional development
objectives and strategy  DOS).
S.    Project Objectives. 'Me overall objective of the project is to strengthen institutional capacity
to formulate and implement the Government's agricultural development policies, strategies and
programs. This objective would be achieved through support to toe following key elemen  of the
IDS in the agriculture sector: (a) phasing out the prcvlision 3f services better done by the private
sector; (b) supporting the restructuring and privatization ot agricultural parastatals spearheaded by the
Paratatal Sector Reform Commion (PSRC); (c) revising laws and regulations to provide an
enabling environment for private sector investment in the agriculture sector; (dl developing the
management systems and car city reqired to improve the allocation and utilization of budgetary and
staffig resources; and (e) strengtening the agricultual information systems and services that are
important to supporting a market-oriented economy.
6.    Project Descrintion. The project would have three main cmponents: (a) rationalization and
strgthening of the fimntions of the Mistry of Agricuture (MOA) (US$7.8 million); (b)
srengthening of institutional capcity to formulate and implement policies (US$7.1 million); and (c)
Improving the agricultural information systems and services (US$10.8 mBlion). Activities to be
financed include technical assistance (TA), personnel service contracts and other in-house local
consultants, 1raining, workshops, seminars, sudy tours, field allowances, vehicles and office
equipment. For the funceonal ratlollalon component, the project would finance the actiies of
MOA task forces, task groups and consultants engaged in phasing out about 48 MOA functions,
developing cost sharing mecsmb    with the private sector fob about 20 other fimctions, and
restructming or preparing for privatization about 80 agriculta  parastatals. Financial support would
also be given to strengthening management systems and capacity related to planning and budgeting,
management traini, personel management, a management information system, accountg  and
procurement. For the policy formulation and imple do  component, fiancing would cover
two sets of activities: Oi) policy analysis; and (ii) longer-term Instituional strengthening. The work
program in the area of policy analysis would include preparation of sector policies and programs;
improved policy coordination and feedback through support to the Policy Analysis and Advisory
Committee; improved regulations and incentives to establish an enabling enviroment for private
sector development; and food security policy. During 1993 and early 1994, policy formulation would
focus on high priority reform aeas for possible inclusion in a proposed Structural Adjustment Credit
for possible IDA financng. Support for longer term institutional strenghening would include a
comprehensive training program, and improved work envioment and facilities. lTe  agrIcultral
informaton component would focus on strengthening, rationalizing and expanding the agricultural
information base. Priority would be given to supporting the county's capacity to produce reliable
tiformation on crop and livestock production and productivity, and marketing and trade, at the
national, regiona and district levels. Emphasis would be on strengthening instutional capacity for
mimely analysis and dissemination of agricultural information, and anticipating the marketing
information requirements to support an efficient functoning of trading in traditonal export crops once
thy are filly liberalized. Insdutional coordination and harmonizaton of effirts and outputs among
data collecters would also be emphasized. Accordingly, the project would finance five categories of
tasks: Q) carrying out an agricultural census (the last one was done in 1971/72); (ii) expanding



3
subsequent surveys to provide adequate data for planning and pollcy evaluation on an ammal basis;
(ii) carrying out a pilot survey using less expensive and more timely subjective methods to establish
low-cot sources of data collectio; (iv) improving the data collection and analysis capacity of the
Crop Monitoring and Early Warning System; and (v) improving communicaton facilities for beter
coilection and dissemination of marketing and trade lIfrmation.
7.    The total cost of the project i estimated at US$27.2 million, with a foreign exchange
component of about 50 pecent. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are showa in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the stats of Bank Group
operatiors in Tazania are given in Schedules C and D, repectively. The Staff Appraisai Report,
No. 11769-TA dated June 30, 1993 is also attached.
8.    Project Ie pleme-tation. Since the project covers the fil scope of MOA's responsibilities,
implementaon would be carried out under MOA's existing organizational and manageaiet strucure.
An Inter-ministerial Steering Committee, chaired by the Principal Secretary of MOA, would direct
project implementtion. Its membeship would include the four commissioners and the Director of
Pesonnel and Administration from MOA, as well as representatves from the Civil Service
Depament, the PSRC, Central Bureau of Statiscs (CdS) and the Planning Commission. An MOA
Advisory Techical Committee, chaired by the Commissioner of Planning and Marketng of MOA,
and comprising the Assistant Commissioners of MOA and a repreentatve from CBS would provide
technical guiance to project implementation. The two Committees would be serviced by a Project
Secretart attached to the Office of the Commissioner for Planning and Marketng in MOA which
would be staffed by a project coordinator assisted by a project accountant, a project trining officer, a
prouement officer, an administrative officer and a manager responsible for the rationalization of the
fctions of MOA. The Project Secretarit would be responsible for the day to day adminirion of
the project including acouning, prcement, disbursement and project monitring. The project
coordinator would serve as Secrtay of both Commitees. Implementation of the component in
support of the rationalization of the MOA fnctions would be coordinated by the Project Preparation
and Monitor  Bureau; actual implementation would be done by relevant organiaional units in
MOA directed by an MOA rationalization task force, with assistance from task groups and
consutants. The components for policy fomnulation and implenton, and for agricultral
information, would be implemented by the Sectwal Planing and Marketing Division of MOA, in
collaboration with CBS. The CBS and MOA have signed a memorandum of understmding that
orchestrates and formalizes their collaboration arrangements especially for the undertaking of the
agricultural census and subsequent surveys.
9.   Project S8sut bllty. The project would improve MOA's analytical base for policy
formulation and management, and enable it to concentrate on providing only critical public goods and
creaing an enabling evironment for the private sector. This would result in MOA becoming more
cost-effective and efficient and better able to promote private sector development; both outcomes
would enhance the sustnability of project benefits described below.
10    Iaom   from Prevous IMA Involvmet. IDA has financed two technical aistance projects
in the agricultural sector (Cr. 1206-TA and Cr. 1524-TA). Their project completion reports have
highlighted two lessons: Qt) hat institution bulding requires long-term assistance and continuity in
implement_tion, and (ii) that success of capacity building projects is enhanced if assistance is tageted
at the strategic functions of the relevant instittions. These two lessons have also been highlighted by



4
a 1990 study by the Operatons Evaluation Department entitled Free-standing Technical Assistance
fr nitudtional Development in Sub-Saharan Africa". Other Important lesons from this study
include tho need for a clearly f ought out Institutuonal development strategy; a project desig that
takes Into account the borrower's limited absorptive capacity; and adequate supervision, especially
from Resident Misions. Additional lessons iclude those gained from institutional development
expeience at global level: project success and sustanability are enhanced by direct involvement of
key country stakeholders; and Institutional strengthening is enhanced if pnoject implementation is done
through established nstitutioni structures. These lessons have guided the design of the proposed
project and Its implementation plan in at lnt five ways. First, the ptoject has been designed to focus
on supporting the implementation of key elements of an institutional development strategy. Second,
the project i simple in design, limited to supporing only three inter-related project components,
mainly in one ministry. Tbird, most of the project supervision would be done by the Resident
Mission staff. Fourth, implementation would involve senior Tanzanian managers who are
suikenolderin the institutions being addressed. Fifth, the project would be implemented through
existing institutions.
11.   Rationa  for IDA Involvmnit. The principal goal of the Bank's country asstance sey
for Tanzna, which was discused at te Board in June 1993, is to assist the Governnt in reducing
povety through acceleration in the pace of structural reform, improvements in the incentive
framework facing the private sector, and the provision of infrastructure and sucial cervices. IDA's
support to reforming and strengthening Isittional capacity in Tanzania's agricultural sectr, through
this project, is a critical element of this program in the following ways. First, continued caacity
building is urgently needed to support the nt round of structural reforms in agrcjture. AR noted in
the recent Country Economic Report (World Bank, 1991), because of the limied institutional capacity
for policy formulation and imple ion, the reforms supported under TANAA were deliberately
simple in design, requiring mainly  uncements of policy changes to stimulate private activities.
The nen phae of reforms is instionally demanding, shifting the role of the Ministry from its
"command and control" aproach to inect economic management and requiring deaed design and
intensive monioring. This phase therare needs to be preceded by institutional strengthening in
policy fomulation and Impl emntaton. Second, MOA bas been spreading Itself too thinly in the
contxt of the resources avaiable to it; there is therefore a need to rationalize its funcdons and phase
out those best suited for the private sector. Third, there is a need to improve the collection,
management and disseminiation of agricultural information which is critical to effctive public and
private sector management in a market-based economy.
12. The project objectives are consistent with the Government's broader policy goals for reform
of the public sector through programs of privaization of parstatas, civil service reform, and the new
approach to planming and budgeting  rough ihe Rolling Pln and Forward Budget, all of which are
being supported under the forthcoming Public Sector Adjustment Credit. The proposed project would
provide a key link at the sectoral level to these initatives. Given IDA's lederhip in mobilizing
developmet aistace and suorting policy ad institonrA reforms in Tanzaia, IODA is best
placed to support instifutional strngthening in the agriculural sector. It would do so working closely
with the UNDP, which is the lead donor agency in technical assistance in Tanzania.
13. Agreed Actions. The following actions have already been undertaken by the Government in
order to expedite project start-up and implementtion: (a) submission of a draft letter of IDOS. which
uiderpins the proJect; (b) submission of draft action plans for 1993/94 for: O) iniating the disposal
of at least 10of the 48 MOA functions identified for elimination, and operating joindy with the
.1



private sector S out of the 20 functions identified for joint participation; and (U) policy formation,
outlining key studies, tasks, reports to be produced and thek deadlines, and personnel and resource
allocation; (c) submission of a signed memorandum of undetanding eween MOA and CBS
outlining areas of collaboaion; (d) submission of procurement-related doceion, including a
dra general procurement notice, standard contacts for hiring of consultants, standard letter of
invitation, and draft tms of reference for technical assistance and studies; and (e) appointment of a
proect coordinator who participated in the project negotiations.
14.   During negotations, the following assurances were obtained: (a) to promote institutional
refrms and development in the agrlcultural sector, the Government would implement the program
contined in the draft letter of IDOS; and (b) to ensure effective project implemeion, the
Goveent would: (i) establish and maintin the project's Inter-minterial Steering and Advisory
Technical Committees as well as the MOA rationalization task force, with membership and trms of
reference satsfactory to IDA; Qi) provide to IDA for review and approval by March 31 ef each year
an annual work program that would include comprehensive training, rationalization of MOA fimctions
and policy analyses; and (iii) consult wih IDA before making changes to the organizational stucture
of MOA. In addition, approval of the related arnual work program would be a ondition of
disbursement for actvities financed by a Fund that supports the rationalzation of MOA fuwctons and
for the trning program. A rview of on-the-job training and personnel service contracts would be
carred out by March 31, 1995, and a mid-term review by June 30, 1996.
15.   The following would be condltions of credit effectivenes: (a) appointment of the project
ttaining officer, the project accountant and the MOA rationalization task manager, and Ob) submission
for IDA review of technical assistanc proposals with letters of invitation packages (consistng of
tums of reference and short lists).
16.   Environmental Aspec. 'Me project Is essentially a technical assistance and training
tiative and therefore has no direct impact on the evironment. It has been classified as a 'C'
category project-
17. Program Objective Categories. The project's support for improved sector and policy
management promotes the achievement of the Bank's program objectives of privae sector
development and improved public sector management.
18.   Project Benefits. The projec benefits would accrue from four sets of activities: Frst, the
role of MOA would be refocused to the provision of public goods and an enabling environment for
the private sector. Second, successful implementation of this project would set up MOA as a pioneer
participant in the forthcoming civil service reforms which are geared to enhancing the orgaizational
structure, morale, peformance, productivity and salary strucur of government employees. Third,
MOA's policy formulation and implemeion capacity would be srengthened, enabling the
acceeration of agricultural reforms. Fourth, the agricultural information systems and services would
be strengthened, faciliting improved public sector management, and the planning and management
by the private sector. All these activities would contribute to the process of achieving a higher
sustained agricultural growth, reducing poverty and improving food security and foreign exchange
earnings.
19.   Risks. The main risk relates to Govement commitment to Ilement the nstiution
development stag and to effectively utilize technical assistance to strengthen instittional capacity.



6
Govermment commitment was tested during Goverment-IDA Joint preparation of the institonal
development strategy, during preprton of the project by Govment and local consultants, and
during appraisal; It was found strong at tecical and management levels. The strnt of
Government commitment was further demonstrated by the Government's letter of institutional
development objectives and strategy addressed to IDA.
20.   RecommendatIon. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

DISBURS ENT ISSUES
1.    IDA's pottfolio In Tanzania at the end of March 1993 consisted of 23 projects (investment
plus adjustment) for a total commitment of US$1.2 billion, of which USS 647 million wu
undisbursed. Of the total committed, US$ 677 mIlion was for 19 invtmen oeations,
corresponding to US$508 million undisbursed. During FY92 only US$47.7 million was disbursed
on such projects, which corresponds to a disbursement factor of only 9.5 (ratio of disbursements
to net commiments at the beginning of the FY). One reason for the slow disbursement of
investment projects is the relatively young age structure of the portfolio. Of the 19 investment
projects, 9 were approved in FY89 or earlier and have an undisbursed amount of US$67 million.
Since FY90 another ten have been approved and have an undisbursed amount of US$441 million.
The main raon for the slow disbursement, however, is the limited domestic capacity. This is
also the main cause of the slow disbursement of import support funds through the adjus_tm
operations.
2.    LImited domestic capacity has been a major constraint across sectors and a Parastatal and
Public Sector Reform Project considered by the Board in early June 1993 is iotended to address
issues of civil service reform which should lead to increased efficiency of the civil service. In
addition, the proposed agriculture sector management project would reinforce the sector's
capabilities, and supervision of projects in the PHR sector has been intenified.
3.    Another issue has been a lack of counterpart funding due to severe budget constraints.
This issue will require greater prioritization of public expenses under the rolling expenditure
framework, improved financial management capabilities (to be developed under the recently
aproved Financial and Legal Management Upgrading project (Cr. 2413-TA) and better revenue
generation through tax reform also being supported by IDA.
4.    A Country Implementation Review (CIR) is being planned for early FY94 to review the
above issues and others of relevance to improve implementation of the Tanzania portfolio.

Mr. Lewis T. Prston

The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W. 24033
Unked Stas of America
Dear Mr. Preston,
3ubJeot: Leer of Institutional Development Objectivs
and Strategy for Agrliculur
The govemment embarked on. an ambitious adjustment process In 1986 with
the Economio Recovery Programme (ERP), which oontinues today under the
Economlc and Social Acdon Programme (ESAP). Since tha time, the country
has been moving awayfrm a situation of pervase controls In which the public
secor was responsible lor organising economio acty to one of dcoentralled
marketdrhven economic grwth.
Govemment porfflts fr ricultural In ons are undergolng corresponding
changes, wIththefocus shffting tothe pro, on of basicsocal and Infrstructursa
sercs to the eonomy and away ftrom involvemens In productive actMes.
This shift emphases an agriultural production system more determined by
maret forces and te acvkis of farmers, co-operativ socite, and other
private sctor agents, and less determined by dirct govemment interventon.



15
Far from removing the need for public sector Involvement, this development
strategy requires even more efficient and responsible supporting Instftutions.
Tanzania Is now entedng a more complex and Institutional demanding phase of
the economic recovery programme. Acceleration of the pace of IMplementation
of reforms is crical for sustining the gains already made and ensuring
significant Increases In the standard of living for alt segments of the population,
Nevertheless, weak management capacity to carry through reform implemen-
tation has constrained progress.
I mproving public sector management is a critical issue and it must be addressed
quickly and effectively In order to accelerate the pace of adjustment. The
Govemment has embarked on a process that includes; #) reassessing the role
of govemment in the economy; (II) budgetary restructuring and reallocation
toward priority sectors; (11 chMi service reform: A1v) restructuring of the financial
system; and (v) restructuring and privatsation of parstatals.
This proces Is especially importnt for govemment instiutions In agriclture,
which have acquired overly broad mandates that Include tasks for which private
sector delivery is better suited, while suffering from a decining resource base.
As a consequence, other acivitis in support of agrcultural growth that only
govemment Insitutions can provide are not being adequately carried out.
To retify this shuation, the Government has initiated a series of reforms to
redefine ts role, Including such policy changes as restructurng the tasks of the
grain and export crop marketing boards and adopting the initial steps to
reorganise the cooperative system. The strategic vsion outlined in this letter
takes the process further by commitng to a process that deflnes and enhances
the appropriate role of govemment In agriculture.
2



16
The Instltutional evloQoment tatgy for AcriculturM
the Government recognises the need to re-direct the role
of public instutions In agriculture In line with the following
mission statement:
To promote and sustain an enabling environment for
growth In agricultural production, trade, and Investment in
order to achieve the national objectoves of I Increasing
rural Incomes, IQ enhancing food securiy for the entre
population, lil) achieving export growth and iv) conserving
the environment.
The Govemment's strategic vision for Instutional development
of the agricultural sector calls for changes so that:
i)  the legal and regulatory iramework promotes an enabling environment
for the expansion of production, trade, and Investment by the private
sector;
ii)  govemment organisations phase out, through an orderly process, func-
tions best carried out by the private sector, afterwhich the Govemment will
provide only those goods and services that are public In nature and that
serve as catalysts for agricultura growth, In llne with national objectives;
and
ill  the insitutions Intemal Incentive and resource allocatfon systems pro-
mote and facilitate high quality performance in these areas where the
govemment has a critica role to play.
The proces of Institutonal reform to reach the straegic vision outlined above
Is necessarily a long-erm effort. Although the government has identified many
of the mileposts, the process for achieving them must remain flexible, adapting
and leaming from the experience as our progres unfolds. In this way, the
govement has adopted a systemaic process through which our public
3



17
Instiutions make continuous adjustments modifying approprlate laws and
regulations, setting priorkites, spinning off activities to the private sector, reallo-
cating resources, and strengthening core tunctions.
The Govemment Is oommitted to carrying out this institutions development
strategy, Including the following key elements:
i)   Revising the legal and regulatory framework to encourage growth
of private sector agricultural production, trade, and investment. An
example of this work Is the 1991 revislon of the Cooperative
Development Act. Other revlsions will follow to enable effective
implementeion of the proposed agenda of institutional and policy
reftoms.
iiQ   Phasing out the provbion of cortaln goods and services by the
public sector. The Minitry of Agriculture (MOA) recently identffled
functions that should be phased out and taken over by the private
secor and others that should be provided jolntly by the govemment
and private sector participants. Priorities will be determined ana
action plans developed accordingly. In 1993/94 the Government
will initate the phasing out of functionethat afe *private In natur
Including seed production, the sale of veterinary drugs, tractor hire
services, heifer production and the sale of agricultural chemicals.
The actvity of phasing out the functions that are purely private and
those for joint operation with the prae sector will continue in the
course of the next five years.
Ill  Implementing the divestiture of appropriate agricutural parastatals.
The MOA has prepared options for distiture of parastatais and is
working In close collaboration wih the PresIdental Parastatal
Sector Reform Commssion (PSRC) to Implement a number of
priority diwstiture operations. At the request and with guidance
from PSRC, the MOA will support the preparation of partatals up
to the point of sale by PSRC.
4



18
lv)   Strengthening the rolling plan and forward budgefing process. This
process will take Into considemtion the pririties of the remaining core
functions In the allocaton of human and financial resources and the
restructurng of projects and donor aid associated wth the functions to be
phase out.
v)   Utilising the ratonatisatlon of functiona already Initatd In the MOA as one
of the first experenoes of general civii servie reform, and taking advan-
tage of the  sorn leaned as the process of restructuring the role of
govemment expands to other sectors and ministres.
vi)  Pladng a high prioorit on Improving agricultural staistics and Informatian
management as part of the process of tranformation from central
economic planning and control to a marketnodentd system.
In view of the Institutional development measures that have already been Initiated and
those that will be implemented In the ner future, th govemrnment requests your
favourable consideration of an Agricultural Sector Management Project. Implementa-
tion of the project would be consistent with the broader civil ervice reforms. It Is our
intention to expedite the transition to the new role and mission of Govemment
Institutions In agrlculure in a manner and pace that are technically and administratively
feasible and consistent with our overall development goals.
Yours Sincerely,
oma A
