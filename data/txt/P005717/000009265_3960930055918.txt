DEFINITIONS OF POPULATION. HEALTH AND NUTRITION TERMS
Contraceptive Prevalence Rate         The percentag of married women of reproductive age who are using
(or whose husbands are using) any form of contraception.
Crude Birth Rate                      Number of live births per year per 4,000 people.
Crude Deafth Rate                     Number of dGuh per year per 1,ooo people.
Infant Mortality Rate                 Annual deat  of infarts younger than 1 year old per 1,000 live births
during the same year.
Life Expectancy at Birth              The number of years a newborn child would live if subject to the age-
specific mortality rates prevailing at time of birth.
Maternal Mortality Rate               Number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in a given year
attributable to pregnancy, childbirth, or post-partum.
Net Reproduction Rate                 The average number of daughters that would be born to a woman if
during her lifetime she were to conform to the age-specific fertility and
mortality rates of a given year. A net reproduction rate of 1.00 means
that each generation of mothers is having exactly enough daughters to
repace itsef in the population.
Rate of Natural Increase              The rate at which a population is increasing (or decreasing) in a given
year due to surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths expressed as a
percentage of the base population.
Rate of Population Growth             The rate at which a population is increasing (or decreasing) in a given
year due to natural increase and net migration, expressed as a
percentage of the base population.
Total Fertility Rate                  The average number of children a woman will have if she experiences
a given set of age specific fertility rates throughout her lifetime. Serves
as an estimate of the number of children per family.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan Summary
Borrower:    Republic of Tunisia
Amoun:      US$26.0 million equivalent
Terms:     Seventeen years, including five years grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
Descriptlion:  The Popuilation and Family Health project aims to assist the Government of Tunisia
(WI)8 to law  bow huIUt  nd nto      by tuuetn bes healh ewe srvices to
undeprileged groups with a rong focus on mother and children. The quantitative
targets of the project are to recruit about 30,000 new family planning acceptors per
year in the public sector while continuing to serve over half a million women with
such services throughout the project period. Further reductions in mortality and
morbidity would be addressed through: (i) reducing regional disparities in access
to basic health care (including the first referral level of care) and in the availability
of resources; and (ii) improving the quality of Basic Health Care (BHC) of which
Family Planning/Maternal and Child Health services (FP/MCH) is a critical
component. The project would provide: (a) works and equipment to BHC facilities
to accommodate the strengthening of FP/MCH services and upgrade the technical
quality of the services; (b) mobile clinics and vehicles to deliver family planning
and other basic health services with a strong focus on underserved areas; (c)
ambulances and equipment for the district hospitals; (d) works and equipment for
5 peri-urban diagnostic centers; (e) educational materials and expert services for a
comprehensive pre- and in-service training program for staff who are to deliver the
services; (f) expert services to improve strategic planning and monitoring
capacities; and (g) spare parts and expert services for the development of a
maintenance program for vehicles, equipment and buildings.
Benefits:   The project would ensure the inciusion of the poor in the demographic transition,
improve access to effective basic health care services and reduce regional
disparities in family planning and heatch indicators. The project would also
contribute to the efficiency of the health sector by strengthening the focus on BHC
and by treating morbidity at an earlier stage. The project would create the basic
conditions for further fertility decline and thus permit Tunisia to achieve the goals
of its population policy which is an integr3l part of its human resources strategy
and labor market planning.
Risks:    Possible risks include the fungibility of budgetary resourrds which could draw
resources away from the lowest level of care towar&d nospital-based curative
services. As the GOT is fully aware of the importdnce of including the rural poor in
the demographic transition to reach the demographic goals, this risk is minimized.
Furthermnre, the National Office of Population and Family Planning (ONFP), will
continue lo monitor the achievement of family planning targets and assist the
responsible staff to meet the planned level. Difficulties in attracting the necessary
staff to underserved areas is another risk. To counteract this, recruitment of staff
and trainees originating from such areas will receive priority and mobile teams will
be targeted to such areas.

A . COUN1TRY BA
1.1      After a decade of strong grow*h, the Tunisian economy started to
experience difficulties in the early 1980'8.  Oil production declined and
world prices fell, but economic measures necessary to adjust for those changes
were not initiated promptly.   By 1985,  a balance of payment crisis was
imminent.  After a period of demand constraint, the Government introduced
policy revisions that broadened into a ride-ranging program of structural
adjustment.   Specifically, the Government's strategy is to transform the
economy from a state controlled into a dynamic market-driven, export-oriented
economy able to provide jobs at home and compete effectively abroad. This
strong adjustment program has been supported by the Bank through five
adjustment operations: two Agricultural Adjustment Loanis (ASAL) in FY87 and
FY89 (Lns No.2754 and 3078), the FY87 Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment
Loan (ITPAL, Ln No.2781), the FY88 Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL, Ln.
No.2962) and the FY90 Public Enterprise Restructuring Loan (PERL, Ln. No.
3109).
1.2      While the economic adjustment process proceeds, a major concern of
the Government is the continuing high level of unemployment which affects
15.3% of the working age population.   Stagnating migration opportunities,
the relatively young age structure and the increasing participation of a
better educated female labor force will make it difficult to reabsorb the
currently unemployed (316,000) and to create about 45,000 new jobs each year.
The Tunisian Government is fully aware of these challenges and has received
Bank support for an Education and Training Sector project in FY89 (Ln No.3054)
and a recently approved FY91 Employment and Training Fund (Ln No.3255) aimed
at adapting the existing labor force to changing job patterns. The Bank is
assisting the Government in strengthening the education sector throvih an
operation, planned for FY92, which will improve the capacity and quai.ty of
t,ie higher education system.   While a concerted attack on unemployment is
being waged through salient labor market reforms and the promotion of economic
growth, the Government's long term strategy is to achieve a balance between
the number of labor force entrants ani the absorptive capacity of the economy.
Thus, reducing the rate of population growth is an essential aspect of the
Governmer.t's human resources strategy.
].3      Although  Tunisia  has  given  high  priority  to  human  resources
development, the education sector has not been able to keep pace with the
increasingly large cohorts passing through the system.   As a result, the
quality of education remains sub-standard and retention in the system is
weak; of those children who enroll in school, only one in three go beyond
grade 6, one in five go beyond grade 9, and only one in twenty children
progress to higher education. Smaller birth cohorts would lead to greater
per capita investment in education and facilitate the development of a
qualifi&d labor force while, in the medium term, better education, especially
of females, would contribute to slower population growth.



S.  POPION
1.4      The Govornment policy of moderating population growth has received
broad  political,  religious  and  legislative  support  mince  Independence.
Legislative changes such as the 1956 "Code du statut personnel" (Personal
Status Law), and other policy initiatives were introduced to raise the atatus
of women and provide them with choices beyond motherhood. Female education
has consistently been encouraged: while in 1965 only 52 girls per 100 males
were enrolled in primary school, the gap had narrowed to 81 by 1987. Female
employment rates have increased from 5.5% in 1966 to 20.3% in 1989.   The
Government remains committed to raising the status of women and promoting
their full involvement in society, including the workplace, despite the
preosuree to make jobs available for the currently (largely sale) unemployed.
The goal of the population policy to achieve an average family size of 3
children per family by the year 1996 is close to being achieved in urban
areas.  H!owever in rural areas, where the average family has about 5 children,
attainment of that goal remains a challenge.
1.  POulation Growth
1.5      Despite  concerted  efforts  to  moderate  population  growth,  the
population of Tunisia has doubled since Independence, up from 3.8 million in
1956 to 7.9 million in 1989. The prevailing rate of natural increase (2.3%)
implies a population doubling time of 35 years.   If fertility remains at
present levels, the population will reach 10 million by the year 2000 and 16
million by 2026.  However, if fertility continues to decline according to the
Government of Tunisia's (GOT) medium-range projections, the population will
not exceed 9.8 million in the year 2000 and could stabilize at about 13
million by 2026.  To maintain a balance betweer. the natural resources of the
country and its human inhabitants, the Government is committed to achieving
this lower growth path. Since it is unlikely that emigration will be a major
factor in relieving population and labor market pressures in the future,
slower population growth has to be achieved through further fertility
reduction.

1. 6     The high, though declining, natural increase of the po.uiation is
due to dramatic declLnes in mortality not matched by similarly large decreases
in fertility. Most mortality reduct_on occurred between 1966 and 1976 whenr
the Crude Death Rate (CDR) declined from 15 to 9 per thousand primarily due
to a reduction in both the Infant Mortallty Rate (114R) and .ie incidence ft
contagious diseases. The CDR, currently estimated at 8 per thousand, compares
favorably with induscrialized countries which tend to have an older age
structure.  The high IMR of 140 per thousand in 1966 declined to its present
level of 51 per thousand live births, which is the lowest rate in the Maghreb
and about average for countries on a similar level of development.  When
mortality declines start earlier and at a faster rate than fertility, the
ine'itable outcome is a young age structure with a high built-in momentum for
future population qrowth.  (Bee Nabr.b (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisial "The
Demographic Challenge to Sustainable Economic Development, No. 8903-EMN,

1.7      Figure 1 traces the decline in fertility from Independence in 1956
to 1989.  The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) declined fror. 45 to 25 per thousand
population and the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) from 7.1 to 3.5 children per
woman. Though some countries (in other Regions) have experienced more rapid
declines in tertility, Tunisia has been the most successful among Arab
countries  (see Figure 2).   The impact on the age structure  is already
apparent: the proportion of the population under the age of 15 years has
dropped to 38%, as compared to 42% in the Arab region, and is projected to
decline to 30% by the year 2001.

2. Contraceptive Prevalence
1.8      The decline in fertility levels I.S associated with a substartial
increase in the age at marriage (from 19 to 24 years for females during the
1980's) which, in turn, is linked to female education and employment befcre
marriage. It is unlikely that the age of marriage will increase much further.
In addition, an active Family Planning (FP) program initiated in the r>i-
1960s has resulted in significant declines in marital fertility.
1.9      The 1988 Tunisian Demographic and Health Survey found that virtua7.y
100% of Married Women of Fertile Age (MWFA) knew of one or more nrodern
contraceptive methods and 40% were using one of such methods.  An additinralI
10% of MWFA practiced traditional methods, i.e. periodic abstinence and coitus
interruptus.   The use of contraception is, however, unevenly distributed,
whereas 64% of MWFA in Tunis use contraception, the percentage drops to 32%
in the Central-West Region and 41% in the South (see Annex 1, table 1).
Schooling  is also a major differentiating  factor.   While only  42% of
illiterate MWFA practiced FP, 57% of those with primary education and 66% with
secondary education practiced. MWFA with secondary education have on average
2.7 fewer children than illiterate ones, and 1.5 fewer than MWFA with primary
edu^ation.



1.10     Clinical methods, i.e. those that require the involvement of health
personnel in a clinic context such as contraceptive sterilization and the
Intra Uterine Device (IUD), are clearly the most prevalent FP methods. While
these methods are highly effective, the dependence on medical staff and
physical infrastructure presents a constraint for servicing rural populations.
To overcome this constraint, the "Office National de la Famille et de la
Population'  (ONFP)  has re-ently introdlced  injectable contraceptives  and
implants, equally reliable methods, which can be delivered outside a clinical
context, e.g. in pharmacies and "meeting points".   In addition, a "social
marketing  of  contraceptives"  project,   managed  by  ONFP,   distributes
contraceptive pills and condoms at subsidized pricee through commercial
wholesalers and pharmacists. (For detailed service delivery data see Annex
1, Tables 2, and 3.) Abortion in legal in Tunisia and available on request.
As it is not considered a family planning method, abortion is not included
in the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR).
1.11     The number of abortions, fluctuating between 20,000 and 23,000 per
year (a ratio of one abortion per 10 live births), has remained virtually
constant over the last 15 years, demonstrating that the decline in fertility
is due to preventive programs,  i.e.  family planning.   The low ratio of
abortions to live births in a country where abortion is legal also indicates
that abortion tends to be used as a fall-back mechanism for contraceptive
failure and not as a FP method.   A patient who receives an abortion  is
routinely counseled about FP methods and given priority for receiving reliable
FP methods.
1.12     In spite of the increases in the CPR, the needs for contraceptive
protection are not yet satisfied.   The 1988 Demographic and Health Survey
found that about 57% of Tunisian women desired to halt childbearing completely
and 21.3% to delay the next birth for at least two years. In rural areas,
25% did not want any more children while 25% wanted to postpone the next
birth. This data suggests a strong nationwide market for FP. In addition,
there are indications that poor quality of FP services discourages continued
practice of FP. Fully 60% of married women of reproductive age (MWRA) have
used a modern method in the past. but now only 40% are using them. This is
a high drop-out rate. The primary reason given for discontinuation is fear
of side effects, which indicates that counseling and the quality of services
should be improved to retain clients in the program.
3. Family Planning Policies
1.13     The significant advances made in moderating population growth are
due to the strong and consistent commitment by the Government to its multi-
sectoral population policy and its determination to achieve the quantitative
goals. However, consensus about the most appropriate policies and strategies
for the delivery of FP services has been more difficult to achieve.   The
debate has centered around "vertical" programs and "integrated" approaches.
"Vertical" FP programs deliver only contraceptive methods, i.e. birth control,
while "integrated" FP programs address, in addition, the health concerns of
mothers and children to bolster reproductive health and child survival. In
practice, the Government has made choices based on expediency and has



- 6 -
supported both approaches although the emphasis has been on vertical progra.m
The experience gained has laid a blueprint for future directions for the
program. It is therefore relevant to describe here the evolution of service
delivery policies and the lessons learned since the initiation of the program.
1.14     When the family planning program was initiated in 1964, the
Ministry of Health (MOH) was charged with the provision of FP services as
an integral part of its health activities. However, due to the Ministry's
focus on curative hospital care and the shortages in personnel and other
resources, service delivery expanded only slowly, to 38 service points by
1973. This low level of activity did not meet the demographic objectives of
the GOT.
1.15     To accelerate the FP effort, the Government created,  in 1973, a
specialized  institution,  the  "Office National  de  la Famille et  de  la
Population" (ONFP), charged with the responsibility to carry out a mission
of research, orientation, coordination and delivery of population and FP
activities. This policy was supported by the Bank and other major population
sector donors and reflected the belief, prevalent in the 1970s, that vertical
programs were the most effective approach to motivate the public tc accept
FP.  Adequate grant and loan financing of the population program,  strong
political commitment to its success, and substantial technical assistance,
contributed to the rapid expansion of the program and rapid increases in
contraceptive prevalence (see Annex 1, Tables 4 and 5).
1.16     By 1980, it became increasingly evident that the vertical approach
to FP service delivery was effective in serving women who had a pre-existing
demand for fertility regulation, i.e. the urban and better educated, yet it
was less effective in generating demand among groups in adverse social
settings, i.e. the poor and rural populations.  Regional differentials in
fertility levels and disparities in the practice of FP among social groups
increased, thereby demonstrating the limits of success with the vertical
approach. Furthermore, the institutional separation between the FP progran
anc the Basic Health Care (BHC) services led to the neglect of maternal care
and contributed to exacerbating the disparities in health indicators between
social  classes  and  regions.   The ONFP,  conscious  of  its  mandate  and
responsibility to implement the population policy, lacked confidence in the
capacity of the BHC system to deliver FP services, in the required quantity
and quality, given the lack of re3ources available.
1.17     Encouraged and supported by donors (see paras 1.48 and 1.51), the
MOH expanded its involvement in FP/Maternal and Child Health (MCH) by
experimenting with pilot integrated projects which introduced and strengthened
FP and MCH within the context of BHC services in a number of geographical
areas. These projects demonstrated that the provision of FP services, as an
integral part of the BHC package, is more sensitive to the clients as
counseling and services can be provided in the course of other visits for
other services, and are therefore more effective in attracting those women
who are less pre-disposed to practice FP. In addition, the availability of
staff trained in FP strengthens maternal care, a neglected service thus far.
The projects also demonstrated that the shortages which had prompted the



initiation of the vertical FP program i.e. in female staff and material
resources, could be overcome at a reasonable cost.
1.18     As a result, the Government started, in the mid-1980, to re-examine
its FP service delivery approaches and the debate on the relative merits of
vertical versus integrated approaches sharpened strategic thinking on future
directions of the population program. A short overview of the experience of
the program and the prevailing strengths and weaknesses of the three
significant sources of FP services: (i) the ONFP, (ii) the Basic Health Care
(BHC) network, and (iii) the private sector, is useful here to document the
current situation.
4. Family Plannna service Deliver,
1.19     The ONFP, the institution charged with the implementation of the
population policy, is financially autonomous and depends on the following
authorities: (i) a Supreme Council which defines its general directions; the
Prime Minister is President and the Minister of Health is Vice-President;
(ii) the Ministry of Health under which authority the ONFP is placed and to
which its personnel formally belong; (iii) and an Administrative Council
composed of a "President Directeur General" (PDG) and eight other members
designated by the MOH, which is responsible for day-to-day management of the
ONFP. The ONFP's service delivery strategies are summarized below.
1.20     A key responsibility of the ONFP is establishing FP service delivery
targets for the 23 governorates in accordance with the goals of tne GOT's
population policy. This responsibility is managed through regional delegates
which have direct knowledge of implementation capacities and field conditions.
Achievement of the targets is monitored through the supervision system,
service statistics, evaluations and operations research.   At the national
level, ONFP implements a strong program of public education and coordinates
population related activities with other Ministries and the Regional
Administrative Structure to assure a multi-sectoral approach to population
activities.
1.21     The ONFP service delivery system includes one training center and
one regional family planning center (Centre Regional d'Education et Planning
Familiale (CREPF)] in each of the governorates which provide a full range of
family planning services (including contraceptive sterilizations and
therapeutic abortions).   In addition,  ONFP provides FP services  in BHC
facilities through scheduled visits by 67 ONFP mobile teams to over half of
the BHC facilities (800 out of 1505) whose own staff cannot or do not provide
such services. ONFP also operates 10 mobile clinics which serve hamlets where
no fixed health facilities exist and manages a "social marketing of
contraceptive program" to distribute contraceptives (orals and IUD's) through
commercial wholesalers and pharmacies at subsidized prices. Countrywide, the
ONFP has about 1200 staff and a non-salary budget of TD4 million (1990).
1.22     The ONFP currently provides about 2/3 of all FP services in the
public sector and can be credited for most of the progress made in FP
prevalence (see Annex 1, Tables 4 and 5). A clear sense of purpose, adequate



- 8 -
financing (primarily through grant aid) and high quality technical assistance
throughout most of its existence explain its excellent performance. Grant
aid has however sharply declined over the last five years and now amounts to
only about 10% of ONFP's budget. The bi-lateral aid program with the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) has come to an end in
December lSQO and, in the future, funding is expected to be forthcoming, at
a much lower level, from special programs on a competitive basis with other
eligible countries.   As a result, at least one (financing) and possibly
another one (technical assistance) of the three factors for success are at
risk (see Annex 1, Table 6). This has led the Government to re-evaluate future
strategies and priorities (see 1.37).
1.23     The BHC System.   In parallel with ONF4P's swift expansion, the MOH
ha3 also increased its FP service delivery capacity (see para 1.51) but at
a slower pace. It now provides integrated FP and MCH services in 16% of its
clinics (as compared to 55% of clinics ::eceiving FP services from ONFP through
visits.) However, only a fraction of the potential of the BHC network to
deliver FP services has so far been realized.  A 1987 survey of BHC staff
demonstrates this point: only 52% of midwives, less than 20% of physicians,
and only 5% of nurses had any involvement in FP service delivery or
counseling.  This lack of involvement by BHC staff in FP service delivery can
be explained by the fact that physicians and nurses, until recently, did not
receive pre- or in-service training in FP and were not motivated to provide
such services because ONFP's staff used to receive performance incentives not
available to BHC staff and ONFP disposed of more operating resources.
1.24     The Private Sector.  The private sector has not played a major role
in FP service delivery because users who could afford private services have
adequate access to free high quality specialized services offered by ONFP and
the Social Security clinics.  As a result, only 10% of IUD insertions and
contraceptive sterilizations were carried out in the private sector. Private
sector involvement is more evident in the provision of supplies, i.e.
contraceptive pills, condoms and injectables (which are subsidized through
the social marketing program.) The Government intends to stimulate private
sector participation in FP by training private physicians and health staff
in workplace based services. This strategy is likely to be supported by USAID
through  technical  assistance  and  project  grants.          Non-governmental
organization (NGO) participation in FP is very limited in scope. It is likely
that the early commitment to population activities by the Government has pre-
empted the emergence of NGOs strong in FP advocacy and service delivery.
1.25     ComDlementarv roles in service delivery.   Several  factors have
contributed to a recent re-evaluation of the relative roles of ONFP, the BHC
system and the private sector in FP service delivery. The key factors are:
(i) the reduction in grant aid for ONFP which eliminated its salary advantages
and reduced operating funds; (ii) the introduction of FP as a module in
physician and nurse training colleges; and (iii) successful pilot "integrated"
projects (see para 1.18 and 1.51). The conclusions reached on future policy
directions and program strategies are discussed below (paras 1.35 to 1.45).



C.  ELT3 AND WUTRITION
1.26     Health and Nutrition Status.  In the last three decades, the health
status  of  Tunisians  hab  improved  significantly  due  to  better  living
conditions, greater access to education, improvements in nutrition, the
development of both preventive and curative health care services, and lower
birth rates. Life expectancy has increased from 48 years in 1960 to 66 years
in 1988.   The IMR of 51 deaths per 1000 live births is the lowest in the
Maghreb and about average for lower middle income countries. However, this
progress has not been equally distributed.   A recently completed study on
Infant Mortality entitled "Un enfant et deux Tunisies", found that the IMR
in rural areas (68 per 1,000) is more than double that of urban areas (32 per
1,000.) In those areas where infant mortality is high, fertility levels are
also high, indicating that access to FP and to child health services are
deficient in the same geographical areas (see Annex 1, Tables 7 and 8.)
1.27     Though severe malnutrition is rare in Tunisia, i.e. 3% of children
between 3 months and 3 years, 15% of those children suffer from mild
malnutrition. Stunted growth is especially elevated in the south and central
regions of the country. Tunisia is located in the zinc deficiency belt, thus
some of the stunting may be due to zinc deficiency as well as the usual
undernutrition and infection complex. Nutrition is linked to infant and child
morbidity and school performance which in turn have an indirect effect on
future fertility aspirations.
1.28     Data from the 1988 Tunisian Demographic and Health Survey  (DHS)
record a national average of 13% women (8% in urban areas and 16% in rural
areas) who exclusively breastfeed their infants in the first four months
after birth. This is a low breastfeeding prevalence and is likely to be a
significant contributory factor to infant mortality and morbidity and low
nutrition status.   It also indicates that women do not fully benefit from
the contraceptive protection provided by frequent breastfeeding. The average
number of months that a mother continues to breastfeed varies by the
educational  status  of  the  mother  and  by  the  level  of  socio-economic
development of the region.   Uneducated women breastfeed for an average of
18.2 months, women who have completed primary education for 13 months and
women with more education 9.8 months.  In urban areas, women breastfeed for
a shorter period of time (Tunis 10.3 months, Central-East 14.7 months, and
North East 14.9 months) than in rural areas of the North West (19.1 months)
and Central-West (18.0 months). The South is in an intermediate position at
15.5 months (see Annex 1, Table 9).
1.29     The Health System.  In the post-colonial era, the emphasis has been
on the increase of access to health care services. The ratio of population
per physician has decreased from one physician per 8,000 population in 1965
to one per 1,750 population in 1989. However, urban areas have benefitted
disproportionally from this expansion of services, as illustrated by the 1989
physician per population ratios which are 1 per 800 in Tunis and 1 per 2,000
population in rural governorates. Almost 50% of physicians are specialized,
of whom 72% have teaching responsibilities. This specificity reinforces the
urban hospital based orientation of the Tunisian health care system since



- 10 -
specialist services are primarily available in the University Hospitals and
Specialist Institutes.
1.30     Public Health Facilities.  The Tunisian health care system has also
developed significantly in terms of physical infrastructure. Designed as a
coherent network, public health facilities are strategically located and
classified according to the level of care provided.  In 1989, University,
Regional and District Hospitals provided 58%, 30% and 13% respectively of the
number of days in hospitals, reversing the normal pyramid-type constellation.
1.31     At the first lev-l  the 95 District Hospitals and 6 free-standing
maternities, 1505 BHC centers and 2140 "meeting points", are intended to
provic.e basic ambulatory care and first level hospital services. The size
and staffing of the BHC facilities vary with the size of the population being
served and the population density. About half of the BHC facilities are of
the smallest type (type I and type II) and are staffed by paramedics only,
usually males (see Annex 1, table 10 for a complete listing of BHC facilities
by type). To maximize the use of scarce human resources and provide access
to higher levels of expertise, those small centers are periodically visited
by itinerant physicians, midwives and nurses. However, due to the age of the
vehicle pool and their lack of maintenance, the arrival of medical teams is
often unpredictable and irregular.
1.32     In addition, service quality and diagnostic capabilities are severely
deficient. The physical structures are in disrepair, equipment is scarce or
absent and essential drugs are unavailable for substantial periods of time.
This results in low technical attractiveness of the peripheral units for
service providers and patients alike. Low quality of EHC is the root cause
of the dramatic differentials in health status between urban and rural areas
and social classes.  Pr-ients who have the opportunity to do so turn towarda
better equipped regional and teaching hospitals which, as a result, are
overburdened by patients that could have been treated at a lower level of
care, at an earlier stage and at lower cost. Midwives, who are vital for the
delivery of maternal care (as well as FP), are sparsely spread over the BHC
network because of the more attractive job opportunities in the hospital
sector.
1.33     At the higher level of care. the 22 Regional Hospitals are the second
referral level, located in the major urban city of the Governorate, and are
designed to provide the population with some specialist care and hospital
services. The third level of care, the 19 Teaching and General Hospitals and
4 Specialized Institutions, are located in the four largest urban poles
(Tunisia, Monastir, Sousse and Sfax) and offer the highest level of care.
1.34     Health Expenditures.  Health expenditures were estimated at 4.5% of
GDP in 1989  (or USS62 per person per year).   This compares to health
expenditures of 5% to 8% of GDP in other middle income countries.  Public
sector expenditures represented 44.3% of total health expenditures (recurrent
and investment budgets) and finance 50% of the ambulatory care visits and
about 90% of the hospitalizations. Both the hospital sector, which consumes



- 11 -
70% of MOH resources, and BHC have suffered from insufficient budgetary
allocations as MOH resources declined, in real terms, from 2.5% in 1985 to
2.3% in 1989.   Since 1989,  the Government has started to redress this
situation by committing to a progressive increase in the allocations to the
MOH. This is likely to be reflected in the Public Expenditures Program of
the VIIth Development Plan now in preparation.   At the same time,  the
efficiency of the hospital sector is to be enhanced through the Hospital
Restructuring Support project developed in parallel with this project. As
burden-sharing arrangements between the Government and the social insurance
program are improved and efficiency in hospital management achieved, the
resources of the public health sector would increase and permit a better
repartition of resources within the sector.  This would assist the Government
in its efforts to maintain the BHC system at an adequate level.

1.35     DemograDhic Challenees.  The GOT intends to address the challenges
of the next phase of the demographic transition to achieve zero population
growth by the year 2026.  If fertility continues to decline at a moderate
rate to attain replacement level (i.e. one daughter per woman) by the year
2010 (an achievable goal while maintaining the voluntary and non-coercive
nature of the population program), the momentum derived from the gqe structure
will maintain low rates of population growth up to the year 2026.  To achieve
replacement level fertility by 2010, the current TFR of 3.45 children per
woman should reach a level of 2.98 by 1996.  This implies that the CPR of 40%
for modern contraceptive methods has to increase to 45% of married women of
fertile age (MWFA), all other factors remaining equal, e.g. age at marriage,
duration of breastfeeding, proportions married, etc. Due to the large influx
of young women into the reproductive age groups (the result of past high
levels of fertility), about 30,000 additional couples should adopt FP each
year in tie public sector and about 20,000 additional couples in the private
sector (physicians and pharmacists) while continuing to serve the half million
(528,000) currently practicing couples.
1.36     According to the study entitled  "Un enfant et deux Tunisies",
fertility in rural areas (TFR: 5.7) is significantly higher than in urban
areas (TFR: 3.4) and about half of the Tunisian population is rural.  The
target group of women to be recruited as new FP acceptors will therefore
increasingly be the rural poor.   The population groups with the highest
fertility also suffer disproportionally from high infant mortality, child
morbidity and low education  levels.   Consequently,  their motivation to
practice FP is weak.   They also have the least access to FP and maternal
services. Combining FP with MCH and other BHC services, as practiced in a
minority of centers, maximizes the impact on health and FP status, increases
staff productivity, and reduces the patient flow to hospitals. However, the
low share of the health budget spent on BHC has prevented a generalization
of the integrated service model. Low staff morale and operating resources
in the BHC system also discouraged the ONFP from entrusting the delivery of
FP services to the routine BHC services.



- 12 -
1.37     Future Directions.  The Government, in full agreement with the MOH
and ONFP, has decided to accelerate the integration of FP and MCH into the
routine BHC services because integrated services have proven to be more cost-
efficient to address disparities in fertility and mortality levels and more
effective in attracting the specific target groups to FP. The Bank and other
donors to the Tunisian population program (notably USAID and United Nations
Fund For Population Activities (UNFPA) fully agree with thib approach, while
pointing out that improving the quality of BHC must be pursued simultaneously
to obtain the desired results. This will require a recurrent budget which
is sufficient to sustain a minimum acceptable level of service quality. The
experience of ONFP in FP service delivery would be mobilized by the MOH for
training, supervision, operations research and the monitoring of FP services.
Reducing ONFP's service delivery burden through integration of FP services
with the routine BHC activities would have the additional benefit that ONFP
can concentrate its efforts on the development of innovative strategies such
as promotion of the private sector, social marketing, and public education.
USAID will continue to assist the ONFP to pursue these low-cost strategies.
1.38     The GOT proposes to phase the integration effort over a 10-year
period.   This is a realistic goal which takes into account the need to
transfer skills and experience from one institution to another. To ensure
that FP will not loose its priority in the multitude of problems facing BHC
services, the process of "integration" would be subject to a system of checks
and balances with the full involvement of ONFP which has the most experience
in the subject matter.
1.39      The MOH is well aware that the overall credibility of BHC services
is low due to insufficient recurrent budgets and low staff morale. However,
the low share of the MOH in the GDP (see para 1.34), escalating cost of
hospital care and the inefficiencies in the management and financing of
hospitals, have so far obstructed a redistribution of resources within the
sector. Two key reforms are needed to assist the Government in achieving an
efficient and affordable health system: (i) reform of the financing and
management of hospitals. This reform will be supported by the Bark through
a Hospital Restructuring Reform project (to be presented to the Board
simultaneously); and (ii) reform of FP/MCH service delivery strategies within
a stronger BHC system. This second reform will ensure that health services
will be provided at the lowest and least costly level of care.
1.40     To improve the credibility of the BHC system and to attract better
staff to those facilities, the Government intends to increase the share of
BHC (including district hospitals) in the recurrent budget of the MOH from
the current 30% to 40% by the end of the project period. During Negotiations
the Government provided assurances that the annual growth rate of the BHS non-
salary operatiag budget would be positive and at least equal to the annual
growth rate of the overall MOR non-salary operating budget. During yearly
prospective reviews and the final evaluation, achievement of this goal will
be monitored and assessed.
1.41     Geographical Distribution of Resources.  To assist the Government
to achieve an equitable distribution of BHC resources, the MOH has developed,



- 13 -
with Bank assistance, an inventory of existing BHC resources (infrastructure,
personnel and vehicles) by governorate. These resources have been pro-rated
by population size and adjustment factors introduced for dispersion, strength
of the private sector and difficulties of access/road infrastructure. On that
basis, an index of relative degrees of access to BHC services has been
developed, i.e. adjusted ratios of clinics and different categories of health
care staff per 1000 population in accordance with the standards adopted by
the Government for the development of the BHC structure. A "needs index" has
been developed based on those adjusted ratios to indicate what an ideal
distribution of resources (In accordance with the Tunisian standards) would
look like. The "needs index" indicates priority areas for the allocation of
project investments and serves as a tool to measure progress on improving
equitable access to BHC services (mm Ann-x 1, table 11) during the project
period.
1.42     It must be realized however that satisfaction of unmet needs cannot
be the only rationale for determining resource allocation during the VIIIth
Development Plan.   Limits to redistribution are set by the necessity to
maintain the existing network of BHC services (see Annex 2, table 8) and the
affordability of further expansion. The improvement of BHC in underserved
areas and adherence to the "needs index" as a guide for resource allocation
will therefore be, to the extent feasible, by preferential resource allocation
to underserved areas.  It is not suggested to reduce BHC resources in the
areas which already have access and resources above the Tunisian standards;
firstly, because the standards indicate minimum acceptable levels; secondly,
because once the physical infrastructure exists, human resources are needed
to complement _t; and, thirdly, closure of well frequented clinics is socially
undesirable.
1.43     The allocation of resources, in particular of vehicles and equipment,
would be closely coordinated with the timing of recruitment of appropriate
staff, in particular midwives, for specific areas. Detailed planning for the
recruitment and assignment of staff is only possible on a yearly basis.  The
MOH will therefore prepare Yearly Resource Allocation -nd Implementation Plans
which specify its resource allocation plans by governorate and define the
location of centers to receive additional staff and material resources.
1.44     In those areas which already have a fair  share of  resources,
government policy is to improve quality of services through training,
technical support and refurbishing of the physical infrastru_..ture without
expanding staff numbers and infrastructure.  This would ens-.'e that deprived
areas obtain a (gradual) redress in resource availabilit; while more favored
areas maintain the existing level of resources (for ;. growing population).
1.45     The Government provided assurances, during Negotiations, that the
yearly Resource Allocation and Implementation Plans, will be submitted to
the Bank by December 30 of each year for review and comments. Resources for
expansion would be distributed in accordance with the "needs index". As a
condition of loan effectiveness, the Resource Allocation and Implementation
Plan for the first year of project operation will be submitted to the Bank
for review and comments.

1.46     Experience with Past Lending and the Bank's Role.  Tunisia was one
of the first recipients of Bank group lending for population activities with
a US$4.8 million IDA credit approved in 1971. The project was designed to
strengthen the Tunisian FP program by improving access to FP and MCH.  It
provided for: (i) the construction and equipment of four maternity hospitals,
29 MCH centers and an extension of the Avicenne Paramedical Training School
in Tunis; and (ii) the provision of management consultants and technical
assistance for paramedical training and the evaluation of the MCH/FP program.
The project, first administered by the MOH ane later, from 1974, by the ONFP,
was scheduled for completion by the end of 1975, but was not completed until
1981. As a result of the delays in implementation and price escalation, the
total estimated cost increased to about US$35 million, up from the initial
Appraisal estimate of US$7 million.  Additional financing was provided by
NORAD (the Norwegian Development Agency) and the Government. The project's
impact on FP acceptance and MCH status was substantial although difficult to
quantify due to a shortage of benchmark data.   The training activities
financed under the project contributed to an important expansion in the number
of paramedics.
1.47     A second Health atid Population project was identified in 1977.
Preparation took more than three years.  The IBRD loan of US$12.5 million
became effective in 1982. The loan closing date was extended twice from the
original of December 31, 1986 to September 30, 1989. US$4 million of the Loan
was cancelled in March 1987 due to dramatic appreciation of the US dollar.
The overall purpose of the project was to integrate FP services with
preventive and curativa care, nutrition, health education and sanitation
services in 8 governorates. The project comprised the following components:
(i) construction and/or remodelling of 140 health posts, 325 dispensaries,
90 staff houses, 2 regional health education centers, 6 paramedical schools
and 8 maintenance workshops; (ii) strengthening of the MOH managenent capacity
through the provision of a Management Information System (MIS); (iii) a
national health education program; and (iv) a training system and its
infrastructure, and training and redeployment of health personnel in the
project areas.
1.48     The  Project  Completion  Report  (October  11,  1990)  lists  as
achievements of the project: (i) strengthening of the BHC capabilities and
the commitment of the MOH to BHC; (ii) establishment, staffing and providing
equipment for major BHC infrastructure in 8 governorates; and (iii) an
improved health training system. However, significant factors impeded full
achievement of the project objectives:
a.    institutional overlap between the MOH and the ONFP prevented the
planned integration of FP/MCH in the BHC services;
b.    a combination of project complexity, scale and inadequate preparation
affected achievement of the MIS, health education and applied
research components;



- is -
c.    the Borrower's reluctance to use technical assistance funds affected
the quality of training programs, civil works supervision and use
of consultants; and
d.    cumbersome bidding and evaluation procedures delayed procurement.
1.49     Other Lessons  Learned.    The  Bank  has  consistently  emphasized
preventive and simple curative care and the integration of FP into the routine
BHC services. Though significant progress was made, the project fell short
of the desired result for a number of reasons: (i) the inefficiency ot the
hospital sector which consumes most of the sector resources. This issue will
be addressed by the proposed Bank financed Hospital Restructuring Support
Project; (ii) the preference of health staff to work in urban areas and
hospital surroundings.   This factor has diminished in importance due to a
better supply of staff competing for fewer job opportunities in the cities
and the recent introduction of compulsory service in assigned areas for public
health physicians, for a period of 2 years; and (iii) the squeeze in budgetary
resources for recurrent costs which will be addressed through an increase in
overall health sector resources and a larger share for BHC within the overall
budget (para 1.40).
1.50     Other External Assistance to the Population and Health Sectors.
Vaccination and oral rehydration programs were initiated and are on-going
with UNICEF support. USAID has provided overall program support to ONFP for
over 25 years. Due to competition for graz.t funds from countries with even
more urgent needs, Tunisia has now "graduated" to project funding only i.e.
for discreet  types of activities.   Integrated projects,  introduced and
supported by bi-lateral donors, such as Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and
Norway, have been completed and were successful in demonstrating the
effectiveness of such approaches. After completion, these activities continue
with MOH support and, in spite of some decline in quality due to insufficient
operating budgets, remain successful.   The UNFPA is currently financing a
project integrating FP/MCH in the BHC system. This project is very promising
and, together with the completed bi-lateral integrated approaches, has served
the GOT as the model for both future FP service delivery strategies and the
proposed Bank operation. The UNFFA will continue its support for integrated
FP/MCH services during the VIlIth Development Plan in particular through
research, training, strengthening of the Management Information system, basic
equipment and contraceptives.
1.51     The bi-laterally funded integrated projects benefitted from intensive
technical assistance support and adequate resources which were key factors
for their success. For various reasons (see para 1.50), the Bank's project
(TUN-2005) achieved some key objectives but did not succeed in furthering the
integration effort. Currently, all donors support and recommend integrated
FP/MCH services within the BHC network as the most viable strategy to motivate
and expand FP practice among those women who have not yet adopted the
practice.

1.52     Links  with  Other  Human  Resources OperationS  in  Tunisia.    A;
mentioned, population activities are closely related to other human resourceo
issues such as health, education and employment with a mutually benef  &.a'
effect.  The Bank's Human Resources sector program for Tun.esia also includes
other planned operations: (a) Hospital Restructuring, FY91, (b) Employi..ert.
and Training, FY90, and (c) Higher Education, FY92, which will, directly arl
indirectly, contribute to the objectives of the Population and Family Health
Operation through improving social indicators of the Tunisian population and
reducing regional disparities in education and employment prospects.   Ihe
achievement of population objectives with che assistance of this project, in
turn, will facilitate human resources development through moderating the rate
of populatinn growth.
P.  RATIONALE FOR FUER  BANK IVOLVUIT
1.53     This population and family planning project is an opportunity to
consolidate the sporadic Bank involvement in population and health activities
in Tunisia over the last two decades and to assist the government of a country
which has maintained strong political commitment to achieving zero population
growth through a voluntary non-coercive FP program. At a time when the h rd-
to reach geographical areas and the poorest social strata need attention and
other donor support is curtailed, moving the contraceptive prevalence rate
to a much higher p4iteau  i- .~ difficult challenge.   The Government  is
committed to address those demographic challenges through an integratel
approach to FP service delivery which will also reduce disparities in heaith
status. The project has the full commitment of the Government, including the
MOH and ONFP, and deserves strong Bank support.
1.54     In addition, the strong commitment of the Government to bring about
a fundamental reform in both population and health atrategies   provides a
unique opportunity to simultaneously improve the efficiency of the health
sector and the quality of FP services through strengthening of BHC.   The
proposed  Hospital  Restructuring  Support  Project  will   facilitate  a
comprehensive restructuring of major teaching and specialized hospitals ani
improve the burden-sharing arrangements between the State, insurers anJ
patients. The two health sector operations address the fundamental reforms
necessary for increasing health sector resources, improving efficiency ar:_
achieving the goals of the population policy.
1.55     Finally,  Tunisia is expected to host the 1994 World Populaticr
Conference.   This is a proper venue as Tunisia has achieved significant
progress on the demographic transition and is a trailblazer in the provision
of FP services within the African continent and the Arab World. Renewed Bank
support for population operations in the country would receive high visibility
and might encourage other countries to adopt similar strategies.

A. PROJICT OwJUCTIVUS
2.1     The objectives of the Population and Family Health project are to
increase the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) for modern methods from 40%
to 45% and to improve the health status of the population, especially of women
and children in rural areas.  These objectives would be puirsued through two
strategies:
a.    strengthening of family planning and maternal and child health services
(FP/MCH) within an improved Basic Health Care (BHC) package;
b.    targeting BHC for population groups with the highest fertility and
mortality levels and inadequate access to BHC services.
3   PROJtCT DRSCRIPTIu
2.2     The proposed project is designed to cover the first S-year phase of a
10-year assistance program.   In this first phase,  the focus would be on
strengthening and expanding FP and MCH service., as a routine component of BHC
services, with particular emphasis on underserved areas. In addition, FP/MCH
outreach and the first referral level of care would be strengthened. In the
second phase, the focus would be on consolidating the gains of the first phase
and on linking the improved BHC system to higher lIfvels of care through an
effective referral system.
2.3     The project consists of 4 components:
-  integrating FP/MCH services in fixed BHC facilities;
- expanding outreach services to increase access to basic health and
FP services;
- improving the first referral level of health care; and
- quality enhancement of the BHC system.
2.4     The  project  would  provide  for:  (i)  the  refurbishing  of  the
infrastructure and equipment of the BHC centers to both permit the provision
of FP/MCH and improve the quality of BHC; (ii) the replacement and expansion
of vehicles for outreach activities in underserved areas; (iii) the acquisition
and replacement of ambulances and equipment for the first referral level; (iv)
the provision of expert services and teaching aids for a continuous training
program  for  BHC  staff;  (v)  spare parts  and technical  assistance  for  a
maintenance system for vehicles, equipment and buildings; and (vi) the financing
of operations research, impact evaluations and technical assistance.

1.  Inteqratin FPC In Fixed BBC Facilities (US510.3 millioan
2.5     Family Planning.  FP services would be provided by female Ministry of
Health Btaff who have received pre- or in-service training in FP and MCH, and/or
physLcians (see para. 2.15). The target number of women to be served will be
set by the Office National de la Famille et de la Population (ONFP), in
accordance with current practices, to meet the national target to increase the
CPR (for modern methods) from 40 to 45% by 1996.  The specific targets per
governorate will be agreed upon by the Regional Health Directors and approved
by the Project Steering Committee in the context of the Yearly Resource
Allocation and Implementation Plans. Supervision would be ensured through the
regional project team and, when necessary, remodial training provided through
the regional ONFP supervising midwife, on the job or in ONFP's specialized
centers. Additional performance monitoring, i.e. for meeting service delivery
targets, will be by analysis of service statistics, sentinel centers and
periodic surveys (see para 2.16).
2.6     Specialized Family Planning Centers (CREPF8.   The regional CREPFs
(specialized family planning center managed by ONFP) will continue to provide
FP referral care and surgical services. Tunis is the only governorate with no
CREPF to serve as a FP referral facility. The project would provide for the
upgrading of an existing small FP center, located in a populous area of Tunis,
to be fully equipped as a CREPF.  The upgraded facility would also accommodate
an existing depot for contraceptives managed by ONFP.
2.7     Maternal Care.  In additioin to FP, safe motherhocd would be one of the
key project objectives. All physicians and female staff ..n clinical settings
and outreach service delivery, i.e. midwives, obstetrical nurses and other
nurses, would receive initial training or refresher tra- ;.ng in gynecological
screening and pre- and postnatal care (see para. 2.15',.  .'"is would assist the
qovernment's efforts to increase the nationail average of t,t !.east one visit for
pre-natal care from 67% of women to 85%, and for 4 visits (focused on high risk
pregnancies) from 21% to 40k.  The pe-centage of women rece,' ng post-natal care
would increase from 39% to 50% by tht. end of the project p;:.iod and include FP
counseling (see Annex 2, tables 1 to 5) to ensure spa7 t.ag of births and
protection of breast feeding.
2.8     In rural areas, the proportion of women delivering withi the assistance
of a trained health care worker is 59%.  No reliable statiso.cs are available
to assess differentials in maternal morte.lity yet clinic records indicate that
a large proportion of maternal mortality  (and complications of childbirth
affecting infants) could have been prevented by timely referral to appropriate
levels of care.  The project would strengthen the infrastructLre for normal
childbirth in district hospitals and peripheral maternities and increase the
rate of assisted deliveries from 59% to 70%. Ambulances would be provided to
facilitate transport to higher levels of care as needed.  A survey has been
initiated to establish baseline data for the *evaluation of project achievement.
2.9     Child Health Services.  Well-baby-care and under-five-clinics would be
introduced in the 75% of BHC clinics that currently provide immunization



- 19 -
services. The expansion of child services is easier to realize than services
directed at women because it is culturally acceptable for male nurses, the only
type of staff in most of the smallest type of clinics, to Berve children.
Screening of infants, growth monitoring and health education for mothers,
especially for the promotion of birth spacing and breastfeeding, would be a
strong feature of the services available at the BHC clinics. Detected cases
of malnutrition would be reported to the social services for an analysiB of the
family's social and economic situation and long term assistance provided through
those channels.
2.10    To identify the specific needs for extension/rehabilitation of the
physical facilities of the BHC system and for equipment, the Regional Health
Directors have updated the listing of c-nters (including district hospitals)
with consideration of the number of spaces, equipment, state of repair, etc.
and have compared this information with the standards developed for and agreed
with the Bank for the previous project (Health and Population Loan 2005-TUN).
The project would finance the priority needs identified which involves civil
works and equipment for about 35% of the centers.   Specifically:  (i) the
extension and rehabilitation of about 160 existing centers to adapt the
infrastructure to the need for privacy in the provision of FP/MCH, and (ii) the
provision of essential small equipment for about 400 centers.
2.  Bwandina Outreach Services To Increase Access To FP And CH
(USs 18.6 *illion)
2.11    The project would support two outreach strategies: (a) by outreach
teams, utilized by the BHC system as well as the ONFP, to provide access to
physicians  and nurses  in hamlets which have the smallest type of health
structures (type I and type II); and (b) by mobile clinics.
(a)   Outreach  FP teams.       As  320  BHC centers  gradually  assume
responsibility for FP/MCH service delivery during the project period,
visits by ONFP outreach FP teams would become redundant in those places.
Twenty six ONFP teams would thus become available for expansion of
visiting services to those BHC clinics which do not provide any kind
of FP services and to increase the visiting frequency to those clinics
that are currently being (sporadically) served.  The new itineraries
for the "mobile teams" will be determined in yearly plans by the
regional delegate of ONFP and agreed upon by the Regional Health
Director.    The  itineraries  would  be  reviewed  by  the  project
implementation team and endorsed by the project steering committee.
As 16% of BHC centers currently provide FP and MCH as a regular part
of their services and ONFP visiting teams provide FP sessions in 55%
of BHC centers, a quarter of all BHC centers do not provide any such
services.   By the end of the project period, FP services would be
integrated in a total of 40% of BHC centers, thus improving quality of
services and regular access. ONFP would then provide services in nearly
all other BHC clinics through visiting teams.



- 20 -
(b)   Outreach with FP/MCH mobile clinics.  The 10 ONFP mobile clinics,
staffed with a midwife and a nurse/educator, serve about t00 assembly
points (out of 2140 points) with monthly Visits. The number of mobile
clinics would be increased to 15 during the project period and serve
an additional 250 points. A study carried out by the Population Council
estimates the cost per woman served in mobile clinics as only slightly
higher  than care delive-ed in a fixed clinical  setting.   As  the
population served by the mobile clinics has no access whatsoever to
other social services (except for immunization provided by male
itinerant paramedics), this is a cost-effective service to reach the
rural underserved with FP. To maximize the benefits of those visits,
the ONFP will also offer screening of children and expand gynecological
services.  Pre-natal care is already available in the mobile clinics
but post-natal check-ups will receive greater emphasis.
2.12    To facilitate outreach by various categories of health staff,  the
project would finance the provision of about 455 vehicles and an initial stock
of spare parts. About three-quarters of those vehicles are replacements for
aged cars which should have been replaced years ago yet, due to financial
constraints,  were not.   Currently,  about half the vehicles are not  fully
operational because of frequent breakdowns, lack of spare parts and high repair
costs. The cars used by outreach teams serve over 1,000 BHC clinics in hamlets
which  have to be  reached over poorly maintained  routes.    Cars  used  for
supervision, school health services and evacuations to the first referral level
of care will be replaced and some additional vehicles provided. In addition,
the project would finance 15 mobile clinics, of which 10 are replacements, to
ensure FP/MCH services in areas without fixed facilities and expansion into new
areas.
2.13    The Ministry of Health  (MOH)  will reinforce  its control  over the
allocation of vehicles through the introduction of a system which will record,
in addition to the current tracking systems, the purpose for which the car is
to be used, the zones in which the vehicle will operate and the type of staff
it will transport.   The regional  project  implementation teams,  under the
direction of the Regional Health Directors, will be responsible for defining
priorities for the allocation of project vehicles and submit their priority
needs to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for approval.   These vehicle
allocations will be a component of the Yearly Resources Allocation and
Implementation Plans to be submitted to the Bank for review and comments (See
1.45). The Regional Health Directors will supervise the vehicle-control system
on behalf of the Project Implementation Unit.

3.  Ilvroving The First Referral Level Of Care (USS8.5 million)
2.14    District Hospitals.       The project would reinforce the quality of
referral care to enhance the credibility of the BHC network and to reduce the
pressure on higher level hospitals.   Under this project,  the coverage and
quality of the services to be provided in district hospitals would be improved
through refurbishing of buildings, provision of additional X-ray and laboratory
equipment for 50 district hospitals and the provision of 158 ambulances.
(a)   Diagnostic Centers.  Five diagnostic centers will be established
in the three largest cities of the country, introducing a new service
delivery channel for ambulatory specialist care in Tunisia. The centers
will make a strong contribution to the quality of care in the BHC
network through streamlining referrals for the usual clientele of BHC
centers i.e. the rural and the poor. This will contribute to raising
the credibility of the system and to the health/equity objectives of
the project. It will also have a beneficial effect on the efficiency
of the health sector as a whole by relieving the flow of patients to
higher level hospitals. Three of those centers will be accomodated in,
to be expanded and refurbished, BHC centers of the larger (type IV) and
two will be new constructions.
(h)   Maternities.  The project would provide for the refurbishment of
the 6 rural maternities to ensure increased capacity to assist normal
deliveries and the care of premature and low birth weight babies. In
addition, the maternities will introduce systematic post-partum
counseling on infant feeding and strengthen FP and gynecological
services.
4.  Quality Enhancesent Of The BBC System (US$16 *illion)
2.1S    The following components would ensure that the quality of the services
to be provided and expanded would be attractive to the clients and enhance the
credibility of the system:
(a)   Technical Trainina.  A comprehensive training program, for BHC
in general and MCH/FP in particular, will be delivered by the MOH for
a majority of BHC staff. (See Annex 2, table 6.) The training will be
at the central level for management staff and for trainers, at the
regional level for paramedics and at the local level for auxiliary
nurses. A training coordination unit for the project has already been
assigned at the central level, consisting of a physician and a senior
paramedic instructor, and training of trainers has started. The MOH
Training and Research Institute will be fully involved. At the regional
level, the in-service training courses will be the responsibility of
the regional training teams under the direction of the Regional Health
Director. The teams consist of the director of the paramedic schools
and a professional manpower trainer. The facilities of the regional
paramedical schools will be used for the training. UNFPA will finance
some of the training activities.



- 22 -
(b)   Management Training. Senior level staff at the governorate level
will be required to participate in a three year, part time Public Health
Master course aimed at improving planning, supervision, evaluation and
training skills. Nine out of eleven training modules have been prepared
and appraised. The other two modules, for management and evaluation,
will be developed with the assistance of external experts during the
project  period.    In  addition,  training  materials  and  technical
information sheets will be developed and regularly updated with
technical assistance provided by Tunisian Medical Schools, the ONFP and
external  consultants.   The project would provide  for a vehicle,
technical assistance, printing and audio-visual equipment for the
training function. The KOH expects that about half the costs of the
planned training programs will be financed by UNFPA and UNICEF. (See
Annex 2, table 7 for a complete listing of training)
(c)   Maintenance.    Maintenance  of  MOH  facilities,  vehicles  and
equipment has been the responsibility of the Regional Health
Directorates in each governorate. Lack of resources and the fact that
responsibility for maintenance does not lie with the primary user have
often led to inadequate maintenance. Available resources are first used
at the hospital level to the detriment of the smaller centers.  To
address this issue, the MOH will prepare a comprehensive maintenance
program for implementation by December 1993, for which 8 staff-weeks
of expert services will be financed (US$20,000.)  In addition, one
maintenance workshop is being equipped on a pilot basis (US$24,000).
A study will be realized by the MOH to assess the cost-effectiveness
of in-house maintenance compared to sub-contracting to the private
sect-r and the feasibility of private sector contracts in the more
ist Ated areas. During Negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that terms of refeLence for a study/evaluation of the BHS maintenance
system for vehicles, equipments and buildings would be reviewed with
the Bank by December 31, 1991; that this study would be carried out by
December 31, 1992; and that all necessary actions would be taken to
implement, by December 31, 1993, a maintenance system based on the
recommendations of this study.
(d)   Pharmaceuticals. Government policy is to provide essential drugs
(a 150 item list) free of charge to consumers. At present, there is
a discrepancy between the value of prescriptions issued by BHC staff
each year (TD$12 million) and the value of drugs supplied to BHC centers
(TDS8 million. )   It would be desirable but not essential  for the
project's performance to ensure the supply of the full range of free
drugs as a large proportion of those drugs is for chronic diseases not
directly related to the project objectives. The project does, however,
fund a sub-list of essential drugs to include contraceptives, vaccines
and other preventive pharmaceuticals for which free or highly subsidized
provision is justified (US$9.8 million).  A regular supply of these
essential drugs will improve quality of services and the credibility
of the BHC system.

by hospitals. It is expected that during the second phase of the BHC
program a formal policy change, away from a wide range of free drugs
towards a limited range of essential drugs, can be developed on the
basis of the findings of the study on prescription practices.
(f)   ContraeeDtives.   Contraceptives have been supplied, until mid-
1990, as commodity aid by the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID). The Government has made available the necessary
foreign  exchange  to  purchase  contraceptives  for  the  immediately
following period in the expectaticn that other donors in the population
field will help to provide assistance for contraceptives, for the full
or for a part of the required amounts, during the VIII Plan period.
The cost of contraceptives needed to meet program needs is estimated
at US$10.6 million fcr the period 1991-94.  So far, UNFPA has confirmed
that it will provide about half the contraceptives required for the
period 1992-1997 while the Netherlands government has confirmed that
it will contribute USS600,000 for 1991/1992.   The latter has not yet
made a commitment  for future years.   To assist the Governrent  in
obtaining further contraceptive commodity aid, the UNFPA will convene
a meeting of potential donors (e.g. Finland and Japan) in March 1991.
During negotiations the Government confirmed that it will make available
the foreign exchange needed to assure the supply of contraceptives for
the national family planning program, the full costs of which have been
included in the recurrent cost budget to be financed by the Government.
The Government also has pending requests for grants to assist in the
financiiAg of this component.
2.16    Research, Evaluations and Technical Assistance.   The Directorate of
BHC has prepared an extensive work program of operations and service research
to be implemented during the project period.  Six studies will be carried out:
(i) Maternal- and peri-natal mortality, in 1991-2 and 1996; (ii) Acceptance and
perceptions of integrated FP/MCH services in BHC facilities, in 1992 and 1996;
(iii) Prospective study on the impact of improved re-animation services fcr the
prevention of handicaps in children, 1991 to 1996; (iv) Patient flow analysis
in BHC facilities of type III and IV, 1991 and 1995; (v) Drug preszrijtion
practices in BHC Facilities, 1993-4; and (vi) Evaluation of the maintenance
system for vehicles, equipment and buildings,  1992.   The first phase of the
studies mentioned under (i) and (iii) has already started with local and WHO
funding; the financial resouices required for the second phase and the other
studies mentioned above are estimated at US$120,000 (TD100,000).

C. ENVIRONXEHTAL CONSIDERATIONS
2.17    No adverse impact on the environment is expected from the proposed
civil works and the health activities.   Moreover, since the proiect would
contribute to reducing population growth and population density, it would seek
to alleviate the pressure exerted by growing human numbers on natural resources.
The proposed project was therefore determined to be in screening category C
which includes projects which seek to enhance environmental conditions.   No
environmental analysis will therefore be prepared for this project.

1/ Local project costs include taxes and duties estimated at US$16.4 million (DT 13.9 million).
2/Provision of contraceptives for the national family planning program, in addition to incremental needs of the project.
3.3       Basis of Cost Estimates.   Costs for construction and extensiorn  of the
BHC centers are based on reviews of recently awarded contracts for comparable
facilities at the Ministry of Health (MOH); these buildings are constructed on
a modular basis according to MOH's standardized plans and building
specifications. The cost of refurbishing the diagnostic centers, contraceptive
depot and district hospitals' dental and x-ray facilities are based on MOH's
estimates of the work involved to bring these facilities up to acceptable
standards and on Bank experience in the previous project (Loan 2005-TUN). These
costs, net of taxes, average US$282 per m2 (TD240 per m2) for BHC centers,
US$123 per m2 (TD105 per m2) for diagnostic centers and US$ 188 per m2 (TD160
per m2) for the contraceptive depot. Furniture and equipment costs have been
estimated on the basis of existing standardized equipment lists and
specifications for each type of center. Costs for office and computer equipment
have been calculated on the basis of mission estimates.   Technical  assistance
costs - US$12,000 per man-month of foreign specialist services and US$7,000 per



- 27 -
man-month of local specialist services  have been estimated on the basis of
recent prices for comparable technical assistance in the Education and Training
Sector Loan (Loan 3054-TUN).   The man-month costs for foreign specialists
include housing, relocation costs, salaries, subsistence, office services, fees,
overheads and recruitment costs.   Base cost estimates  reflect prices  as
projected for the time of Negotiations.
3.4     Customs Duties and Taxes.  Project costs, inicluding taxes and customs
duties to be borne by the MOH, have been estimated at US$16.4 million (TD 13.9
million.)
3.5     Contingencv Allowances.  Project costs include a contingency allowance
for unforeseen physical additions (US$2.3 million), equal to 4X of the estimated
bas. cost of the prmect.  PricM e ontingenclas b.tweiw Negatiation  (January,
1991) and the end of project implementation are estimated at US$7.0 million
equivalent,  or 122 of the base cost plus physical contingencies.   Total
contingencies represent 172 of the base cost. Price increases have been applied
to both local and foreign costs in US$ terms at a 3.4X annual rate.
Differentials between foreign and local inflation during implementation are
expected to be reflected in an adjustment of the exchange rate.
3.6     Foreign Exchanue  Content.   The foreign exchange content has been
determined by: (a) estimating the indirect foreign exchange of construction;
(b) assuming that all equipment would be imported; and (c) evaluating, for each
relevant component, the availability of local experts. This resulted in the
following  percentages:    (a)  construction  and  refurbishment  of  existing
facilities - 502; (b) vehicles - 551; equipment - 701; (d) specialist services
- 14X; (e) training - 0%; (f) drugs and consumables - 55X; (g) contraceptives -
100l; (h) equipment maintenance - 302; (i) vehicle maintenance - 35%; (j)
building maintenance - 20%.  Including contingencies.  the resulting foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$36.2 million, or about 57% of total costs.
3.7     Recurrent Costs.   Under the proposed project, additional operating
recurrent costs would be generated by: (a) an increase in the provision of drugs
and contraceptives resulting from both a 7% annual increase in services provided
and the improved quality of those services; and (b) the maintenance of
equipment, buildings and vehicles. The incremental operating recurrent costs
in the fourth year of the project are estimated at US$8.8 million (TD7.5
million.)   Based on World Bank projections of GNP growth and assuming MOH
expenditures at 2.62 of GNP in 1995, these incremental costs will represent 2%
of total MOH expenditures for 1995 or 4.7X if the share of BHC increases to 40%
of total MOH expenditures. These incremental recurrent costs are affordable
because:



- 28 -
a. the Government is committed to restore, during the VIlIth Plan period,
the share of the MOH budget in the GDP which had declined slightly from
2.51 in 1985 to 2.3X in 1989;
b. efficiency gains will be pursued in the hospital sector through the
Hospital Restructuring Support project which will contain costs in
hospital care;
c. improved burden-sharing arrangements will be pursued with the social
security program and co-payments from consumers will increase. This
will supplement MOH resources;
3.8     During Negotiations. the Government provided assurances that the annual
growth rate of the LHS non salary op.rateUg bufg.t wold be positive nd at least
equal to the annual growth rate of the overall NOH non salary operating budget.
B.  1nnian
3.9     Prolect Financing.   The proposed Bank loan of US$26.0 million would
finance 72X of the foreign exchange component or 56X of total project costs net
of taxes. Pending formalization of the grant agreements being discussed by the
Government with UNFPA and bilateral sources for the financing of contraceptives,
the Government would finance the balance of foreign exchange, or lS$10.2 million
as well as all local costs (including US$16.4 million in taxes and duties).
Project financing would be in accordance with Table 3.3.

3,10    Architectural Services. The Department of Buildings and Equipment (DBE)
of the MOH is responsible for preparing, procuring and monitorinig all
construction programs. Prototype designs for all types of facilities as well
as equipment layouts for clinics, laboratories and hospitals are also the
responsibility of this department with experts' assistance.  Floor plans for
each of the various types of BHC clinics under the project have already been
used in the Health and Population Project (Loan 2005-TUN) and are generally
satisfactory. However, to take advantage of the experience acquired under the
previous project and to take into accounit comments by users, minor modifications
will be applied where necessary.  In addition, the project team will include a
full-time architect in charge of reviewing final architectural plans and
monitoring construction.
3.11    Site Acquisition.  The large majority of project items are extensions
of existing facilities and will not require site acquisition. The remainder is
expected to be identified by September 1991 and acquired by June 1992.
3.12    Training.  In-service training will be carried out by MOH with the
participation of its Training and Research Institute. Eighty percent of the
teaching modules are ready and have been appraised. Preparation for the Health
Management Master  training program  for  regional  Health  Directors,  chief
physicians and regional administrators will require some foreign technical
assistance estimated at US$0.2 million.   Total costs  for this component,
estimated at US$1.1 million are modest as all new training modules have been
prepared by the Training and Research Institute, the Directorate of BHC and ONFP
as part of their normal activities. With the exception of some of the Eealth
Management Master training program, courses will be delivered by staff of the
Institute, ONFP mid-wives or other regular medical staff already in the system.
Costs incurred will cover transportation and accommodations for trainees.
Whenever possible, courses will be held at the Governorate level to reduce
travelling costs and per diem. The courses will be accommodated at the regional
para-medical training colleges.
C. Procurement
3.13    Procurement.    Vehicles  and  equipment  would  be  procured  through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (May, 1985).
Invitations to bid for these items would be grouped respectivelv into about 40
and 25 major packages of goods to elicit competition. Thes' contracts would
account for 100% of the value of vehicles and 60% of che total value of
equipment. For the remaining 40% of the equipment valu.e., there would be about
10 minor packages, suitable for procurement other than ICB (see para.3.14).
Contracts would be awarded as per Table 3.4.

a/    Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Bank
loan.
3.14    The exceptions to ICB procurement would be as follows:
a.     Civil works  contracts,  estimated  at  a  total  of US$6.0  million
equivalent, would be relatively small (US$16,000 per center) and widely
scattered and as such are not suitable for ICB, as they are unlikely
to interest foreign contractors. These contracts would be grouped, as
much as possible, by governorate, and advertised under local competitive
bidding procedures, with public bid opening.   These procedures are
generally consistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the
execution of the works.   The size of each contract will not exceed
US$700,000 in each of the 23 governorates.
b.     Civil works contracts in an amount equal or inferior to US$70.000 per
contract, which in the aggregate would not exceed US$3.500.000 could
be purchased on the basis of comparison of a minimum of three
quotations.
c.     Contracts for furniture and equipment estimated to cost less than
US$200,000 equivalent each, which in the aggregate would not exceed
US$2.5 million, are not expected to interest foreign suppliers because
of the v'riety of each contract. These contracts could be awarded on
the basis of local competitive bidding, using bidding procedures which
are acceptable to the Bank.



- 31 -
d.     Contracts for furniture and equipment not exceeding US$50,000 in each
contract and aggregating a maximum of US$1.5 million equivale:it could
be purchased on the basis of co,,,parison of a minimum of three
quotations.
e.     Fellowships, stipends, transportation costs and educational materials
(estimated to cost about US$1.4 million) would be procured through
direct contracting.
3.15    In comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through ICB, domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%, or the existing
customs duty, whichever is lower over the c.i.f. prices of competing imports.
*der ICI an& LCI proo.dure, invitationa to bL  ar  the  proposed award of
contracts would be reviewed by the Bank prior to final award decisions for all
contracts over US$300.000. It is estimated that this review would cover 100%
of the total value of vehicles and 551 of the equipment contracts.   The
remaining 451 of Aquipment contracts would be subject to selective post award
reviews.
3.16    Technical Assistance.  To simplify management of Technical Assistance
(TA), the MOH would obtain specialist services as comprehensive TA contracts in
accordance  with  Bank Guidelines.    The  consultants  would be  selected  in
accordance with principles and procedures acceptable to the Bank on the basis
of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency." (March, 1981).
D. Disbursements
3.17    Status of Preparation and Disbursements.   The proposed project would
be disbursed over a period of 5 1/2 years, which is a shorter than average
profile for Tunisia projects (8 years). This short implementation schedule is
based on the following: (a) the project is intended as a first phase of a two-
phase program (para 2.2); (b) few sites need to be acquired as most works are
extensions of existing fa_ilities; (c) equipment lists for each center have been
standardized and specifications computerized; and (d) courses curricula are
ready, have been reviewed by the Bank, and some training has already started.
Project completion would be September 30, 1996 and the Closing Date March 31,
1997, Disbursements would be mad: against:
a.     80% of total expenditures for civil works;
b.     1001 of foreign expenditures, 1001 of local expenditures (ex-factory
cost) and 701 of local expenditures for other items procured locally
for vehicles, equipment, furniture and an initial stock of spare parts
for vehicles and equipment; and
c.     100%  for consultant  services,  fellowships,  students  stipends  and
transportation costs.



- 32 -
3.18    Disbursements  against  contracts  for  goods  and  services  exceedinj,
US$200,000 equivalent would be made against normal documentation.  DisbursviciiLts
againsc contracts  below  that  level,  all  training-related  items  inculn,im.l
contracts for training services, lists of recipients in the case of stiperid~; or
allowances with the amounts provided, and invoices for materials and consumables
would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOF.s) , available :om
examination by Bank missions.
3.19    Special Account.   To facilitate timely project implementation,  thE
Government would establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars at the Central Bank
of Tunisia to which the World Bank woul(i make an initial deposit, equivalent to
US$2.0 million, representing about four months of projected Bank expenditures.
The Special Account would be replenished .t least every three months or whenever
one-third of the amount of the initial deposit has been withdrawn, whichever
comes first.   Documentation for replenishment of the Special Account would
follow the same procedure as in paragraph 3.18.   In addition, monthly bank
statementa would accompany  replenishment  requests.    The minimum  size  of
withdrawal applications acceptable by the Bank will be US$200,000 equivalent.
Modalities concerning the use of SOEs and Special Account were agreed on at
Negotiations.
3.20    Progress ReRorts. Accounts and Audits.   Separate accounts for the
project would be maintained.  Annual joint reviews of progress and performatnce
projections for the coming year will be conducted by October 31 of each year,
beginning in 1992.   By September 30 of each year,  a detailed statement
reflecting project expenditures during that period, and projected expenditures
for the forthcoming year would be submitted to the Bank for review. Pro,ect
accounts including the Special Account (para. 3.19) would be audited in
accordance with the March 1982 Bank "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and
Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank". Within nine months of the end
of each fiscal year, the Bank would be provided with an audit report of such
scope and detail as it may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by
the auditor on disbursements against a certified statement of expenditures. The
Government provided assurances to this effect during Negotiations.

IV: MANAGEMENT AND DMPLEMENTATION
A.   A
4.1     The project is not expected to raise complex implementation issues for
the existing MOH and ONFP management structures, and would be handled as part
of the normal duties of the line services concerned, especially the Directors
of Health responsible for each individual Governorate. The MOH would establish
a small Project Implementation Unit (PIU) as an integral part of the Directorate
of Basic Health Care (DBHC.)  The organization chart and composition of the PIU
are detailed in Annex 4, table 1. The PIU would be maintained for the duration
of the project and its staff would be full time. The PIU team would have the
following mandate:
a.    coordinate and supervisa all project activities;
b.    monitor project implementation and prepare annual plans and progress
reports;
c.    convene  and  provide  secretariat  support  to  the  Project  Steering
Committee;
d.    carry out procurement and arrange for timely withdrawals  of  loan
proceeds;
e.    recruit consultants and monitor training activities; and
f.    liaise with  the IBRD and ensure  adherence  to all Loan Agreement
provisions.
4.2     The PIU's Project Director will be the BHS Director.   He will be
assisted by 2 full time deputies, respectively for technical and administrative
matters. The former would be assisted by an epidemiologist and a health planner
plus support staff, and the latter by an architect, a procurement officer and
support  staff proficient  in management  information systems.   The project
direct.or has direct access to the Director General of Health Services.   The
PIU would liaise with ONFP through a senior staff member assigned to coordinate
between the PIU and ONFP on implementation matters.
4.3     A Project Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the Minister of Health,
would facilitate project planning and implementation by convening the Chief
Executive of the ONFP (PDG) and those MOH Directors whose departments have a
direct role in the execution of the project.   Specifically, members would
include: the PDG of ONFP, the Secretary General (Finance and Administration)
of the MOH, the Director General of Health Services, the Director of BHC and
the Director of International Cooperation. The PSC would approve the Yearly
Plans and Yearly Progress reports, review and endorse detailed work plans for
the next 6 months periods and be responsible for the implementation of the



- 34 -
Agreements reached with the Bank during Negotiations.  The PSC would meet at
least twice a year. Assurances have been provided during Negotiations that the
yearly Resources Allocation and Implementation Plans would be submitted to the
Bank by December 31 of each year for review and comments. In addition, and as
a condition of Loan Effectiveness, the first such Plan would be submitted to
the Bank for approval.
4.4     An ad-hoc evaluation team will be appointed by the Minister for special
evaluation assignments, in accordance with Terms Of Reference agreed with the
Bank. The evaluation team will consist of senior officials of HOH departments
not directly involved in project implementation and from universities.   As
health indicators, as well as current service statistics, are available (or will
be available at the time of Loan fffectiv.nesal, and the objective, of the
project have been quantified for each sub-component, the impact of the proposed
project can be accurately measured at completion.
S.  nPlehIOR
4.5     Regional ImRlementation Teams. The MOH will reinforce the decentralized
management system that is already in place through the Regional Health Directors
and the Regional Delegates of the ONFP. Under the leadership of the Regional
Director, a coordination nucleus will be formed (it exists already in some
governorates)  including  the  ONFP  Delegate,  the  BHC  supervisor  and  the
supervisor/midwife of the ONFP. This nucleus will assist the Regional Director
in all aspects pertaining to the project, including field supervision.
4.6     Supervision. Monitoring and Evaluation. The project would be supervised
and monitored by the Bank through the normal supervision mechanism, and will
require about 45 staff-weeks over the five years of implementation. The PIU
would maintain data on project implementation, status of procurement of the
proposed resources and prepare an annual progress report to be submitted to the
Bank by September 30 of each year for review and comments. During Negotiations,
assurances to that effect were provided by the Government.   In addition, a
project completion report is to be submitted to the Bank within 3 months of the
loan closing date.

V: BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BENmYIT
5.1     With the project, the numbers of consultations for Family Planning (FP)
would triple thereby raising the current annual average of 0.23 consultations
per Married Woman of Fertile Age (MWFA) to 0.6 consultations per MWFA. This
is adequate for IUD and oral contraceptive users. As regional variations are
very wide, the extremes being 0.06 in Medenine and Kasserine and 0.8 in le Kef,
the project's focus on underserved areas would significantly narrow these
disparittes.  The number of pre-natal and post-natal consultations would double,
raising the average to two per pregnancy, which will facilitate the
identification of high risk pregnancies and reduce maternal and neo-natal
mortality. The number of visits for curative care would increase by about 30%.
A larger proportion of health services provided at the first level of care would
increase the efficiency of the health sector by reducing pressure on higher
level hospitals. An indicator of progress made in reaching that objective will
be an increase from the current 33% to 50% in normal deliveries attended at the
Basic Health Care (BHC) levels.
5.2      The expansion of the BHC system and its adaptation to the needs of
women and children would benefit about 80% of Tunisian women and children to
varying degrees. In those clinics receiving integrated FP/Maternal and Child
Health (MCH) services through the availability of trained staff on a permanent
basis, access to those services will be during normal clinic hours.  In clinics
which receive outreach teams, service will improve because of the provision of
reliable means of transport for the visiting teams and a reinforced control
system for the vehicles (including the itinerary and identity of the teams using
the vehicles).
5.3      Because the poor in general and the rural poor in particular have less
access to other sources of health care, the benefits of the project would be
especially significant for an estimated 2 million of the poor, thereby narrowing
the disparities in health status between regions and social classes.   By
reducing disparities in health status, the project would create the basic
conditions for further fertility decline and thus assist the Government of
Tunisia (GOT) to achieve the goals of its population policy which requires a
Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) of 45% for modern methods by 1995.
5.4      Furthermore, access to FP is one of the precor titions for the inclusion
of women in the development process by improving family health, allowing for
the planning of family size and increasing child survival. A smaller family
size facilitates the participation of women in the productive sectors and
therefore enhances their earning capacity.



- 36 -
B. RIS,
5.5     Possible risks include the fungibility of budgetary resources in the
health sector which could draw resources away from the FP/MCH/BHC programs.
This is not specific to Tunisia but a risk facing all peripheral social
services.   Urbanites can more easily apply pressure on governments to meet
their perceived needs while the dispersed rural populations are seldom heard.
For this project, the risk is smaller than usual because of the recognition by
the GOT that the inclusion of the rural poor in the demographic transition is
a sine qua non for attainment of their demographic goals, and therefore
allocation of sufficient operating resources for the program is critical.
Because of the Government's commitment to those goals, it has indicated that
the share of BHC in the non-salary operating budget will increase from 30% at
present to 40X by 1996. Furthermore, attainment of FP targets will be closely
monitored by the Government and, if program achievement falls behind the planned
level, this would quickly be recognized and rectified. The Project Steering
Committee (PSC) will be responsible to the Government for project achievements.
5.6     The long standing constraints to attract the necessary staff for service
in rural areas is the most difficult challenge to overcome.   The MOH is
confident that, givL.i the present situation of the health manpower labor market,
recruitment of the projected number of staff is feasible. Furthermore, the fact
that working conditions in the BHC centers will be improved by the project
inputs and that a comprehensive in-service training program and staff rotation
will maintain and improve professional skills, will make such service more
attractive. The MOH has also agreed to lower the standard entry requirements
for female staff if fully qualified staff cannot be attracted for posts in
specific geographical areas. Pre-service training would complement the missing
skills of such staff.

VI: 
6.1     Agreements  reached  durina  N,cotiations.    The  Government  provided
assurances that:
a)    the annual growth rate of the BHS non salary operating budget will be
positive and at least equal to the annual growth rate of the overall
MOH non salary operating budget (paras. 1.40 and 3.8).
b)    the yearly Resources Allocation  and Implementation Plans will  be
submitted to the Bank by December 31 of each - ear for review and
comments, and that the resources for expansion of BHC will be
distributed in accordance with the wno*f iui4x' (paras. 1.4S and 4.3).
C)    a study/evaluation of the BHC maintenance system for vehicles, equipment
and buildings will be carried out by December 31, 1992 according to
terms of reference reviewed with the Bank before December 31, 1991; and
that all necessary actions will be taken to implement, by December 31,
1993, a maintenance system based on the recommendations of this study
(para. 2.15(c)).
d)    adequate foreign exchange will be made available by the Government for
the purchase of contraceptives (para. 2.15(f)).
e)    the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established and maintained
throughout the project, with terms of reference and composition
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.2).
f)    within nine months of the end of each fiscal year, the Bank will be
provided with an audit report of such scope and detail as it may
reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on
disbursements against certified statements of expenditures (para. 3.20).
g)    a  progress  report,  specifying  the  status  of  implementation  and
procurement, will be made available to the Bank for review and comments
yearly by September 30, the first one to be submitted by September 30,
1992, and a project completion report within three months of the loan
closing date (para. 4.06).
6.2     As conditions of Loan Effectiveness,  the Resources Allocation and
Implementation Plan for the first year of project operation will be submitted
to the Bank for review ane comments (paras. 1.44 and 1.45), and the appointment
of the PIU Director will be confirmed (para 4.02).

TRAINING OF BASIC HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL
Management of the training program included in the Population and Family
Planning Project will be two-fold. A central coordination unit will be
managed by a senior paramedic instructor and a physician on a half-time basis.
Regional coordination will be managed by a Regional Health Director.
Training of those who will mawg. the contiuid educ-tim at a  central,
regional or district level will be conducted on a national level. Training of
other categories of personnel (nurses, mid-wives, etc...) will be at either a
regional (for mid-wives) or local level (for nurses).
Financing the total cost of the training program (2,000,000 TD) over the
next six years will be provided by the following sources: 300,000 TD (or
60,000 TD/year) will be allocated from the budget of the World Health
Organization, 650,000 TD will be provided by UNICEF, 400,000 TD from the
continued education budget of the Ministry of Public Health, and the remaining
650,000 TD will be financed by the Population and Family Health Project.
The ob4ective of the training for Directors and regional administrators
is to enhance their ability to manage and supervise the facilities and health
problems at the regional level. Eleven different themes will be explored over
the course of 15 days. The topics will range from epidemiology and health
economics to evaluation and supervision techniques. Each year (from 1992 to
1994), 23 people will complete the year-long training program.
Training of pharmacists, physicians, and district level administrators
will focus on techniques of management, supervision, and project evaluation.
In addition, working as a group and development of community participation in
health affairs will be addressed. Four representative professionals (2
doctors, 1 pharmacist, and 1 administrator) from each region will attend a 10
day national seminar to learn about the topics listed above and how the
information is to be disseminated. In addition, 6-day seminars will be
designed to provide education on the above topics at the regional level.
Training of public health physicians will focus on the above mentioned
topics, with an underlying theme of addressing child and maternal health
concerns. 900 general internists of the public health system will be offered
additional training in gynecology and family planning. Two physicians from
each of the peripheral maternities (District Hospitals, CSSB type M) will be
offered additional training on normal deliveries and neonatal care. A total
of 40 public health physicians (or 2 per maternity) will be trained on
handling difficult deliveries and neonatal care.

1,200 mid-wives will be trained about perinatal care, aormal birth
deliveries, neonatal care, and family planning. 160 supervisors at the
regional and district level will be trained in the management and supervision
of regional and district level para-medical staff, 50 nurses at district
facilities will be trained in basic radiology. 4,000 nurses and para-medical
staff will be *ducated on their role in tho provision and delivery of health
programs.  A total of 250 social workers will be informed of the their
opportunity for involvement in the recruitment of those populations targeted
by the health programs.
Training of hospital personnel will focus on management issues and
concerns that stand as obstacles to the provision of high quality, effective
care at the first line. Training will be directed at the doctors,
pharmacists, dentists, administrators, and para-medical staff to enhance their
ability to work as a team and to manage, be it the management of a district, a
health center, a hospital, or a service. Health personnel will be informed of
the objectives of the Population and Family Planning Project, and monitored to
ensure that these objectives are attained.
