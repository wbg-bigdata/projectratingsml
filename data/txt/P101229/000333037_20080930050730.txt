Description          The proposed poverty reduction support operation (PRSC-6) would
                     be the third credit in a series of five annual operations (PRSC-4/8)
                     and the mid-cycle operation supporting the implementation of
                     Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty
                     (known as MKUKUTA). Its strategic focus is on two key sets of
                     objectives: Sustaining high and shared economic growth, and
                     expanding the effective delivery of basic services through the
                     government budget.
Benefits             The operation supports the significant progress that has been
                     achieved by government in improving the institutional and financial
                     set-up in the Energy and Transport sectors, and in the area of
                     Governance, through the enactment of a new anti-corruption and a
                     new audit bill. The proposed credit, together with other partners'
                     budget support contributions, sustainsthe government in funding its
                     basic services and infrastructure       development needs, while
                     strengthening the country's       own financial management and
                     budgetary delivery systems.
Risks                There are two closely interrelated and overlapping sets o f risks for
                     this operation. The first set includes general risksthat may interfere
                     with the successful implementation o f the MKUKUTA, including
                     the vulnerability of Tanzania's economy to external shocks, political
                     risks related to the situation in Zanzibar, aid dependence,
                     decentralization, and capacity constraints. The second set o f risks
                     could undermine the overall credibility of the GBS process - and
                     PRSC - as an effective means to channel resources towards the
                     achievement o f the MKUKUTA objectives. These risks include:
                     corruption and weak domestic accountability, the reliance on the
                     domestic budget process, the transition to sector review processes,
                     and fiduciarv risks.

                                   I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes a Sixth Poverty Reduction Credit (PRSC-6) for
Tanzania inthe amount of US$160 million. This third credit ina series o f five annual PRSCs
(PRSC-4/8) i s the mid-cycle operation supportingthe implementation o f Tanzania's National
Strategy for Growth andReduction o f Poverty 2005-2010 (known as MKUKUTA).

2.      The Bank's PRSC support to Tanzania is provided within a harmonizedframework for
general budget support (GBS) with 13 other development partners (DP), comprising a
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM)
for GBS for the implementation o f MKUKUTA, and a streamlined review process. The
framework is designed to support domestic accountability, further reduce transaction costs
(especially for the government) and encourage the further development and use o f Tanzania's
own systems - rather than setting up and usingparallel donor systems. The program structure
follows the three pillars o f Tanzania's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (MKUKUTA),
namely "Growth andReductionof Income Poverty", "Social Well-Being", and "Governance".

3.      Within the overall GBS framework, the PRSC series strategic focus is on two sets o f
objectives: (i)Sustaining high and shared economic growth, and (ii)   Expandingthe effective
delivery o f basic services through the government budget. Given the advanced stage o f
reforms in Tanzania, these 2 main strategic areas map out into 7 operational policy areas for
the PRSC series: (1.a) agriculture; (1.b) infrastructure; (1.c) environment for private sector
development; (2.a) monitoring o f service delivery in social sectors; (2.b) public expenditure
and financial management; (2.c) effectiveness o f public administration; (2.d) anti-corruption
and accountability ofthe State.

4.     This mid-series PRSC offers the opportunity to build on previous achievements under
PRSC-4 and 5, and address emerging challenges and risks. In particular, starting this
operation, the PRSC series will gradually strive for the following:

    0  Selection o f new policy areas will be directed to increase the program relevance to
       shared growth, and inparticular attempting to increase the focus on income generation
       inrural areas, andinareasreceivinglarge ruralmigration flows.

    0  Overall, the program is moving towards more focus on policy implementation rather
       than supportingthe set up o fnewpolicy and institutional frameworks.

    0  The program aims to improve government M&E systems to achieve a better follow-up
       on the program results, and allow a tighter link between the program design and the
       impact on the ground.
5.     Discussion of the country context in Section I1 focuses on progress in realizing key
outcomes targeted by the MKUKUTA, namely: (1) sustained high economic growth and
accelerated reduction o f income poverty, (2) improvements in non-income dimensions o f
poverty, especially education, health, and water, and (3) strengthened governance. Section I11

outlines the government's Program followed by the discussion o f the Bank's support to the
government strategy in section IV. Section V then provides details o f the program supported
by the PRSC,highlightingspecific reforms implemented by government andprogress towards
specific MKUKUTAobjectives. Section VI describes the operation implementation elements.

                                 11.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

POVERTY OUTLOOK
6.      The 2000/01 poverty survey estimated that around 36 percent o f the population live
below the national poverty line. The large majority o f the poor over 80 percent live inrural
                                                                -                 -
areas. Robust rural growth i s critical to ensure progress on poverty reduction. At the current
rates o f rural income growth, however, it i s not evident whether Tanzania will see sustained
poverty reduction inrural areas. Also, while GDP has shown relatively high growth, between
6 and 7.8 percent in the period since 2001, growth in private consumption has not matched
this. Depending on the methodology used to estimate the various components of GDP,
projections leadto divergent trends of income-poverty levels from 2001 to 2007.

7.      Overall, the two major uncertainties concerning the evolution o f income-poverty rest
on whether growth i s public or private sector-driven, and on distributional effects, in
particular between urban and rural areas. Under the assumption o f moderately stable income
distribution, and a relatively strong performance o f the private sector, income-poverty
reduction could have been significant. However, if growth has been mainly public sector
drivenand concentrated ina few urbanareas, income-poverty reduction is likely to have been
moderate. This uncertainty points to the need to strengthen the focus of economic policy on
the environment for private sector growth, inparticular for small enterprises outside the urban
centers, as well as on improving income generation for the rural poor.

8.      A new set o fpoverty estimates will become available inthe third quarter of 2008, and
will provide the basis for an increased focus of the Government program on the critical
determinants o f poverty reduction. The lack of reliable data on the current status o f rural and
urban poverty and the uncertainty attached to the poverty simulations highlight the need to
collect information on income-poverty and other poverty indicators with higher frequency.

9.      The uncertainty o f the income-poverty trends i s somehow mitigated by clearer signs o f
progress as far as non-income-poverty i s concerned, especially in health and education. The
challenge there i s to address some specific issues on which limited progress has been made,
such as maternal health, to review whether the poor have benefited equally from the general
expansion of public services, and ensure that public expenditures can remain productive at the
margin.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
10.     Tanzania has sustained solid growth o f around 6.8 percent per year since 2000.
Tanzania experienced a severe drought and an energy crisis, which reduced real GDP growth
to 6.7 percent in 2006 from 7.4 percent in 2005. The specific measures to protect industry
from power shedding appear to have increased the resilience of the Tanzanian economy to the
shock, although the downturn in agriculture, and some o f the impact o f the energy crisis on
the informal sector, might not have been fully picked up by the GDP data. In 2007, the


                                                2

economy i s estimated to have grown by about 7.1 percent, while good rains and continued
sound economic performance are behind the government's projections o f 7.3 percent growth
in2008.

11.        The most dynamic sectors since 2000 have been mining, construction and public
administration, though the manufacturing, transport & tourism, and financial sectors have also
shown solid growth (see table 1).             The recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
estimated that the increase in GDP growth, from less than 4 percent in the late nineties to
around 7 percent in the first half o f the 2000s, could be attributed by three quarter to higher
government spending, fueled to a significant extent by larger aid flows'. Even so, the private
sector still contributes around half o f the GDP growth rate, and Tanzania's share o f world
exports has been increasing steadily since the rnid-90~~while manufacturing output and
exports have also been growing significantly, though from a tiny base.

12.        Maintaining the current levels o f economic growth, let alone reaching the
government's 8-10 percent target of annual GDP growth could prove challenging. The
structural transformation in the economy is concentrated in a few areas and remains slow
overall. Key constraints in infrastructure and in the business environment are not being
removed sufficiently fast, and accumulation o f modern technology and skills i s proceeding
very gradually. The growth in public spending may also not be sustained at the same level.
There is also a broad consensus that the country needs a more operational shared-growth
strategy, built on the country's comparative and competitive advantages, which could help to
consistently prioritize and screen economic policy and public investment. In the near term,
sustained highgrowth will have to rely more on sector such as transport and logistics, tourism
and natural resources, and a more dynamic agriculture sector.

 13.     The structural transformation seems concentrated in Dar es Salaam and in a few
dynamic urban areas, as exemplified by the growth inprivate formal employment from 2.4 to
8 percent o f the total labor force between 2000/01 and 2005/06. Although agricultural GDP
may have been growing at around 5 percent per year, which is above average in Africa, the
lack o f correlation between crop sector value added and rainfall suggests that agricultural
GDP might not capture smallholder crop agriculture adequately. Even putting aside data
problems, crop yields appear to have been flat, with agricultural growth primarilybeingdriven
by extension of cultivated area, along with shifts inthe composition o f crop production. While
these developments are in many ways positive, there is no indication as yet of a widespread,
dynamic transformation in Tanzanian agriculture, and a more strategic approach, beyond the
current focus on intensification o f rural infrastructure, mightbe needed.

 14.    The natural resource sector, including tourism, mining, forestry and fisheries, i s a
significant supplement to the subsistence for a majority o f Tanzanians, and it fosters the
environment on which much o f the population's health depends, and provides the basis for
much o f the economic non-farm growth in the formal and informal economy. Natural
resources are positively contributing to economic output, and are expected to be a growing
source o f income, generating exports from traditional activities such as forestry, fisheries,
mining, and tourism. However, recent evidence indicates shortfalls in governance and law
enforcement inthe sector (e.g. pricing distortions, coupled with institutional weakness and the
lack o f rule o f law), creating an environment that undermines shared economic growth inthis
sector.

15.     Tanzania ranks relatively low interms o f its business environment, being ranked 130
out o f 175, inthe 2008 Cost o f Doing Business (CoDB) indicators. Tanzania actually dropped
two places in the CoDB rankings this year, reflecting some slack in PSD reforms,after being
one o f the worlds ten top reformers in 2006. In recent years, the government has made
significant efforts to improve business environment through several reform programs,
including Business Environment Strengthening Program (BEST), a Tax Modernization Plan
(TMP) and the Second Generation Financial Sector Reform. These cover: (i)       labor reform; (ii)
landreform; (iii)   business registrationand licensing reform; (iv) tax administration reform; (v)
regulatory reform; and (vi) financial sector reform.

16.     The impact of these reforms has been marginal, though, as only a few o f them have
been fully implemented and there is a natural lag before actual results can be seen on the
ground. Delays and hesitations in reforming the business licensing regime, one o f the weak
points o f Tanzania in terms of CoDB, are particularly critical. Some recent government
measures with respect to market regulations, foreign direct investment, and the minimum
wage have also sent mixed signals to the investors as to their consistency with a conducive
and reliable environment for the private sector. The results of a new Investment Climate
Assessment to be released in October 2008 should allow a more detailed analysis o f the
bindingconstraints to private enterprise.

17.     Tanzania has made considerable progress in the development o f its financial sector in
recent years, though most enterprises, as elsewhere still finance investment primarily through
retained earnings (68 percent o f new investment) in Tanzania. The mainstreaming o f micro-
credit institutions in the financial sector i s a positive development, and the MFI are expected
to play an important role inproviding access to credit for the poor. A rural finance strategy i s

                                                  4

currently being prepared, coordinated by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust. An anti-
money launderingbill was approved last year.

 18.    Regarding the macroeconomic policy mix to support growth and poverty reduction,
fiscal policy has remained broadly on a prudent track, with particularly strong domestic
revenue performance. The fiscal deficit after grants has been around 5 percent o f GDP over
the last 2 years, with around 2/3 o f it financed through external concessional loans. On the
back o f a large increase in foreign aid, the fiscal impulse, as measured by the deficit before
grants, has steadily increased from around 5.5 percent o f GDP in 2000/01 to around 12.5
percent in 2006/07, and i s estimated to remain above 12 percent in 2007/08. The underlying
increase inpublic expenditures has allowed a significant expansion o f service delivery inboth
infrastructure and socials sectors, though administrative and miscellaneous expenditures have
also been rising fast. The recent decision to raise the minimum wage in the civil service by
around 20 percent and its repercussion on the next budget framework are o f concern, as the
broadly defined public wage bill was already around 9 percent o f GDP.

19.     As noted inthe debt sustainability analysis, prepared jointly by the staffs o f the IMF
and the Bank in June 2007, debt indicators are significantly below the debt sustainability
thresholds. The net present value o f public external debt stands at some 16 percent of GDP
and 63 percent o f exports, whereas public external debt service is equivalent to some 2
percent o f exports o f goods and services. The DSA concludes that Tanzania has a low risk o f
debt distress, albeit its external debt sustainability hinges on continued financing o f its large
current account deficit at highly concessional terms.

20.     Overall, Tanzania has maintaineda good record o f macro-economic stability. Over the
last years, however, signs o f mounting short-term macroeconomic tensions have emerged.
Inflation on a 12-month basis has been above the government target andthe IMF PSI program
inthe last 2 years, hedging higher, and climbing to 7 percent on average in 2007 (8.6 on an
end-of-period basis), and up to 9.5 percent on a 12 months basis in July 2008. Interest rates
have increased, with yields on government Treasury bills reaching an average 16 percent in
FY2006/07, although they have since come down to below 10 percent. The main reasons
behind these tensions are partly linked to the higher international commodity prices, to
weather shocks that have severely impacted food prices, and to the challenges o f absorbing the
liquidity pressures linked to high levels o f foreign aid. Overall, re-attaining the government
target o f a maximum inflation rate o f 5 percent will be a renewed challenge in the short to
medium term, especially given the current international inflation context. Tanzania is
particularly exposed to higher petroleum prices, and to a lesser extent to rising food prices.
The IMFhas been advisingthe government on adjustingmonetary policy inthis respect, and a
more flexible exchange rate policy and better management o f T-Bill auctions have allowed to
meet monetary targets and start reduce interest rates.

21.     The external position o f Tanzania remained strong, with increasing official reserves
covering around 4 months o f imports. Underlying this trend was, however, a continued
widening o f the current account balance (excluding grants), which, over the last 4 years,
moved from around 5 percent o f GDP to around 14 percent, driven mainly by higher imports.
The current account deficit is no longer fully covered by the amount o f foreign aid, and more
dependent on FDIflows: foreign reserve accumulation is therefore expected to slow down in
the near future. Furtherincrease inoil prices, and higher food import bill incase of a drought,

                                                5

would require careful macroeconomic management. A more flexible monetary policy,
combined with some large portfolio inflows, have led to a modest nominal appreciation o f the
exchange rate inthe third quarter o f 2007, and the nominal exchange rate has since remained
relatively stable.

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
22.     Tanzania ranks 162 out o f 177 countries inUNDP HumanDevelopment index (2006).
The country under its two successive PRS has engaged in a vast program o f social services
expansion. Education, Health, AIDS and Water all have sector strategies which have been
endorsed by the GOT and Development Partners. In some areas, strategies are still being
defined, refined or redefined, e.g. a social protection strategy is just being drafted and a new
HIV/AIDSMultiSectoral Strategic Frameworkhasjust beenendorsed.

23.     The health sector on the mainland hasjust completed an extensive external evaluation
o f the health reforms 1999-2006, which, combined with the 2005 DHS findings, provides
evidence that the health reforms are having an impact upon health outcomes, and system
performance, and improving efficiency through better management o f domestic and external
financing. Health indicators have generally improved, with under-five mortality declining
from 155 to 112 from 1999 to 2004, although maternal mortality has not shown similar
progress, due partly to slow progress in improving referral care and hospital reforms.
Government i s initiating implementation of a roadmap to reducing maternal mortality.

24.     Ineducation, Tanzania has made huge strides inincreasingprimary enrollment, and is
now facing the need to expand secondary, as well as tertiary education. Although the official
primary net enrollment ratio is close to 100 percent, survey data indicates that effective
regular attendance for the relevant class age i s around 80 percent, and that most children start
school at eight years of age. The data also show that the pupils enrolled but not attending are
mostly from poorer backgrounds. There remain, therefore, difficult challenges for attaining
universal primary education, as well as issues o f quality and learning achievements. The
government has put large additional resources in expanding secondary education, following
the increase in primary school completion, and enrolment in secondary is now about 25
percent. The challenges are about fiscal sustainability, private sector provision, learning
outcomes, and a balanced expansion strategy. Similar issues o f fiscal sustainability and quality
also apply to tertiary education.

25.     Public social protection mechanisms are currently very limited, and one o f the
Government's main instrument is the Bank-supported Social Fund TASAF. The government
i s developing a National Social Protection Strategy, and the challenges will be to arrive at a
strategy that i s realistic for a low-income country, where social vulnerabilities andpoverty are
deep and widespread. A recent nutrition study by the Bank suggested that malnutrition i s
widespread, and the best strategy to attack it might be to leverage synergies with existing
social programs, rather than a major nutrition-specific funding effort. A similar approach
mightbe relevant for social protection as a whole.

26.     An increase in access to clean and safe water of 2 and 4 percent in rural and urban
areas, respectively, has been recorded duringthe year up to the mid-2007 thanks to substantial
investment by the Government, increased participation of communities, and good rains. The


                                                6

institutional upgradingo f the sector i s proceeding, albeit at a slow pace, with both the Water
SupplyAct and Water Resources Management Act yet to be presented to Parliament.
27.     A problem across service delivery sectors concerns the ability o f Government and
stakeholders to assess both the degree to which strategies are implemented as well as the
impact o f strategies. Even in sectors where extensive data i s collected, the compilation and
interpretation o f data is not routine. There i s little systematic demand for empirical evidence
o f progress in the annual reports provided by sectoral ministries to Finance and Planning or
from the management of the MDAs, which will be critical to domestic accountability for
results rather than only demand for quantitative information coming from development
partners.

28.     High population growth, around 3 percent annually, still creates huge pressures on
private resources-through increasing dependency rates-and on public resources for social
services provision. It i s unclear ifthe government has an effective policy inthis regard.


GOVERNANCE
29.     Tanzania ranks in the first tier o f countries with overall better governance in Sub-
Saharan Africa, ranking 14th out o f 50 plus countries inboth the TI and Mo Ibrahimindices
o f governance. World Governance Indicators have this year singled out Tanzania as one o f the
few countries showing significant improvement inthe perception o f reduced corruption. The
Government continues implementing a comprehensive program o f core reforms in five key
governance areas. Despite considerable progress, though, Tanzania continues to face key
challenges in this area notably with respect to weak domestic accountability, extensive and
rampant corruption, uneven implementation and weak coordination o f the core reforms, and
wavering commitment to decentralization.

30.     Against recent positive institutional developments, a number o f high-profile cases o f
corruption have been disclosed inrecent months, including misappropriations at the Bank o f
Tanzania (BOT), corruption in the management of natural resources, notably forestry, and
mismanagement of major infrastructure contracts, such as the Richmond emergency power
generation deal. Irregularities in the financing o f elections have also been extensively
documented. On a number o f these issues, the relevant national Authorities have taken action
to investigate or otherwise pursue the matters. In particular, the National Audit Office has
undertaken an external audit o f the EPA account at the BOT, which documented the
breakdown o f internal controls and the leakage o f over US$110 million from this account.
Soon after the audit report was issued, the Authorities started taking remedial measures,
including changing the Governor o f BOT,initiating criminal investigations, suspending key
officers involved at the BOT, and clearing the conflict o f interest at the Internal Audit
Committee o f the Central Bank. A more tolerant and open environment has led the media and
the political parties to be more forthcoming inraising corruption allegations. Ina major show
o f independence, the Parliament has brought forward an investigation on the Richmond
energy deal which forced the resignation of key ministers and led to a change o f Cabinet.

31.     Overall, recent events have shown how the existing policies and institutions can be
insufficient to curb illicit private interests. The reaction o f the oversight authorities, in
particular the Parliament, the Audit Office, and the Public Procurement Authority, even if


                                                  7

delayed, has however been strong, and i s demonstrating that strengthened domestic
accountability inTanzania i s taking hold.

32.      The judicial system still faces daunting challenges, notably: (i)delays in dispensation
o f justice and commercial dispute resolution due to backlogs and to civil and criminal
procedure laws which are not yet consistent enough with a market economy and for expedited
dispute resolution; (ii)   technical incapacity (human resources) to address challenges brought
by a market economy including technological, economic and political changes; (iii)
corruption; (iv) poor case reporting; and (v) ineffective alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms.

33.      Public service reforms have been underway for several years, and have helped put in
place more transparent systems to manage the public service and slightly better remuneration
particularly for professional, managerial and technical staff have been leaving the service at a
faster pace than other groups, although impact o f these reforms in the executing agencies i s
still to be fully felt. In the next phase o f reforms, the government intends to focus on results
and accountability o f the service, recognizing that it needs a performing public service to
deliver services.

34.      Tanzania has a solid PFM system. The PEFA assessment for 2006 showed that the
Tanzanian PFM system was, on average 15 percent better than that o f sub Saharan Africa and
9 percent better than the global average. However, progress from the current level has been
patchy with the government umbrella PFM reform program basically stalled for the last two
years. Areas o f progress include audit and procurement. Following a decade-long reform
process, under a new Procurement Act, the procurement function has been decentralized to
procurement entities, and an autonomous Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA),
established and fully staffed, with a functional website. Capacity in executing agencies,
though, i s still weak. This is particularly true inlocal government authorities, bodies that have
an increasing influence in rural growth and poverty levels through district development plans
(DDPs) and a system o f capital development grants programmed through the local plans.


                         111.    THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

35.      The Government o f Tanzania completed its second poverty reduction strategy, called
MKUKUTA, in June 2005. The strategy, covering 2005-2010, emphasizes accelerating
private-sector led growth by building a competitive economy supported by an efficient
government. It also recognizes that policies will be required to ensure that growth is shared
and benefits the poor. Building on experience with previous Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS), the MKUKUTA adopts an outcome based approach stressing inter-sector linkages and
synergies. It identifies three clusters o f broad outcomes: growth and reduction o f income-
poverty; improvement of quality o f life and social well-being; and governance and
accountability.

36.     A new President and Parliament were elected inmid2005 on the basis o f an electoral
platform, known as the C C M manifesto, from the winning party's name. The C C M manifesto
has become the explicit programmatic platform o f the government under the new President,
and is cited before the MKUKUTA in the budget speech as one o f the key drivers o f
government policy. The C C M manifesto and the MKUKUTA support similar overall

                                                   8

priorities, but the two agendas appear to imply quite different implementation strategies. The
CCM manifesto focus on infrastructure outputs has been seen as distracting from agreed and
more articulate sectoral strategies. How the government i s able to reconcile and balance the
tensions betweenthe two will be criticalto the quality of its development policy.

            IV.     BANK SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CAS
37.     The proposed PRSC-6 is fully congruent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
presented to the Board of Executive Directors in March 2007. The CAS consists of the
Government Joint Assistance Strategy (JAST), the multi-donor Joint Program Document
(JPD), and a World Bank Group-specific supplement, with details on the WBG strategy,
progressunder the previous CAS, and FY06-FY10programs andprojects, IDA financing, and
a WBG-specific results matrix.

38.     The JAST clearly identifies GBS as the preferred aid modality. GBS is believed to
foster ownership, donor harmonization and alignment, and domestic accountability.
Development Partners (DP) have endorsed Government programs and strategies, increasingly
using harmonized aid modalities and relying on Government processes and systems. Subject
to continued progress on public and financial management, procurement, budget planning and
implementation, and development outcomes, budget support is expected to continue to be an
important instrument for Bank support over the CAS period FY07-10.

COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSAND THE IMF
39.     The JAST calls for a rationalization of donor support, including a move towards
Government's preferred aid modality, GBS, which i s now being provided by fourteen
Development Partners (DP)2. The PFM (Annex 3) spells out the objectives and underlying
principles for the provision of general budget support to Tanzania as well as the
responsibilities of government and development partners.It defines the GBS facility as a five-
year program to support the implementation of Tanzania's MKUKUTA.The principles set out
in the PFM seek to operationalize various international commitments, including the
Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development (2002), the Rome Declaration on Aid
Harmonization (2003), the Marrakech Memorandum on Managing for Results (2004), the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) and the Tanzania Joint Assistance Strategy
(JAST) aiming at providing more scope for government ownership, better alignment and
integration of donor support with government priorities and systems, and more predictability
of donor support.

40.     Decisions on GBS are based on a common Performance Assessment Framework and
Joint Annual Review processes, designedto engage the authorities at regular intervals during
the budget cycle on key development issues - such as energy, transport, fiduciary reforms.
This dialogue culminates eachyear inDP commitments to the authorities about the amount of


   * KfWand JBIC provide parallel financing to the PRSC, reflected inharmonization oftriggers andprior
   actions. Under these partnership arrangements and within the broader context ofthe GBS framework, KfW
   andthe Bank collaborate closely on public expenditureand macro-economic issues, while the collaboration
   with JBIC centers around growth and infrastructure issues


                                                     9

their budget support, used inpreparingthe budget guidelines. The GBS dialogue is led by a
rotating Troika of DP, andthe Bank as a permanentmember.

41.     The IMF Executive Board approved a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for
Tanzania in February 2007, supporting the goal of achieving sustainable broad-based high
growth, while maintaining macro-economic stability. The core objectives of the program are:
enhancing public resource mobilization and efficiency of spending; increasing financial
sector's contribution to growth and effectiveness of monetary policy; and improving the
business and investment environment. The periodic IMF's assessments of Tanzania's macro-
economic performance serve as a key input for dialogue and assessments on policies relatedto
macroeconomic stability. IDA and IMF staff collaborate closely, notably on public
expenditure management, financial sector, debt sustainability and PRS assessments.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
42.     As detailed inthe CAS/JAST document, WBG engagementinTanzania covers a wide
variety of sectors and thematic areas, and systematically uses harmonized aid modalities such
as development policy lending, basket funds and joint analytical and advisory services. The
PRSC has a two-way interface with sector investment operations. The objectives of PRSC in
many areas are supported by the implementation of Bank/DP sector investment programs,
ensuring that PRSC objectives inthese areas are realistic. On the other hand, PRSC strives to
identifyspecific policy or cross-sector constraints that are more appropriately handledthrough
a DPL instrument.

LESSONSLEARNED
43.     The ICR of the first series of PRSC-113 was completed inJune 2007, and reviewed by
IEG. This evaluation stressed the need to establish a clearer results framework for the
operation, and correspondingly strengtheningthe M&E system in country. It also stressed the
importance of supporting the government in achieving better efficiency and impact inpublic
expenditures, and focusing on policies helpingthe to re-balancethe growth pattern toward the
rural areas. QAG has performed a Quality at Entry assessment for PRSC-5 which found the
operation to be Highly Satisfactory overall, and commended it as a best practice example of
how the new (post-Paris-Declaration) aid architecture can function. It also highlighted areas
for improvement including building greater in-country demand for good governance, as well
as encouraging more cost-effective mechanisms for tracking performance in key public
services, and a greater focus on the drivers of growth in line with the ICR findings. On the
broader budget support framework in country, the current set up o f the PAF and of GBS
dialogue is the result of a profound restructuring of harmonized budget support in Tanzania
that started at the time of the MKUKUTA in 2005/06, and took stock of the experience of
budget support under the first PRS, aiming at simplifying and re-balancing the structure of
Budget Support, and strengthening the quality ofthe dialogue.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
44.    The PRSC is supported by a broad analytical program carried out by the Bank, often in
close collaboration with the Authorities. A CEMfocusing on economic growth was completed
in 2007, done jointly with the Ministry of Planning. The yearly PER cycle led by the
Government, and open to all DP and to civil society representatives, reviews key budget and


                                              10

financial management developments during the year, and supports the production o f a yearly
PEFAR report. The quality and relevance o f the PER process has deteriorated inrecent years,
but efforts are underway to revive it, and increase its focus on achieving results and value for
money. The Bank, in collaboration with UNICEF and the government, has completed a
nutrition report which has placed malnutrition back on the development agenda in Tanzania.
The Bank has also been carrying out a number o f PSIA on water, agriculture, and energy to
analyze the social impact o f some o f the key government policies supported by the Bank. A
PSIA on Land Reform i s also scheduled for next year. An I C A report is also expected shortly.
The Bank plans to carry out a poverty assessment inFY09/10 to take stock ofthe newpoverty
survey findings. A large number o f analytical works on environmental issues have been
completed inrecent years both by the Bank and other DPs, and are listed inAnnex 9.

45.     With respect to subsistence farming, and agriculture development in general,
additional analytical work will be the focus o f new AAA that the Bank is undertaking this
fiscal year. The government has also finalized a study on fertilizer subsidy, which makes a
number of recommendations for improved effectiveness o f the scheme. An important study on
forestry was issued by the N G O Traffic in collaboration with the government o f Tanzania in
2007, and it sets very clearly the challenges and impact of reforms inthe sector. Overall, these
studies aim to strengthen the empirical evidence base for a deeper policy focus on these areas
inthe lasttwo PRSCs ofthe series.

     V.     THE PROPOSEDSIXTH POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION
46.     The proposed poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-6) would be the third ina series
o f five annual operations (PRSC-4/8) supporting the implementation o f Tanzania's National
Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty (known as MKUKUTA). The Bank's PRSC
support to Tanzania i s provided withina harmonized framework for general budget support.

47.     The strategic focus of the PRSC4-8 series is on two key sets of objectives: (i)
sustaininghighand shared economic growth, and(ii)          expanding the effective delivery o f basic
services through the government budget.

48.     Giventhe advanced stage o f reforms inTanzania, andthe key constraints identifiedin
section I1above, these 2 main strategic areas map out into 7 operational policy areas for the
PRSC series: (i)agriculture; (ii)infrastructure; (iii)environment for private sector
development; (iv) monitoring o f service delivery in social sectors; (v) public expenditure and
financial management; (vi) effectiveness o f public administration; (vii) anti-corruption and
accountability o fthe State.

SUMMARYASSESMENT OF OVERALL PROGRESS3
49.     The GBS Annual Review (AR) 2007 was held from October 29th to November 2nd
2007 in Dar es Salaam. The joint assessment i s that overall progress was moderately
satisfactory. The AR concluded that there was good progress in some sectors and priority
areas but, in others, agreed PAF targets had not been met fully. The MKUKUTA

3GBS Review2007 is available at http://www.mof,go.tz/mofdocs/GBS/GBS%20Report%2OCEF.pdf


                                                   11

implementation was considered broadly on track. An assessment o f the PAF shows that out
of 22 underlying processes 14were judged satisfactory, 2 fairly satisfactory, 5 fair moving and
one could not be assessed. Out o f 24 outcome indicators 14 were considered on track, 5 were
achieved, for 2 data were not available and 3 were considered at risk. Out o f 21 temporary
process actions 8 were achieved, 3 were on track and 10were delayed but with progress made.

50.     The GBS review selected a number o f issues to be discussed, which were considered
by both Government and DP as key challenges to improve the effectiveness o f government
action. These five key issues were: (i)the need for a more focused growth strategy; (ii)
resolving the human resource crisis in social service delivery; (iii) strengthening o f
                                                                        further
public finance management; (iv) improving monitoring and evaluation for results; and (v)
improved governance and anti-corruption efforts.

Review of progressagainst PRSC-6 triggers and conversionto prior actions

51.     The assessment with respect to the specific policy areas o f PRSC-6 is more positive.
Very significant progresshas been achieved in improving the institutional and financial set-up
inthe Energy and Transport sectors, and inthe area of governance, the enactment of a new
anti-corruption and a new audit bill are critical steps forwards for Tanzania.

52.     All triggers have been substantially completed. All three social sector reviews
concluded that progress has been satisfactory but with qualifications, and the proposed prior
action amends the qualification o f the review accordingly.       To ensure that future sector
reviews can strengthen the focus on results reporting, which was the main reason for the
qualification, the triggers for PRSC 7 intwo of these sectors have been tightened accordingly.
With respect to the implementation of TANESCO's financial recovery plan, while the trigger
appears to have been broadly met, there i s a concern that the tariff increase-recently approved
by the regulator EWARU-is below the level that would ensure TANESCO's financial
viability, although it i s expected to allow TANESCO achieve cash balance for the first time in
recent years. Finally the Audit bill had not been submitted to the Parliament at the time o f the
AR, butwas submittedinJune 2008.

MONITORINGRESULTS
53.      The results framework (RF) covering the whole PRSC-4/8 series in support o f
MKUKUTA is fully congruent with the PAF. Giventhe highlevel o f harmonization, it is not
possible to distinguish the results supported by PRSC separately from the overall PRBS
support, although indications are given as to the PRSC-specific policy measures. The RF
identifies a limited number o f Project Development Objectives which will measure over the
full PRSC cycle the success o f the PRSC series. The RF is organized around the three
MKUKUTA broad clusters of objectives, each of which has three main outcome areas,
resulting ina 3x3 overall structure with nine outcome areas:

         1.1Improve business environment bymaintaining a conducive macro framework and
         reducing administrative barriers
         1.2 Increase access o fprivate sector to key inputs, inparticular credit andbackbone
         services (electricity, roads, ICT)
         1.3 Improve livelihoods inrural areas where the majority o fthe poor work, through
         improved agricultural policies, and expansion o f rural infrastructure
        2.1 Improve health status o fthe population

        2.3 Improve sanitationthrough better accessto cleanwater
        3.1 Enhance accountability o fthe State
        3.2 Improve the effectiveness o f Public Administration through better incentives for
        public servant and decentralization

                                                      13

        3.3 Improve Public FinancialManagement

54.     The PRSC's results framework integrates different information provided separately in
earlier PRSC documentation for Tanzania, as to align with the new ICR formats, to enhance
the quality and relevance o f M&E for the operation. The results framework i s based on the full
5-year period in terms o f overall development objectives, but focuses policy actions around
the current PRSC operation.

55.     Tanzania has put inplace an elaborate M&E architecture to follow up on MKUKUTA
implementation. This includes both specific institutions, procedures and outputs, which cover
the whole budgetcycle, from planningto execution. While this system is remarkable, there are
increasing concerns that it fails to deliver in a satisfactory way for at least two reasons: (i)
shortcomings inthe quality and timeliness o f the underlyinginformation, and (ii) o f the
                                                                                     lack
necessary incentives to integrate the outputs in the domestic budget and accountability
systems. As a result, the MKUKUTA's M&E system has remained mainly donor-oriented,
producing M&E outputs o f uneven relevance.

56.     The government and DP have acknowledged these shortcomings and are committed to
strengthening further domestic systems, notably by (i)finalizing and implementing a new
National Statistical master plan; (ii)
                                     carrying out the implementation o f an annual LSMSpanel
survey, possibly with extended donor support, starting 2008; (iii) supporting the strengthening
o f the internal reporting requirements o f the government, in particular, the output and
performance reports newly introduced in the latest budget guidelines; and (iv) better
integrating the MKUKUTA M&E and the public service reform program, which in its new
phase puts much emphasis on results and accountability, hence better performance from the
public service.

57.     Results monitoring of budget support suffers from the unavailability or low frequency
o f some o f the critical outcomes indicators, such as poverty estimates, health outcomes, or
learning achievements. It i s expected that starting with next PRSC, the availability o f the
poverty survey data in the third quarter o f 2008, and subsequently the results o f the annual
panel survey, as well as the demographic and health survey planned for 2009, will allow a
much tighter follow up on the impact o f the government policies and spending.

58.     The results since this second PRSC series was initiated in 2005 show steady
improvements in most outcome areas. In particular, road construction has increased
substantially, and enrollment in secondary and tertiary education has expanded significantly.
Tanzania has gained around 6 ranks in the Cost o f Doing Business scale, and has expanded
energy supply capacity, and improved immunization coverage rates. The results framework
shows also improvements in current budget execution and in the timeliness o f the Auditor
General report. Road quality has not yet improved significantly, mainly due to heavy floods in
2006/07, but higher funding for maintenance i s expect to overturn this trend inthe next years.

DESCRIPTION OF POLICY AREAS
59.     The PRSC two strategic objectives of higher shared-growth and expanded service
delivery through the government budget are articulated in the following 7 policy areas: (i)
agriculture; (ii)infrastructure; (iii)environment for private sector development; (iv)
monitoring of service delivery in social sectors; (v) public expenditures and financial
management; (vi) effectiveness o f public administration; and (vii) anti-corruption and
accountability ofthe State.

60.     The PRSC continues to support the infrastructure and governance sectors, building on
the government's     achievements under PRSC-4 and PRSC-5, but with a focus on
implementation. The PRSC will be deepening its policy dialogue and monitoring in areas
critical to poverty reduction and effective service delivery. This implies a renewed focus in
supporting rural development, improved environment for private sector including in remote
and rural areas and for SME. It also implies a stronger focus on better budgeting through
improvements o f the integrity and strategic alignment o f budget funds, and better integration
o fpublic expenditures with more effective M&E systems.

61.     The proposed renewed focus on rural livelihoods, both from the agricultural and PSD
perspectives, derive from the perceived risk that the current pattern o f economic growth may
have been skewed away from having a rural impact, and might have had less o f an impact on
subsistence agriculture, which provides the livelihood o f most o f the poor. The heightened
focus on the budget follows the PEFAR recommendations, which have stressed the need to
improve the budget process, and budgetary execution in general, while the proposal o f
addressing M&E issues results from a critical assessment o f 2-3 years implementation o f the
MKUKUTAmonitoring and evaluationsystem.

62.     The rest of the section provides an assessment o f recent developments in the policy
areas supported by the PRSC, focusing particularly on the discussion o f prior actions for
PRSC-6 and triggers for PRSC-7, which are critical to the achievement of Tanzania's
MKUKUTA objectives. (The program document for PRSC-4 provided a summary o f the
government strategy ineach o f these areas).

63.     Cross-cutting issues. Critical to Tanzania's development are both to sustain and
further increase economic growth, andmake sure it is sufficiently pro-poor to have a tangible
impact on the large majority o f Tanzanians. Critical bottleneck in infrastructure, from port to
railways to energy, a still weak environment for private sector, especially smaller firms, and
high aid-dependency are primary constrains to sustainable economic growth. The still
insufficient growth in agriculture and the vulnerability to climatic shocks o f most of the
subsistence farmers represent a major issue insharing growth more broadly.

64.     Agricultural sector. The Government has pursued the implementation of its
Agricultural Sector Development Program (ASDP) with the support o f the Bank and other
partners. Key areas o f reform to enhance productivity and incomes in the agricultural sector
include: (a) improved market access and private sector development, especially through


                                              19

strengthened rural infrastructure; (b) reform o f sector governance and marketing; (c) scaling
up of irrigation through public-private partnership; (d) improved public service delivery,
including reforms o f the extension and research delivery systems and involvement o f private
service providers, systems for input subsidies, and the strategic grain reserve. The
implementation o f the ASDP, though, has been hampered by delayed disbursement o f funds
for FY2006/07 and slow flow o f funds to LGAs.

65.      Progress on crop board reform, which has been an area o f focus since the start o f the
PRSC series, has been proceeding very gradually. Under PRSC-6, all crop boards have
completed the consultation process, leadingthe way for the submission o f amended legislation
that will focus crop board on regulatory functions. While crop board reforms, the expansion of
infrastructure in rural areas, and other measures to support agriculture development are
expected to benefit rural livelihood; there i s little evidence and lack o f strong analytical
underpinnings to give confidence that the implementation o f the current policy can have rapid
impact on rural poverty. The Bank, through the PRSC and analytical work, intends to
progressively engage in a more intensive dialogue with the authorities to ensure a stronger
impact o f economic policies on the rural poor. This will hopefully lead to the definition o f
more relevant policy actions in the sector which could be supported by subsequent PRSC. In
the shorter-term, improved governance in the natural resources sector - discussed below is              -
also expected to have some tangible impact on poverty reduction, as forests and woodlands
cover around 40 percent o f the total land area, yet support the livelihoods o f the some 87
percent o fthe poor populationwho live inrural areas.

 PRSC-6 Prior Action: Draft amendments to six crop board legislation submitted for stakeholder consultations
 and strategic plans for all crops boards finalized.


66.      Business environment. PRSC support has been focusing on reforms o f the business
registration and licensing regime, which intended to complement the effort on improving
infrastructure access. Implementation o f different bills related to the reforms has been
proceeding very gradually. For instance, the government introduced new business licensing
legislation in 2005, but then had to modify it further in the form o f a Business Activities
Registration Act (BARA) passed in January 2007 (PRSC-5 prior action). The regulations to
implement the BARA act are still being drafted, and constitute a trigger for PRSC 7.
Similarly, inthe area of labor reforms and landreforms, limited capacity, redtape, and lack o f
transparency in line ministries operations are hampering the smooth implementation of the
reforms. The PRSC will continue to support implementation o f the reforms initiated in the
last few years, with a special focus on speeding implementation, and prioritizing the removal
o f constraints for private sector activities inremote or rural areas and inthe SME sector, such
as the simplification and decentralization o f property registration, and o f business licensing. It
is expected that such progress will lead by the end of the PRSC series to significant
improvements inTanzania's cost o f doing business rating.

 PRSC-7 Trigger: Business Activities Registration Act subsidiary regulations consistent with one-stop-shop
 good practice approved.


67.      Energy Sector. Inthe last year, the government hastaken decisive steps to implement
its strategy to bring the energy sector back on a sustainable track, including by (i)        reorganizing
and changing the management o f the State Utility Company (TANESCO); (ii)approving a


                                                     20

new Electricity bill, which will provide for a sound institutional framework for the sector; (iii)
developing and rolling out an investment plan in generation and distribution with support
from the Bank and other DP; and (iv) implementing the Financial Recovery Plan, consisting
notably inthe disbursement of a syndicatedloanfor TANESCO, andthe submission of atariff
increase to the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) inDecember2007
(PRSC-6 trigger). The tariffincreaseauthorized by EWURA inearly January 2008 ledto a25
percent increase in TANESCO's revenues, which appears insufficient to ensure TANESCO's
full financial viability, but should allow it to achieve cashbalance for the first time inrecent
years. Under PRSC-7, the Bank will follow up on to ensure that a full cost of service study is
completed, which is a pre-requisite set by EWURA for a full-cost tariff application by
TANESCO.

68.     Progress was limited also with respect to the conversion to gas of IndependentPower
Tanzania Limited(IPTL) facility, which should allow substantial cost savings, and which was
originally plannedfor mid-2008 and has now beenrescheduledto be done by early 2013. This
delay was causedby low capacity of the gas processingplant to supply Songas and the leased
plants. Songas are inthe process of procuring additional trains to increase the capacity of the
gas processing plant. Overall, it i s expected that by the end o f the PRSC series, the energy
sector will have beenput on a sound institutional and financial footing.

 PRSC-6 Prior Action: Progress inthe implementationof the TANESCO fmancial recovery plan, notably in
 increasingrevenues, and strengtheninggovernance ofthe sector by improved regulation.
 PRSC-7 Trigger: Further progress in implementation of the TANESCO financial recovery plan by the
 Government taking all necessary actions regarding any additional measures that may be required to strengthen
 TANESCO's revenue base, as appropriate by October 2008.

69.     Transport Sector.         Following up on progress under PRSC-5, the government
furthered its efforts to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for the transport
sector and prioritize investment and maintenance funding. Key achievements under PRSC-6
included: (i)the approval of a new road bill; (ii)the completion of preliminary work to
prioritize the TSIP and align it with the MTEF; and (iii)tripling o f the funds allocated to
                                                                    a
road maintenance inthe FY07/08 budget, ensuring its full funding for the first time. The Bank
will continue to support authorities' efforts to ensure smooth implementation of the enhanced
funding for road maintenance and the recently approved Transport Sector InvestmentPlan. It
will also support the implementation of the new road bill, which should notably allow the
appointment of an autonomous Board for TANROAD. Dialogue under PRSC will focus on
the establishment a more transparent government-wide policy framework for PPP,including
stronger government capacity to manage large PPP transactions. The experience with PPP in
Tanzania in infrastructure has been disappointing, due the lack of a consistent policy
framework and weak capacity. The new policy framework envisages the enactment of an
umbrella PPP law and the creation of a central PPP unit inthe Ministry of Finance. This series
of reforms is expected to lead to a sustainable and effective institutional and financial
framework intransport and infrastructure more generally.

 PRSC-6 Prior Actions: (i) Bill enacted; (ii) Prioritized Transport Sector Investment Plan finalized
                             Roads
 with adequateprovision for maintenance and a framework for PPP.
 PRSC-7 Trigger: Framework for PPP, including inthe Transport Sector, finalized and approved by October

MKUKUTA Implementation: Cluster2 Quality of Life and SocialWell Being
                                            -

70.      Under this cluster, the PRSC focus i s strictly on the monitoring and evaluation o f
effective service delivery, and on critical cross-cutting issues, such as civil service
management, which link with other components o f PRSC. The three sectors covered, namely
education, health and water, all have well-established sector development programs and, since
the start of this PRSC series, are subject to specific harmonized annual sector review
processes, which assess: (i)  whether budgets align with agreed strategies and the strategies &
budgets are being implementedas agreed; (ii)     whether the implemented strategies are having
the anticipated results; and (iii)when not, whether the strategieshmplementation
plans/expenditures are being revised accordingly. The rating o f the review process i s a
composite indicator which summarizes these assessments, together with the question o f
whether the GOT i s enabling itself to be held accountable to a broad range o f stakeholders
through an open review process.

71.      While in 2006 sector reviews were satisfactory for all three sectors, progress in 2007
was still overall satisfactory but with qualifications such as "fairly satisfactory" inhealth and
education sectors and "fair moving" in water sector. Part o f the problem inrating the success
o f sector reviews stemmed from unclear evaluation criteria o f such a composite assessment,
but a common reason for the qualified assessments was related to shortcomings in
documenting effectively results achieved on the ground. To tackle these issues, Government
and DPs have finalized a new note to define satisfactory sector reviews and have also made
M&E for results a keyarea of focus o fbudgetsupport.

72.      Cross-cuttingchallenges.Achievement o f MKUKUTA objectives under this cluster
i s particularly reliant on service delivery capacity at the front line, particularly in LGAs.
Despite significant improvements in the conditions for LGA service delivery, accountability
in delivering social services remains insufficient, in particular due to (i)inadequate
information on procedures to access different social services; (ii) continuing shortages - acute
shortages in the health and education sectors - o f qualified staff, particularly in underserved
areas; (iii)still problematic flows o f funds to service delivery units at the local levels, both in
terms o ftiming andtransparency.


73.      Review o f progress under this cluster has been complicated by the timing, and last-
minute scheduling o f reviews inthe larger sectors. Inseveral sectors, the quality, frequency,
and completeness o f performance information are insufficient to support a comprehensive
assessment of sector performance. In many sectors across the cluster, establishment o f clear
performance frameworks - including expected results, measurable indicators, and targets -
has not yet been concluded.      Access to timely and accurate information for management
decision-making continues to be a major challenge and an important barrier to achievement o f
MKUKUTA objectives. The approach to strengthening M&E for results described above (see
par. 55-56) is therefore particularly relevant for the sectors in this cluster and is reflected in
the PRSC 7 triggers inthis area. Bythe end ofthe PRSC series, it is expected that monitoring
and reporting on results will be a basedon higher-frequency and solid information system, and
more tightly integrated into the budget process.

74.      Education4. The introduction o f the Primary Education Development Program
(PEDP) in July 2001 and the abolition o f primary education school fees have led to a rapid
increase in primary Enrolment Ratio. Performance in learning measured through Primary
School Leaving Examinations has also improved from 28.6 percent in 2001 to 70.5 percent in
2006. The Government has continued its efforts to expand access and improve the quality o f
secondary education through the implementation o f the Secondary Education Development
Program (SEDP) program.

75.      The sector review conducted in October 2007 concluded that progress has been fairly
satisfactory. The key weaknesses identified included: (i)inadequate sector dialogue in and
across sub sectors and among stakeholders; (ii)      fragmented planning, budgeting and allocation
across sub sectors; (iii)lack o f an agreed education sector performance assessment
framework; (iv) absence o f education monitoring tool and time framework; and (iv) absence
o f a capacity building strategy based on analysis o f situation. In addressing these issues, the
authorities and DP intend to further their efforts to: (i)ensure the provision o f school
infrastructure to cater for increased enrolment o f students and staff; (ii)improve the
verification tools, accuracy and quality o f information and data presented; (iii)        improve the
consistency o f reporting across subhector needed; (iv) strengthen the dialogue towards a
unified and coherent vision; and (v) ensure availability of qualified staff and teachers by
focusing on strategies on teacher training, recruitment, retention and continuous professional
development. It i s eipected that the production o f an education sector performance report this
year is the needed interim step to improve dialogue, support improved integrated planning,
based on agreed overall sector performance framework.

PRSC-6 Prior Action: Fairly satisfactory EducationSector review carried out.
PRSC-7 Trigger: By October 2008, agree on education sector performance report on the basis o f an agreed
sector monitoring.tool.


76.      Health5.The government's health sector development program aims at improving the
accessibility, delivery and quality o f health care services available inthe country, underscored
by far-reaching reforms at all levels.

77.      The health sector review process i s well established and has been improving
continually since its inception in 1999. It reviews the implementation o f the Health Sector
Strategic Plan and makes commitments on issues for the following year. The Sfh Annual Joint
Health sector Review was conducted between September 24 and 26, 2007.                      The review
concluded that progress inthe sector has been fairly satisfactory, and identified the following
key challenges: (i)    the difficulty to deploy health workers to underserved regions, with large
numbersof newly recruited workers who did not report; (ii)           insufficient funding o f the sector,
which at about 10.5 percent of the total government budget for FY 07/08 remains well below
the Abuja target of 15 percent agreed by African Heads o f State; (iii) flow problems,
                                                                                  cash

quarters reaching the districts only in May or June, despite donor approval for release in
January; (iv) much of the health infrastructure is still run down despite funding through the
LGCDC and the Joint Rehabilitation Fund(e.g. in2006 in 35 percent of districts only half the
health facilities had safe water supplies); (v) annual information on performance inthe health
sector remains weak, forcing to rely on periodic data including for some of the 22 indicators
that are supposed to be updated annually;             and (vi) weak management at all levels,
compoundedby a highturn-over rate specially at the LGA level.

78.     To address some of the reported weaknesses inperformance reporting, it was agreedto
bring more effort into producing improved performance reports that can feed into a more
substantive sector review process. The production of such performance report has been
included as triggers for PRSC-7.

79.     There was no annual sector review for HIV/AIDS in 2007, as the authorities and DP
decidedinsteadto undertake a revision ofthe National Multi-Sectoral StrategicFramework on
HIV/AIDS. The revision culminated into a revised NMSF for HIV and AIDS 2008-12. The
new NMSF has been approved by TACAIDS. The Framework covers the following main
areas: (a) the creation of an enabling environment for a national response to HIV; (b)
prevention; (c) care and treatment; and (d) impact mitigation to improve the quality of life of
PLHIV andthose affected by HIV and AIDS, includingorphans and other vulnerable children.

PRSC-6PriorAction: Fairly satisfactoryHealth Sector Review carried out.
PRSC-7 Trigger: Updating the 2006/07 Health Sector Performance Report by January 31, 2008, and Health
Sector PerformanceReport for 2007/08 producedand disseminatedby October 2008.


80.     Water sector6. The second Joint Water Sector Review was held on October 18-19,
2007. The review concluded that reforms inthe sector were fair-moving, and agreed on a set
of undertakings. Areas of good performance underscored during the review included: (i)           the
adoption of a Sector Wide Approach; (ii)the establishment and start of the Water Sector
Basket Fund; (iii)  the adequate design and functioning of sector dialogue framework; and (iv)
the submission of a National Water Sector Development Strategy to Cabinet. Significant
challenges ahead were also highlighted, though, including: (i)         limitedmanagement capacity
inthe sector at all levels; (ii) absence o f clear criteria for prioritization of interventions; (iii)
lack of consolidated information on resource flows to sector; (iv) need to strengthen
communication and coordination of sector reforms; (v) weak data collection, monitoring and
analysis systems; and (vi) need for clearer institutional framework for sanitation and hygiene.
Better information and analysis of performance in the sector will be key in improving the
outcome of the water sector review. The government, with support from the Bank, i s carrying
out Public Expenditure Tracking Survey and a service provider survey analysis, which are
expected to feed in next year sector review, and solve some of the shortcomings in terms of
results motoring.

MKUKUTA Implementation:Cluster 3 -GovernanceandAccountability
81.    Tanzania's National Framework on Good Governance provides the overall framework
for reforms inthis area. The implementation o f public expenditure, financial management, and
procurement reforms, as well as the Public Service Reform Program (PSRP), the Local
Government Reform Program (LGRP), the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACSAP),
andthe Legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP) are the government's main instruments towards
improving the governance environment.

82.     Cross-cuttingissues.The policy issues to be addressed inthis sector concern boththe
strengthening o f the general environment for governance, and the improvement in service
delivery. Stronger institutions o f domestic accountability -in particular parliament, the
oversight offices, and the media- are critical to improving governance throughout government,
and are also keys in making sure that reforms in this field become less technocratic and
formalistic innature, and have relevance with respect to the actual decision mechanisms inthe
country. Completion o f efforts to restore the full credibility o f the Bank o f Tanzania fiduciary
environment will also be an important signal.         There are also remaining difficulties in
achieving progress across the breadth o f all 5 core reforms and coordinating among them.
Improved flow o f funds in budget execution, and solutions to address the human resource
constraints in social service are some o f the policy areas critical to the effectiveness in the
provision o f basic services.

83.    All reviews that were scheduled in the past year for the cluster were undertaken as
planned. This included the PSRP and LGRP. The LSRP reviewtook place inMay 2008.

84.     Public Service Reform Program. The PSRP is one o f the core reforms aiming at
improving performance o f the public service to deliver better services. The key focus o f the
PSRP Phase I(2000-2007) was to instituteperformance management systems inMDAs. This
process has improved continually over the last three years and has lead to the agreement on
the next phase o f the Public Service Reform Program (2008-2012), which will have a greater
focus on implementation o f reforms by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and
that will also seek to enhance the coordination o f core reforms at the center o f government
(Office o fthe Chief SecretaryIHead o f the Public Service).


85.     Although the previous government medium-term pay policy targeted wage
decompression, low pay and incentives continue to be raised throughout government as the
main challenge to attract, retain and motivate key categories o f employees in all sectors
specifically inunderserved areas. A related challenge is the need to establish a clear regime o f
allowances. The current system o f allowances i s highly distortive o f incentives for productive
work in the civil service, and i s liable to easy manipulation for patronage and favors.
Providing enhanced remuneration closely linked to performance to ensure the selection and
retention o f key professional, managerial and technical staff, is fundamental to the
achievement o f all reforms, service delivery and poverty reduction.               A Presidential
Commission was set up to look into this issue, and produced a report in December 2006.
While this report has not been made public, the Government is planningto issue by February
2009 a revised pay policy for a phased implementation o f the Commission's
recommendations. This policy, which i s a trigger for PRSC7, is expected to cover the
following areas: (i)rationalization o f compensation across public service bodies that draw

                                                25

compensation from Treasury; (ii)mechanisms and incentives to enable the Government to
recruit retain and motivate staff at all levels particularly professional and technical staff; (iii)
medium-term pay targets that are realistic, achievable and fiscally sustainable; (iv)
rationalization o f allowances, and integration of allowance and pay policy; (v) mechanisms
and incentives for personnel working in the hard to reach areas; (vi) better integration o f
staffing and wage bill into MTEF.Next PRSCs will follow up on the implementation o f this
newmedium-termpolicy.

 PRSC-7 trigger: A revised Medium-Term Pay Policy is adopted by Government by February 2009 as the
 basis for reform ofpay and allowances. Draft available by December 2008.

86.      Legal Sector Reform Program. The vision o f the LSRP Medium Term Strategy i s
"timely justice for all". The reform program is being implemented with the support from a
joint donor basket. Progress o f the LSRP as a whole remains slow and challenging and
requires addressing existing financing and human resource constraints. The capacity o f the
LSRP's institutions to plan, budget for and implement activities in a coherent and transparent
way remains limited across all LSRP Lead and Implementing Agencies. A comprehensive
capacity building and technical assistance program that involves all link officers in the
implementing and lead agencies should be implemented on a priority basis for LSRP to
perform as expected. The absence o f adequate monitoring tools and indicators does not allow
an objective and informed assessment on progress with LSRP implementation. LSRP
coordination and monitoring structure remains to be fully implemented, with the appropriate
M&E systems designed to support it. The inclusion inthe 2008 GBS PAF o f two temporary
process actions associated with the LSRP should add further impetus to reform
im)lementation.     The first LSRP review was carried out inMay 2008.

87.     Local Government Reform Program. Encouraging progress has been registered in
the areas of fiscal decentralization and harmonization and integration o f the Local
Government Capital Development Grants system into the national budget needed to ensure
sustainability, although further work i s still needed. The application o f formulae in the
allocation o f grants for recurrent expenditure i s still facing problems mainly due to decisions
that are made at Central Government level regarding staffing levels and posting o f staff. The
national budget should be structured to easily enable the monitoring and enhance
accountability o fthe flow o f requrrent and capital funds directly to the LGA level.

88.     The Second National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan. The National
Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP 11) was launched in December 2006.
Among the innovations to strengthen the anticorruption agenda is the expanded coverage to
include civil society, the private sector, the Legislature and Judiciary. A strategy to follow-up
on monitoring reports and those o f the Auditor General and Parliamentary oversight
committees has also been included. The NACSAP also provides for the establishment o f a
National Anti-Corruption Forum for stakeholders to review and dialogue over progress and
outcomes o f the anti-corruption initiatives in Tanzania. Progress under PRSC-6 includes the
Government enacting a new Anti-Corruption Law in June 2007, which significantly expands
the number of offences under the law. Also, thanksto the bill, the Preventionand Combating
o f Corruption Bureau has now more powers to investigate and prosecute offenders than
before; it also has the obligation to go public at the end o f each investigation.            The



                                                     26

Government also approved the conduct o f a National Governance and Corruption Survey,
expected to be completed by March2008.

89.      Putting NACSAP in the wider context o f anti-corruption efforts, the GOTi s currently
investigating alleged cases o f misuses o f public resources, which have been a cause for
concern on both GOT and DP sides. GOThas already started implementing an action plan on
the recommendations o f the EPA special audit, and appears committed to undertake all
required actions upon the conclusion of the investigations on the EPA fraud. The BOTi s also
committed to implement measures to reduce control risks at the Bank o f Tanzania, on the
basis o f the recommendations o f the recent Voluntary Assessment mission o f the IMF. The
Government has shared with the Bank a time-bound action plan o f investigations and audits
covering some o f most suspect allegations o f fraud related to past BOTtransactions. The
Governments is also reporting to Parliament what measures it intends to take as a response to
the recommendations o f the Richmond Parliamentary select Committee. The Government and
DPs have agreed that these actions will also be monitored as an integral part o f the overall
policy dialogue on budget support, and are therefore expected to feature in the next year's
PAF.

90.      Some o f the next steps in the anti-corruption agenda are to: (i)re-visit the Public
Leadership Ethics Code Act to accord with the President's announcements regarding conflict-
of-interest and corruption in leadership ranks; (ii)          review the Political Parties Act and the
Elections Act in order to control the financing o f politics and political campaigns; (iii)
proceed with the preparation o f the Freedomo f Information Bill and the Whistleblower Bill.

91.      Following up on the implementation o f the anti-corruption bill and building synergies
with the poverty reduction agenda inrural areas, the PRSC will focus on governance andanti-
corruption issues linked to natural resources management. The release o f ajoint Government-
DP report on Forestry carried out by the NGO "Traffic", and work on Natural Resources in
the Bank's recent CEM provide solid ground to support government in exploiting large
unrealized potential in the sustainable exploitation o f natural resources. These reports have
underscored that management under current circumstances i s unsustainable and favors elite
capture, further contributing to real imbalances in income and contributing to - rather than
alleviating - conditions o f poverty. To improve the management o f these resources, the
government i s committed to clarify the various systems it uses to allow economic access to
these resources, and how these methods meet transparency standards and market value.
Following on this action, which i s a PRSC 7 trigger, the government is expected to show
progress in implementinga more transparent system that guarantees sustainable management
that i s beneficial to local communities.

 PRSC-6PriorAction:Anti-corruption act enacted.
 PRSC-7 trigger: Collect        information   and report on transparent      and    accountable    systems  o f
 licenses/concession allocations and how this meets market values inthe Forestry, Fisheries, Wildlife, Minerals
 andOil & Gas sectors.

92.      Public Finance Management. Tanzania has a solid PFM system. The PEFA
assessment for 2006 showed that the Tanzanian PFM system was, on average 15 percent
better than that o f sub Saharan Africa and 9 percent better than the global average. The
primary donor program supporting PFM improvements has been the PFM Reform Program
(PFMRP) that has been in operation for around 8 years. A mid term review o f PFMRP in

                                                     27

2006 recommended restructuring the program to increase ownership and improve its
effectiveness. After an intensive consultative process, the Government has finalized its revised
PFM Reform Strategy that will guide PFMRP for the next 5 year period. The third phase o f
PFMRP has started in July 2008, with renewed support and commitment from DP for
supporting PFM improvements. Areas o f focus are improvements to cash management,
payment systems, coverage and integration o f IFMIS,and budgetclassification.

93.     During the last two years significant progress has been made in the areas o f external
audit, internal audit and procurement, with consistent support from previous PRSC
operations. Inthe last year alone, 600 qualified accountants have been recruited and posted to
local governments to strengthen internal audit capacity. The target for the Government i s to
have eight qualified accountants at each local council along with three qualified internal
auditors in the next few years. Following a decade-long reform process, under a new
Procurement Act, the procurement function has been decentralized to procurement entities,
and an autonomous Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), established and fully
staffed, with a functional website. Capacity inexecuting agencies, though, is still weak.

94.     For a second time in a row, the National Audit Office was able to produce the annual
audit report in a timely manner in March 2007 and tabled in Parliament before the budget
session in June 2007. Soon after the audit reports were published, the President o f Tanzania
convened two meetings with Accounting Officers from the Central Government and Local
Government respectively to reinforce the message o f better use o f public funds and improved
accountability. The audits show that for the Central Government, only 4 percent received an
adverse opinion, for Local Governments 3 percent received an adverse opinion-a remarkable
improvement since 2000. N A O seems to be determinedto expose less performing MDAs in
its annual report. The approval o f a new Audit bill will provide N A O with the required level
o f independence and with the financial autonomy to improve the quality o f its processes, staff
and its infrastructure. An expected PRSC-6 prior action, the submission o f the bill, was
delayed by consensus building within government, but its submission to Parliament in June
2008 has opened the way for its effectiveness starting inthe 2008/09 fiscal year.

95.     The enactment o f a new audit bill is a key milestone of a broader agreed roadmap to
achieve Afrosai 3 requirements by 2010. The 2006 Central Government Audit Report made
several important recommendations for improving accountability and fiduciary compliance in
Tanzania, including the need to improve capacity o f Internal Audit units, by staffing them
with professionally competent staff (e.g. certify 50 internal auditors), and improve reporting
arrangements and external membership o f Audit Committees. These actions are included
under a PRSC-7 trigger for improving capacity inprocurementand audit.

96.     A key remaining challenge is the follow-up o f audit recommendations. There is a
backlog o f two years in issuance of PAC reports, and a backlog o f eight years in issuance o f
Treasury Memorandum to follow up on PAC reports. There is need to improve the capacity o f
Parliament to scrutinize budget submission and to improve its ability to undertake policy
review and hold the Executive to account inan effective manner. This prevents the full PFM
cycle o f accountability being completed, despite the successful reforms being undertaken at

97.     As part o f monitoring compliance by procuring entities, PPRA conducted recently a
procurement audit o f 20 procuring entities, and made the results public. It was observed that
overall performance in complying with the procurement Act i s 39 percent. No single entity
was found to comply with the Act fully, pointing to the need to enhance capacity inexecuting
agencies. Tanzania i s among o f 22 countries worldwide, which are piloting the assessment o f
national procurement system on the basis o f compliance and performance indicators prepared
by OECD-DACjointly with the World Bank.

98.     Inprocurement, the challenge for the Government will be to implement the various
strategies and tools that have been developed, and embark on a special program o f capacity
building, in particular for LGAs. In this regard, a key government policy is to act fast in
establishing a Procurement Cadre in government, as well as establishing organizational
structures and staffing levels o f the Procurement Management Units (PMUs), leading to the
full operationalizationof scheme of service for procurement cadre by 2010. A first step is the
PRSC 7 trigger covering issuance o f regulations under the Procurement and Supplies
Professional Board Act.

 PRSC-6Prior Action: Audit bill submittedto Parliament.
 PRSC-7 Trigger: Approval granted by October 2008 to create a new Department of Internal Audit in the
 Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, and regulations under the Procurementand Supplies Professional
 BoardAct preparedandissued(gazetted).

BudgetConsistency andResource Allocation
99.     Overall budget actual expenditures in FY06/07 were 12.8 percent less than budgeted,
with an average deviation at the vote level o f 20%. The recurrent budget average deviation at
vote level, which i s the measure tracked by the PRSC trigger, came down from 16 percent last
year to around 12 percent this year. Expenditure deviations for central and regional votes
show that budget execution i s particularly poor for the development budget, with significant
under-spending at year end, resulting inan aggregate deviation rate o f 41percent.

100.    Agriculture significantly under spent its budget by 41.6 percent in the development
budget, and 30.2 percent in the recurrent budget, and under-spending in the development
budgets o f energy and minerals (-92.4 percent) and infrastructure (-37.5 percent) was also
particularly large. The shortfall in the energy development budget, and a much smaller
overspending on the energy recurrent budget, are likely to have been the result o f the
government emergency response to the energy crisis. In infrastructure, sizeable development
budget under-spending appears to reflect delays in fund disbursements, and to a lesser extent,
constraints in implementation. The lack of funding, combined with a required reallocation due
to extraordinary road construction last year from damage caused by heavy rains, resulted in
large unsettled payments to contractors by the Ministry o f Infrastructure Development
(MOID), which had to be carried over into this budget year.

101.    Total budget deviation at the Local Government Authorities (LGA) level reached 25
percent in 2006/07, having worsened from 15 percent in 2005/06. This reflects a shortfall in
actual expenditure in the recurrent budget, but mostly in the development budget.
Reallocations betweencouncil budgets with inthe year are also significant. The timeliness of
the release and expenditure of funds at LGA is another area o fconcern. A largeproportion of
LGA expenditures, particularly for the development budget, are only realized inthe third and
the fourth quarters of the financial year.

                                                  29

102.     Overall, late and unpredictable expenditures are potentially prime drivers o f poor
policy implementation and inefficiency in the expenditure o f funds. As part o f the PER, a
study is being conducted on identifying the key bottlenecks behindthese execution problems,
and discussions o f the results o f this study will be central to the dialogue on consistency o f
budgetoutruns, which is a standardtrigger retained for PRSC-7.

  PRSC-6Prior Action: Expenditureoutturnfor FY07consistentwith approvedbudget.
  PRSC-7 Trigger: Expenditure outturn for FY08 consistent with approved budget and recurrent budget
  deviationreduced.

103.     Government expenditures increased from 17 percent o f GDP in 2000/01 to 26.2
percent o f GDP in 2006/07, and to a projected 30.9 percent o f GDP in 07/08. Domestic
revenues increased at a more gradual pace, growing from 12 to 16.1 percent of GDP over the
same 2000/01-2006107 period, and are projected to reach 18.0 percent in FY07/08. Aid
inflows, as a percentage o f government expenditure, have risen fairly rapidly from 28.8
percent in2000/01 to 37.4 percent inthe 2006/07.

104.     MKUKUTA sectors are receiving substantial share of the increased spending,
with the social sectors benefiting most. MKUKUTA-related sectors receive around 62
percent o f the budget allocations in both in FY06/07 and FY07/08, and 56 percent o f actual
expenditures in FY06/07. The large increase in expenditures in FY07/08 i s directed by 62
percent to MKUKTA related sectors and by the remaining 38 percent to other sectors. The
increase in actual spending between 05/06 and 06/07 was directed by 104 percent to
MKUKUTA related sectors and by -4 percent to non-MKUKUTA. Social sector were the
main recipient o f increased expenditures.

105.     The figures show the government's commitment to implement MKUKUTA, and its
ability to direct aid resources towards it, while sustaining an effort to raise domestic revenues.
Increases in development assistance (excluding debt relief) have translated in more than
equivalent increases in spending/allocations to MKUKUTA sectors. Against this backdrop,
the quality o f budget preparation is still weak, in particular with respect to linking sector
strategic plans and sector budgets, and achieving an overall strategic view o f budget priorities
inthe medium-term. The government is working, with support from the PER and PFMRP, to
improve the strategic orientation ofthe budgetpreparation.

106.     Monitoring o f progress o f the PRSC action related to budget alignment will be
monitored also in relation to improvement inthe ability of the budget system to follow up on
impact and value for money o f public spending. It i s hoped that the introduction o f stronger
sector performance frameworks to be discussed in the social sector reviews will be an
important tool for improving effective alignment o f spending and MKUKUTA objectives.

 PRSC-6 Prior Action: Approved budget for FY08 in line with policy objectives (MKUKUTA, sector
 policies).
 PRSC-7Trigger: Approvedbudgetfor FY09inline withpolicy objectives(MKUKUTA, sector policies).

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
108.   Poverty and Social Impact Assessments (PSIAs) have allowed the Government to
analyze the distributional impact o f policy reforms on the well-being o f different stakeholder
groups, with particular focus on the poor and vulnerable. A poverty and social assessment on
crop board reform was carried out by the Bank in2005 under PRSC-3 and i s still relevant for
these reforms. Another key area o f PRSC where poverty impact is relevant i s the tariff policy
for electricity. Work done by the Bank has shown that the poor receive a negligible share o f
the implicit energy subsidy, but also advised that the lifeline tariff should be exempted from
the proposed increase, through an appropriate combination o f budget financing and cross-
subsidization from higher brackets. A broad PSIA program is under way, with a focus on
water, agriculture, land policy, and the in-country institutionalization o f PSIA. In addition,
most core diagnostic or sector work addressesthese issues eventhough the final product is not
presented as a PSIA.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
 109.     Monitoringarrangements.The government has issued two key reports to follow up
on MKUKUTA implementation. These are the Poverty and Human Development Report
2007, the second MKUKUTA Annual Implementation Report 2006/07. The Poverty and
Human Development Report (PHDR), which is published bi-annually, consolidates poverty
measures from various sources, and provide analysis o f poverty trends and underlying factors.
Sector reviews are also key monitoring mechanisms for developments at the sector level, and
the PSI reviews, as well as the monthly Bank of Tanzania economic reports are the key
sources for the assessment o f the macroeconomic situation. Progress in public expenditure
management covering improvements in systems, enhanced allocative and operational
efficiency in the use o f inputs, and the consistency o f the budget and budget execution with
the MKUKUTAare trackedby the annual PEFARs. As mentioned above the underlyingM&E
system is under revision to strengthen information quality, policy relevance, and integration
withthe budget process.


Box 1. Good practice principles in conditionality
Principle 1-Reinforce ownership
The Government home-grown PRS, the MKUKUTA, was developed through extensive national consultations,
and is broadly-shared platform for government action. Tanzania i s at the foreffont o f aid coordination though
strong alignment o f both the broader program and the budget support instrument to the MKUKUTA, though the
Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST), which was completed in 2007. The Poverty Reduction Budget
Support (PRBS) process multiplefora, at the sector cluster and macro levels, are headed by government.

Principle 2 -Agree in advance with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
Donor harmonization and alignment with Government priorities is well-advanced in Tanzania. The Government
and DP have subscribed to a Partnership Framework Memorandum which set the rules for the joint PRBS
process which underlies PRSC. Under the PFM, the government and Development partners organize budget
support around an annual implementation plan for the MKUKUTA, summarized in the Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF).

Principle 3 -Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
Policies supported by the PRSC represent actions included inthe PAF that the Government believes will lead to
the desired MKUKUTA outcomes, and thus reflect country preferences. They are selected in consultation with
donors, including the Bank, ffom the larger PEAP policy matrix. The PRSC is structured so that fmancing is
committed intime for the preparation o f the Budget Guidelines for the following fiscal year.

Principle 4 -Choose only actions critical to achieve results as conditions for disbursement
The PRSC triggers representactions and outputs that are considered critical by the Government to the success o f
its reforms. Several o f the PRSC prior actions are based on satisfactory completion o f undertakings agreed to in
existing sectoral review processes (e.g., in water), thus avoiding creation o f new and overlapping review
structures and indicators. However, the Bank continues to provide important input to the sector review process to
improve prioritization and outcome-orientation.

Principle 5 -Conduct transparent progress reviews conduciveto predictable and performance-based
financial support
The Annual Review of PRBS is a public event chaired bygovernment. There is an established preparation
process, and the PFM envisage that within 6 weeks o f the Annual Review's conclusion, DP will make indicative
financial commitment under PRBS, based on their evaluation o f the outcomes o fthe annual review




                                                       32

110.    An additional dimension o f the monitoring framework covers the government-donor
relationship in monitoring progress on PRSC objectives, such as enhanced local ownership o f
the development process, participation by all stakeholders, and efficiency o f aid delivery
mechanisms. Inparticular, the PRSC team i s working with the PRBS partners to enhance the
capacity of, and information flows with Parliament, civil society and the private sector.

111.    Supervision. Supervision and preparation o f subsequent credits will take place in
close collaboration with other donors and be consistent with the MKUKUTA review
mechanism. For most o f the program areas, supervision and dialogue will be carried out on a
continuous basis in the context o f sector or thematic programs. A joint GBS review will be
conducted annually for an overall assessment o f progress made in each o f the program areas.
Inaddition, the achievement o f PRSC targets will be assessed annually inthe context of the
MKUKUTAreview that will document the progress made inthe MKUKUTAimplementation
and analyze the outcomes o f reforms. The reform program sets out clear quantitative and
qualitative benchmarks for the implementation period o f the MKUKUTA.The PRSC targets
are fully consistent with the MKUKUTA.

FIDUCIARYASPECTS
112.    A Special Audit o f the Bank o f Tanzania (BOT) EPA account for FY05/06 has
identified serious occurrences o f fraud, which affected the integrity of the BOT'Scontrol and
audit systems, and resulted in illicit payments o f more than US$ 75 million made to bogus
private companies from the Central Bank on behalf o f the Ministryo f Finance. Other US$ 35
million inEPA payments inFY05/06 are also suspected to have been illicit, and a fwrther US$
4 million payments made in FY06/07 have also been subject to investigation following the
completion o f the BOTaudit for FY06/07. These fraudulent payments were first brought to the
notice o f the authorities in September 2006 by Deloitte & Touche, the then external auditor o f
BOT,but, following the abrupt termination o fthe auditor contract bythe BOT,remedial action
was only taken in January 2008, after a special audit was conducted by the National Audit
Office through Ernst and Young.

113.    The World Bank is supportive o f the vigorous Government actions taken inthe wake
of the audit report. These include the replacement o f the BOTGovernor, the appointment of
task forces to conduct the criminal investigation and attempt to recover stolen funds, the
suspension o f key officers involved at the Bank o f Tanzania, the appointment o f a standing
Internal Audit Department Director, and the removal o f conflict o f interest inthe Board Audit
Committee at the Central Bank. The national Audit Office has a three-year outsourcing
contract with a reputable international firm for the audit o f the Bank of Tanzania, and has
finalized the audit of the BOTfor 2006/07, including the EPA account. InJuly, the task force
handed in its report to the President who has taken action to recover the stolen funds by
October 2008. At the same time strong corrective measuresto prevent future fraud are needed.
The Government has prepared an action planon the follow-up to the EPA audit, andthe Bank
o f Tanzania i s committed to strengthen control by implementing recommendations o f the
recently-completed IMF Voluntary Safeguard Assessment. The World Bank with GBS
partners will be monitoring closely its implementation, and also monitor the effective
application o f the rule o f law inthese cases o f grandcorruption.




                                                 33

114.     The audits o fthe Central Bank as well as the Voluntary Safeguard Assessment provide
important indications on how to strengthen the control environment at the Bank o f Tanzania.
Over the next fiscal year, the Bank would also want to review with Government the following
measures:

         The progress o f an Anti Money Laundering (AML/CFT) assessment, as a preludefor a
         fullFSAP nextfiscal year;

         The divestiture from the Bank o f Tanzania o f commercial activities, notably large
         commercial loan guarantees, andrefocusing on the Bank's core activities

         A follow up action plan on the implementation o f the recommendations o f the
         Safeguards Assessment.

115.     The previous safeguards assessment o f the BOT, which was completed by the IMF on
December 5, 2003, found that, while the bank had a relatively strong internal control
environment, some vulnerabilities existed, notably inthe external audit and financial reporting
areas. Inorder to mitigate these vulnerabilities, staff made a number o f recommendations. The
BOT has since implemented most o f these recommendations, including: (i)          annual external
audits that are conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA); (ii)
adoption o f International Accounting Standards (IAS) as the financial reporting framework;
(iii)establishment o f a formal process o f reconciling accounting data to the program data
reported to the Fund; (iv) publication o f the full audited financial statements on a timely basis,
within five months o f the financial year's end; and (v) adoption o f an audit charter for the
internal audit function to strengthen audit methodologies and procedures.

116.     The Bank has been regularlyreceiving the annual external audit report for PRSC, and
quarterly internal audit reports o f the same from BOT.To strengthen the confidence in the
fiduciary management o f budget support funds, DP have been carrying out last year an
external review o f the mode o f operation o f the PRBS accounts at the BOT,where all funds of
GBS partners are disbursed. The review confirmed the integrity o f PRBS funds, and made
recommendations on a number o f improvements o f the mode o f operations, on which the
government is working.

117.    Budget resources. A comprehensive audit of budget resources is carried out by the
National Audit Office, as detailed inpar. 87.

DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING
118.    Borrower and credit amount. The borrower is the United Republic o f Tanzania. A
single tranche credit o f SDR 101.8 million (US160 million equivalent) would be made
available upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for November 2008. The closing date o f the
operation would be November 30, 2009. It i s envisaged that there will be two further single-
tranche annual PRSCs to support the implementation o f the MKUKUTA during the period
FY09- FY11.

119.    Disbursement, reporting, and auditing arrangements. The proposed credit will
follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Credit proceeds
will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and
not tied to any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the credit


                                                34

is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the credit will be deposited at
the request of the Borrower by IDA inan account designated by the Borrower at the Bank o f
Tanzania and which forms part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The
Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Credit into said account, an equivalent
amount i s credited in local currency to an account that i s available to finance budgeted
expenditures. The Borrower will provide a written confirmation to the Bank when the amount
has been credited to an account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures. If the
proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Credit
Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to, promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon
such request shall be cancelled. The administration o f this credit will be the responsibility o f
the Ministryof Finance.

120.    The following arrangements also support the requirements related to fiduciary
assurance:

        Foreign reserve account. The government will acknowledge to IDA receipt o f the
        money into the foreign reserve account and the crediting o f this amount in local
        currency to the Tanzania government Consolidated Fund Account. While no external
        audit will be required, it i s expected that the confirmation o f receipt will be
        countersigned by the Accountant General and the Controller and Auditor General.

    0   Public (government) accounts. The Controller and Auditor General is requiredby law
        to produce his annual report to Parliament on the public accounts within nine months
        o fthe financial year-end. IDA will have access to those reports.

        Bank of Tanzania. The annual entity financial statements o f the Bank o f Tanzania,
        audited in accordance with international auditing standards as promulgated by the
        International Accounting Standard Board, are publicly available.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS
121.    The PRSC contributes to the financing o f the implementation o f Tanzania's
MKUKUTA across all three MKUKUTA clusters, but the policy dialogue focuses primarily
on institutional reforms in selected areas. This section thus discusses (a) the likely
environmental effects o f the actions monitored under the PRSC performance assessment
framework and (b) the overall capacity o f government to monitor and mitigate environmental
effects o f budgetary expenditure.

122.    With respect to policy reforms contained inthe Performance Assessment Framework
and supported by the operation, and given the potential negative environmental implications
o f policy reforms and their implementation, several measures are taken to ensure that any
negative environmental effects o f the various activities will be properly addressed by the
government o f Tanzania in collaboration with its development partners. In line with the
requirement o f the Environmental Management Act (EMA 2004), precautionary approaches
need to be undertakenby each sector to capture broader effects within and in other sectors.
EMA requires each sector to establish a sector environmental section that will undertake
analysis o f environmental impacts o f sectoral legislation, regulations, policies, plans,
strategies and programs through strategic environmental assessments. Some o f the key sector
under the program (PRSC) are already inthe process of conducting Strategic Environmental

                                               35

Assessment (SEA), as a precautionary approach. The main objective o f SEA i s to give
particular attention to supporting the incorporation o f environmental and social concerns into
policies and long-term development and investment planning as well as safeguarding against
potential adverse environmental impacts.

123.    Among the policies supported by the operation that may raise concerns from an
environmental perspective is the rehabilitation o f 15,000 km o f roads by 2010. The
implementing agency for road works on main roads in Tanzania, TANROADS, has
established an environmental unit and procedures for the environmental impact assessment o f
its road works. Although Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are normally done by
external consultants, TANROADS i s responsible for reviewing and monitoring o f the
implementation o f the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The preparation o f EM and
EMP i s mandatory for all upgrading works. Only very low impact road works are done on
rural roads by the local governments. The supervising agency at PMO-RALG needs to build
up some EA capacity to advise the LG accordingly. In the rural sector, another area of
potential environmental and natural resource concerns, supported country policies will
promote a more sustainable use o f natural resources and minimize waste. Other sectors, which
have prepared or are in process o f preparing SEA as an input in sector policy formulation,
strategy or planning include: water sector - to strengthen environmental planning and
management capacity for the implementation o f the National Water Policy (NAWAPO); and
irrigation under the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) as part o f preparation
for the National Irrigation Policy and Strategy, which is scheduled to be finalized before June
2009.

124.    The impact o f higher electricity tariffs on fuel wood is expected to be very limited
taking into account that (a) only a relatively small number of Tanzanians are connected to the
grid (with particular low connection rates in rural areas), and (b) electricity is not commonly
used for cooking (mainly for affordability reasons). This said, it needs to be pointed out that
there i s a problem with the unsustainable production o f fuel wood and charcoal, as the main
energy sources for poor households. The Bank is addressing this together with GOT through
developing a charcoal policy note and subsequent development and implementation (at pilot
scale) o f a National Fuel woodCharcoa1 Action Plan under the TZ Forest and Conservation
Project.

125.    Inanalyzing potential effects o f supported country policies onthe environment andthe
government's environmental management capacity in the roads and rural sector, the Bank
relies on a variety o f analytic work undertaken over the past years. These include a Strategic
Environmental Assessment under previous PRSCs and analytic work underpinning
environmental aspects o f investment projects, includingBank projects inthe roads, water, and
energy sector. Inaddition, the Bank supported studies on the interaction betweenpoverty and
environment as well as growth and environment.

126.    As sector support for health, water, and education is beingshifted from specific sector
operations to the PRSC, the PRSC draws on the environmental management systems that
government has established with the support o fthese projects.

127.    Inaddition to the assessment of potential effects of policy actions directly supported
by the PRSC, the PRSC also supports government in its efforts to monitor and mitigate

                                               36

environmental effects o f public expenditures, financed from domestic resources and general
budget support provided under the GBS framework. The implementation o f the National
Environmental Management Act will strengthen in-country capacity for screening, monitoring
investments for positive and negative environmental effects and the ability at national and
district level for identifying mitigation measures for reducing effects. The Act is very
comprehensive and has specific provisions for EA, SEA as well as conflict resolution and
administrative processes for pollution charges according to the `polluter pays' principle. The
Vice President's Office and the National Environmental Management Council have been
supporting the development and implementation o f various sector-specific guidelines for EA
(initially in roads and agriculture), and have more recently pursued procedures for strategic
and sector environmental assessment to permit mitigation o f any adverse environmental
effects while taking advantage o f potential synergies between poverty reduction and
environmental protection efforts.

PARTICIPATORY ASPECTS
128.     The reform agenda supported by the PRSC derives from Tanzania's MKUKUTA,
which has been developed through a consultative process inwhich government sought inputs
and feedback from a wide array of stakeholders representing all levels o f society and all
regions o f Tanzania. Similarly, Tanzania's MKUKUTA monitoring system also i s open to
inputs from inside and outside government.

129.     Aside fiom the MKUKUTA, the government o f Tanzania carries out wide ranging
consultations on most policy reforms and many o f the policy areas covered by the PRSC are
underpinnedby sector or thematic processes that are open to stakeholders from civil society,
NGOs, academic and research institutes, the private sector, and the donor community. This
includes the PER process as a regular forum for dialogue on public expenditure, financial, and
macro-economic management, the Investor Round Table and the Tanzania National Business
Council for government - private sector dialogue, and the environment working group. In
addition, Tanzania has also put in place a process for an independent monitoring o f the
government-donor relationship, which also covers the PRSC. The design o f the GBS
framework seeks to encourage the further development o f participatory review processes inall
areas, which would then provide the main inputs to the overall GBS assessment.

RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION
130.     There are two closely interrelated and overlapping sets of risks for this operation. The
first set includes general risks that may interfere with the successful implementation o f the
MKUKUTA,including the vulnerability of Tanzania's economy to external shocks, political
risks related to the situation in Zanzibar, aid dependence, decentralization, and capacity
constraints. The second set o f risks could undermine the overall credibility o f the GBS process
-andPRSC -as an effective means to channel resources towards the achievement ofthe
MKUKUTA objectives. These risks include: corruption and weak domestic accountability,
the reliance on the domestic budget process, the transition to sector review processes, and
fiduciary risks.

         Vulnerability of Tanzania's growth. Tanzania's growth performance remains
         vulnerable to external shocks which can be exacerbated by domestic structural
         weaknesses. Recurrent droughts have significant impacts on agriculture and the power


                                               37

sector, which i s heavily dependent on hydro generation. The planned expansion o f
Tanzania's power generation capacity, which also includes diversification into thermal
(gas, coal, and fuel) power sources, will be important to avoid recurrent energy crises.
Other areas o f vulnerability to external shocks include tourism, which has become a
leading source o f foreign exchange and which could be affected by developments in
the international security situation, and terms o f trade, especially with regard to the
prices o f the leading export commodities including gold, coffee, tea, and fish, and
import commodities, especially oil. Political disturbances in Kenya have had mixed
effects on growth, as the two countries shares both complementary and substitutable
resources. The recent increases in food price represent an opportunity for the large
rural population, although ina drought year, the country may have to bear the brunt o f
a higher food import bill. The Bank i s discussing with the Authorities measures to
strengthenagriculture production, andtargeted social protection schemes.

Political risk. Since independence in 1961, Tanzania has developed a strong track
record o f political stability which underpins the steadfast implementation o f reforms,
once a consensus has been reached. The main political risk relates to Zanzibar.
Zanzibar's semiautonomous status and the presence there o f a strong opposition party
have led to three contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won despite
international observers' claims o f voting irregularities. InOctober 2001,the ruling and
the main opposition party reached a bilateral accord, which was hailed as a landmark
achievement by an African country to solve its thorny political issues through internal
dialogue. The main opposition party has as a result been represented in the Zanzibar
Electoral Commission as part o f the agreement. In 2006, government and the main
opposition party reaffirmed their commitment to revive the process for mutual political
understanding in Zanzibar, popularly known as Muafaka, but recently a planned
political compromise leading to some level o f power-sharing has hit a stalemate. The
Zanzibar government i s preparing its own poverty reduction strategy (MKUZA) in
consultationwith stakeholders and development partners.

Aid-dependence. Tanzania's dependence on external aid, which is about 12percent of
GDP and finances around 40 percent o f its budget, makes the country extremely
vulnerable to changes in donor sentiment. With respect to general budget support,
disbursements are subject to potentially more abrupt changes o f donor's sentiment. The
PFM underlyingthe PRSC recognizes these risks and contains a general commitment
by all participating donors that, incase budget support is to be reduced, this should be
done in a gradual manner. The Tanzania Assistance Strategy also recognizes the need
to design aid modalities with a view towards minimizingthe scope for abrupt changes.
However, there is also a clear recognition that the authorities need to maintain an
appropriate environment for sustaining relatively highlevels o f aid. The rapid increase
in the level of domestic revenues, which for the first time in FY08/09 will cover
recurrent expenditures, is a critical achievement to mitigate aid dependence.

Decentralization.Another risk for the achievement of MKUKUTA objectives arises
from the ongoing decentralization process, which shifts responsibility for key poverty
reducing programs in education, health, the water sector, and agriculture to the
districts. The local government reform program focuses on strengthening the capacity
o f local authorities. As a result, there have been significant improvements in

                                        38

accountability processes at the local level and about 50 percent o f local authorities
now meet basic accountability standards, compared to an estimated 10 percent only a
few years ago. The PRSC also supports actions to strengthen the watchdog role o f
beneficiaries at the community level through disclosure o f the flow o f resources to
various activities at the grassroots level and expenditure tracking o f financial flows
from the central government through the annual PERs.

Capacity constraints. Limited human resources capacity to implement and manage
the PRSC reform agenda represents another risk. A large number o f capacity-building
efforts are in place. Most reform programs have capacity-building components
embedded, including the PFMRP, the LGRP, and the PSRP. Similarly, sector
programs and projects typically also contain capacity building components. The
challenge for Tanzania i s to enhance the effectiveness of capacity-building efforts by
shifting from supply-drivento demand-driven efforts and address capacity building in
a holistic way, in which the incentive structure, education system, and specific
capacity-building efforts are organized in a mutually reinforcing manner. Analytic
work to address these issues i s planned. In the medium term, it i s expected that the
shift from project to budget support by the Bank and other donors will release staff
that are currently tied up inproject management to play a greater role inoverall public
sector management.

Corruption and weak domestic accountability. One of the intentions o f the
redesigned GBS framework i s to use domestic processes for the assessment o f
progress and dialogue. This i s intendedto foster domestic accountability. However, as
some o f the analytic work has shown, these processes are still weak, partly because o f
weak incentives and capacity o f civil society organizations, NGOs, and the private
sector to participate inthese processes. Recent events, though, have shown a renewed
vigor inthe oversight role o fparliament and o f the media.

Reliance on domestic budget process. The utilization o f PRSC resources is
determined by the domestic budgetprocess with the possibility that resource allocation
i s influenced by other factors than the pursuit o f the MKUKUTA objectives. The
principal mitigating measure derives from strengthening the role o f domestic
stakeholders in budget formulation and budget review. Government's continued
commitment to an open and participatory PER and budget process i s an important and
well established tool to support and monitor consistency o f budget formulation and
execution with the MKUKUTA.It i s worth noting that due to fungibility o f resources,
the allocative risk also exists for other aid modalities and the PRSC i s explicitly
designed to address this risk.

Transition to sector review processes. An important innovation o f the PRSC
program is the shift from a detailed policy matrix with annual monitorable actions to
greater reliance on sector reviews as the primary forum for dialogue and assessment.
Experience from Tanzania's health sector review and from other countries suggests
that it typically takes several years for these reviews to mature and to provide a fully
satisfactory forum for dialogue and assessment. A central objective o f the GBS i s thus
to ensure that these reviews do take place and improve over time as government
develops adequate capacity for these sector reviews. Work on improving the

                                        39

Government M&E systems, and reporting on performance, i s a central part o f
improving the quality o f sector reviews.

Fiduciary risks. The 2006 PEFAR assessment suggests that Tanzania's financial
management system i s among the best in Africa. Nonetheless, significant fiduciary
risks in the areas o f financial management and procurement remain. Inrecent years,
government has implemented measures to reduce fiduciary risks, including the
approval and application o f new public finance and procurement acts, the full
operationalization o f the Integrated Financial Management System, strengthening o f
the National Audit Office, and reform o f the public procurement system. The PFMRP
and actions monitored by the PRSC are designed to address weaknesses in
government's financial management and procurement systems. Tight follow up o f the
Government's action plan on the EPA account audit, and o f other government
measures to assess eventual past fraudulent transactions at the Central Bank will also
bepartofPRSC supervision.

RE: Letter of DeveloPment Policv

1. On behalf of the Governmentof the United Republic of Tanzania, I
hereby write to request approval of the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC-6) in the amount of US$160 million (SDR equivalent). This
credit will assist in the implementation of the National Strategy for
Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA) and in supporting the
ongoing Government reforms ,aiming at maintaining macroeconomic
stability, facilitate private sector's participation in the economy, rural
development, infrastructure and energy and reforms in health,
education, and water sectors, strengthening the public financial
management,                  improvement in public service delivery,     enhance
governance, and ensure environmentaI sustainabiIity       .

I. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS

      A.         MACROECONOMICPERFORMANCE

2.          Tanzania continued to enjoy good macro- economic performance,
with a 7.3 percent real GDP growth rate recorded during the year ending
December, 2007 compared to 6.7 percent growth rate of the same
period in 2006. The good performance in GDP growth was largely

                                           42

attributed to high growth rates in the sectors of the communications
(19.8 percent), mining and quarrying (14.0 percent), financial
intermediation (12.0 percent), construction, and trade and repairs (9.7
percent each). During the year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
revised the National Accounts series in line with the UN System of
National Accounts - 1993 Manual), and applied 2001 as the base year.
The revision incorporates new sources of data on the production of
goods and services, and introduces certain methodological changes to
ensure compliance with international standards set by the United
Nations Statistical Office. Therefore, the revision of the national accounts
statistics resulted in a number of changes in GDP tables including the
overall GDP growth, the structure of the economy, levels and shares.

3.     The economy continued to experience inflationary pressures
during 2007/08 emanating mainly from persistent increase in oil prices
in the world market; increase in power tariff and depreciation of the
shilling in the first three quarters of 2007. From 5.9 percent in June
2007, and 9.0 percent in September, 2007, annual headline inflation rate
eased to 6.4 percent by end December 2007 before increasing again to
9.7 percent by April, 2008. Food prices have begun to ease a factor that
has helped to hold inflation at below 10 percent.

4.    There were positive external developments during 2007/08 fiscal
year despite an unexpected decline in gold production, and a further
increase in oil prices. Merchandise exports grew by about 18 percent
during the period, reflecting mainly a very rapid increase in
manufacturing exports, and a recovery of traditional exports from last
year's sharp drop due to adverse weather conditions. At the same time,
imports also grew at a very rapid pace-nearly 25 percent during the first
7 months of the year-driven mainly by higher fuel costs and increased
investment-related imports including fertilizer. As a result, between July
and December 2007, the current account deficit widened to USD 938.4
million, compared with USD 589.9 million registered in the same period
of the previous year, consistent with programme projections for
2007/08.

5.    As at the end of December, 2007 gross official foreign exchange
reserves stood at USD 2,755.2 million, equivalent to 4.9 months of
imports of goods and services. This level represents an increase of 4.6
percent from their level of USD 2,634.5 million at the end of June, 2006.

                                     43

In the same period, the nominal exchange rate of the shilling to the US.
dollar appreciated from TZS 1,281.0 at end July 2007 to TZS 1,132.1 at
end December 2007.

B.    BUDGET        SUPPORT        AND     ASSISTANCE      FOR      THE
      GOVERNMENT'S OWN REFORM PROCESS

6.    The Government reaffirms that General Budget Support (GBS) is
the preferred aid modality because of its advantages over other
modalities in terms of Government ownership over resource allocation,
and its full integration in the national budget, public financial
management, and accountability systems. Project and basket funding
modalities are expected to be fully in line with national priorities,
strategies and programmes, and rely on Government structures for
implementation in line with the JAST principles. The JAST Action Plan
and Monitoring Framework have been prepared. This is a comprehensive
tool that spells out actions, monitoring indicators and targets for the
implementation of JAST commitments. The actions are based on the
four key areas which include: Formulation and implementation of TA
Policy; Strengthening of MTEF projections and integration of all external
resources in the Government budget and Exchequer system;
Establishing effective division of labour within Government and among
DPs; and Harmonising and rationalising Government and DPs processes
in line with national calendar of processes.

11. REFORMPROGRAMMEUNDERTHE PAF 2005/6 2006/7              -

7.    The JAST adopts all of the existing national MKUKUTA and GBS
processes for monitoring and evaluation. Under the Partnership
Framework Memorandum governing the PAF, an annual review is held to
bring together sector and thematic reviews and against the overall
framework and a joint assessment of performance is produced. The
latest Annual Review was held in October 2007 and the Government
together with DPs assessed the achievements of the PAF/PRSC-6 agreed
actions as outlined hereunder.

             A. INFRASTRUCTUREAND ENERGY

8.    Government recognises the role of Energy and Transport in the
development of the economy. In this regard, removing the impediments

                                     44

to a smooth functioning of these subsectors is pertinent in ensuring a
broad based growth of the economy. The Government is committed to
ensuring that adequate resources are provided to spearhead the process
of establishing smooth energy and transport infrastructure for a
sustainabIe impIementation of MKUKUTA's growth cIuster      .

       PRSC- 6PriorAction:
       Prioritized TransportSector Investment Plan (TSIP) finalized with
       adequateprovision for maintenanceanda framework for PPP

9.     The Transport Sector investment Plan (TSIP)                has been
operationalised and aligned with the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework for 2007/08 - 2009/10. The three year rolling plan has been
finalized by incorporating in its preparation, the Ministry of Infrastructure
Development, PMO-RALG and Agencies involved in preparation of TSIP.
The road maintenance funding has been increased substantially from
Tshs. 85,517 million in FY 2006/07 to Tshs. 217,474 million in FY
2007/08, which is an increase of about 150/0. The increase has almost
covered the maintenance funding gap for FY 2007/08 and is considered
a major achievement for the road sector.

10, The public-private partnership (PPP)          provides framework for
broad-based participation in economic activities through private sector
development, participatory dialogue between Government, Civil Society
and private sector. In this regard, a draft framework for Public Private
Partnership (PPPs) in the road sector has been prepared and a PPP -
Policy Guidelines and regulation for the entire Infrastructure Sector is
underway. The Government will strengthen fiscal risk management
practices by enhancing MOFEA's capacity to adequately monitor risks
stemming from different sources, with a view to preparing a statement
of fiscal risks in the medium term. The framework for deployment of
public private partnerships (PPP) will facilitate in ensuring value for
money and clearly identifying and mitigating fiscal risks associated with
PPP.

       PRSC-6PriorAction:
       RoadsBill Submiited to Parliament

11. The Road Bill was submitted to Parliament in April 2007 and
passed. The Act obtained Presidential consent on 28.08.2007. Other

                                     45

steps are under way to establish an independent Board for TANROADS
and issuance of         Environmental Assessment       and   Management
Regulations

PRSC- 6PriorAction:
       Progress in the implementation of the TANESCO Financial
       Recovery Plan (FRP) and strengthening governance of the
       sector by improvedregulation.

12. The Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) of TANESCO was approved by
the Government in February 2007. The objective of the FRP is to restore
TANESCO's financial performance and credibility and improve technical
performance of power infrastructure including reduction of losses. The
first tariff increase of 6% was effected in February 2007 and EWURA
approved a 21.7 percent power tariff increase for TANESCO beginning
February, 2008. While this is lower than the 40% increase requested by
TANESCO, EWURA agreed to consider another request for a tariff
increase once TANESCO completes its cost of service study and takes
measures to reduce non-technical losses, notably theft. TANESCO is
currently reviewing its financial situation in view of EWURA`s ruling, and
could be in a position to submit in 2009 another application to reach
cost recovery on an operational basis. In the meantime, TANESCO is
using the private emergence power generators to meet intermittent
power supply deficits. The procurement of its own 145MW gas fired
generation capacity is progressing well too. The Government is also
continuing with consultations with development partners to secure
support for the power utility`s investment budget.

13. Despite the improved hydrology and a recent award by EWURA for
a power tariff increase by TANESCO, the financial situation of TANESCO
remains vulnerable, in part because of the non-materialisation of a
number of key cost-reducing measures in its Financial Recovery Plan
(FRP) related to the buy-out and conversion of the IPTL. The
Government will pursue TANESCO's implementation of the cost cutting
measures demanded by EWURA without undue adverse impact on
service delivery. Negotiations with IPTL's main creditors are underway,
with a view to realizing the crucial action on TANESCO's FRP.

A new Electricity Act designed to promote competition and attract
greater private investment to the sector has been enacted and

                                     46

accented.The Power Sector Reform Strategy and the Power Master Plan
are now being finalized in collaborationwith stakeholders.

         B. AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

14. Government continued to implement interventions aimed at
improving agriculture sector development in the country. These
interventions include implementation of the District Agriculture
Development Plans; the Agriculture Marketing Systems Development
Programme; the District Agriculture Investment Project; and the
ParticipatoryAgricultural Development and Empowerment Project.

The Joint Implementation Review of the Agricultural Sector Development
Programme (ASDP) was completed in 2007 .The process was guided by
the Reference Group composed of thematic working groups, Directors of
the Agriculture Sector Lead Ministries, Permanent Secretaries and
Development Partners  .

      PRSC-6 PriorAction:
      DraR amendments to crop board legislation submitted for
      stakeholder consultations and strategic plans for all crop boards
      finalized.

15.   The amendment of crop board legislation was delayed as a result
of delayed approval of funding for Phase 11. A consultant was recruited
in August, 2007 and has finalised draft legislation and stakeholder
consultations took place in November 2007. It is envisaged that draft
legislation will be submitted to the Parliament by November 2008.
Further, all the crop boards have completed the preparations of their
Medium-Term Strategic Plans (MTSPs) in consultation with stakeholders.
The MTSPs will provide a framework for improved service delivery as per
new functions, both regulatory and promotional roles.


         C. MACROECONOMIC STABILITY

16. The Government projects a real GDP growth rate of 7.8 percent in
2008, 8.1 percent in 2009, 8.8 percent in 2010 and 9.2 percent by 2011.
In addition to a steady growth in agriculture which is expected to benefit
from good weather conditions in the current year, strong performance is

                                   47

expected to continue in the communication, construction,         tourism,
financial intermediation, and manufacturingsub-sectors. Accelerating the
rate of growth and poverty reduction in the medium to long term will
continue to be central in the programme design and implementation.
The Poverty and Human Development Report for 2007 was launched
during May 2008. It indicated good progress towards Millennium
Development Goals. In addition, the Government forecasts the following
in the medium term: to control inflation at below 7.0 percent by end
June, 2009; Contain the growth rate of M2 within bands of 24.9 percent
in 2007/08, 23.9 percent in 2008/09 and 22.9 in 2009/10, consistent
with GDP growth and inflation targets; Maintain adequate official foreign
exchange reserves of not less than a value equivalent to five months
worth of imports of goods and non-factor services; Maintain a market
determined realistic exchange rate, with Bank of Tanzania's intervention
exclusively limited to smoothing wide fluctuations and/or liquidity
management purposes; and Accelerate reforms to the requisite legal
and regulatory framework for enhancing access to credit by the private
sector.

17. The Government intends to further improve domestic resource
mobilisation with a view to generating sufficient resources to fund
reform initiatives for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Domestic
revenue was 16.7 percent of GDP in 2007/08, and is projected at 18.5
percent in 2008/09, and 18.6 percent in 2009/10 and 19.0 percent in
2010/11. This will benefit from the impact of continued strengthening of
tax and customs administration, and policy measures, including putting
in place better procedures for non-tax revenue collection. Revenue
administration measures include widening the tax base by registering
new taxpayers, improving compliance, and continuing improving the
investment and business environment; the expansion of tax base as a
result of high economic growth particularly in the sectors that contribute
substantially to government revenue together with the management and
control of tax exemptions; strengthening supervision of excise and
customs duties; and implementation of a TRA Third Corporate Plan,
which focuses on promoting compliance and accountability among the
taxpayers and tax collectors.

18. Total national debt stock at end December 2007 stood at USD
7,041.2 million, compared to USD 7,188.4 million at end December
2006. The debt stock comprises USD 1,673.5 million domestic debt, and

                                     48

USD 5,367.7 million external debt. The stock level shows a decline of 2
percent, equivalent to USD 147.2 million relative to the level in the
preceding year. Consequently, the share of domestic debt in total debt
rose from 18.4 percent to 23.8 percent, and that of external debt
declined from 81.6 percent to 76.2 percent.


         D. IMPROVEMENT          I N   THE    EFFECTIVENESS          OF
         DELIVERYOF PUBLIC SERVICES

19. The Government recognises the importance of sustaining
macroeconomic stability, improving the quality of budget formulation
and its implementation as well as ensuring the overall expenditure
discipline. The underlying processes for this area include the Budget
Guidelines, the Public Expenditure and FinanciaI AccountabiIity Review
(PEFAR), Policy Support Instrument (PSI), Annual MKUKUTA Progress
Report, and quarterly Budget Execution Reports.

20.   Budget execution for the year 2006/07 was broadly in line with the
approved budget with domestic revenues registering a 2 percent over
performance against budget estimate.       The good performance in
revenue collection during 2006/07 was driven by income taxes, import
duties and excise duty on imports both petroleum and other imports. In
addition, the Government has continued with its efforts to improve the
business environment, monitoring implementation of institutional
reforms by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) under its five year
corporate plan that has led to significant improvement in revenue
collection.

PRSC-6PriorAction:
Expenditureoutturn for FY07 consistent with approved budget.

PRSC-7 Trigger:
Expenditure outturn consistent with approved budget and recurrent
budget deviation reduced.

21.   Expenditure performance for 2006/07 was broadly in-line with
budget estimates, with recurrent and development expenditure reaching
103 percent and 77 percent respectively. However there were some
deviations from initial budget, which were attributed mainly to the
                                   49

Government decision to reallocate funds from less to more priority areas
in response to power crisis experienced in the first half of 2006/07, food
shortages, oil prices and higher domestic interest payments. The
Government is strengthening cash management function to ensure
efficient resource utilisation by spending agencies and cash flow
forecasting functions.

   PRSC-6 PriorAction:
   Approved budget for ff08 in line withpolicy objectives(MKUKUTA)

   PRSC-7 Trigger:
   Approved budget broadly in fine with policy objectives (MKUKUTA,
   sectorpolicies)

22. The approved budget for 2007/08, had projected revenue at 16.7
percent of GDP (based on new series); reflecting an increase of 28
percent from the 2006/07 outturn, primarily on account of the
continued improvements in tax administration, while continuing to
improve overall business environment. This target was achieved.

23.   The Government has consistently placed high priority on
implementing the Vision 2025, MKUKUTA and Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). The Government recognises that this commitment
requires a substantial quantity of resources from stakeholders. In the
medium-term, the Government is determined to further enhance
revenue collection, particularly domestic revenue. To this end, the
Government recurrent expenditure shall be fully financed from domestic
revenue. In the Budget Guidelines for 2008/09 - 2010/11, the
Government has cautiously considered development partners' pledges to
the national budget in a manner that will ensure sustainability of its core
functions. Total expenditure is projected at 28.3 percent of GDP
consistent with the planned resources for 2008/09. A gradual decline in
expenditure is envisaged during the medium term primarily on account
of cautious projections of foreign contribution into the budget. In order
to keep the macroeconomic variables on track and under normal
circumstances, no net domestic financing is planned in the medium
term.

24. To strengthen focus in the prioritisation of institutional
interventions consistent with national priorities, Budget Guidelines

                                   50

Committee provided indicative ceilings to all MDAs and Regions during
preparation of their respective budgets for the MTEF period. Each
institution was advised to submit additional requests (if necessary)
separately stating why the given ceiling could not address such areas of
intervention. This proved to be very useful. Some MDAs have continued
to benefit from the inputs derived from the ongoing MKUKUTA costing
exercise. This further improved the linkages between MKUKUTA and
resource allocation..

25.   The Government is putting effort to include MKUKUTA analysis in
the Budget Execution Reports.         This includes improving budget
preparation by further aligning MKUKUTA, the MTEF, and the budget,
including by reviewing the links between the Strategic Budget Allocation
System and the IFMIS which will also allow tracking budget execution
along the MKUKUTA Clusters. Further the Government is improving
expenditure monitoring through Expenditure Tracking and Monitoring
Unit at the Treasury, and the production of performance based reporting
by spending agencies, in order to enhance the efficiency in resource
utilisation.

          E. IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
          AND THE OVERALL INCENTIVE ENVIRONMENT

26.   Government has continued with its efforts to improve performance
of the public service to deliver better services. The achievements in
Public Service Reform Programme (PSRP) Phase I(2000-2007) include:
documentation of PSRP Phase 11; increased levels of pay and instituting
accountability framework for all MDAs across the Government. The key
focus of the PSRP was to institute performance management systems in
MDAs whereas the next two phases are aimed at deepening focus on
performance and accountability and putting           in  place quality
improvement cycles. Specifically, Phase I1 of the Public Service Reform
Programme (2008-2012) will have greater focus on implementation of
reforms by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and will also
seek to enhance the coordination of core reforms at the centre of
Government. In addition, very wealthy information has been made
available to the public through the website and can easily be
downloaded. They contain indicators that are monitored throughout the
implementation of the programme and the yearly benchmarks. During


                                   51

this phase, review process will be open to key Ministries and is expected
to gradually include representativesfrom non-state actors.

 27.     Significant progress has been made in the legal sector reform as
well as local government reform; the Government has streamlined the
 prosecution service and modernized investigation system. As with local
government reform, efforts have been placed in fiscal decentralization
with six MDAs' having embedded Decentralisation by Devolution (D by
 D); establishment of a Ministerial Task Force to expedite D by D and
 increased capacity for councillors and staff of LGAs. However, the
challenge remains on attracting and retaining staff in remote areas and
 balancing allowances and salary.

             F. MINIMISATION OF RESOURCE LEAKAGES AND THE
             STRENGTHENING OF ACCOUNTABILITY

28.     Government sustains the effort to promote transparency and
accountability in the management of public resources through the Audit
Committees established in all MDAs. Committees' main focus was on
addressing the observations in the 2005/06 report of the National Audit
Office (NAO). Spending agencies are producing quarterly reports of
implementationof recommendationsof CAG and PPRA audits.

29. The Government continues to make progress in addressing
governance issues. The PCCB is actively investigating several prominent
cases of alleged corruption and has presented a number of cases to the
Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal action. Following the
completion of the special audit of the EPA Account in November 2007,
the Government has developed an action plan for implementing the
recommendations of the audit report. Several measures have already
been taken. The President has withdrawn the appointment of the former
Governor of the BOT and a criminal investigationof all involved parties is
underway as well as legal procedures to recover the stolen funds. The
BOT has suspended all transactions in the EPA account and has taken
disciplinary action against BOT officials involved in the initiation,
processing, and approving of EPA payments. Steps have also been taken
to strengthen the governance structure of the BOT, including the


'These ministries are Educationand VocationalTraining, Healthand Social Welfare, PMO-PALG,
Infrastructure Development, Community DevelopmentGender and Children and Agriculture.

                                               52

appointment of a new Board. In addition, the Audit Committee of the
Board is now chaired by a non-executive member of the Board and the
Governor no longer serves on this committee to allow unencumbered
scrutiny of all financial matters.

30.   The Government intends to further reinforce good governance and
accountability, particularly in the area of public procurement with the
objective of strengthening the capacity of procurement agencies to
comply with procurement regulations. In line with its action plan
responding to the recommendations of the EPA audit, the Government
will carry out a verification of the remaining EPA claims and develop a
strategy for acknowledging and eventually settling the accounts
legitimately due on the basis of guidelines for settlement of public debt.
The Government is committed to complete this process including
investigation by the Presidential Task Force, on the EPA report. The BOT
is also undertaking a fundamental review of its functions, with a view to
identifying those that could be outsourced or hived off from the Bank.
The Government will clarify the relationship between the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs (MOFEA) and the BOT regarding some of
the tasks that the BOT conducts on behalf of the MOFEA, including the
management of the EPA account.

31.   The BOT is reviewing its internal controls mechanism and had
requested the International Monetary Fund to undertake a voluntary
safeguards assessment of the BOT to assist it in strengthening its
governance. Recommendations of the IMF safeguards assessment will
be incorporated in the BOT'S Corporate Action Plan, and that further
update assessment will be conducted in three years.          Further, the
government through PCCB is investigating the expenditures related to
construction of BOT Twin Towers and Mwananchi Gold Company
Investment. Arrangements are in place to commission a Value For
Money (VFM) audit on the Twin Towers project separate from the PCCB
investigations. On the Mwananchi Gold Company Itd ,the Board of the
BOT has recently decided to terminate the Bank's involvement and the
USD 5.5 million extended by the Bank and collateralized loan is expected
to be recovered at least 60 - 70 percent through liquidation of the
company's remaining property.        With regard to the BOT 2006/07
financial statements, the audit report with unqualified opinion of the
Auditors has been discussed by the Parliamentary Oversight Committee
(POC) in July 2008 and tabled in the Parliament in August 2008.

       PRSC-6PriorAction:
      Anti-corruptionact enacted

32. The Parliament passed the new anti-corruption legislation in April
2007 and the President assented to it on 11th June, 2007 and a
Government Notice was published in the Official Gazette to
operationalise the new law effective 1st July 2007. The new anti-
corruption strategy seeks to establish a NationalAnti - corruption Forum
for annual dialogue on anti-corruption between Government and
national stakeholders and development partners. One output of the
dialogue would be regular reviews of the anti-corruption environment
and recommendationsto strengthen NACSAP.


33.   The Government plans to review the regulatory framework for
preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism based on an
assessment prepared by the regional body, the Eastern and Southern
African Anti Money Laundering Group, by end September 2008

       PRSC-6PriorAction:
      Audit Billsubmitted to Parliament

34. The Public Audit Bill was approved by Parliament in June, 2008,
and enacted as the Public Audit Bill No. 11of 2008. The Bill is expected
to further strengthen the independence of the National Audit Office.

35. The Government's effort to strengthen the public financial
management (PFM) systems is focusing on strategic resource allocation,
and ensuring value for money in budget execution. The Government has
adopted a revised strategy for the Public Financial Management Reform
Program (PFMRP).      Phase I11 of the PFMRP will strengthen the
management of the program, increase ownership of the reforms by the
various components, and roll out reforms to the line ministries and Local
Government Authorities. The programme seeks to achieve allocative
efficiency through ensuring aggregate fiscal discipline and accountability,
allocation of resources in accordance with government priorities, and
promoting efficient service delivery through enhanced predictability and
availability of medium term resources for implementing agencies
(MDAs)  .

                                    54

         G. ENVIRONMENTALSUSTAINABILITY

36. A Strategic Plan is in place for the implementation of the
Environmental Management Act (EMA) 2004 by each MDA and LGA. In
this regard, MDAs and LGAs have started implementing EMA. In
addition, the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) is
already implementing the Act by undertaking unscheduled checks on
industries. However there is a need to strengthen supervision and
monitoring.

         H. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

37. The Government will continue to sustain a conducive environment
for private sector participation in the economy. Improvement of the
business environment to promote investment is a prerequisite for
accelerated and sustainable growth in a stable macroeconomic
environment. This includes availability of credit to private sector, which
is being addressed under the Second Generation Financial Sector Reform
Programme.

38.   In cognizance of the need to provide sector specific information,
public and private sector information sharing through TNBC will be
strengthened. This may involve promotion of lively discussion with
apparent consensus on the need for an operational Growth Strategy,
with participation drawn from MDAs, private sector, academia and DPs
sides. The TNBC may constitute a forum for charting out the growth
strategy. In this regard, the Government will review existing strategies
with a view to implementing a more coherent growth strategy with focus
on prioritization of expendituresand outputs.

         I. SECTORREVIEWS

Health

39. The health sector review was conducted in October 2007 and
Development Partners expressed agreement with the Government that
the health sector review has improved over the last year. More
milestones have been achieved and there was better participation during

                                   55

the year. The Government attaches great importance to the institutional
memory in assessing progress in the health sector, noting that the
eighth review conducted last year provided progress that has been
made in ARV treatment and on Millennium Development Goals 4 and 6.
In this regard, the following prior action was fulfilled

PRSC-6 PriorAction:
Fairlysatisfactoryhealth sector review was carriedoutin 2007

Education

40.    In order to sustain Government effort in improving access and
quality the ESR 2007 emphasized the need of allocating limited financial
resources to address agreed priorities for all subsectors. Further, the
review noted that at post-primary, the country should focus on quality
and skills development.

41.    Remarkably good performance continues to be observed in
relation to overall enrolment of both girls and boys in Education Sector.
This review noted a number of challenges, including the shortage of
qualified teachers (especially in rural areas), and the need to improve
quality of primary education through provision of teaching and learning
materials. Drop-out rates in primary education also remain a challenge
and there is need for a multi-sector approach to this particular issue.
The review also highlighted the increasing demand for secondary
education, and the need to expand gross enrolment in higher education
institutions in the near future. The sector is currently implementing the
recommendations from the review which were agreed through the
Education Sector Review Aide Memoire of November 2007. With this
review, the prior action outlined hereunder has been fulfilled.

PRSC-6PriorAction:
Fairlysatisfactory educationsector review wascarriedoutin 2007

Water

42. The review conducted indicated that the Government has
established a good framework in terms of policy, strategy, and dialogue
in the last two years but performance in increasing access to water is
still low. The Government will take necessary actions to increase

                                     56

accessibility of water to the citizens and undertake the rehabilitation of
the non-functioning water facilities. Sector budget has gone up and is
expected to increase further to reach the target and this will facilitate
the increase in water access coverage rate. The National Water Sector
Development Strategy has already been submitted to the Cabinet and
the Draft Water Bill is in place and will be aligned with the Strategy. In
this regard, the following action has been achieved.

 PRSC-6PriorAction:
 A fairk satisfactotywatersector review wascarriedout in 2007

HIVIAIDS
43.    Substantial progress has been made by all MDAs in implementing
activities related to mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS in their sector and work
place. The Guidelines for the Civil Service on HIV/AIDS are available at
the President's Office, Public Service Management. Other areas are: the
revision of the National Multi Sectoral Strategic Framework on HIV and
AIDS for 2008 -2012, existence of Regional FacilitatingAgencies (RFAs)
to support Local Government Authorities on HIV/AIDS; National
Voluntary Counselling and Testing Campaign by the President on 14th
July 2007 which continued up to 1' December 2007 and Care and
Treatment has been strengthened.

44.   Further, all MDAs have a component of mainstreaming HIV/AIDS
in their respective plans and budgets and the establishment of Technical
AIDS Committees (TAC) for coordinating HIV/AIDS in MDAs has resulted
in an increase in the public sector response. In addition, the introduction
of a specific code to track HIV/AIDS expenditures in the Government
budget under expenditure objective A has enhanced in some extent the
mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS in the national budget.


Social Protection Framework

45. The Government in consultation with stakeholders has developed a
draft Social Protection Framework (SPF). The draft aims at ensuring that
the interventions will benefit the most vulnerable people. Development
of Social Protection Implementation Framework is expected to guide all
actors involved in the implementation.

                                    57

  MILESTONES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MKUKUTA

 46.    Some of the key milestones that Government hopes to achieve in
 2008 to advance the implementation of MKUKUTA are reflected in the
                                                                                            ~

                                                    58

xxii. Expenditure outturn consistent with approved budget and
      recurrent budget deviation reduced.


CONCLUSION

47. The Government remains committed to continue focusing on
sustaining macroeconomic stability, increasing domestic resource
 mobilisation, promoting pro poor economic growth, and increased
 investment in core social services like education, health and water. The
Government is confident that various reforms pursued under the PRSCs
and others in the PAF will further improve service delivery in public
sector. Further, the Government recognisesthat the support by the Bank
and other development partners will complement government's efforts
to ensuring adequate funding of MKUKUTA interventions, a key to
sustainable growth and poverty reduction.         Thus, the Government
requests the International Development Association to approve the
provision of US$160 million to support the Government's efforts in
sustaining macroeconomic stability and continuing to implement the
reforms.


                  Thank you for your continued support.

                            Yours sincerely,

ANNEX 3: FUNDRELATIONNOTE
IMFExecutiveBoard Completesthe SecondReview Under the Policy Support Instrument for
Tanzania

Press ReleaseNo. 08/129
May 30,2008
The ExecutiveBoard o fthe International Monetary Fund(IMF) today completedthe thirdreview under a
three-year Policy Support Instrument(PSI) for Tanzania.
The PSI was approved on February 16, 2007 (see Press Release no. 07/26) and is aimed at sustaining
broad-based high growth and accelerating progress in poverty reduction. To that end, the PSI supports
enhancing public resource mobilization and efficiency of spending; bolstering financial sector reforms
and the effectiveness o f monetary policy; and improving the business climate to stimulate private sector-
ledgrowth.
Following the Board's discussion on Tanzania, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, made the following statement:
"Tanzania's continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies has contributed to sustained
robust economic growth. High global fuel and food prices pose challenges, but Tanzania's flexible
exchange rate policy, ample stock o f international reserves, and a favorable near-term agricultural
outlook should help to cushion the adverse effects of these shocks. Persistent high petroleum prices and
slow world economic growth could, however, dampen Tanzania's economic growth prospects.
"Implementation of the government's budget in 2007/08 has been strong-again             led by an impressive
revenue performance. For the year ahead uncertainty about donor assistance has complicated budget
preparations. While there i s some scope for domestic financing to ensure continuity of critical public
expenditures, greater spending restraint may also be necessary if aid flows fall significantly short o f
projections,
"The marked improvement inmonetary and foreign exchangeoperations over the past several months has
enhanced the predictability o f the Bank of Tanzania's monetary policy and contributed to a welcome
decline in yields on government securities. Looking ahead, monetary policy will needto remain vigilant
to ensure that pressures from high global fuel and food prices do not spread to other sectors, while
providing sufficient room for continuedexpansion of credit to the private sector.
"The government's focus on improving infrastructure as well as health and education services, while
ensuring long-term debt sustainability, is appropriate to raise Tanzania's growth potential. To that end,
there is scope for increased reliance on public-private partnerships, provided that high standards of
transparency and accountability are in place to guard against fiscal risks associated with contingent
liabilities.
"Recent cases o f alleged fraud and corruption have raised concerns, and continued progress in
strengthening governance and public accountability is paramount to restore confidence. Steps taken so
far, including the action plan to implement recommendations from the special audit of the Bank o f
Tanzania, are encouraging. In addition, the authorities have requested a voluntary safeguards assessment
of the central bank from the Fund.
"With respect to Tanzania's breach o f its obligation under Article VIII, Section 5 o f the Fund'sArticles o f
Agreement to provide accurate information to the Fund, the authorities have taken appropriate remedial
measures and no further action i s required," Mr.Portugal said.
The IMF's framework for PSISis designed for low-income countries that may not need IMF financial
assistance, but still seek close cooperation with the IMF in preparation and endorsement of their policy
frameworks. PSI-supported programs are basedon country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in
a participatory process involving civil society and development partners. This is intendedto ensure that
PSI-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural,
and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is reviewed
semi-annually, irrespective o f the status of the program (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).
