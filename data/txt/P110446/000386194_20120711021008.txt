Contributions
to CAS        The proposed RRDPG is consistent with the CAS FY07-11 and is also an integral
              part of the Bank‘s assistance program to Malawi articulated in upcoming CAS
              FY13-16, currently being finalized for Board presentation in the second quarter of
              FY13. The operation is consistent with the CAS FY07-11 outcome on improved
              public expenditure management, transparent budget formulation, execution and
              reporting, and facilitation of the development of a more coherent National Social
              Protection Policy.

Risks and    Four main risks could influence the expected outcomes of the proposed operation:
Risks
Mitigation   (a) Shortfalls in donor support could have a deterring impact on economic growth, as
             they could weaken the balance of payments and widen the external financing gap and
             could force the authorities to borrow domestically, which is not in line with the fiscal
             adjustment path currently being pursued. Given the low level of official reserves and
             significant import needs, this would put enormous pressure on what already is a tough
             fiscal adjustment process and could undermine fiscal sustainability and/or jeopardize
             necessary social and capital expenditures. These risks are mitigated by a number of
             factors. First, the authorities have already undertaken measures to repair relations with
             development partners (DPs) and intend to address governance and human rights
             concerns. Second, the authorities are committed to a prudent fiscal stance and a flexible
             exchange rate policy, which provide key anchors for external and debt sustainability.
             Third, predictable and timely budget support, backed by analytical support (i.e.
             programmatic public expenditure reviews) and policy dialogue through the future DPO
             series and good-will from DPs to aid GoM‘s ongoing medium-term fiscal consolidation
             program, will also help mitigate the risks. A new 3-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
             supported program for Malawi is expected to be presented to the IMF Board in July
             2012. This should pave the way for resumption of budget support for most of the
             Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) DPs.

             (b) Political risk. The current administration, in power since early April 2012, has
             embarked on bold reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and is committed to
             maintain prudent macroeconomic policies. However, the risk might arise from tensions
             between political pressures to expand the GoM programs and the need to maintain a
             prudent fiscal stance with a view to keeping inflation pressures at bay as well as
             preserving debt sustainability. This is mitigated by the GoM‘s efforts to build support
             for policy reforms supported by this operation.

             (c) Social tensions. The consequences of some of the economic policies of the previous
             administration and adjustments that are taking place in the economy could lead to
             further upward pressure on consumer prices and could erode further consumer
             purchasing power, which could raise social tensions. In addition, increases in fuel
             prices could result in second round effects on prices of other products leading to further
             tensions. Domestic tensions could affect investor and consumer confidence, which
             would constrain further private investment. There will be a need for the GoM to engage
             all key stakeholders to rally support for reforms and help stakeholders understand their
             consequences and manage expectations. In addition, the GoM‘s efforts on enhancing
             social inclusion through education, health and social protection programs is expected to
             offset potential social tensions.

             (d) Implementation capacity risks. The GoM‘s capacity to massively scale up social
             safety net programs could be overstretched. This could delay the implementation of the
             programs supported by this operation and lead to low utilization of available resources
             and insufficient coverage of beneficiaries. Given the fact that DPs are financing a large
             part of the social protection interventions and the fact that programs being scaled up

                          Project Development Objective and Description
Current project development objective :
To improve livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and to strengthen the capacity of
local authorities to manage local development.

Project description:
Community Livelihoods Support (CLS) Fund: This component has two sub-components to
finance: (a) Public Works Subprojects (PWSPs) under the Local Authority Fund (LAF), and (b)
investments for improving functionality of existing facilities and creation of opportunities for
community savers and entrepreneurs to increase their participation in Local Economic
Development under the Community Fund.

Local Authority Capacity Enhancement (LACE) Fund: This component focuses on support for
the development of a comprehensive framework for addressing capacity needs for Local
Authorities in the effective management of grants they are already receiving, performing the
functions allocated to them under this project, and preparing them to perform anticipated
responsibilities as devolution proceeds and more resources are available under the LDF or any
other longer-term GoM grant arrangement.

National Institutional Strengthening Fund: The component finances national-level cross-cutting
issues aimed at improving accountability and transparency in the use of project resources.

                             Project Development Objective and Description
Current project development objective: (i) to increase agricultural productivity and incomes
of approximately 196,550 poor rural households in the 11 participating districts and (ii) to
strengthen Recipient institutional capacity for long-term irrigation development. Note: This is
the simplified version of the PDO from the first Additional Financing, mainly revised to be in
line with the Project Financing Agreement.

Revised project development objective: to: (i) increase agricultural productivity of poor rural
households in all districts; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity for long-term irrigation
development.
The PDO has been changed to cover all districts in the country and allow for changes in the
number of targeted beneficiaries as captured in the Results Framework.

Original Project description: The original project has 4 components: (i) Irrigation
Rehabilitation and Development and Catchment Conservation; (ii) Farmer Services and
Livelihood Fund; (iii) Institutional Development and Community Mobilization; and (iv) Project
Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation.

Revised Project description: The revised project will have 5 components: (i) Irrigation
Rehabilitation and Development and Catchment Conservation; (ii) Farmer Services and
Livelihood Fund; (iii) Institutional Development and Capacity Enhancement; (iv) Project
Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation; and (v) Contingency for Disaster Risk Response.
The fifth component is a new component, which will allow for rapid response in future
emergencies. The title for component 3 is revised to reflect re-grouping of some activities.

                           RAPID RESPONSE PROGRAM

OVERVIEW: RAPID RESPONSE PROGRAM

A.     Introduction

1.      This Rapid Response Program Paper seeks approval of the Executive
Directors to provide IDA Grant and Credit in the amount of SDR 99.6 million
(US$150 million equivalent) to the Republic of Malawi (Malawi) in support of its
reform program. The Program responds to an urgent request by the Government of
Malawi (GoM) to support the ongoing macroeconomic stabilization program as well as
measures which will mitigate the impacts of the wide range of reforms which are being
currently implemented. GoM has undertaken bold economic reforms since Mrs. Joyce
Mtila Banda took over as President on April 7, 2012, after the death of President Bingu
wa Mutharika. Some of the key economic reforms include liberalizing Malawi‘s foreign
exchange regime and significant fuel and power price adjustments to better cover costs of
these essential commodities.

2.      Despite the soundness of the measures undertaken, the economy remains
fragile given Malawi‟s extremely weak reserve position, slow re-start of aid inflows,
and the need to undertake fiscal adjustment measures to reverse poor policies
carried out in the past year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates GoM‘s
external financing needs in the short term at about US$200 million to build reserves and
meet immediate external obligations. While the timing of the exchange rate liberalization
is benefiting a large number of small-scale tobacco farmers, there are large portions of
urban and rural poor who remain negatively impacted by the events of the past year. The
Bank analysis shows that an additional US$80-100 million per year is needed to partially
cover the loss of welfare of the poorest 60 percent of rural and urban population. Labor-
intensive public works programs and measures to protect livelihood through support to
agricultural productivity and income diversification have been identified as the most
suitable instruments to achieve partial coverage of welfare loses of the poorest. This will
help maintain the current popular support for the overall reform effort and inject
resources into the system to help the poorest, particularly before the new planting season.

3.      Timing of the support is critical to maintain confidence in the reform effort.
Since the liberalization of the exchange rate market and subsequent adjustment of the
official exchange rate (from MWK 167 to MWK 250 per USD), the official Kwacha rate
has depreciated by a further 8 percent to MWK270 as of June 21, 2012, as the exchange
rate seeks its equilibrium and the official rate remains in line with the market determined
rate. Given the thinness of the foreign exchange market, the authorities fear that the
system is at a high risk of excessive short run volatility (i.e., overshooting) if donor
financing is not injected promptly. Early disbursement of aid would help assuage these

                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

and other risks. Thus, there is a need to urgently provide external resources to (i) help
stabilize the system and let the reform momentum continue to take hold, and (ii) scaleup
social protection programs to mitigate the effects of the measures on the most vulnerable
population.

4.      Malawi‟s Development Partners (DPs) are reacting positively to the reforms.
DPs are in the process of accelerating their assistance to Malawi in response to the urgent
request from GoM to improve its foreign exchange position through general budget
support and emergency social support programs. The Bank is playing a constructive role
in this process and is working closely with DPs and the IMF in coordinating this urgent
support. An IMF mission was in Malawi in May/early June 2012, working on a new
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Program, and has issued an assessment letter to DPs on
June 20, 2012. The Department for International Development (DfID), the US, Norway
and Ireland are also moving ahead quickly. Nevertheless, as of mid-June only DfID has
disbursed £30 million under its existing programs. A first tranche of the European Union
(EU) Sector Budget Support (13 million Euro) is expected to be transferred immediately.
The African Development Bank (AfDB), using accelerated procedures, plans to go with a
US$45 million budget support (with first tranche of US$30 million to be disbursed in
July). The IMF plans to present its program to its Board in July, following the
Parliamentary adoption of the Budget on June 27, 2012. In addition, a coalition of DPs
has been formed to support the implementation of the draft National Social Strategy
including the expansion of cash transfer programs – currently in place in seven districts -
for the next few years.

5.     To allow the World Bank to respond more quickly and directly to the appeal
issued by GoM, the Bank has proposed a US$150 million IDA Rapid Response
Program (RRP), comprising:
      A Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG), in the amount of
        US$50 million, prepared in tandem with the IMF program that will focus on: (i)
        achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring the
        functioning of a market based economy to ensure a quick growth rebound, and
        (ii) protecting the poor and most vulnerable groups in the short run while
        improving transparency of delivery systems; and

        Two Additional Financing (AF) Operations for US$50 million each (totaling
         US$100 million) for ongoing operations – Malawi Third Social Action Fund
         APL II (MASAF 3) and Irrigation Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural
         Development Project (IRLADP) - to provide mitigation measures for the
         vulnerable. The objective of MASAF 3 is ―to improve livelihoods of poor and
         vulnerable households and to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to
         manage local development‖ while IRLADP aims to ―increase agricultural
         productivity of poor rural households in all districts, and strengthen recipient
         institutional capacity for long-term irrigation development‖.

6.     The objective of this RRP is to “support emergency recovery reforms aimed
at restoring macroeconomic stability, accelerate the resumption of growth, and
mitigate the impacts on vulnerable households from the legacy of inflationary
pressures and rebalancing of the economy?. The three operations comprising the
RRP are described in Table 1.

Rapid Response           50     The operation will focus on efforts to restore macroeconomic
Development Policy              stability, strengthen social protection interventions and the
Grant                           resilience of the most vulnerable groups to shocks, improve
                                functioning of the petroleum market and incentives to exporters
                                (including smallholder tobacco farmers), and improve economic
                                management of the farm input subsidy program (FISP).
AF - Malawi Social       50     The project will help scale up the social safety net program
Action Fund                     through labor intensive public works. The AF will have
                                nationwide coverage and reach both rural and urban areas. The
                                number of additional beneficiaries will be 586,000 households
                                or 2.9 million people, representing 20 percent of the population.
                                Beneficiaries will be identified using community based and self
                                targeting.
AF - Irrigation, Rural   50     The project will scale up its social safety net function and
Livelihoods and                 support productive rural livelihoods in irrigation, as well as
Agricultural                    prepare for further investments that strengthen resilience in
Development Project             agriculture. The project will reach an additional 230,000
                                households (about 1.25 million people) and scale up to all
                                districts in the country.

7.      The proposed two additional financing operations are processed under
OP/BP 8.00, Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies. These operations will help
restore the means of production and economic activities in both rural and urban areas
which have been affected by rising basic commodity prices as a result of the exchange
rate unification and the petroleum pricing reforms. The proposed additional financing
operations are consistent with OP/BP 13.20, Additional Financing as they will help
implement additional and expanded activities to scale up the two project‘s impact
throughout the country.

8.     The program is aligned with the ongoing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
and is also consistent with new World Bank Group CAS for Malawi (FY13-16)
which is at an advanced stage of preparation. The last CAS was discussed by the
Board on February 13, 2007 and was intended to cover the period up to June 30, 2010.
However, implementation of the full CAS program suffered several delays, primarily due
to the political stalemate in Parliament in 2008-2009 which stalled the approval of
reforms and ratification of many operations; the full CAS program was delivered by
FY11 (June 30, 2011). The delay in the approval of the Second Malawi Growth and

Development Strategy (MGDS II), coupled with deteriorating governance and substantial
weakening of macroeconomic performance since 2010, precluded the development of a
new assistance strategy. In April 2012, the new Government adopted the MGDS II
(2011-2016). In view of the magnitude of the reform effort, the Bank agreed to slightly
postpone the finalization of the new CAS, and allow for an additional round of
consultations with the new GoM. This would allow some time to further prioritize the
MGDS II in light of the new macroeconomic realities, and help re-confirm the Bank‘s
contribution to investing in Malawi‘s medium and longer term development agenda. For
example, there are now opportunities to make significant progress on the regional
integration agenda especially in energy and regional trade. The new FY13-16 World
Bank CAS for Malawi will be presented to the Board in the second quarter of FY13, with
the Joint Staff Advisory Note of the MGDS II expected to be presented to the Board in
early August.

9.      The proposed RRP is not co-financed by other development partners but has
been designed in close coordination with the IMF and all other partners in Malawi,
working together within a Common Approach of Budget Support (CABS) framework, as
well as in social protection and agriculture.

10.    This document comprises an overview, which provides the context, rationale,
and description of the Program, and three attachments providing detailed
description for each of the three proposed operations.

B.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

11.     Landlocked Malawi has one of the lowest levels of per capita income (US$330
in 2009) in the world. With a population of 14.9 million (2010, World Development
Indication [WDI]), it ranks among the world‘s most densely populated countries. The
country is highly vulnerable to shocks, particularly given its undiversified production and
export structure, and is prone to droughts, floods, and frequent food shortages. Despite
strong growth performance during 2006-10, poverty levels remain high and the economy
faces key structural, capacity, and infrastructure constraints.

12.     Malawi‟s record on governance had been deteriorating since 2010.
Underlying governance challenges, such as lack of checks and balances in the political
process, affected the environment for growth, the investment climate, and servicedelivery
potential. Over 2010-2011, the Parliament passed a number of laws perceived as
weakening democratic institutions and abrogating the respect for human rights raising
serious concerns by domestic stakeholders. A fall-out between President Mutharika and
the Vice President Banda over succession strategies resulted in the Vice President taking
her own political course in early 2011, while formally maintaining her Vice President
position. As the main alternative voices, leaders of civil society and the press received
vehement criticism from some politicians, and some were subjected to intimidation.
Social unrest increased as well. A series of protests and strikes, most notably the


                                            4
                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

nationwide demonstrations in July 2011, demanded the resolution of economic and
democratic governance challenges. Relations with neighboring countries soured over
political level disagreements. DPs, while still providing sizeable support to Malawi,
increasingly expressed their concerns, and gradually adjusted their programs, both in size
and in content to respond to the deteriorated situation. This entailed utilization of
significant amounts of previously slated budget support programs to directly fund
fertilizer, fuel and emergency drugs imports to keep essential poverty-oriented programs
on track. Important investments, such as the US$350 million energy compact from
Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC), were put on hold.

13.     During the same period, Malawi‟s macroeconomic performance also
weakened substantially. The IMF‘s ECF was suspended in June 2011, and DPs halted
their budget support as well. The sudden drop in traditionally large amounts of budget
support (ranging between 6-13 percent of the budget) contributed to an already severely
imbalanced economy situation, rapidly resulting in acute foreign exchange and fuel
shortages. In response, GoM adopted a ―zero-deficit budget‖ attempting to fund all
recurrent government expenditures through local tax revenues, with significant tax
increases on an already overstressed private sector. Nevertheless, reserves dwindled
dramatically, and domestic borrowing soared, putting further pressure on the domestic
currency. The gap between the fixed official exchange rate and parallel market rate
reached over 80 percent, and prices increased to reflect parallel market prices for foreign
exchange and fuel. Shortages of critical imports (coupled with power outages) further
negatively affected economic performance and employment. Letters of credit dried up,
further squeezing the productive capacity of the Malawi economy. By March 2012,
economic forecasts indicated that in the absence of drastic reforms, economic growth in
2012 would have significantly contracted and the country would enter into a full blown
(policy-induced) recession in 2013.

14.     The worsening situation threatened to reverse Malawi‟s major achievements
in macroeconomic stabilization, economic growth, food security, and laudable
progress towards a number of Millenium Development Goals (MDGs). During 2011
and early 2012, Malawi entered into a negative cycle of loss in confidence, investment
and support. Severe foreign exchange shortages and the growing gap between the official
and the parallel exchange rate contributed to accelerated capital flight, fuel shortages,
rising inflation, idle industrial capacity, and rising poverty. The ensuing increasing cost
of living and hardship on the population due to the deteriorating economic environment
further invigorated public discontent.

15.    The new GoM immediately started to address overdue reforms in democratic
governance. Parliament has repealed some of the repressive laws passed by the previous
regime such as the Civil Procedure Amendment Act and Section 46 of the Penal Code
that was restricting press freedom. Others laws that GoM has prioritized to repeal are
Section 35 of the Police Act and the Local Courts Act. GoM has also instituted inquiries
into prominent human rights abuses. The official enquiry into the July 2011

                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

demonstrations shall be brought to a conclusive end soon. As part of strengthening
freedom of speech, state-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation was announced to be
open as a true public broadcaster, to be used by all. GoM has also announced new
measures on public finance management, and is proposing to strengthen the management
of public procurement and controls, focused on strengthening key accountability
institutions such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Auditor-General. Parastatal
reforms will be a priority as well. A long-awaited new Electoral Commission has been
appointed. The presidency has also been reaching out to a large audience, including civil
society, the church, the traditional authority, as well as to the private sector, the donor
community and to neighboring countries.

16.     Government has already undertaken bold economic reforms. On May 7,
2012, ahead of a planned IMF program mission, GoM started implementing the long
overdue macroeconomic rebalancing program by liberalizing Malawi‘s foreign exchange
regime. In effect, prior to the adjustment of the official exchange rate, prices (including
food) were already adjusting to reflect the pass-through effect from a depreciated parallel
market rate as the official rate remained fixed. A few days later, significant fuel and
power price increases were announced to better cover costs of these essential
commodities. The much needed adjustment of fuel prices triggered a positive response
from the private sector leading to the critical normalization of fuel imports and supplies.
The Parliament also adopted the 2012/13 national budget on June 27, 2012, which fits
within a realistic IMF-agreed budget framework, with scaled-up resources for social
protection and a number of measures to encourage private sector investment. The budget
also includes a number of expenditure cuts, needed to restore economic balances and
foresees no net domestic financing on an annual basis. In this context, grants and
concessional financing are critical to help ease this fiscal adjustment process to help
finance social mitigation measures and critical growth enhancing investments.

C.     MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT

Economic Overview

17.     During the period 2006 to 2010, Malawi experienced solid growth averaging
around 7 percent, supported by a stable macroeconomic environment and large aid
inflows. The growth was largely driven by growing agricultural exports, rising foreign
direct investment (FDI) inflows related to mining, and fiscal expansion. The debt relief
from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative helped to create the fiscal
space needed to generate the momentum for growth. The agricultural sector contributed
about 28 percent of GDP between 2006-11, primarily driven by tobacco exports, while
service sector has recently increased its share to about 33.1 percent of GDP, driven by the
telecommunication, retail and wholesale trade, and financial services.

18.   Macroeconomic indicators (Table 2) point to an economy that was
performing well with moderate inflation, manageable current account deficit and

sustainable levels of domestic debt. These indicators, however, also depict an economy
that was excessively dependent upon external grants to meet its current deficits on both
fiscal and external accounts and where levels of external reserves have been generally
low. Both of these latter two factors made Malawi economy susceptible to external
shocks. The 2010 Country Economic Memorandurm (CEM) identified the overvalued
exchange rate as the most binding constraint on the Malawi economy, in addition to
inadequate power supply, weak human capital, lack of trade facilitation, and weak
financial intermediation.

19.     Macroeconomic imbalances started to build up after 2008 in the context of
the global crisis, the 2009 Presidential elections, and deteriorating relations with
donors. These events led to fiscal and external imbalances that required adjustment by
containing domestic demand. Even as the external deficit was growing, GoM maintained
a policy of fixed exchange rate. The ECF-supported program for Malawi went off track
shortly after completion of the first review in December 2010, leading to the suspension
of budget support grants by CABS DPs. With no adjustments in the 2011/12 budget in
the absence of budget support grants, the authorities resorted to central bank financing.

20.     By end-2011, Malawi was grappling with severe foreign exchange shortages
which started to choke the economy. The excess demand for foreign exchange led to
increasing shortages of some critical goods, most notably, fuel. The stricter
administrative controls in the foreign exchange market further drove all operations to the
parallel market and the gap between the official and the parallel exchange rate shot up.
Malawi's economy slowed down as firms could not access foreign exchange to secure
inputs for production, and fuel supply shortages intensified.

21.    In early 2012, real GDP growth for 2011 was estimated to have slowed to
about 4.3 percent, and barring significant reforms, the outlook for 2012 and beyond

                                                                 7
                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

was extremely bleak. The IMF Article IV mission in March 2012 projected that lack of
policy action would result in the slowdown of the economy to around 2.5 percent at the
end of 2012. Further in 2013, the economy would have entered into a policy-induced
recession, with a collapse in trading - both on the supply and demand side.

Crisis Response: Preparing for Growth Rebound and Mitigation of Social Impacts

22.     The new GoM took decisive policy measures to arrest the slowdown in the
economy and is already implementing a comprehensive package of economic
reforms. The GoM addressed the overvaluation of the exchange rate. The GoM began
with a one-step 50 percent liberalization of the official exchange rate and foreign
exchange market. This included allowing the official market rate to track the prevailing
rate and the removal of restrictions on the setting of exchange rates by banks and foreign
exchange bureaus for transactions with their customers. The GoM has also removed the
requirement to surrender tobacco export proceeds to the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM),
where now the US dollars earned at the tobacco auction floors are transferred directly to
seller‘s commercial banks. This action is expected to help cushion part of the smallholder
tobacco farmers‘ welfare loss from the exchange rate unification and facilitate the process
of developing a functioning interbank foreign exchange market.

23.     In addition, the authorities have moved to tighten monetary policy. The
decision to adjust the policy rate upward from 13 percent to 16 percent signaled the
authorities‘ tightening monetary stance. RBM has also recently intervened in the foreign
exchange market with a twin aim to supply foreign exchange for the private sector and to
absorb excess Kwacha liquidity from the market.

24.     The authorities have reinstated the automatic adjustment mechanism for
retail prices of petroleum products to reflect import parity prices as well as
movements in the international fuel prices and in the exchange rate. In addition GoM
has allowed an upward adjustment in the electricity tariffs by 77 percent so that revenues
in the sectors are closer to covering the costs of production. This measure is a first step
towards a more market determined tariff structure in the electricity sector, partly
addressing price movement rigidities that have been one of the main influences behind
low private capital inflows into the sector.

25.    The measures so far are having their intended effect. Foreign exchange
availability has improved dramatically. The parallel market for foreign exchange has
shrunk with a premium of about 5-10 percent from 80 percent. Supply of petroleum
products has normalized, the excess liquidity in the market has been mopped up, and
smallholder tobacco farmers are being paid at market determined exchange rates. The
supply response is also on track as firms have begun to resume normal operations as the
foreign exchange situation has normalized, fuel is available and credit lines are returning.

26.    The authorities have presented a realistic 2012/13 budget to realize the
benefits of policy reforms, to entrench macroeconomic stability and expand social

                                             8

safety net expenditures. The 2012/13 budget attempts to achieve a large fiscal
adjustment to put government finances on a sustainable course while expanding
expenditure on social safety net programs. GoM plans to bring down net domestic
financing to zero as at end June 2013 (from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2011/12), aided in part
by the increase in external grants. Exchange rate liberalization is also expected to have a
net positive impact on the budget.1 On the expenditure side, fiscal adjustment will entail
cuts in wasteful recurrent expenditures and postponement of development projects which
are 100 percent government-financed.

27.     The budget provides for scaled up social protection interventions, including
the expansion of a country-wide labor intensive public works, FISP and other social
safety net programs such as school feeding program, the school bursaries program and
the social cash transfer program. GoM has expanded FISP for 2012/13 agriculture year to
reach a large number of poor farmers affected by the dry spells in the South. The budget
also provides for a 30 percent increase in the nominal wage bill and the cost of hiring
more teachers and health workers. To reduce fiscal risks, efforts would be geared towards
strengthening fiscal discipline, particularly public financial management, and expenditure
control to avoid accumulation of domestic arrears and build-up of domestic debt.

28.     The budget also proposes removal of some taxes imposed in the previous
budget, including the minimum tax based on turnover and capital gains tax from
the sale of shares. In addition, the authorities have increased the investment allowance
on new and unused industrial building, plant and machinery to 100 percent; international
transport allowance to 25 percent; and removed VAT on machinery and financial
services. Together, these measures are geared to providing a conducive environment for
private sector investment in the country.

Medium Term Economic Outlook

29.    The new government‟s effort to adopt appropriate policy measures and to
repair relations with the DPs has put Malawi on a firm position to return to faster
growth path. Real GDP growth is expected to exceed 6.0 percent by 2014, anchored
mainly on the sectors that were hardest hit by the foreign exchange shortages, including
tourism, manufacturing, transportation services, construction, and trade. Other sectors,
including agriculture, will also benefit from the easing of fuel shortages. 2 Inflationary




1
 This is based on the fact that expected large increases in foreign grants (projected at over 10 percent of
GDP) and their kwacha values will more than offset the increase in kwacha value of government imports.
On average about 40 percent of government expenditures is foreign exchange sensitive.
2
  With agriculture being the dominant sector, exchange rate unification should eliminate the implicit tax
and increase welfare, especially for smallholder farmers whose earnings are pegged to the US Dollar.


                                                    9

pressures are expected to remain strong in 2012 with a projected annual average inflation
of about 18.4 percent, but are expected to ease to pre-2010 levels of about 7.5 percent in
2014.

30.     The overall balance in the medium term is projected to narrow from a deficit
of 7.0 percent in 2011/12 to an average deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP during 2013-
2015. The authorities‘ commitment to fiscal adjustment during 2012-14 provides an
important anchor for safeguarding sustainability in the medium term, but it faces risks
arising from possible spending pressures in the run-up to elections scheduled for mid-
2014. To support the low fiscal deficit goal, GoM will continue to implement a number
of tax policy measures and tax administration mechanisms introduced in the 2011/12
budget, to further boost its revenue (projected to average 23 percent of GDP during
2012/13-2014/15). Specifically, efforts have been intensified to broaden the tax base,
with increased efforts to mobilize both tax and non-tax revenues.

31.     The current account deficit is projected to narrow from 5.9 percent of GDP
in 2011, to less than 2.5 percent during 2013-2015. Exports are expected to grow at a
faster rate than imports during 2013-2015 at an average of 10.8 percent compared with
4.2 percent for imports. The medium-term financing plan requires continued public sector
inflows, in addition to FDI and other private inflows. The recovery of private capital
inflows and accumulation of international reserves is expected to strengthen the country‘s
balance of payment position.

32.     Agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, mining and construction sectors are
expected to rebound quickly. Specifically, agriculture is expected to grow by 5 percent
within the next 24 months as production diversifies. The manufacturing sector is
expected to rebound during the second half of 2012 as firms begin to use up idle capacity.
The mining sector‘s contribution to growth is projected to increase from 13 percent of
GDP in 2011 to over 16 percent of GDP over the next three years. The mining
contribution will also be boosted by a projected increase in coal production in 2013-14,
as well as the coming on stream of the niobium mining project at Kanyika by 2014.

33.    Private investment is projected to recover from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to
an average of 14.0 percent during 2013-2015, on the back of rapid improvements in
business environment. FDI is also projected to increase with the improvements in the
business climate and restored private sector confidence, as well as the move to a floating
exchange regime.

34.    In view of the above analysis on the medium-term outlook, GoM‟s
reinvigorated macroeconomic policy framework is appropriate. However, the
medium-term prospects of the economy, especially its ability to sustain strong growth
that will be accompanied with a solid fiscal and external position, remain subject to
important risks. These risks, which could be mitigated by government policies, come
especially from fiscal loosening in the run-up to the general elections in 2014, softening

performance issues leading to contingent liabilities.

D.      SECTOR CONTEXT AND STRATEGY

Poverty, HIV/AIDS, Nutrition and Social Protection
35.    Poverty in Malawi remains widespread and concentrated in rural areas3.
Income inequality also remains high (Gini 0.39), reflecting profound inequities in the
access to assets, services and opportunities across the population4. The 2007 Malawi
Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA) estimated that in 2004 about half of the
Malawian population (52.4 percent) lived below the poverty line (about 6.4 million) and
as many as 2.7 million Malawians (22 percent) lived in ultra-poverty, a level of total
income per capita below the minimum food expenditure needs.

36.    The analysis also showed that poverty has been driven by limited access to
education, production assets, shocks affecting agricultural productivity, and lack of
diversification and access to markets. Poverty is also being exacerbated by a high
population growth rate (about 3 percent) and density, as well as HIV/AIDS prevalence.
Nationally, the poorest household heads have less schooling, are older and are more
likely to be female than those of better-off households. Moreover, female-headed
households have 14 percent less per capita consumption than their male counterparts.

37.     The worst poverty is concentrated in rural areas in the most densely
populated South and in the North. Urban areas have much lower percentages of people
below the poverty line (25 percent), and also the lowest share of ultra-poor (8 percent).
Therefore, any strategy to reduce poverty in Malawi and make growth more inclusive
must include a leading role for rural growth and development, with focus on smallholder
agriculture, tourism development, infrastructure, and other non-farm employment
creation. The Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS-3) results are scheduled for
release within the third quarter of FY13.

38.    Malnutrition remains a major concern in Malawi. Given that malnutrition is
the underlying cause of one-third to half of all child deaths, and impairs cognitive
development by 20 IQ points or more, the challenge is to address the lack of a coherent
and integrated approach to nutrition. GoM‘s National Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan


3
  A preliminary, unpublished analysis of the Third Integrated Households Survey (IHS3) data presents a
discouraging picture, with no major changes in poverty over the 2004/5 – 2010/11 period. These trends
will be confirmed and published once the temporal price adjustments needed to compare poverty figures
over time have been completed.
4
  Findings from IHS3 indicate that consumption inequality in Malawi (Gini coefficient) has risen sharply
from 0.39 in 2004/5, to 0.44 in 2010/11 mostly in rural areas.


                                                  11
                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

(2007-2012) is currently being reviewed in light of new developments and increased
donor support. DPs (Canadian International Development Agency [CIDA], Irish Aid,
United States USAID [ United States Agency for International Development], United
Nations Children‘s Fund [UNICEF], the European Union [EU], and Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] among others) have expressed
interest to support the nutrition policy agenda. In March 2012, the Bank approved a
US$80 million Nutrition and HIV/AIDS project. The Bank also participates in a Donor
Nutrition Security Support Group to leverage and harmonize support to the multi-sectoral
nutrition program.

39.     A large number of households move in and out of extreme poverty and
occasionally are in need of safety nets. A significant portion of the ultra-poor is in need
of social transfers, while some have extra labor available to earn income. The recent
economic downturn and related price increases have eroded the consumption of the rural
and urban poor, leaving a number of them food insecure. Most firms that employed
unskilled labor have scaled back leaving many bread earners jobless. The number of
people living below the poverty line has most likely increased. It is estimated that about
1.72 million households in rural and urban areas (about 60% of the population) are in
need of social support interventions.

Agriculture Sector
40.     Agriculture remains the main source of growth and exports in Malawi. With
85 percent of the population residing in the rural areas, the sector accounts for over 80
percent of the country‘s employment, over one-third of GDP, and about 80 percent of
merchandise exports. The primary staple for most of these households is maize. Over 70
percent of all farmers in the country cultivate less than one hectare (ha) and a significant
number of these farmers still struggle to produce enough food to meet their annual
consumption requirements. Agriculture remains dominantly rainfed and dependent on
one short and variable annual rainy season. The country continues to experience severe
dry spells, especially in the southern region, rendering a significant number of households
perpetually food insecure. The largest and most costly investment program in the
agriculture sector is the FISP, which is designed to attain food security and is targeted
towards the poorer households. The FISP has been in many ways successful, but is also
relatively costly and dependent on both imports and favorable weather conditions.

41.     High population density and poverty have led to significant human pressure
on the environment and degradation of Malawi‟s natural resource base, notably
land and forests. Unsustainable land and water use and management practices have
resulted in deforestation, run-off, flash floods, soil erosion and sedimentation, posing
serious threats to the environment and natural resource base.

42.     Maize harvest is currently estimated at 3.6 million metric tons (MT), 7
percent below the bumper harvest of 2011 and 5 percent above the 5-year average.
It is estimated that a half million MT surplus should be available but this result may

                                            12

prove overly optimistic as many localized areas suffered from serious dry spells.
Following the 2011 crisis and very low prices, tobacco production has decreased to
151,000 MT from 231,000 MT last year but prices have risen from 0.8 US$/kg in 2011 to
US$1.2-US$1.5 on average so far this year.

43.    The exchange rate liberalization offers good prospects of income increase in
Kwacha for export crop producers, but may have a negative impact on smallholder
farmers who are not self sufficient and may have to buy additional staple food. The
impact on input prices for next year is also an issue. The GoM is planning to protect
smallholders from increased cost of critical farm inputs by increasing the number of FISP
beneficiaries from 1.4 to 1.5 million farming households and by keeping the beneficiary
contribution steady at MWK500 subsidy which now translates to a 95 percent subsidy on
a 50kg bag of fertilizer.

Social Protection Strategy

44.     The Government Strategy (MGDS II) has identified social protection as one
of the key pillars for bringing about shared growth. Government spending on social
protection is at 0.2 percent of total spending, with most of it being donor-funded. The
current national policy framework is laid out in a National Social Support Policy (NSSP)
as well as a National Social Support Program which is yet to be operationalized (see
Figure 1).

45.     The objective of the draft NSSP is to provide a framework for prioritizing
targeting of support to reduce poverty and enable the poor to move out of poverty
and vulnerability. It consists of four main pillars: (i) provision of social support; (ii)
protection of assets; (iii) promotion of productivity enhancement; and (iv) policies to
reduce exclusion5.

46.    The draft NSSP is meant to provide an overarching framework for all social
support activities undertaken by Government and donors. The GoM has identified
five social support programs that are to be included in the NSSP. These are: 1) public
works; 2) social cash transfers; 3) school meals; 4) micro-credit; and 5) village savings
and loan schemes. The figure 1 below illustrates how these are to be arranged in a
cascading web of support, from the poorest to the less poor6.

47.     Currently, many of the social support interventions in Malawi are
uncoordinated. The interventions include public works programs, social cash transfers,
school meals, and savings and loan schemes. Most of these interventions, except for the
public works, are not implemented nationwide and have limited ability to scale up in
times of crises. In addition, these interventions have different targeting mechanisms, and
it is possible to double target a needy household in the absence of a unified targeting
mechanism. Figure 1 below shows the categories of the poor living below the poverty
line and the kinds of needs and interventions that can be used to reach them.

48.    The Bank is actively supporting the GoM in its effort to provide social
protection to the vulnerable. In this regard, the Bank has been providing financing
through the Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) in three phases. MASAF is now in its
seventeenth year. Under the RRP (MASAF 3 AF II), the Bank plans to further increase
support to the poor by scaling up the public works under the third phase of MASAF to
reach about 586,000 households with two cycles of public works within one year. The
support is geared towards assisting the poor households to smooth consumption and also
to protect their household assets and not engage in negative coping mechanisms. The

upcoming CAS will propose an intervention to transform the current public works
program into a comprehensive, predictable and productive social safety net program to
support the poor and vulnerable section of the Malawi population.

Agriculture Strategy

49.      Under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme
(CAADP) process, GoM, in coordination with its development partners, formulated
the Agricultural Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp) as a strategy and investment
framework for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the agricultural sector.
The ASWAP was approved in October 2011 and a roadmap has been developed to guide
ASWAp implementation. The ASWAp constitutes an investment framework to foster
donor harmonization and alignment in support to agricultural development and identifies
three priority areas for investments: (i) food security and risk management; (ii)
commercial agriculture, agro-processing and market development; and (iii) sustainable
agricultural land and water management. Its implementation will be supported by two
additional key support services: (i) technology generation and dissemination; and (ii)
institutional strengthening and capacity building. Beyond FISP, the GoM is strongly
committed to promote alternative crops (legumes, soybeans and cotton) and livestock to
diversify the maize and tobacco-based production system.

50.     GoM also gives high priority to sustainable agricultural land and water
management, including irrigation development, which reduces dependence on
favorable weather conditions, while boosting productivity. The ASWAp aims to
increase the area under sustainable irrigation from 72,000 ha to 280,000 ha. Support to a
thriving irrigated agriculture sector is predicated on a demand-driven, service-oriented
approach with the full participation of farmers and commercial interests.

51.      The Bank is actively supporting the agriculture sector. The Agricultural Sector
Wide Approach - Support Project (ASWAp-SP) aims to (i) strengthen institutional
capacities; (ii) improve the payoffs to the FISP by speeding the adoption of improved
technologies and promoting the adoption of complementary management practices
offering higher and more sustainable productivity gains; and (iii) increase the resilience
of the maize smallholder farming systems. An additional financing to ASWAp-SP
provides further support to the food security and agricultural diversification agenda and
includes rehabilitation of feeder roads to improve farmers access to input and output
markets. The Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural Development Project
(IRLADP) aims to increase productivity through the rehabilitation and construction of
irrigation infrastructure and the provision of an integrated package of technical and
advisory services for sustainable small-scale irrigation. IRLADP also includes an input-
for-assets program which aims at enhancing demand-driven rural public works programs
to create more community assets and build community resilience. In the upcoming CAS
(FY13-16), the Bank will put more emphasis on diversifying the maize-based smallholder
farming systems and help producers move beyond subsistence farming to more market-

oriented agriculture. Bank investments will thus promote stronger linkages between
agriculture research and extension, irrigation infrastructure and water management, land
administration and sustainable land management, with produce processing and marketing
and market access in rural areas.

E.     RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AND BANK STRATEGY

Rationale

52.     There is an urgent need to support GoM‟s reform program. The proposed
RRP and its timing are key to maintain confidence in the reform effort and inject much
needed resources both for reserves and to provide mitigation for those adversely affected
by the reforms. The IMF estimates GoM‘s external financing needs in the short term at
about US$ 200 million. The Bank‘s assessment shows a need of an additional US$80-
100 million per year to partially mitigate the loss of welfare of the poorest. Failure to
address these urgent needs will not only result in economic hardship and loss of
confidence in the reforms, but will present additional long-term risks to the sustainability
of the reforms.

53.     The proposed interventions under the RRP will contribute directly to the
short-term needs of Malawi. The RRDPG will help mitigate the impact of the economic
reforms on the most vulnerable and contribute to a quick growth rebound. RRDPG will
implement measures to improve the prioritization of social expenditure in the 2012/13
national budget, strengthen social sector resilience, improve the functioning of the fuel
market, improve incentives to exporters, including smallholder tobacco farmers, and
enhance economic management of the FISP. The two Additional Financing operations
(MASAF 3 and IRLADP) will provide resources to mitigate the effect of the reform,
especially the exchange rate liberalization which eroded poor people‘s incomes thereby
depriving them of adequate nutrition and access to basic necessities, further perpetrating
poverty. MASAF 3 AF will provide cash earning opportunities to the poorest people in
the first three quintiles, country-wide, in both rural and urban areas. These mitigation
measures would be implemented through various support mechanisms including public
works and cash transfers. AF of IRLADP enables a nationwide scale-up of diversified
agricultural livelihood and productivity support primarily under the Inputs for Assets
Program that would have a cushioning effect and enhance development impacts on the
rural poor in all 28 districts. These interventions will help the construction and
rehabilitation of critical community assets, such as mini-scale irrigation facilities, rural
feeder roads as well as increase access to a diversified demand-based menu of farm
inputs through the input-for-asset program (including fertilizers, variety of seeds, farm
equipment and small livestock).

54.    These short-term interventions will be complemented by medium and long-
term interventions to ensure that Malawi is once again on an accelerated growth
path. All three proposed operations under the RRP will have a positive effect in the
medium term. Taken in combination, they will help support the creation of a solid

                                            16
                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

foundation for Malawi‘s economy to return on an inclusive growth path that contributes
to poverty alleviation. In addition, as discussed below, the upcoming CAS (FY13-16)
has identified various interventions which will help address medium- and long-term
development challenges. The interventions will also accelerate the implementation and
broaden the scope of ASWAp to ensure that complementary productivity-enhancing
interventions support food security over the long-term. These interventions will help in
the rehabilitation and sustainable and efficient management of small-scale irrigation
facilities, critically address catchment conservation, improve access to extension services
and support marketing and post harvest assets. Short-term interventions will be
complemented by medium- and long-term interventions to sustain growth in agricultural
productivity and diversification, consolidate achievements in agriculture and irrigation
development and prepare for future investments in the sector.

CAS Alignment

55.     The RRP is consistent with the CAS FY07-11 and is also an integral part of
the Bank‟s assistance program to Malawi articulated in upcoming CAS FY13-16,
currently being finalized for Board presentation in the second quarter of FY13. The
FY07-11 CAS focused on improving agriculture productivity, decreasing vulnerability
and sustaining improvements in expenditure management, budget execution and
accountability which are also key aspects of the proposed RRP. The draft CAS (FY13-
16) draws on the Africa Strategy, contributes to the achievement of a selected subset of
Malawi‘s development goals as outlined in MGDS II, and supports the achievement of
the MDGs. In both strategies, there is a provision of programmatic development policy
lending (DPL) operation to support policy reforms especially in areas where investment
lending is being provided. A stand alone DPL has been accommodated to bridge the gap
created by the cancelled development policy lending operation for the fourth quarter of
FY11 due to weak economic governance. The proposed RRDPG will support policy
reforms that contribute towards restoring prudent fiscal policy and sound macroeconomic
management and reduce key fiduciary risks in the Public Financial Management (PFM)
system in line with the Africa Region Strategy‘s foundation of building governance and
public sector capacity through the public expenditure management systems. The two
additional financing projects will assist poor and vulnerable households through
decentralized mechanisms, to improve their livelihoods, income, and access to basic
social and economic infrastructure.

OP/BP 8.00 Alignment

56.     The proposed RRP is well aligned with OP 8.00. The proposed RRP will
contribute to (i) prevention of further economic decline and help guide Malawi towards
long-term economic growth; (ii) facilitate the availability of essential commodities, for
example petroleum and medical products, as well as services which have been disrupted
by adverse economic policies; and (iii) protect vulnerable groups during this reform
period through scaled up public works and inputs-for-assets program to improve
vulnerable households‘ access to income and increase food security. As specified in the

                                            17
                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

OP/BP 8.00, the proposed interventions address economic and/or social impacts while
continuing the focus on the Bank‘s competencies and mandate. This approach is fully
incorporated into the proposed Program.

               THE RAPID RESPONSE PROGRAM

Program Instruments, Linkages and Sustainability

57.     This RRP is based on a series of economic and sector works as well as
extensive policy dialogue, both prior to and post government change in Malawi.
Given the concern of the possible negative impact of exchange rate liberalization, the
Bank undertook various analyses in FY12, including a Comprehensive Exchange Rate
and Foreign Exchange study for Malawi and a Welfare Impacts and Mitigation of
Exchange Rate Unification in Malawi. Evidence on the impact of the crisis on welfare
clearly showed that the poor were heavily affected by the deteriorating economic
situation, especially since fall of 2011, when the laying off of workers and loss of income
and food consumption as a result of price changes induced by depreciation in the parallel
market started to emerge.

58.      The Bank‟s analytical work formed the basis for a comprehensive program
for “Competitiveness, Growth and Poverty Reduction?. Further work was carried out
to design an affordable program to help sustain consumption and promote economic
growth and poverty reduction. Two compensation scenarios were considered to partially
cover the loss of welfare of the poorest 60 percent of the rural and urban population
through Labor Intensive Public Works Programs (LIPWP). In addition, it was estimated
that if the unification of the exchange rate was undertaken in time for tobacco farmers to
receive adjusted prices, the original losses due to foreign exchange liberalization induced
price increases could be ameliorated by as much as 32 percent on average, especially for
the poorest tobacco farmers. The analysis also concluded that in order to promote
economic growth and poverty reduction, additional measures would be needed to protect
livelihoods through support to agricultural productivity and income diversification. An
examination of the ongoing safety net interventions found that the LIPWP and the Social
Cash Transfer programs were ideal for reaching the vulnerable poor. However, in the
context of a crisis response context, LIPWPs were preferable, as they were immediately
scalable under MASAF and IRLADP. These two programs have systems in place and
also have successful experience and institutional set-up that can deliver LIPWP. Based on
these studies, a high level multi-sector mission in March 2012 engaged in dialogue with
the economic management cabinet of the previous administration presenting the Bank's
views on a comprehensive program for ―Competitiveness, Growth and Poverty
Reduction‖.

59.    The RRP supports the implementation of this Comprehensive Program. It
represents an integrated and well-sequenced response to match the need for
macroeconomic stabilization with an expansion of social protection programs and
adequate support to encourage a quick economic rebound.

                                            18
                                                                Overview: Rapid Response Program



60.     At the macro level, the RRDPG aims to support macroeconomic stability and
a quick growth rebound while mitigating negative impact on the most vulnerable
groups. The RRDPG is the right instrument to urgently respond to the request by the
authorities for a quick disbursing budget support operation to bridge the financing gap in
the national budget to help stabilize the economy and finance social mitigation measures.
The DPO also supports reforms geared towards improving incentives to exporters,
including the smallholder tobacco farmers, through the removal of an implicit tax on
exports following the unification of the exchange rate, as well as the reform that allows
tobacco proceeds to be transferred to the sellers‘ commercial banks at the prevailing
market exchange rate. Smallholder tobacco farmers have now seen their real income
increase and the potential welfare loss from the exchange rate liberalization minimized.

61.     At the microlevel, the AF operations for MASAF 3 and IRLADP help
provide immediate support for income generating activities. They will enable
beneficiaries to earn income to meet their basic needs, as well as have sufficient
resources to buy subsidized farm inputs for the next season. Moreover, the interventions
are well sequenced to ensure that during the lean agricultural season beneficiaries are
able to earn income from public works and also engage in irrigation activities during the
winter period, which will help them increase agricultural production. Beneficiaries will
specifically be able to participate in the construction of small irrigation infrastructure in
exchange for farm inputs, which will in turn increase their income and their ability to
sustain themselves throughout the year. Interventions through LIPWP will help create
jobs during the off-agriculture season while at the same time help the country develop its
infrastructure. The beneficiaries will be able to utilize earnings for food and basic
household needs, as well as for accessing subsidized farm inputs during the later part of
the year, which will help increase production. Beneficiaries will also be able to save some
of their incomes and benefit from information that will be provided on investment and
finance management.

62.     The Bank provided further assistance on the 2012/13 budget formulation.
After the new Government initiated its reform program, it requested the Bank to provide
assistance in expenditure prioritization for the preparation of the 2012/13 budget. The
exercise had a dual purpose: (i) to ensure that total expenditures fit with the IMF-agreed
fiscal framework; and (ii) to prioritize social spending to allow for scaled-up social
protection program. The budget serves as the linchpin for the Bank‘s proposed support.

Program Objective

63.     The program will expedite the implementation of Malawi's comprehensive
economic recovery program to regain macro economic stability while protecting the
most vulnerable people from the effects of the recovery reforms. In this regard, the
overall objective for the RRP is to ―support emergency recovery reforms aimed at
restoring macroeconomic stability, accelerate the resumption of growth, and mitigate the

impacts on vulnerable households from the legacy of inflationary pressures and
rebalancing of the economy‖.

Program Description

64.    A detailed description, appraisal, technical analysis and implementation
arrangements for each operation are contained in the respective project papers
(Attachments A, B, and C and their respective Annexes). A brief summary of each
proposed operation is presented here.

       1.     Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (US$50 million)

65.      The objective of RRDPG is to support the authorities‟ efforts to achieve and
maintain macroeconomic stability and restore the functioning of a market-based
economy to ensure a quick growth rebound; and to protect the poor and most
vulnerable groups in the short run while improving transparency of delivery
systems. The reform program supported by the RRDPG focuses largely on the short-
term measures that aim to restore macroeconomic and social stability in response to
ongoing reforms through fiscal adjustments and efforts to protect the vulnerable.
Specifically, the operation recognizes and supports measures to entrench macroeconomic
stability through the national budget, improve functioning of the petroleum markets and
incentives to exporters, including smallholder tobacco farmers, strengthen social
protection interventions and the resilience of the most vulnerable groups to shocks, and
improve economic management of the farm input subsidy program (FISP). These
reforms are in line with the GoM‘s own Economic Recovery Plan aimed at getting the
economy back on the sustainable growth path and reducing the country‘s vulnerabilities.

66.     Some of the outcomes of these reform areas will be achieved over a period
longer than one year. Monitoring of the results will therefore continue under future
DPOs envisaged in the FY13-16 CAS. In supporting the implementation of selected
reforms, the GoM is expected to make some budgetary savings through improved
controls in the use of public resources, which could be directed towards social sector
spending. The program is also supporting enhanced transparency and citizens‘ access to
information on government actions and policies. Ultimately, if fully implemented, these
policy reforms will contribute towards enhancing the credibility of the public sector
financial management in the country.

67.    All prior actions reflect the reform priorities of the GoM which are
supported by the Bank in the CAS. The full program supported by the proposed
operation is set out in the Policy Matrix found in Annex 2 (Attachment A). The prior
actions support the GoM in its effort to implement its economic recovery program.
During implementation, maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic policy
framework, as well as a satisfactory program performance would remain as underlying
conditions for this operation.

                                                              Overview: Rapid Response Program




       2. MASAF 3 Second Additional Financing (US$50 million)

68.     The Government has proposed the implementation of short-term safety net
mitigation measures to cushion the vulnerable population from the adverse effect of
the reform program. These mitigation measures would be implemented through various
support mechanisms including public works, cash transfers, agriculture input subsidies,
and irrigation infrastructure supports. The MASAF project has been running for 17 years,
and over time has evolved and developed comprehensive methodologies for poverty and
vulnerability targeting, and designed systems for monitoring and evaluation of social
protection indicators.

69.     The Third Malawi Social Action Fund APL II (MASAF 3) program has three
components: (i) Community Livelihood Support Fund (CLS); (ii) Local Authority
Capacity Enhancement Fund; and (iii) National Institutional Strengthening (NIS).
The proposed Additional Financing will support the first CLS and the NIS and will scale
up the Public Works Sub-project Program (PWSP) nationwide in urban and rural areas
expanding its coverage from the normal 200,000 households in a cycle per year to about
586,000 households in two cycles in one year. In addition, the number of days will be
increased as well as the daily wage amount and the number of projects per community.
The PWSP would not only be available for the able-bodied people, it would also support
direct transfers to labor constrained households who will not be able to engage in public
work activities (up to 20 percent of the total beneficiaries). The original project design
allowed for up to 5 percent only for this beneficiary group. The labor constrained
households include those headed by children, elderly, and people with disabilities and/or
chronic illnesses. The proposed project will strengthen its linkages to the Community
Savings and Investment Program (COMSIP) to promote savings, as well as facilitate the
graduation process and engagement into economic activities. The Additonal Financing
will not support the Local Authority Component as capacity enhancement programs are
already in place under the original project.

70.     The NIS component will address national-level cross-cutting issues aimed at
improving accountability and transparency in the use of project resources and
project management. It will help address weaknesses in the institutional system for
fiscal discipline, especially related to rules and regulations on fiscal controls, the
procurement regime, and personnel payroll management. It also seeks to strengthen the
operational links between the central and local governments through an improved fiscal
architecture. It supports the roll-out of the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) to Local Authorities through capacity building. MASAF will therefore
enable the Bank to provide technical assistance to the GoM to implement some of the
reform programs that are essential for delivery of services to poor and vulnerable
households, in addition to reforms supported by RRDPG.

                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

71.     The MASAF 3 AF II is classified as a Category B project and triggers OP
4.01, 4.09, 4.12 and now OP 4.36. The original MASAF project approved
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) will be applied for this AF. Since OP 4.36 is now triggered with the
AF II, the GoM will revise the ESMF within six months after project effectiveness in
order to ensure it includes guidance on how to prepare Forest Management Plans for the
community reforestation subprojects. The revised ESMF will be re-disclosed in country
and in the Bank‘s InfoShop. In order to address the requirements of the triggered policies,
potential impacts have been identified and mitigation measures elaborated, and costed in
readiness for implementation of AF II. The specific details are presented in Attachment
B.

       3. IRLADP Second Additional Financing (US$50 million)

72.      The proposed IRLADP additional financing is primarily intended to support
the rural poor, cushioning them from the current economic hardships, as well as
consolidate project achievements and prepare irrigation investments for longer
term development within the sector. Through this project, farmers will be supported to
increase irrigated crop yields, add value to their produce and improve marketing and farm
sales. The main project activities include provision of irrigation services including
infrastructure, technical and advisory services for sustainable small-scale irrigation as
well as diversified and demand-driven support to livelihoods diversification, access to
farm inputs and support to marketing and post harvest assets. The AF is also designed to
facilitate early emergency response through a newly introduced contingency window.
The general objectives of the AF are in line with those of the original project, and the AF
will scaleup from 11 districts to all the 28 districts in the country and reach a larger
number of beneficiaries.

73.     The IRLADP AF has five components: (i) Irrigation rehabilitation and
development and catchment conservation which supports rehabilitation and development
of small scale irrigation schemes, and water use efficiency in existing schemes. This
component also has a new provision for a strategic study on the future of irrigation
development and management in Malawi; (ii) Farmer services and livelihood fund to
support beneficiary communities, particularly those covered under the irrigation schemes,
to obtain complementary services and goods for optimizing their returns from irrigated
farming, to add value through micro-processing, to improve the marketing of their
produce, and to build their technical and business capacities; (iii) Institutional
development and capacity enhancement which will focus on consolidation of the capacity
building gains and help ensure that capacity for irrigation development and management
is maintained; (iv) Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation; and (v) a new
component on contingency for disaster risk response that will support preparedness and
rapid response to disasters as needed.




                                            22
                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

74.     The project will support growth-oriented agricultural development by
working with the economically active poor in the rural areas. A major higher level
objective is to raise smallholder productivity and food security, and to increase
smallholder share of GDP. The principal target group under the project will be the
economically active rural poor (those of working age and in good health but lacking
productive assets) and, to a lesser extent, the transient poor (those at a risk of becoming
poor due to periodic or transitory shocks). While this project is aimed at promoting
economic growth through development in irrigation and other activities by the capable
poor, the ongoing MASAF is focused on providing social protection and livelihood
enhancement activities. Hence, it is important that a district‘s or community‘s
participation in this project does not exclude it from other sources of safety net type
assistance.

75.     IRLADP is classified as an environmental assessment category B project and
triggers OP 4.01, 4.09, 4.12, and 7.50. The original project approved ESMF and RPF
will be adopted for this AF: potential environmental and social adverse impacts have
been identified and mitigation measures have been elaborated and costed in readiness for
implementation under AF II. The ESMF and RPF have both been redisclosed in country
and in the Bank‘s InfoShop. Specific details relating to the AF‘s environmental and
social impacts and principle safeguard policy considerations are presented in Attachment
C.

F.     FINANCING PLAN

76.    The Program would be financed through International Development
Association (IDA) resources by front loading from the IDA16 envelope for Malawi.
Total IDA funding for the proposed Program amounts to US$ 150 million. Each of the
proposed operations will have financing of US$50 million.

G.  COORDINATION WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS ON PROPOSED
PROGRAM

77.    DPs in Malawi, who are increasingly becoming more harmonized in the
provision of their development assistance, have positively received the proposed
RRP.

78.     The RRDPG operation will be implemented within the framework of the
Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) which represents a group of
development partners that use a joint approach in the provision of budgetary
support to the GoM. As was the case with the previous PRSC I-III series, the Bank has
been collaborating very closely with Malawi‘s main development partners, in particular
the IMF and AfDB. Attainment and sustainability of sound macroeconomic management
will be a precondition for implementation of the RRDPG. Malawi has negotiated a new
ECF arrangement with the Fund expected to be presented to the IMF Board in July 2012,
and the coordination between the Bank and Fund teams is strong. A joint IMF/World
Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for low-income countries (LIC-DSA) was
undertaken in late March 2012 in the context of the IMF Article IV consultations.

79.     MASAF team and the Development Partners Technical Working Group
(DPTWG) results on social protection mapping culminated into a decision to scale
up Public Works Program in order to cushion the poor from the inflationary effects
of exchange rate liberalization. DPTWG aims to provide a forum for effective
coordinated development partner support to the social protection agenda. DPTWG
comprises Irish Aid, World Bank, German Development Cooperation, DFID, EU,
Norway, USAID, WFP, UNDP, UNAIDS, & UNICEF. The social protection mapping
results praised MASAF Public Works Program for helping to create community assets
that would increase access to socioeconomic services, particularly the FISP. The
MASAF program also has the infrastructure in place to provide additional employment in
any period chosen, provided funding is available. Other programs assessed included
school meals, secondary school bursaries, Malawi Social Cash Transfer Program, and
provision of meals to Community Based Child Care. Some of the disadvantages of these
programs include limited coverage, high exclusion and inclusion errors, failure to be
scaled up rapidly, and seasonality of assistance.

80.   In preparing IRLADP AF II the Bank discussed with the International Fund
for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and other Development Partners supporting

the irrigation and agriculture sectors, organized in the informal coordination group on
irrigation, most notably AfDB, EU, GIZ (Germany Agency for Technical Cooperation)
and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Collaboration with AfDB is closely
coordinated on the jointly agreed support to the roadmap for the Shire Valley Irrigation
Project preparation; and with all development partners on the development of a
harmonized investment framework for the irrigation sector along with financing and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements that are supported by other development
partners. Specific arrangements have been reflected in the Attachment C. The original
IRLADP was co-financed with IFAD and used Bank implementation procedures.

H.     PROGRAM BENEFITS, RISKS AND MITIGATING MEASURES

Benefits

81.     The provision of timely support to Malawi will assist GoM in pushing
forward with its reform efforts. The Program‘s impact – as measured by economic
returns, social, poverty and environmental benefits - is expected to be positive. The RRP
aims to support GoM in its reforms to stabilize the economy through the RRDPG and
mitigate the impact of the reforms on the most vulnerable through additional financing
for MASAF and for IRLADP. The specific benefits of the program are:




                                           25
                                                              Overview: Rapid Response Program


      The RRDPG support will help sustain the reform momentum by supporting
       the macroeconomic stabilization effort through budget financing. Among
       other key reforms, RRDPG will help improve the functioning of the petroleum
       market, improve incentives for exporters (including smallholder tobacco farmers),
       and improve economic management of the FISP.

      MASAF AF will assist in cushioning vulnerable groups from the negative
       effects of exchange rate liberalization through cash provision via a scaled-up
       public works program and cash transfers. Vulnerable groups targeted include
       the landless, female-headed households, child-headed households, and the elderly
       and disabled, persons living with HIV/AIDS, and the underemployed and
       unemployed in urban areas. It is expected that some of the MASAF earnings by
       households will go towards purchase of food and subsidized farm inputs to
       improve productivity and reduce food insecurity. The project is expected to
       benefit about 586,000 households or 2.9 million people representing over 20
       percent of Malawians.

      IRLADP will help increase agricultural productivity of poor rural
       households throughout the country. The program will help households diversify
       beyond the staple maize to rice and other high value crops in irrigation schemes.
       Productivity is expected to improve through increased cropping intensity and
       more extension service support. Farmers are also expected to earn more incomes
       through high value crops.

Risks and Mitigation

82.     The reforms being implemented by GoM are expected to reduce some of the
risks that have been threatening Malawi in the past two years. In the context of these
reforms, the current major risks that the country faces relate to availability of funding,
government capacity to deliver, and political commitment to reforms. Project-specific
risks are outlined in respective Attachments.

83.     Availability of additional resources to GoM. The first risk is whether donor
support will be delivered in required amounts and in a timely manner to ensure adequate
reserves for GoM, as well as increased provision of mitigation measures for those
adversely affected by the reforms. Several of the DPs have expressed their willingness to
provide support and are planning to accelerate disbursement of existing programs, as well
as preparation of new programs and as of June 30, DFID is the only DP to have
disbursed. .. To mitigate this risk, GoM has successfully negotiated a new 3-year ECF-
supported program, which is expected to be presented to the IMF Board in July. The
Bank is coordinating closely with DPs on additional support to social protection
programs, which should be forthcoming soon, as well as on budget support, with AfDB
also accelerating its budget support preparation.
84.     Inflationary pressures and public support to reform. The consequences of
some of the reforms such as exchange rate liberalization could worsen in the coming

                                           26
                                                               Overview: Rapid Response Program

months because of inflation, leading to public discontent. The immediate reaction to the
exchange rate liberalization from some sectors such as tobacco farmers and car dealers
has been positive as it eased doing business and profit margins. However, prices of some
goods and services may further rise. Some relevant government ministries/agencies have
already started to discuss the consequences as part of change. There will be a need for
GoM to have an effective and comprehensive public information, education and
communication (IEC) program to help stakeholders understand the reforms and their
consequences in the short and medium term to manage expectations.

85.      Sustaining reforms in the run-up to elections. This could be challenging
especially for politically sensitive reforms. Malawi will be gearing for campaigns in
preparation for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2014. Experience has shown
how leaders have deviated from economic reform plans and prudent macro-fiscal
management to satisfy political objectives in the run-up to elections. The capability of
this government to stay the course and sustain its economic recovery reforms would be
critical for a substantive economic turnaround within the first two years.

86.      Inadequate capacity and coordination in government to steer reforms and
implement programs. Public sector capacity has always been an issue in Malawi, and
now, with the ongoing reforms and expected support from DPs, GoM needs to ensure that
there is adequate staff with the right technical background to plan and implement the
reforms and upcoming operations, and that the necessary coordination among relevant
line ministries is strengthened. Government realizes the weaknesses in management of
public procurement and controls, and also the need to strengthen key accountability
institutions. In this regard, it has pronounced a ―national austerity drive‖ to address some
of these issues. Several existing interventions such as the Public Finance and Economic
Management MDTF are expected to help address some capacity challenges.

87.    Vulnerability to adverse weather conditions. Adverse weather continues to be
an exogenous shock. Good rains are critical for food security, given that irrigation is
limited in Malawi. Good weather will be critical for the success of some safety nets
intervention proposed in the RRP. IRLADP will help in mitigating some of the risks by
financing irrigation schemes to help facilitate food production all year round.

I.     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR PROGRAM FINANCING

88.     The financing will be provided in the form of IDA grants and credits. All Credits
will be provided on standard terms of 10 years‘ grace period and 40 years‘ maturity.

ATTACHMENT A: RAPID RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT

I.     INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

1.     This program document proposes a stand-alone single tranche Rapid
Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG) to the Republic of Malawi for SDR
33.20 million (US$50 million equivalent), on standard IDA terms. This operation acts
as a bridge between the PRSC I-III series and the future DPO series planned to be
launched later in FY2012/13 in line with the GoM‘s own new poverty reduction and
growth strategy, the Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II). The
RRDPG is part of the Rapid Response Program (RRP) together with two additional
financing operations (Malawi Social Action Fund and Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods, and
Agricultural Development projects).

2.     The development objectives of the RRDPG are to support (i) achieving and
maintaining macroeconomic stability, and restoring the functioning of a market-
based economy to ensure a quick growth rebound; and (ii) protecting the poor and
most vulnerable groups in the short run while improving transparency of delivery
systems. Specifically, the operation recognizes and supports measures to entrench
macroeconomic stability through the national budget; improve functioning of the
petroleum market and improve incentives to exporters, including smallholder tobacco
farmers; strengthen social protection interventions and the resilience of the most
vulnerable groups to shocks; and improve economic management of the FISP.

3.      The RRDPG comes at the time when the GoM has undertaken bold and swift
reform measures to address persistent imbalances in the economy and to put
Malawi back on a trajectory of stronger growth and poverty reduction. At its
inception in April 2012, the new administration faced a situation of severe foreign
exchange shortages with a thriving parallel exchange market, shortages of fuel and other
intermediate inputs, a large fiscal deficit, and a declining growth.

4.      In response, the new administration took several important steps. It initially
devalued the Kwacha by 50 percent, liberalized the foreign exchange market, including
the adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, thereby almost eliminating the parallel
market. In addition, the administration reformed petroleum prices, whereby retail prices
were adjusted upward to fully reflect import costs and to also put in place an automatic
adjustment mechanism to ensure that retail prices track world prices and changes in the
exchange rate. Electricity tariffs have also been increased to make them more cost
reflective and to reduce fiscal burden.

5.     This operation recognizes the reforms that the GoM has already
implemented, and provides support to the 2012/13 budget, towards achieving and
maintaining macroeconomic stability and mitigating the impact of reforms on the
poor. The budget support grant supports the GoM‘s efforts to undertake a large fiscal
adjustment at a time when its own tax resources are under stress and there is a need to

                                          28
                                                        Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

expand poverty-reducing public spending. The GoM‘s tax resources have suffered a
setback due to the slowing down of the economy. On the expenditure side, the GoM has
planned a large temporary increase in expenditure on social safety nets to partially offset
the impact of price increases, caused by the sharp loss of the Kwacha value in the past
few months, on the poor and the vulnerable. The GoM has also planned to hire new
teachers and health workers to strengthen and expand delivery of social services.

6.       The financing provided by this operation will be complemented by other
financial support geared to finance the budget and to also close the external
financing gap at a critical time. The GoM has negotiated a new three-year arrangement
with the Fund under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The Development Partners have
also responded positively to the reforms being implemented by the new administration.
The United Kingdom has already disbursed about £30 million to Malawi. The authorities
have also received pledges from other development partners, including USAID and
Ireland. Support from the international community includes pledged general/sector
budget support from IDA, AfDB (US$ 45 million), Norway, and European Union. If all
of the pledged support materializes, grants will exceed 10 percent of GDP in 2012/13.7

7.      This grant is an integral part of a package of comprehensive support that the
Bank has organized, in a proactive manner, to help Malawi regain macroeconomic
stability. This support has included timely analytical and advisory services from the
Bank and just-in-time technical assistance to support the authorities to develop their own
comprehensive economic recovery plan to arrest the economic decline and alleviate
poverty.

8.      A high level multi sector mission in March 2012 engaged in dialogue with the
economic management cabinet team of the previous administration presenting the
Bank's views on a comprehensive program for “Competitiveness, Growth and
Poverty Reduction.? The Bank has also provided technical assistance to support the
preparation of the 2012/13 national budget. A multi-sectoral mission visited Malawi in
mid-May 2012 to help the GoM in prioritizing expenditure allocations, with special
attention to social protection interventions.

9.    The Bank‟s response through the RRDPG has been coordinated with
responses from other DPs, including the Common Approach to Budget Support
(CABS) development partners (DPs). Budget support in Malawi is provided within the
harmonized framework for the provision of budget support in Malawi, the CABS,
comprising IDA and five other participating DPs.8 The proposed reform program


7
    Grants stood at 7.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and less than 5 percent of GDP in 2011/12.
8
  Other members of the Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) are the European Commission,
United Kingdom (DFID), African Development Bank, Norway, and Germany (KfW). The UNDP, IMF and
Ireland have observer status.

Growth and Development Strategy (2011-2016), the GoM‘s economic recovery plan and
related discussions for the new FY13-16 CAS.


II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                A. Economic Background

10.     During the period 2006 to 2010, Malawi experienced solid growth averaging
around 7 percent, supported by a stable macroeconomic environment and large aid
inflows. The growth was largely driven by growing agricultural exports, rising foreign
direct investment (FDI) inflows related to mining, and fiscal expansion. The debt relief
from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)/MDRI initiative helped to create the
fiscal space needed to generate the momentum for growth. The agricultural sector
contributed about 28 percent of GDP between 2006-11, primarily driven by tobacco
exports, while service sector has recently increased its share to about 33.1 percent of
GDP, driven by the telecommunication, retail and wholesale trade, and financial services.


11.     Macroeconomic indicators (Table 1) point to an economy that was
performing well with moderate inflation, manageable current account deficit and
sustainable levels of domestic debt. These indicators, however, also depict an economy
that was excessively dependent upon external grants to meet its current deficits on both
fiscal and external accounts and where levels of external reserves have been generally
low. Both of these latter two factors made Malawi economy susceptible to external
shocks. The CEM (2010) identified the overvalued exchange rate as the most binding
constraint on the Malawi economy, in addition to inadequate power supply, weak human
capital, lack of trade facilitation, and weak financial intermediation.

12.     Macroeconomic imbalances started to build up after 2008 in the context of
the global crisis, the 2009 Presidential elections, and deteriorating relations with
donors. This combination of events led to fiscal and external imbalances that required
adjustment by containing domestic demand. This in turn would have likely required a
policy mix that would have included both a fiscal adjustment and a monetary restraint.
Even as the external deficit was growing, the GoM maintained a policy of fixed exchange
rate. The IMF program at that time recommended a flexible exchange rate regime and
liberalizing payments for current account transactions, but after completing the first
review in December 2010, the program went off-track in June 2011, when the GoM
failed to implement its commitments. Consequently, several donors suspended their
budget support grants. However, the GoM did not manage to adjust to the loss of budget
support grants and resorted to increased domestic financing including borrowing from the
RBM.

13.     One main outcome of the overall inconsistent policy mix was that by end-
2011, Malawi was grappling with severe foreign exchange shortages which started to
choke the economy. The excess demand for foreign exchange led to increasing
shortages of some critical goods, most notably, fuel. Faced with rapidly falling
international reserves, the authorities devalued the kwacha by 10 percent in August 2011
and concurrently tightened restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, including
requiring foreign exchange bureaus to buy and sell foreign exchange within a small band
around the official exchange rate. The stricter administrative controls in the foreign
exchange market further drove all operations to the parallel market (Box 1) and the gap
between the official and the parallel exchange rate shot up, going from 20 percent in
August 2011 to about 80 percent in March 2012. Malawi's economy quickly started to
slide into a fast reduction in economic activities as firms could not access foreign
exchange to secure inputs for production and fuel supply shortages intensified.

                                                                   Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant




                         Box 1: Foreign exchange market operations in Malawi 2008-Present

       Prior to May 2012, Malawi had a hybrid foreign exchange system where foreign exchange was priced
       differently in different markets and sectors. The foreign exchange market was divided in three segments:
       commercial banks, foreign exchange bureaus and the parallel market. Due to scarcity of foreign exchange,
       interbank foreign exchange market did not exist. RBM used to set spot mid-rates prior to August 2011, where
       banks traded foreign exchange with a spread of 2 percent around the mid-rate. Foreign exchange bureaus
       were however free to set their own trading rates. In August 2011, however, more restrictions were imposed on
       the foreign exchange bureaus as they were from then required to operate within a fixed maximum spread of
       official rate like banks (significantly narrowing the gap between official and bureau rates). Limited access to
       foreign exchange from the banking system shifted demand for foreign exchange to the parallel market,
       increasing the pressure on the parallel exchange rate premium. This raised the volume of foreign exchange
       diverted from the official window, with bank traders becoming significant suppliers of foreign exchange to
       unofficial markets where they receive large premiums above the official rate. This increasingly eroded
       revenue collection as the shift to parallel market activities started to undercut the tax base.

       Following the unification of the exchange rate in early May in the context of broader measures to
       liberalize the foreign exchange rate market, foreign exchange operations are gradually coming back to the
       formal sector away from the parallel market and the premium between official and parallel market rates has
       narrowed to about 5-10 percent. The depreciation of the Kwacha reflects forces of supply and demand and
       the fact that the market is not yet on stable equilibrium. The inter-bank transactions between banks are still
       non-existent with little or no extra foreign exchange to trade. With anticipated aid inflows, the market should
       stabilize.

14.     In early 2012, real GDP growth for 2011 was estimated to have slowed to
about 4.3 percent, and more importantly barring significant reforms, the outlook
for 2012 and beyond was extremely bleak. The IMF Article IV mission in March 2012
projected on the basis of this growth trajectory that lack of policy action on the part of the
GoM would have resulted in the slowdown of the economy to around 2.5 percent at the
end of 2012. Further in 2013, the economy would have entered into a policy-induced
recession, with a collapse in trading - both on the supply and demand side.

15.     Meanwhile prices in the economy had been adjusting to the parallel market
exchange rate. Figure 1 shows that between January 2008 and December 2011, all
prices were on an upward trend, particularly in recent months. This is more evident for
tradable foods and non-food items. Moreover, the non-tradable foods show a clear path
of ―within year seasonality‖ reflecting the cropping calendar of major domestically
produced foods. Figure 1 provides a clear correlation between the recent increase in the
parallel exchange rate and the steep increase in the prices of tradable foods. The same
kind of correlation is noted for non-food items. These results suggest that some
consumer prices, including food prices, were already adjusting to the steep change in the
parallel foreign exchange rate, i.e. some ―pass through‖ was already taking effect at the
time of the analysis.

16.     Evidence of the impact of the crisis on welfare shows that the poor were
affected by the prevailing economic situation, with the laying off of workers and loss
of income and food consumption as a result of price changes induced by the
significant loss in value of the Kwacha in the parallel market. The Bank carried out a
simulation analysis of welfare implications of the unification of the exchange rate on
consumers, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, drawing upon the Third Integrated
Household Survey 2010/11 data.9 The analysis also described mitigating measures, to
sustain consumption and promote economic growth and poverty reduction, and their
monetary cost. The analysis found that in urban areas the poorest households were the
most severely affected in terms of loss of income in both aggregate consumption and in
terms of food consumption. While in rural areas there were no statistically significant
differences across income groups in terms of total consumption, the poorest groups
suffered the most in terms of lost food consumption as a result of devaluation-induced
price changes.

  Welfare Impacts and Mitigation of Foreign Exchange Unification in Malawi, May 2012. This is a partial
equilibrium analysis that measures welfare impact in terms of the amount of money sufficient to
compensate households following price changes and enable the return to the initial levels of utility. Some
simplifying assumptions are made about the pass-through of depreciation to prices of consumption goods.

17.     As mitigating measures, the analysis considered two compensation scenarios
(at 33 percent and 50 percent levels) through Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW)
programs to partially cover the loss of welfare of the poorest 60 percent of the rural
and urban population. The estimated costs, including delivery and the actual transfers
are US$85 million and US$128 million per year (at a compensation of 33 percent and 50
percent, respectively). Finally, the analysis estimated that if the unification of the
exchange rate was undertaken in time for tobacco farmers to receive adjusted prices, the
original losses due to devaluation-induced price increases, could be ameliorated by as
much as 32 percent, on average, among tobacco farmers, with the largest effects
benefiting the poorest growers. In order to promote economic growth and poverty
reduction, additional measures would be needed to protect livelihoods through support to
agricultural productivity and income diversification.

     B. Crisis Response: Preparing for Growth Rebound and Mitigation of Social
        Impacts


18.     The new administration has acted swiftly to arrest the economic crisis and
has implemented a number of critical economic reforms. To begin with, the GoM has
addressed the overvaluation of the exchange rate, which was identified as the foremost
binding constraint on the Malawi economy in the CEM (2010). In this regard, the GoM
began with a one-step 50 percent unification of the exchange rate and liberalized the
foreign exchange market. This included allowing the official market rate to track the
prevailing rate and the removal of restrictions on the setting of exchange rates by banks
and foreign exchange bureaus for transactions with their customers. The GoM has also
removed the requirement to surrender tobacco export proceeds to the Reserve Bank,
where now the US dollars earned at the tobacco auction floors are transferred directly to
seller‘s commercial banks.10 This action is expected to help cushion part of the
smallholder tobacco farmers‘ welfare loss from the unification of the exchange rate, as
well as facilitate the process of developing a functioning interbank foreign exchange
market.

19.     In addition, the authorities have moved to tighten monetary policy. The
decision to adjust upward the policy rate from 13 percent to 16 percent signaled the
authorities‘ tightening monetary stance. In addition, the RBM has also recently
intervened in the foreign exchange market with a twin aim to supply foreign exchange for
private sector use and to absorb excess Kwacha liquidity from the market.

20.     The authorities have reinstated the automatic adjustment mechanism for
retail prices of petroleum products to reflect import parity prices, as well as
movements in the international fuel prices and in the exchange rate. This policy
action is aimed at ensuring that importers are able to recover the rising costs of
importation of petroleum products and also improve transparency in price adjustments.
The GoM has also allowed for an upward adjustment in the electricity tariffs by 77
percent so that revenues in the sectors are closer to covering the costs of production. This
measure is a first step towards a more market determined tariff structure in the electricity
sector, partly addressing price movement rigidities that have been one of the main
influences behind low private capital inflows into the sector.




10
   The RBM has over years maintained different surrender requirements for export revenues. The major reason of it
has been the fear of shortages of foreign exchange to finance essential imports such as petroleum and fertilizer.




                                                      36
                                                       Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

21.     The measures so far are having their intended effect. Foreign exchange
availability has improved significantly. Foreign exchange is now more readily available
in the commercial banks, bringing back into the formal sector transactions that had been
transferred to the parallel market. The parallel market for foreign exchange has shrunk
with a premium of about 5-10 percent from 80 percent - hence, the exchange rate
unification process has been implemented successfully. Supply of petroleum products
has normalized, the excess liquidity in the market has been mopped up, and smallholder
tobacco farmers are being paid at market determined exchange rates.

22. The supply response is on track as firms have begun to resume normal
operations as the foreign exchange situation has normalized, fuel is available, and
credit lines are returning. The Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (MCCCI) is optimistic that its members will recover to pre-2010 production
levels by the end of 2012. The revised tax measures (e.g. removal of minimum tax based
on turnover) in 2012/13 budget are set to provide further financial space in firm budgets
to stimulate operational rebound and expansion in the short term.11

23.     The authorities have put together a realistic 2012/13 budget to realize the
benefits of policy reforms implemented, to entrench macroeconomic stability and
expand social safety net expenditures. The 2012/13 budget attempts to achieve a large
fiscal adjustment to put the GoM‘s finances on a sustainable course while expanding
expenditure on social safety nets programs. There will be no net domestic financing of the
government budget on annual basis as the GoM plans to reduce net domestic finance to zero
(from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2011/12). This adjustment is aided in part by the increase in
external grants. Exchange rate liberalization is also expected to have a net positive impact
on the budget.12 On the expenditure side, fiscal adjustment will entail cuts in wasteful
recurrent expenditures and postponement of development projects which are 100 percent
GoM-financed.

24.    The budget, however, provides for scaled-up social protection interventions,
including the expansion of a country-wide labor intensive public works, FISP and
other social safety net programs. About US$ 103 million has been provided in the
budget for the scaling up of four programs, including the labour intensive public works,
the school feeding program, the school bursaries program, and the social cash transfer
program. The GoM has also expanded FISP program for 2012/13 to reach a large
number of poor farmers affected by the dry spells in the Southern region. The budget


11
  Trade taxes in Malawi are not inordinately high and are within regional trade regime. High share of trade
tax revenue reflects very high import composition of the economy. VAT tax is at 16.5 percent.
12
   This is based on the fact that expected large increases in foreign grants (projected at over 10 percent of
GDP) and their kwacha values will more offset the increase in kwacha value of government imports. On
average about 40 percent of government expenditures is foreign exchange sensitive.


                                                    37

also provides for a 30 percent increase in nominal wage bill, including the cost of hiring
more teachers and health workers.13 To reduce fiscal risks, efforts would be geared
towards strengthening fiscal discipline, particularly public financial management, and
expenditure control to avoid accumulation of domestic arrears and the build-up of domestic
debt.14
25.     The 2012/13 budget also proposes removal of some taxes imposed in the
previous budget, including the minimum tax based on turnover and capital gains
tax from the sale of shares. In addition, the authorities have increased the investment
allowance on new and unused industrial building, plant and machinery to 100 percent;
international transport allowance to 25 percent; and have removed VAT on machinery
and financial services. Together, these measures are geared to providing a conducive
environment for private sector investment in the country.



       C. Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook
26.     The determined movement of President Banda‟s administration to adopt
right policy measures and to repair relations with donors and international financial
institutions has put Malawi on a firm position to return to a faster growth path.
Real GDP growth is expected to exceed 6.0 percent by 2014, anchored mainly on the
sectors that were hardest hit by the foreign exchange shortages, including tourism,
manufacturing, transportation services, construction, and trade. Other sectors, including
agriculture, will also benefit from the easing of fuel shortages.15


27.     Inflationary pressures are expected to remain in 2012, with a projected
annual average inflation of about 18.4 percent, but expected to ease to pre-2010
levels of about 7.5 percent in 2014.16 There is a concern that an average increase of 21
percent in public wages could lead to a demand for higher wages in the private sector and



13
  With the projected annual inflation of 18.4 percent for 2012, the real increase in civil servants‘ wages is
estimated at 2.6 percent. The Trade Union of Malawi has been calling for 67 percent hike in civil servants‘
salaries to help workers fight the rising cost of living, but the 2012/13 budget has accommodated a 21
percent average wage increase for civil servants.
14
  The fiscal cost of all the proposed interventions is estimated at about 2.5 percent of GDP, which is
expected to be financed through fiscal savings from expenditure control, grants and revenue enhancing
measures.
15
  With agriculture being dominant sector, exchange rate unification should eliminate the implicit tax and
increase welfare, especially for smallholder farmers whose earnings are pegged to the US Dollar.
16
     The year-on-year headline rate jumped to 17.3 percent in May 2012, from 12.4 percent in April 2012.


                                                      38
                                                      Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

exacerbate inflationary pressures. However, available evidence at this stage shows that
the private sector is not witnessing a demand for higher wages. 17 Overall, the GoM‘s
policies geared towards ensuring fiscal adjustment and monetary restraint are likely to
contain the demand-side pressures on prices.


28.     A tight fiscal stance is expected to be maintained over the medium term. The
overall balance in the medium term is projected to narrow from a deficit of 7.0
percent of GDP in 2011/12, to an average deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP during 2013-
2015. The authorities‘ commitment to fiscal prudence during 2012-14 provides an
important anchor to safeguard sustainability in the medium term. However, the fiscal
adjustment agenda faces risks arising from possible spending pressures in the run-up to
the tripartite elections scheduled in mid-2014. To support the low fiscal deficit goal, the
GoM will continue to implement a number of tax policy measures and tax administration
mechanisms introduced in the 2011/12 budget, to further boost its revenue (projected to
average 23 percent of GDP during 2012/13-2014/15). Specifically, efforts have been
intensified to broaden the tax base, with increased efforts to mobilize both tax and non-
tax revenues.


29.     The current account deficit is projected to narrow from 5.9 percent of GDP
in 2011, to less than 2.0 percent of GDP during 2013-2015. Exports, expected to play
a key role in driving economic recovery, are projected to expand from 21.8 percent of
GDP in 2011 to an average of 30 percent of GDP between 2012- 2015. Still, export
expansion going forward is subject to uncertainty regarding both the external
environment and domestic supply constraints. Meanwhile, imports are also expected to
pick up from 33.4 percent of GDP in 2011, to an average of 40 percent of GDP during
2013-2015, partly to reflect the projected increase in economic activities. Despite the
projected recovery from the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade in 2011, the
undiversified nature of the country‘s exports will continue to make it vulnerable to terms
of trade shocks. The medium-term financing plan requires continued public sector
inflows, in addition to FDI and other private inflows. The recovery of private capital
inflows and accumulation of international reserves is expected to strengthen the country‘s
balance of payments position.




17
   There is, however, a tendency for the private sector salaries to be adjusted whenever the public sector
salaries are adjusted, without due consideration of productivity increases.

30.   Agriculture is expected to rebound to 5 percent growth within the next 24
months as production diversifies. However, moderate decreases in prices forecast for
2012-14 may slightly dampen the revenues earned from exports, particularly for tobacco




                                                                       40
                                                       Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

and sugar, which are traditional exports for Malawi; and soybeans and cotton, which are
non-traditional exports recently targeted by the national export diversification strategy.18

31.     Manufacturing is expected to rebound during the second half of 2012 as firms
begin to use up idle capacity with supply chains normalizing on account of returning lines
of credit and normal foreign exchange supply. In this regard, the production of dairy,
meat, flour, sugar, beer, biscuits, and rubber is expected to grow to above pre-2010
levels. Moreover, a large company like Illovo sugar is planning to expand their capacity
and cultivation of sugar.

32.     The mining sector‟s contribution to growth is projected to increase from 13
percent of GDP in 2011, to over 16 percent of GDP over the next three years, with
the Kayelekera mine having reached its full operating capacity in 2011. The mining
contribution will also be boosted by projected increase in coal production in 2013-14, as
well as the coming on stream of the niobium mining project at Kanyika by 2014 with
construction beginning in 2013. The growing importance of minerals, mainly uranium
for export will help to diversify the export base of the economy.

33.     Private investment is projected to recover from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2011,
to an average of 14 percent of GDP during 2013-2015, on the back of rapid
improvements in business environment. FDI inflows are also projected to rise from
1.1 percent of GDP in 2011 to an average of about 2.5 percent of GDP during 2013-2015.
Higher private domestic investment is also expected to benefit from a pick-up in bank
lending, with private sector credit projected to increase from 8.3 percent in 2011 to 17.0
percent in 2013 and moderate at 14 percent in 2015. The unification of the exchange rate
and the move to a floating exchange regime will help encourage private investment and
diversified growth. Investment is also expected to be driven by efforts by the private
sector to take advantage of trading opportunities arising in neighbouring countries, in
particular, Mozambique, in the Tete region.

34.      The authorities are also making efforts to address some of the constraints to
growth, including those related to inadequate energy supply, weak human capital,
lack of access to finance and trade facilitation. Specifically, the GoM is leading
negotiations on an energy deal (regional electricity interconnector) with Mozambique and
is facilitating market access for Malawian products, in particular targeting the economic
boom in Tete. Other regional trade facilitation initiatives include moves to operate one-
border posts with Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. The Bank is also supporting the
GoM‘s efforts to address these constraints through investment operations in energy and
education sectors, with support from other DPs, and is providing technical assistance in
the mining and financial sectors, as well as targeted support to enhance the overall

business environment. All these efforts will contribute towards removing existing
constraints to growth and creating an environment for a robust supply side response
generated by the reforms supported by RRDPG.

35.     The macroeconomic framework in the medium term is underpinned by a
constant flow of funding from the development partners, especially budget support.
However, there are downside risks associated with the weakening global economic
environment, which, if sustained, could subsequently affect the overall financing
framework. The new administration appears determined to address outstanding issues
that led to the suspension of budget support in FY12; however, risks remain if issues of
human rights and democratic principles are not adequately addressed. Given the
country‘s dependence on donor funding,19 a significant withdrawal or cuts in budget
support due to the GoM‘s non-compliance of the fundamental principles for budget
support and/or weakening political economy environment could make the program
unfinanceable.20 In the event of a shortfall, the GoM will be forced to make significant
spending cuts, as well as to increase domestic borrowing, which could compromise its
domestic debt position.

36.      In view of the above analysis on the medium-term outlook, the new
administration‟s reinvigorated macroeconomic policy framework is appropriate.
However, the medium-term prospects of the economy, especially its ability to sustain
strong growth that will be accompanied with a solid fiscal and external position, remain
subject to important risks, i.e. persistent external payment imbalances. These risks,
which could be mitigated by GoM‘s policies, come especially from fiscal loosening in the
run-up to the general elections in 2014, softening of financing in the event of an off-track
IMF program, as well as from parastatal performance issues leading to contingent
liabilities. Meanwhile, the authorities have made a commitment to manage fiscal and
monetary policy in a manner that improves the efficiency of public expenditure, while
creating room for private sector activity and growth.

       D. Debt Sustainability Analysis

37.    Malawi is still at moderate risk of debt distress as the country‟s debt burden
indicators are projected to remain well below relevant prudential thresholds.
Malawi‘s external stock of debt has increased from US$683 million (19.4 percent of
GDP) in 2008 to about US$1,140 million in 2011 (23 percent of GDP). The stock of



19
     Grants from DPs account for 7-10 percent of GDP.
20
  The proportion of the budget funded by donors is on a downward trend, currently at 27 percent of total
budget for 2010/11 from 30 percent in 2009/10; after a dip in 2010/11 on account of suspension of budget
support in 2011/12, 2012/13 is expected to see a rebound as development partners (DFID, WB, EU, AFDB,
Norway) resume budget support operations.


                                                    42
                                              Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt is expected to gradually decline in the
longterm from about 31 percent of GDP in 2012 to about 16 percent of GDP in 2032.
Malawi‘s debt sustainability during the projected period is entirely based on prudent
macroeconomic policy environment. The present value (PV) of PPG debt-to-GDP
gradually declines to below 15 percent during the rest of the projected period. The PV of
debt-to-exports ratio falls gradually, remaining under 80 percent that is well below the
threshold of 150 percent. However, the PV of debt to export ratio is breached under stress
tests after an export shock, thus the need to diversify the country‘s exports to minimize
the country‘s vulnerability to shocks. The PV of PPG debt to revenue drops under an
average of 110 percent (well below the threshold of 250 percent) during the entire
projected period.

38.     The ratio of public external debt service to exports is expected to decline
gradually from 73 percent in 2012 to 50 percent in 2015, before falling to 19 percent
in 2032. The debt service to revenue ratio is expected to decline to 13.5 percent in 2012,
picking up again to 15.5 percent in 2014, before falling to about 2.9 percent in 2032.
Recent policy slippages, including expansionary fiscal and accommodating monetary
policies, have also contributed to the build-up of the domestic debt in 2011 (to about 25
percent of GDP from 20 percent of GDP as of end-2008). Stress tests indicated a need to
for fiscal consolidation and reform of parastatal institutions to slowdown growth in the
domestic debt stock.

III.   GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

39.     The Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) 2011-
2016, which is the country‟s second medium term plan, was approved by the
Cabinet in April 2012. The MGDS II is a medium-term strategy designed to attain
Malawi‘s long term aspirations as spelt out in its Vision 2020. It strives to foster a more
inclusive job creating growth to tackle the unemployment problem as well as reduce
poverty. The strategy reflects a general consensus on the country‘s broad goals for
growth, social equity, and governance. More specifically, the strategy recognizes that in
order for all Malawians to benefit equitably from economic growth, concerted efforts to
promote human and social development would need to be complemented by efforts to
improve labor productivity, structural transformation and economic diversification.

40.    The MGDS II was developed in an all-inclusive process. All levels of society,
including women, youth, private sector, civil society and development partners were
involved in the MGDS II consultation process. The process of developing the MGDS II
was well integrated with the existing processes of the GoM led by the Sector Working
Groups (SWGs). The monitoring of the MGDS II implementation will also be conducted
with participation from representatives of the Civil Society Organizations and
Development Partners, through the various SWGs.

41.      To respond to the negative impact of policies undertaken by the previous
administration, the GoM has come up with a short term economic recovery plan

                                            43
                                               Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

approved by Cabinet in April 2012. This recovery plan is well aligned with MGDS II
and its focus is on short-term measures to restore macroeconomic stability while
mitigating the impact on the poor. In the immediate term, the focus will be on monetary
and fiscal policies, including liberalization of the foreign exchange rate and foreign
exchange markets, revenue enhancing measures, and expenditure control. In its proposed
recovery plan, the GoM recognizes that macroeconomic reforms that are being
implemented will have negative consequences on standards of living of its people due to
rising cost of living arising from pass-through from the initial exchange rate liberalization
into non-tradable prices and second round price increases due to increasing prices of fuel
and distribution costs.

42.       Therefore, the GoM has proposed a social support package of US$200
million, which will be built on existing programs especially public works program to
mitigate the impact of these reforms on vulnerable groups of society. These programs
include: scaling up labor intensive public works program (LIPW); Farm Input Subsidy
Program (FISP); scaling up of legume seed multiplication, agro forestry and soil
conservation, multiplication of cassava cuttings and sweet potato vines, and extending
village savings club; scaling up of school meals program and vitamin A supplementation;
and scaling up of social cash transfer program.

43.       The consultation process for the Economic Recovery Plan and specifically
for the reforms supported by this operation, has involved various stakeholders,
including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Academia and DPs in different foras.
Consultations on reforms related to the 2012/13 budget were carried out in national
budgetary consultative meetings in Lilongwe, Blantyre and Mzuzu in mid-May 2012,
whereas discussions on social protection reforms were conducted through the Malawi
Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) with various stakeholders, including
CSOs. Consultations on reforms related to FISP were carried in May through regional
workshops in main three regions. Consultations on issues of foreign exchange have been
held in various fora, including the national consultations held by the GoM in February
2012.

IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
       A.      LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

44.           The RRDPG is an integral part of the Bank‟s assistance program to
Malawi in the new CAS currently being finalized and consistent with FY07-11 CAS.
Specifically, the operation is consistent with the CAS FY07-11 outcome on improved
public expenditure management, transparent budget formulation, execution and reporting,
and facilitation of the development of a more coherent National Social Protection Policy.
To achieve these outcomes, the CAS envisages programmatic development policy
lending operation over the CAS period and this self-standing development policy
operation. In terms of policy areas, the RRDPG identifies important policy reforms that
seek to contribute towards restoring prudent fiscal policy and sound macroeconomic

                                             44
                                                      Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

management and protecting the most vulnerable through improved social safety net
programs.The draft FY13-16 CAS is fully aligned to the Africa Regional Strategy and the
MGDS II and is designed to help the GoM achieve three key outcomes: i) prudent fiscal
policy and sound macroeconomic management to restore internal and external balance;
ii) increased productivity and diversification in agriculture; and iii) improving social
safety net systems.
        B.       COORDINATION WITH THE IMF

45.     As was the case with the previous PRSC I-III series, the Bank has been
collaborating very closely with the IMF. A joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA) for low-income countries (LIC-DSA) was undertaken in late March 2012
in the context of the IMF Article IV consultations. The Bank team also participated in
some of the IMF mission discussions with the authorities on the new ECF-supported
program in May 2012, and provided inputs into the development of the macroeconomic
policy framework. In the identification of prior actions for the RRDPG, attention has
been paid to the benchmarks under the new ECF arrangement to avoid cross-
conditionality.


46.     The macroeconomic assessment underlying this operation is in line with the
conclusions of the recent IMF mission on the new ECF-supported program for
Malawi. The objectives of the program to be supported by the new ECF arrangement
include fiscal sustainability and a gradual build-up of international reserves to help
cushion the economy against external shocks. More broadly, the program will guide the
implementation of policies to create the stable macroeconomic environment needed to
achieve the main objective of the Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS II) of reducing poverty through sustained private sector-led growth and wealth
creation.

        C.     COLLABORATION AND HARMONIZATION WITH OTHER DONORS

47.         The Bank‟s response through the RRDPG has been coordinated with
responses from other DPs, including CABS DPs. The RRDPG will continue to be
implemented within the framework of the CABS.21 The CABS represents a group of
development partners that use a joint approach in the provision of budgetary support to
the GoM. In September 2005, the CABS group and the GoM agreed on a Joint
Framework (JF) agreement for budget support cooperation designed to formalize their



21
   At the time the Bank joined the CABS in 2007, there were plans to revise the JF during fall of 2007, but
this process never took off until FY10. The agreement among CABS members was that the JF would be
revised and the Bank would sign up the JF at the completion of this process, with the inclusion of Bank‘s
reservations. But since the JF revision process was never completed, the Bank continued to provide the
budget support through the CABS framework without having signed the JF.


                                                    45
                                             Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

relationship. The JF represents a memorandum of understanding on principles governing
budget support cooperation in Malawi. Some of the principles governing this cooperation
include alignment to the country‘s poverty reduction strategy, joint reviews, and
predictability of funding. The DPO is IDA‘s instrument for the provision of budget
support under the CABS framework.

48.     The CABS JF among other things provides for a Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF) as a basis for disbursement decisions. The PAF consists of a
jointly approved set of indicators and targets for assessing the GoM‘s performance and
progress in the use of budget support. Each indicator has an annual target which the GoM
is expected to meet. The CABS undertakes two annual reviews, one during February-
March and another during September-October. The February-March review takes place
just as the GoM starts to prepare its budget. The review focuses on assessing the GoM‘s
performance in achieving the targets for each indicator in the PAF.
       D.    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

49.          The RRDPG is one of the three operations under Rapid Response
Program to support the country‟s fiscal and social needs. The other two are the
Additional Financing for Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) and Irrigation Rural
Livelihoods and Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP) - see Attachments B and
C.

       E.    LESSONS LEARNT

50.    A number of important lessons relevant for the design of the proposed
RRDPG have emerged from the CAS Completion Report and PRSC I-III ICR and
have been taken into account in the development of this operation. They include:

   GoM’s ownership, political will and commitment are key determinants in the
    successful implementation of the institutional and structural reforms. In areas where
    the GoM‘s ownership is less broad-based, likelihood of objectives being met is also
    low. The Bank should invest more in terms of staff time and other resources at the
    preparation stage to ensure adequate GoM‘s capacity and ownership of reforms is
    built. In addition, the authorities should also be given the time and the space to
    prepare credible and sustainable reforms in sensitive areas. This operation has
    benefited from strong ownership by the GoM of the reforms being supported.

   Progress tends to be slower in reform areas where the political economy context is
    critical, yet not adequately understood. The pace of reforms tends to be much slower
    when the reform actions involved political decisions (Cabinet/Parliament) for
    implementation. Clearly, more rigorous political economy analysis is needed to
    inform selection of program components, as well as the approach to policy dialogue
    for politically sensitive reforms supported by DPOs. Evidence-based analysis and


                                           46
                                              Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

    engagement at a Cabinet level helped pave the way for reforms supported by this
    operation.

   Working within the harmonized framework for the provision of budget support, the
    CABS, has enhanced the quality of policy dialogue across donors, notwithstanding
    the inherent coordination challenges. Continuous dialogue with the GoM has been
    critical in keeping up the momentum on reforms supported by this operation, and this
    was enhanced by the CABS framework.

   Flexibility in the CABS PAF should be encouraged to enable it to adapt to unforeseen
    external shocks and changing of the GoM’s priorities and programs. Given the
    urgent need to support the GoM‘s reforms, the operation has adopted some of the
    policy actions from the GoM‘s own short-term recovery plan.


       F.    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

51.    This RRDPG has drawn on some key findings from a series of economic and
sector works. This includes the following analysis:

Welfare Impacts and Mitigation of Exchange Rate Unification in Malawi (2012):
The report identified a growing gap between the official and the parallel exchange rates,
with parallel rates significantly higher and with prices of tradable commodities, including
tradable foods, already adjusting to those higher parallel market rates. It proposed two
compensation scenarios through Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) Programs to
partially cover the loss of welfare of the poorest 60 percent of the rural and urban
population. The study also indicated that if exchange rate unification is undertaken in
time for farmers (especially smallholder tobacco farmers) to receive adjusted prices for
their crop, the original losses due to foreign exchange rate liberalization-induced price
increases could be ameliorated with the largest effects benefiting the poorest growers.

Comprehensive Exchange Rate and Foreign Exchange Study for Malawi: The report
provided the genesis of the foreign exchange imbalances - how the GoM got into this
situation, - identified the main causes of external imbalances and effects of the chronic
foreign exchange shortages and the associated real exchange rate appreciation in the
economy, and proposed possible policy responses, including the unification of the
exchange rate and fiscal and monetary restraint. The note also presented a brief analysis
of pass-through effect of exchange rate unification.

Joint Procurement Review of the 2010/11 Farm Input Subsidy Program: The report
identified the following weaknesses: the award criteria used in the bidding documents did
not ensure value for money; currency of the bid and payment provision was not
respected; the quantity allocation criteria based on unit prices, as well as contract award
process (e.g. roles of the Evaluation Committees and Internal Procurement Committees)
were not adhered to in line with Malawi‘s procurement procedures.

2010 Country Economic Memorandum: The report identified constraints to growth,
including an overvalued exchange rate, inadequate power supply, and lack of trade
facilitation among others. It also clearly identifies the public expenditure management as
a key reform area for containing the growth of GoM‘s spending and maintaining fiscal
stability. The CEM pointed to the fact that growth in aggregate demand needed to be
reduced through expenditure rationalization and effective expenditure targeting, so as to
bring about internal balance.

Public Expenditure Review: 2010 Public Expenditure Review on Travel, sponsored by
CABS, revealed that travel expenses were high, especially for domestic travel, and the
travel budget needed to be reduced. The high travel expenditure is partly because of
inefficiencies, malpractices and abuse. Many of the malpractices take advantage of the
poor, weak and inadequate internal controls system.


V.     THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT (RRDPG)

                                 A. OVERALL DESCRIPTION

141. Development objectives. The Rapid Response Development Policy Grant
(RRDPG) program recognizes and supports the authorities‘ efforts to address the
imbalances in the economy while mitigating the impact on the poor. The reform program
supported by this operation is built on two pillars: (i) achieving and maintaining
macroeconomic stability, and restoring the functioning of a market-based economy to
ensure a quick growth rebound; and (ii) protecting the poor and most vulnerable groups
in the short run while improving transparency of delivery systems. These reforms are in
line with the GoM‘s own Economic Recovery Plan aimed at getting the economy back on
the sustainable growth and poverty reduction path.

142. Prior actions. The program focuses largely on the short-term measures that aim
to restore macroeconomic and social stability in response to the crisis through a fiscal
adjustment process and focused interventions to protect the vulnerable. The specific
reforms supported in each area are described in the following sections; the GoM‘s Letter
of Development Policy (Annex 1); and the DPO policy matrix (Annex 2).

143. The GoM has implemented the following prior actions before the presentation
of the operation to the Bank‟s Board of Executive Directors:
     Prior action 1: Adoption by Cabinet of the 2012/2013 national budget that is
        consistent with fiscal sustainability and prioritization of social expenditure.
     Prior action 2: Adoption by Cabinet of a fuel pricing policy that fully reflects fuel
        import parity prices.
     Prior action 3: Approval by Cabinet of an automatic price adjustment of petroleum
        import prices.

       Prior action 4: Directive from Reserve Bank of Malawi mandating exporters,
        including tobacco farmers, to transfer earnings in US dollars obtained at the tobacco
        auction floors to commercial banks at prevailing market determined exchange rate.
       Prior action 5: Inclusion, through MoF, of a scaled up labor intensive public works
        (LIPW) program, designed to enhance the Recipient‘s safety nets program, in the
        2012/13 national budget.
       Prior action 6: Inclusion, through MoF, of a scaled up Farm Input Subsidy Program
        (FISP) in the 2012/13 national budget.
       Prior action 7: Institutionalization of the policy to undertake procurement audits of
        FISP as recommended in the Joint GoM/World Bank Fertilizer Procurement Review
        Report on the 2010/11 FISP.

144. Good practice principles in conditionality. Box 2 provides information on how
good principles on conditionality have been applied in Malawi.

Box 2: How Good Practice Principles on Conditionality are being Applied to the Operation


Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

   The GoM has strong ownership of the proposed DPO, which supports several dimensions of the GoM‘s
    economic recovery reform plan where the Bank has comparative advantage and complements the work
    being supported by IMF and other development partners. The proposed DPO follows the PRSC 1-3 series,
    which demonstrates Malawi‘s track record of significant GoM‘s ownership and strong commitment to the
    reform process. The Bank‘s analytic work has contributed to the formulation and implementation of
    selected aspects of the GoM‘s economic recovery reform plan. The Bank has had extensive discussions with
    the authorities on the policy options and the GoM departments identified the critical reforms needed to accelerate
    attainment of macroeconomic stability and growth rebound, while mitigating the impact on the most vulnerable
    groups.
   The prior actions selected have been extracted from the GoM‘s Economic Recovery Plan, which has been
    informed by the Comprehensive Package for Competitiveness, Growth and Poverty Reduction. The prior
    actions are linked to the pillar on regaining macro-balance, social impacts and their mitigation, and growth
    rebound.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the GoM and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework

   The CABS donors and the GoM have signed a Joint Framework (JF) of budget support cooperation. One of
    the principles contained in the JF is that of carrying out joint reviews. Every year one of the reviews
    focuses on assessing the GoM‘s performance in meeting the targets contained in the PAF.
   The accountability framework (e.g. policy matrix) for measuring progress under the program has been prepared
    and discussed with ministries and departments involved at technical levels.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

   The DPO team works closely with the GoM‘s counterparts from various ministries in designing and monitoring
    reform implementation. The agreed accountability framework is fully consistent with the GoM‘s expressed
    policy intentions and internal accountability mechanisms. The CABS undertakes biannual reviews, one during
    February-March and another during October-November. Both reviews are aligned to the country‘s budget cycle.
    The February-March review takes place just before the GoM starts to prepare its budget. The review focuses on


                                                      49
                                                            Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

      assessing the GoM‘s performance in achieving the targets for each indicator in the PAF. Decisions on whether to
      disburse budget support and how much to disburse are based on the outcome of this review. The September-
      October review focuses on the annual budget that will have just been approved by Parliament, public financial
      management issues, and a preliminary assessment of the fiscal performance during the previous fiscal year.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

     The DPO program focuses on actions that are critical for the success of the reform aimed at restoring
      macroeconomic stability, mitigating impact on the most vulnerable groups and supporting growth rebound.
      There are 7 prior actions, which aim at mitigating the impact of the unification of the exchange rate on the most
      vulnerable groups, improve functioning of fuel and commodity markets and improve the governance of FISP.
      All prior actions reflect the reform priorities of the GoM which are supported by the Bank in the CAS. The
      actions for the proposed RRDPG represent only those actions that will be critical for achieving the
      program‘s development objectives and the expected outcomes.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support

     The preparation of this operation follows the lessons learned from the PRSC I-III and one program review is
      planned. All of the prior actions as well as the expected outcome indicators for this operation focus on the results
      of implementation of the supported reforms. The RRDPG‘s financial support is expected to provide the much
      needed resources to support the GoM‘s economic stabilization process through the national budget. The
      support is fully consistent with the GoM‘s macroeconomic framework agreed with the IMF, including the
      FY2012/13 budget framework.

                                               B. POLICY AREAS

145. The RRDPG recognizes the importance of the reforms below aimed at ensuring that
macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence is restored; the most vulnerable groups are well
cushioned from the impact of adjustments in the economy; the functioning of the fuel
markets and incentives to exporters, including smallholder tobacco farmers are improved;
and the economic management of FISP is strengthened.


1.     Achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring the
functioning of a market-based economy to ensure a quick growth rebound

1a.       Restore macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability

146. The 2012/13 national budget presents a realistic budget anchored on zero net
domestic borrowing.22 A sizeable fiscal adjustment is planned whereby the net
domestic financing will be brought down from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2011/12, to zero




22
   The 2012/13 national budget was adopted by the Parliament on June 27, 2012, based on the budget
framework agreed with the IMF.


                                                         50
                                                      Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

(see paragraph 23).23 This will largely be achieved through the reduction in discretionary
expenditure that had ballooned in 2011/12 by about 3 percent of GDP. The 2012/13
budget has included a number of expenditure control and prioritization measures to
contain expenditures within the available resource envelope. These include reductions in
travel (both internal and external travel) and transfers to public entities, reductions in
development24 expenditures, and the review of allowances to make sure that they are not
abused. The authorities also intend to undertake more symbolic measures such as the
sale of the Presidential Jet and reduction in the number of vehicles available to senior
officials.

147. To support the low fiscal deficit goal, the GoM has also intensified efforts to
broaden the tax base. The GoM has refined some tax policy measures that were recently
introduced with a view to improve their application and encourage domestic production
through promotion of value addition and encouraging investment and exports through
various tax policy instruments. The largest contribution to increased revenues is
expected to come from fuel taxes. With the recent change in fuel pricing policy, the
implicit subsidies on pump prices (foregone revenues) have now been removed as pump
prices now reflect actual cost of imports and changes in international world petroleum
prices.25 Some of the recently introduced taxes, which were considered inhibitive, have
been removed.26 A range of items subject to VAT are also being expanded and excise
duties are being harmonized with regional partners.27 The GoM is also putting in place
measures to improve tax administration and tax collection through the implementation of
electrical fiscal devices in collection of VAT, automated self-assessment system for
management of tax returns, web-based ASYCUDA system, and the customs data
processing center. Efforts are also being made to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of collecting non-tax revenues.



23
  There will be no net domestic financing of the government budget on an annual basis; any borrowing in
the early part of the year would have to be repaid by the end of the year.
24
  Postponement of new development projects which are fully funded by government. Only the ongoing
projects on existing contracts will be financed.
25
   In 2010, the cost of fuel subsidies was about US$40 million (0.7 percent of GDP), US$67 million (1.2
percent of GDP) in 2011, and according to the authorities this cost would have increased to US$130 million
(2.8 percent of GDP) in 2012, if no fuel pricing policy reforms were undertaken.
26
  These include the minimum tax based on turnover (2 percent); capital gain taxes from sales of shares
held for more than a year to encourage long-term investments; Value Added Tax (VAT) on machinery and
equipment, and others to help improve the overall investment climate.
27
  The government has also eliminated VAT on basic items, including bread, and has introduced other tax
measures to protect the poor. The removal of taxes like VAT on financial services, newspapers and Internet
services are meant to promote financial inclusion and access to information.


                                                   51

148. The budget will be monitored closely through quarterly reviews to ensure
adherence to parameters laid out above. In this regard, the authorities have agreed to
quarterly monitoring of a cash budget during the first year of the new ECF-supported
program.28 Fiscal risks, such as those that arose from the fuel subsidy have been
addressed through the reinstatement of the automatic price mechanism, which has made
cost recovery for fuel possible. The Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) is also going to be strengthened through the implementation of
commitment control module to prevent the build-up of new arrears. Procurement rules
and regulations will also be enforced to ensure that the public is familiar with them and
that no payment would be made for provision of goods and services outside the
established rules. The new ECF program will mitigate the risk of arrears through its
quarterly reviews, as the IMF will be working with the authorities on the clearance of the
stock of arrears while monitoring closely the performance of parastatals.29


RRDPG Prior Action 1: Adoption by Cabinet of the 2012/2013 national budget that
is consistent with fiscal sustainability and prioritization of social expenditure.

Expected Results: Reduction in the fiscal deficit from over 7.0 percent in 2011/12, to less
than 2.0 percent by June 2013.



1b. Improved functioning of the petroleum market.

149. As part of the GoM‟s attempt to improve the supply of petroleum, it has
liberalized the petroleum market.30 The objective was to re-establish a pricing policy


28
   Authorities will establish and enforce quarterly spending limits on all MDAs, consistent with available
resources and quarterly reporting to the Cabinet on progress.
29
   Parastatals pose a fiscal risk as they are among the main culprits responsible for accumulating arrears
over the past 4-5 years in excess of MWK72 billion (equivalent to US$ 268 million or 7 percent of GDP),
with almost half of the arrears attributed to them. In the 2012/13 budget, a provision of MWK10 billion has
been made for the settlement of some of the arrears. Verification of existing domestic arrears will be
carried out by the government and plan will be put in place to settle the verified claims. It is expected that
the clearance of arrears will take 3 to 4 years.
30
  Malawi is a net importer of liquid fuel and its annual bill for fuel ranges between US$300 million and
US$400 million, with the estimated monthly import bill of about US$35 million. The demands of a
growing economy and persistent load shedding have contributed to the rising demand for fuel. Between
2006 and 2010, growth in fuel imports has averaged at about 5-6 percent per annum; closely tracking the
real growth of the economy. However, it is projected to slow down to less than 4.0 percent of its normal
annual growth in 2011.


                                                     52
                                                             Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

that results in retail prices that are fully reflective of actual total cost of import. The main
element of the price adjustment was to increase the In-Bond Landed Cost (IBLC), which
includes landed costs, the GoM‘s taxes and oil industry costs and margins, to reflect
world fuel prices (Table 4). In the past, the FOB prices had remained fixed for a number
of years at the same level and the official exchange rate was also fixed. As the Kwacha
value of petroleum imports is now based on market exchange rates, the implicit subsidy
in providing foreign exchange for imports at an overvalued official exchange rate is being
saved.

150. The GoM has also adopted an automatic pricing mechanism (APM) that
allows adjustment of fuel prices at the pump on a regular basis in response to
movements in the world petroleum prices and exchange rate. This has triggered a
positive response from the private sector and the normalization of fuel imports and
supplies. While policies supported by this operation existed on paper following the
reforms in the petroleum importation in early 2000 that saw the establishment of
Petroleum Importers Limited (PIL), an association of main private importer of petroleum,
they were never effectively implemented. As a result, the petroleum market never
functioned well as administered prices31 were never adequate to ensure that all
procurement, transportation and distribution costs were covered; and price adjustments
were made on an ad-hoc basis and in a non-transparent way, most of the time making
huge adjustments reflecting accumulations over long periods of time. PIL therefore was
accumulating losses, which at end of October 2011 stood at about US$ 36 million.32

petroleum prices. The safety net levy has been dropped and the excise duty on fuel has

   In the survey conducted by the IMF on the average pass-through from international to domestic pump
price between 2003-06, it reveals that the pass-through for Malawi averaged at 1.4 for petrol, 1.1 for
paraffin/kerosene and 1.5 (full price through) for diesel. (Domestic Petroleum Product Prices and
Subsidies: Recent Developments and Reform Strategies: IMF Working Paper WP/07/71.

been reduced from 30 percent to around 10 percent of the pump price. In addition, the
contribution to Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) has now been reduced. The PSF now has
5 percent of IBLC to absorb movements on the FOB for petroleum products and
additional 3 percent of IBLC to deal with the accumulated arrears from unpaid fuel
import bill. This change will have positive impact on domestic revenues as fuel supplies
are normalized.33 The price adjustments effected in May 2012, did not affect the price of
kerosene for household use. This is a deliberate measure by the authorities to cushion the
impact on the poor.34 It is expected that users of commercial kerosene will cross-
subsidize users of household kerosene.

RRDPG Prior Action 2: Adoption by Cabinet of a fuel pricing policy that fully
reflects fuel import parity prices.

RRDPG Prior Action 3: Approval by Cabinet of an automatic price adjustment of
petroleum import prices.

Expected Results: Systematic adjustment of pump prices to reflect import parity price
movements in international petroleum prices and exchange rate plus or minus 5 percent
of the actual cost of fuel importation by June 2013 as evidenced by the increase in
volume of fuel imports from 160 million litres in 2011/12, to projected 300 million litres.


1c.        Improved incentives to exporters, including smallholder tobacco farmers


152.    With the unification of the exchange rate and the removal of the requirement
for foreign exchange earnings to be surrendered to the Reserve Bank of Malawi
(RBM), US dollars earned at the auction floors are now being transferred directly to
sellers‟ commercial banks and exchanged at prevailing market determined
exchange rate. This effectively means that tobacco exporters, including smallholder
farmers without foreign currency denominated accounts (FCDAs), surrender all their
export earnings directly to commercial banks at the prevailing market exchange rate.
Meanwhile, exporters with foreign currency denominated accounts (FCDAs) can retain
60 percent of earnings in these accounts. Other exporters of traditional products are
required to surrender 40 percent of earnings to commercial banks at the commercial bank
rate.




33
     Fuel levies have averaged to about 13 percent of total domestic revenues in the past three years.
34
  Paraffin consumption among the poor is now being substituted by cheaper alternatives for lighting
available in the market, i.e. cheap imports of lighting lamps and use of firewood for cooking.


                                                       54
                                                               Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

153. The analysis on the impact of timely exchange rate unification on tobacco
farmers (Table 5) shows that in Malawi there are over 400,000 tobacco growing
households, out of which over 220,000 are among the poorest 60 percent. The
liberalization of the exchange rate has allowed tobacco growers to recover part of the
welfare loss associated with exchange rate liberalization, via the additional income in
Kwacha. In fact, as illustrated in Table 5, the amelioration of the loss in purchasing
power should be particularly strong among the poorest households. Specifically, the
timely exchange rate liberalization, have provided the poorest 20 percent of tobacco
growing households with an opportunity to recover about 68 percent of the welfare loss.
The share reduces gradually with wealth levels, and the average recovery rate is about 32
percent.

154. On average a smallholder tobacco farmer normally grows up to one hectare,
which produces 1,200 kgs translating to 12 bales with an average bale weight of 100
kgs. In 2012, the national selling average price for tobacco is estimated at an average of
US$2.12 per kg.35 In the absence of a liberalized exchange rate, the net earnings to
tobacco farmer would have been at about MWK160,483, but with the unification of the
exchange rate, the net earnings to a farmer are estimated at about MWK 252,393 after
deductions (i.e. levies for grower associations, auction fees, the GoM‘s withholding tax,
transport costs etc).

   While the tobacco market has witnessed a 35 percent reduction in tobacco production from last year, the
average prices offered on the auction floors this season are much higher (US$0.80 per kg versus US$2 per
kg). The 2011 tobacco marketing season was characterized by low prices due to over production (237,000
MT produced versus market demand of 165,000 MT) and poor quality tobacco leaf leading to high
rejection rates.

155. The GoM also intends to review the Tobacco Act with a view to encourage a
more integrated development of the tobacco supply chain. The approach will rely on
promoting quality and tractability through contract farming where tobacco producers
received inputs, quality seeds and technical advice from the tobacco industry. While the
sector‘s dominance in the economy is expected to remain in the medium term, the GoM
is fully committed to encourage export diversification into other non-traditional crops. In
2011/2012, it launched an ambitious cotton development program that will be continued
next year along with further investments in other crop and livestock productions
(groundnuts, soybeans and dairy).

RRDPG Prior Action 4: Directive from Reserve Bank of Malawi mandating
exporters, including tobacco farmers, to transfer earnings in US dollars obtained at
the tobacco auction floors to commercial banks at prevailing market determined
exchange rate.

Expected Results: Smallholder farmers’ earnings pegged to the US dollars are
exchanged at market determined exchange rate by June 2013 as evidenced by the
increase in net earnings to an average farmer from MWK 160,483, to about MWK
252,393 after exchange rate liberalization.


2.     Protecting the vulnerable groups while improving transparency of systems


156. The RRDPG will support the GoM‟s plans to scale up social safety net
interventions so as to cushion the most vulnerable groups from the negative effects of
the policies of the previous administration, including the loss of the value of the Kwacha.
This will be implemented through provision of cash via a scaled-up country-wide public
works program (including inputs for assets), provision of agriculture inputs and public
unconditional cash transfers.

       2a.     Labor Intensive Public Works Program

157. The 2012/13 national budget proposes to expand labour intensive public
works program (through MASAF, IRLADP and others), which will be implemented
country-wide, with the total coverage of about 700,000 households (see Attachments
B and C). Through MASAF, the beneficiaries would be able to work for twelve days in a
month for four months at a rate of MWK 300 per day up from the earlier daily rate of
MWK 200 per day. The project will cover about 2.9 million people representing over 20
percent of Malawians. Beneficiaries are expected to earn about MWK 14,400 each (or
MWK 3,600 per month equivalent to US$13.6) in 2012/13.

158. Through IRLADP, beneficiaries will be able to participate in more
productive „inputs for asset‟ initiative where they would be involved in the
construction of mini- and small scale irrigation schemes, as well as in rural roads

                                            56
                                               Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

work. Upon completion, the new infrastructure will generate long lasting benefits to
farmers and resilience to variable weather, increase food security and agriculture growth,
which will in turn increase their income and their ability to sustain themselves throughout
the year.



RRDPG Prior Action 5: Inclusion, through MoF, of a scaled-up36 labor intensive
public works (LIPW) program, designed to enhance the Recipient‟s safety net
programs, in the 2012/13 national budget.

Expected Results: An increase in ratio of total LIPW related expenditure to total
recurrent expenditure from 1.5 percent in 2011/12 to 6.5 percent by June 2013, and
expanded coverage of beneficiaries from 311,807 households, to 700,000 households by
June 2013.


          2b.     Farm Input Subsidy Program

159. The RRDPG will support the GoM‟s efforts to cushion the most vulnerable
groups affected by the dry spells in the Southern Region. The objective of this reform
is to strengthen social protection interventions and the resilience of the most vulnerable
groups to shocks. The plan is to expand the FISP by additional 100,000 beneficiaries in
2012/13 from 1.4 million farming families covered in 2011/12. The budgetary allocations
for logistics have also been adjusted upwards to reflect the increase in coverage and fuel
price adjustments. This will ensure timely delivery of fertilizer to smallholders and in
turn contribute toward increased food production. This slight increase is seen by the GoM
as a way to help poor farmers recover from dry spells that occurred during last cropping
season in some areas and minimize the impact of currency exchange rate liberalization on
fertilizer prices. The expanded FISP will include more legumes which will also enhance
the nutritional status of households and increase incomes for households.

160. The support for the expansion of FISP under this operation is premised on
the fact that this is an established program that was easily scalable, with potential of
reaching more farming families, and that once the mitigation measures are
implemented in 2012/13, it will be evaluated for its impact. Stronger connection
between FISP and farm yields needs to be established and a good monitoring system
developed to evaluate the impact of FISP on yields.

161. With FISP representing a significant expenditure of the GoM‟s budget at
over 3 percent of GDP and over 60 percent of Ministry of Agriculture‟s budget,
urgent action is needed to improve the management, the effectiveness and efficiency
of this program by ensuring that it does not crowd out other important interventions
such as extension services and research and development. In order to further improve the
transparency and targeting of the FISP, the GoM will continue to work with civil society
organizations, community leaders and Anti-Corruption clubs that have been established.
Policy dialogue with the GoM will continue on the future of the FISP and the need for
phased reduction of the program. The planned agriculture PER supported by the Bank to
be launched soon should also contribute to these discussions.

RRDPG Prior Action 6: Inclusion, through MoF, of a scaled up Farm Input Subsidy
Program (FISP) in the 2012/13 national budget.

Expected Results: An increase in ratio of total fertilizer and seeds subsidy related
expenditure to total recurrent expenditure from 7.5 percent in 2011/12, to over 12
percent by June 2013, and expanded coverage of beneficiaries from 1.4 million
households in 2011/12, to 1.5 million households by June 2013.


       2c.     Improve Economic Management of FISP

162. The RRDPG will provide support to the GoM‟s efforts to improve economy,
efficiency, and value for money in public procurement by institutionalizing annual
procurement audits for FISP in the GoM‟s systems. The objective is to improve
economic management of FISP and ensure efficiency of the FISP program, especially in
use of budgetary resources and transparency in the contract award process. This reform is
operationalizing the GoM‘s commitment to mainstream procurement review process into
annual audits, which would now be conducted by the National Audit Office (NAO) so as
to strengthen ownership and transparency in public procurement. It is expected that this
action will contribute to improved value for money and transparency in public
procurement processes, including FISP.

163. Until early last year, the Bank used to carry out joint procurement reviews
with the GoM with the last joint review covering the 2010/11 fertilizer procurement
under FISP. This action therefore represents a continuation of reforms that were
supported under the PRSC I-III series, which aimed at improving the efficiency of FISP
given the huge fiscal risks and the high visibility of the program. FISP has been a major
program in the agricultural sector covering over 60 percent of the total agriculture budget.
The fiscal cost for the FISP has been high averaging at 3 percent of GDP over the past
five years, with an overshoot of 6.1 percent of GDP in 2008/09, which reflected high
global fertilizer prices and a close to 40 percent increase in fertilizer quantity above the
approved level in the budget.



                                            58
                                              Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

164. While progress continues to be made in the fertilizer procurement under
FISP, weaknesses still remain. These include the following weaknesses: the award
criteria used in the bidding documents do not ensure value for money; currency of the bid
and payment provision are not respected; and the quantity allocation criteria based on
unit prices as well as contract award process (e.g. roles of the Evaluation Committees and
Internal Procurement Committees) are not adhered to Malawi‘s procurement procedures..

165. To date, the focus of the GoM has been on financial audits for FISP, and
several financial audit reports have been presented to Parliament for discussions.
This operation will therefore support the first procurement audit for FISP, which should
help bring out some of the generic procurement management problems that need to be
addressed. For instance, some of the arrears accumulated by the GoM‘s ministries,
departments and agencies (see paragraph 146) over the past four to five years are related
to non-compliance of public procurement rules and procedures. It is expected that the
planned audit will help bring out in public some of the systemic procurement problems
pertaining to FISP.


RRDPG Prior Action 7: Institutionalization of the policy to undertake procurement
audits of FISP as recommended in the Joint GoM/World Bank Fertilizer
Procurement Review Report on the 2010/11 FISP.

Expected Results: FISP procurement audit report submitted to Parliament by June 2013.

VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                               A.        POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

166. The RRDPG has been designed to mitigate the impact of the policies of the
previous administration and the impact of exchange rate liberalization on the most
vulnerable groups. The overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework has included
significant reallocation of expenditures, which has created fiscal space for increased social
protection and agriculture expenditures. Reforms to scale up and strengthen the social
protection interventions while maintaining targeting efficiency have had the greatest effect on
supporting incomes of the poor over the course of the economic downturn (see paragraph 56,
41). Reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and growth rebound are expected to be the
driving force behind improved living standards in the medium term. However, the prior
actions on fuel pricing reforms are not expected to be neutral on income distribution.

167. The RRDPG builds on the recent analysis carried out by the Bank on the
impact of price changes between 2007 and 2011, which highlighted the fact that
prices have been on a rise, with urban areas standing out as the most affected
relative to rural areas. This is particularly due to high food price inflation that is notably
strong in urban areas since 2005. Housing/utilities have had relatively higher rates of
increase in rural areas, with a tendency towards some convergence in recent years.
Increases in transport prices have been quite similar although urban transport costs have
been steeply rising since 2008 likely due to increases in world fuel prices. While the
impact of exchange rate liberalization is expected to be muted by the fact that most
imports were already riced at the much more depreciated parallel market exchange rate,
the exchange rate liberalization has triggered adjustments in retail prices of petroleum
products, which will have ripple effects on other prices, including transport and food
prices. However, the expanded social protection interventions, such as public works,
input for assets program, and gains in real earnings to tobacco farmers should help
cushion some of the impacts.37

168. Welfare and distributional impact assessment of unification of the exchange rate
indicates that existing social protection programs play an important role in preventing
people from falling into poverty, in particular into extreme poverty. Simulations show
that in the absence of any social protection programs, moderate poverty would have been 65
percent higher than the actual figures reported in 2010. Moreover, extreme poverty would

  Higher domestic prices for petroleum products will affect household real incomes through two channels.
First, there are direct effects from an increase in the prices by households for consumption of petroleum
products (e.g. paraffin or petrol for private transport), and second, there are indirect effects from increases
in prices of other goods and services (e.g. higher prices for food, transportation and electricity
consumption) consumed by households as producers pass on the higher costs of fuel inputs. (IMF
WP/07/71)


                                                     60
                                                Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

have been more than four times higher. The study pointed to social programs (e.g. cash
transfers) that could be scaled up, should the GoM take up the option of rolling out these
reforms immediately to take advantage of the positive social gains of unification at the onset
of the tobacco sales season. With approximately 420,000 households in Malawi growing and
selling tobacco the unification of the exchange rate has cushioned some of the impact on
incomes of these households.

169.    The proposed social protection interventions take cognizant of the fact that in
rural Malawi around a quarter of households are headed by females, and these
households tend to be poorer than male-headed households. Interventions such as school
conditional cash transfer program currently implemented by the GoM, with support from
DPs, has resulted in closing gender gaps in primary education and improved gender parity for
the higher standards. Therefore, female-headed households, the elderly, child-headed
households and the destitute would be the main beneficiaries of the social protection
interventions supported by this operation. Farming families involved in tobacco farming,
including women, will also benefit.

170. Improvements in the procurement of fertilizer under the FISP, which has a
huge fiscal cost, will also help the GoM ensure value for money in the program. Since
the program targets poor and vulnerable farmers, it is expected that these improvements
would strengthen the national food security and reduce vulnerability to hunger. The other
policy measures supported by this operation, geared towards improving transparency and
accountability in the use of public resources, will also help reduce wastage of public
resources and maximize the impact of the MGDS –related pro-poor spending.

                             B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

171. The policy actions supported by this DPO are not expected to cause significant
effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources of Malawi. The reforms
under Inputs for Assets and LIPW programs are addressed in Attachments B and C. In
general, experts observe that while the regulatory framework on the environment in Malawi
is broadly aligned with international standards for the level of economic development of
Malawi, the implementation of this framework can be strengthened.


172. The conclusion of an environmental assessment of the proposed reforms,
undertaken as per the requirements of OP 8.60, is that the reforms are not likely to
have a significant environmental impact. Economic governance reforms should lead to
more efficient use of public resources, which may indirectly generate environmental benefits
in the form of better use of modern technologies. As part of the environmental assessment,
the Bank has also reviewed the possible impact of the RRDPG reforms on the procurement
of fertilizers, but found that the negative environmental impact of this reform is likely to be
minimal.



                                              61
                                              Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant



               C.     IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

173. Implementation entity. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) will be responsible for
overall implementation of RRDPG, as well as for reporting progress and coordinating actions
among other concerned ministries and agencies. The MoF has experience in coordinating and
implementing DPO-supported programs as evidenced by the implementation of the PRSC I-
III.

174. The institutional arrangements for the preparation and execution of the
RRDPG fall within the framework of the CABS. On the GoM‘s side, the CABS are
served by Secretariats which are situated in the Debt and Aid Division of the Ministry of
Finance. The Secretariats coordinate preparation of PAF Priority Action Plans,
implementation, assessment, and revision. For these activities, the Secretariats mobilize
sector experts in various ministries and departments (see paragraph 137).

175. There is a need to improve further the monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
system of the country. The general M&E system has improved in recent years with room
for further improvements. The MGDS II has provided more information on many of the
indicators, although the framework still needs to be improved in terms of the quality of
the indicators and its linkages to other sectoral M&E frameworks. Monitoring and
Evaluation of the MGDS II is coordinated by the M&E Division in the Ministry of
Economic Development and Planning. An M&E master plan and road map to its
implementation were approved in 2005. Implementation of the road map is being
supported by a joint program of support with basket funding from the European
Commission, DFID, and UNDP. Under the program, M&E officers have been recruited,
trained and deployed in all district councils of the country. This will improve collection
of data from the field for monitoring the MGDS II. M&E divisions have also been
established in most line ministries, and economists will also be deployed in all line
ministries to be responsible for monitoring of implementation of the MGDS II in their
respective ministries.

176. Program monitoring. Progress against RRDPG targets will be monitored by Bank
staff during the course of the year through biannual reviews within CABS framework and
staff mission, especially under the social safety net pillar. Following previous successful
budget operations, the review of the program objectives will be based on relevant and easy-
to-monitor indicators (Annex 2). In addition, the proposed operation will also benefit from
the monitoring system of the soon to be approved IMF ECF program, notably on the
macroeconomic performance. An Implementation Completion Results Report (ICR) will be
issued within six months from closing date of June 30, 2013.

                               D.     FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

177. Public financial management system. Malawi‘s fiduciary framework is adequate
overall to receive the proceeds of the grant. The GoM, in close collaboration with

                                            62
                                                          Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

development partners, has developed a medium-term Public Finance and Economic
Management Reform Program (PFEM-RP) 2011/12-2013/14. The PFEM-RP is designed to
further advance the pace of public financial management reforms in Malawi. The PFEM-RP
covers a broad range of areas that include planning and policy analysis, resource
mobilization, budgeting, procurement, accounting and financial management, cash and debt
management, parastatal financing, reporting, auditing, and PFEMRP administration. A Multi-
Donor Trust Fund to operationalize the PFEM-RP is managed by the Bank.


Box 3: Public Financial Management Assessment, 2011 – Major Findings (extract from PEFA report)

Credibility of the budget: The period as a whole was characterized by persistent over-spending in comparison
to original budget which contrasts with the previous three years each of which reported under-spending. On the
revenue side actual revenue was consistently above budget, as it had been in the previous three years.
Therefore, the credibility of the budget is called into question - this time in terms of its ability to provide a
reliable indication of the GoM‘s resource envelope.

Comprehensiveness and transparency: Though Malawi scores well in a number of areas associated with
comprehensiveness and transparency, various issues remain - Treasury Funds are not reported in the Estimates
and only appear in the Annual Appropriation Accounts as net figures. There is significant room for
improvement in terms of public access to key fiscal information.

Policy-based budgeting: While the orderliness of the annual budget process has improved relative to the last
PEFA assessment, challenges lie ahead in terms of alignment of MTEF with the new priorities in the MGDS II.

Predictability and control in budget execution: Reforms are ongoing in the Malawi Revenue Authority. The
Ministry of Finance has improved the cash management process. Debt management and payroll system are
being operated efficiently. The Procurement system continues to be unable to provide statistics with regard to
the implementation and comprehensiveness of competitiveness in public procurement. The IFMIS rollout
process has been concluded to the central government and 22 Local Authorities. Although awareness seems to
be rising with regards to internal control, the evidence does not yet support the finding of improved control and
internal audit procedures and processes being implemented and taking effect.

Accounting, recording and reporting: Progress in the period under review has featured the improved
timeliness of the closure of the accounts and the production of the financial statement for audit. Also, in-year
budget execution reports are produced on a timely basis and with some improvements in quality. However,
management information at service delivery units stills needs to improve. A serious control concern identified
is the backlog in bank reconciliations since July 2010. Timely bank reconciliation is an essential discipline in
the ongoing checking and verification of accounting practices across the GoM and it also provides assurance as
to the integrity of data used for reporting.

External scrutiny and audit: The period covered by this assessment has seen a backlog of external audits and
Public Accounts Committee (PAC) scrutiny cleared. However, there are still weaknesses in the actions and
follow up based on the recommendations of the National Audit Office (NAO) and PAC. In summary, NAO and
PAC scrutiny has been characterized by periods when there has been no public scrutiny followed by intense
activity to clear backlogs. With respect to the Parliamentary Finance Committee, there is more opportunity for
scrutiny of the draft budget than of budget execution.



178. Four Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments
have been conducted in recent years, i.e. in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2011. The 2011

                                                       63
                                              Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

PEFA assessment, which found a number of improvements since 2008, was based on an
analysis of performance for the years from 2007-08 to 2009-11. Selected areas where
improvements have been made include cash management process, orderliness of the
annual budget process, debt management and payroll system, debt and guarantees,
effectiveness of internal audit, quality and timeliness of annual financial statements, and
legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law. The assessment reported that regardless of
progress made, weaknesses remain on the credibility of budget (in terms of its ability to
provide a reliable indication of the GoM resource envelope); internal control;
comprehensiveness and transparency-Treasury Funds are not reported in the Estimates
and only appear in the Annual Appropriation Accounts as net figures and public access to
key fiscal information; timeliness of follow-up on audit recommendations and backlog in
bank reconciliations. The PFEM-RP has taken into account the weaknesses identified in
the PEFA 2011 report in order to ensure overall strengthening of the PFM. The budget is
also publicly available as per guidance on budget transparency in 2011.

179. On audit follow up, all audit reports submitted to Parliament for years ended
in June 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 have been scrutinized and discussed by the
Public Accounts Committee (PAC). This implies that PAC is current in terms of
scrutinizing all the reports that were submitted including a Treasury Minute for the year
ended June 2004. However, the GoM is aware of the backlog of Treasury Minutes which
were mainly due to the absence of the Auditor General and irregular Public Accounts
Committee (PAC) meetings due to funding challenges. Since the appointment of the
Auditor General a backlog of audit reports has been cleared. With increased funding to
Parliament, PAC is able to meet more regularly to scrutinize audit reports. The GoM has
recently submitted a Treasury Minute for 2005 to 2007 financial years to Parliament. The
GoM will step up its efforts to work on more recent Treasury Minutes and make
necessary follow ups with controlling officers who have been identified to have issues.

180. The 2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) found that
public procurement accounted for 16.2 percent of GDP in 2002, that corruption in
procurement was widespread, capacity low and sanctions for corrupt practices were
not effective. The GoM has, in response, attempted to comprehensively address these
weaknesses. A new Public Procurement Act, based on international procurement
standards became operational in 2004 with the establishment of the Office of the Director
of Public Procurement (ODPP), headed by a Director and Deputy Director appointed by
the President and approved by the Public Appointments Committee of Parliament. ODPP
has policy, standards and monitoring functions and does not procure. It has supervisory
oversight of a decentralized procurement system that has been receiving intensive support
from the World Bank, UNDP and USAID since 2006. While challenges remain, there
have been significant advances in moving the public procurement system towards
acceptable standards.

181. Foreign exchange environment. Under the Fund‘s safeguards assessment policy,
the Central Bank of Malawi was subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the
ECF arrangement approved on February 19, 2010. From the assessment, which was

                                            64
                                                Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

completed on May 28, 2010, the principal safeguard concern was on the lack of autonomy of
the RBM. Other areas of vulnerability included internal audit and internal controls. While the
RBM foreign reserves management functions have strengthened since the 2008 assessment
by updating Foreign Reserves Management Policy (RMP) and incorporating comprehensive
reserves management guidelines, oversight of the foreign reserves management remains
insufficient as analysis and evaluation of the in-house managed portfolio is not documented
and analytical reports are not provided to Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) to
facilitate effective oversight. Measures to strengthen the legal and control framework and to
help safeguard Fund resources were agreed with the authorities. Priority action was for
ALCO to review monthly analytical reports regarding the in-house managed foreign reserves
portfolio and for the foreign currency reserves managed by the Treasury to be regularly and
independently verified with such reports to be provided to Internal Audit Department (IAD).
Some recommendations have been implemented, including submission of the RBM Bill to
Parliament in November 2010 addressing vulnerabilities identified in the 2008 safeguard
assessment. Implementation of these recommendations is being monitored by Fund staff.

Assurance Requirements

182. Due to the fiduciary risks associated with the program, additional fiduciary
arrangements shall apply to this operation. An audit of the flows in and out of the
dedicated Foreign Currency Account of the GoM held with the Central Bank of Malawi will
be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to IDA within 4 months after the end of
the fiscal year and the audit report shall be submitted to IDA within 6 months of the end of
the fiscal year. The Terms of Reference of the audit agreed at negotiation will include with
respect to the Foreign Currency Account held with the Central Bank of Malawi, a full
assurance that the withdrawals from the account were indeed (i) reflected in the budget
management and accounting records, and (ii) transferred in local currency to the
Consolidated Account of the GoM.

                               E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

183. A single-tranche of SDR 33.20 million (US$50 million equivalent) will be
disbursed upon grant effectiveness and following the Recipient‟s request for
withdrawal of proceeds of the grant. The proposed grant will follow the Bank‘s standard
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. The grant will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any
specific purchases. Once the operation is approved by the Board and becomes effective, and
upon receipt of a withdrawal application signed by an authorized signatory, the proceeds of
the grant will be deposited by IDA in a US Dollar account designated by the GoM at the
Central Bank of Malawi and will form part of the official foreign exchange reserves of
Malawi. Within two working days, the Central Bank of Malawi will credit the Malawian
kwacha equivalent of the grant proceeds to the consolidated account maintained on behalf of
the GoM for budget execution. The conversion from the foreign currency to the local
currency will be based on the prevailing exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited
to the budget management system. The Central Bank of Malawi will not impose any charges

                                             65
                                                 Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

or commissions on the Recipient for these transactions. The Recipient will: (a) provide
confirmation to the Bank within 30 days that an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds
from the Bank has been credited in the Recipient‘s budget management system, with an
indication of the exchange rate applied; (b) provide evidence that the Malawian Kwacha
equivalent of the grant proceeds was recorded as financing the GoM budget; and (c) ensure
that the Malawian Kwacha equivalent of the grant proceeds are subject to effective controls
sufficient to ensure its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only as per the Financing
Agreement.

184. If the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to promptly upon notice from
IDA refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded
to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this grant will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.

185. The use of the Malawian Kwacha equivalent of grant proceeds to support
budgetary expenditures will be subject to audit by the Auditor General as provided for
by the Malawian Constitution. The Bank will have access to these audit reports.

                                G. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

186. Shortfalls in donor support could have a deterring impact on economic growth,
as they could weaken the balance of payments and widen the external financing gap and
could force the authorities to borrow domestically, which is not in line with the fiscal
adjustment path currently being pursued. Given the low level of official reserves and
significant import needs, this would put enormous pressure on what already is a tough
fiscal adjustment process and could undermine fiscal sustainability and/or jeopardize
necessary social and capital expenditures. These risks are mitigated by a number of
factors. First, the authorities have already undertaken measures to repair relations with
DPs and intend to address governance and human rights concerns. Second, the authorities
are committed to a prudent fiscal stance and a flexible exchange rate policy, which
provide key anchors for external and debt sustainability. Third, predictable and timely
budget support, backed by analytical support (i.e. programmatic public expenditure
reviews) and policy dialogue through the future DPO series and good-will from DPs to
aid the GoM‘s ongoing medium-term fiscal consolidation program, will also help
mitigate the risks. A new 3-year (ECF) supported program for Malawi is expected to be
presented to the IMF Board in July 2012. This should pave way for resumption of budget
support by most CABS DPs.

187. Political risk. The current administration, in power since early April 2012, has
embarked on bold reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and is committed to
maintain prudent macroeconomic policies. However, the risk might arise from tensions
between political pressures to expand the GoM programs and the need to maintain a
prudent fiscal stance with a view to keeping inflation pressures at bay as well as


                                              66
                                                Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

preserving debt sustainability. This is mitigated by the GoM efforts to build support for
policy reforms supported by this operation. Other risk mitigation measures such as
change management, ‗just-in-time-reports‘ and in-depth political economy analysis could
be provided by the Bank on demand.

188. Social tensions. The consequences of some of the economic policies of the
previous administration and adjustments that are taking place in the economy could lead
to further upward pressure on consumer prices and erosion of consumer purchasing
power, which could raise social tensions. In addition, increases in fuel prices could result
in second round effects on prices of other products leading to further tensions. Domestic
tensions could affect investor and consumer confidence, which would constrain further
private investment. There will be a need for the GoM to engage all key stakeholders to
rally support for reforms and help stakeholders understand their consequences and
manage expectations. In addition, the GoM‘s efforts on enhancing social inclusion,
through education, health and social protection programs is expected to offset potential
social tensions.

189. Implementation capacity risks. The GoM‘s capacity to massively scale up social
safety net programs could be overstretched. This could delay the implementation of the
programs supported by this operation and lead to low utilization of available resources
and insufficient coverage of beneficiaries. Given the fact that DPs are financing a large
part of the social protection interventions and the fact that programs being scaled up have
existing institutional structures and skilled personnel, especially for labor intensive public
works, this risk will be minimized.

  Mr. Robert Zoellick
  President
  The World Bank Group
  1818 H. Street N.W
  Washington D.C 20433
  United States of America

  Dear Mr Zoellick,

  MALAWI: LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

1.       On behalf of the Government of Malawi, I write to request for a Rapid Response
  Development Policy Grant (RRDPG) of US$50 million from the International
  Development Association (IDA). The RRDPG will help the Government to restore
  macro-economic balance and implement an economic recovery program in the
  forthcoming 2012/13 budget and the comprehensive response package of 2012.

2.        Since the Government went off track an IMF sponsored ECF program in 2010,
  the economy has experienced huge macro imbalances which have reduced the growth
  prospects of the economy. The proposed RRDPG will help the Government among other
  things to address the following issues: (i) restore macro-economic stability, (ii) improve
  functioning of the petroleum market; (iii) improve functioning of export markets; (iv)
  strengthen social protection intervention and the resilience of the most vulnerable groups
  to shocks; and (v) improve economic governance of the Farm Input Subsidy Program. On
  the macro-economic front the Government will continue with reforms aimed at regaining


                                             68
                                               Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

  macro-balance and return to a market based economy. Since April 2012, when the new
  President assumed leadership of the country, Government has implemented some of the
  most difficult macro-economic reforms including the liberalization of the foreign
  exchange market which was considered as socially undesirable. Thus, the RRDPG being
  sought from the Bank will help the Government to manage the effects of this policy
  reform and restore macro-economic balance. Under social protection, the Government
  will continue with reforms in the design, targeting, implementation and coordination of
  social protection programs. In implementation of the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP)
  the Government will continue with reforms that will enhance transparency of the program
  beneficiaries as well as pursuing a transparent and economic system for procurement and
  distribution of the inputs to minimize its impact on the fiscus. The Government will
  conduct annual audit of the procurement system for the inputs and publish results of
  tender and audit on its website and daily papers for public consumption. With regard to
  Public Finance Management, the Government has developed a reform program which is
  aimed at consolidating some of the PFM reforms that were initiated in the last three
  years. More details on the proposed reforms to be supported under RRDPG are set out in
  Part C of this letter.

  A.     Recent Macroeconomic Performance

3.         Malawi experienced uninterrupted solid growth from 2006 – 2010 with real GDP
  growth averaging 7.5 percent, compared to 2 percent for 1999 – 2004, amid a decline in
  inflation to mid-single digits. This robust growth was supported by sound economic
  policies. In addition to positive macroeconomic environment, good weather and the
  fertilizer subsidy program made significant contributions to agriculture growth. However,
  persistent external imbalances compounded by the reduced donor inflows, low tobacco
  proceeds coupled with other supply side bottlenecks contributed to the weakening of
  macroeconomic performance over the last two years. This in turn contributed to a
  widening of balance of payment and budget gaps and slowdown in economic activity. An
  off-track International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program
  and governance concerns adversely affected budget support.

4.       There has been progress in the recent discussions with the IMF for a new ECF.
  Negotiations with the IMF on the new ECF are ongoing, and it is expected that an
  agreement will be reached by June 2012. Once an agreement is reached on a program, the
  Fund will issue an assessment letter that will signal a credible macroeconomic framework
  and provide comfort to Development Partners in order for them to unlock budget support.

5.        Regaining macroeconomic balance will be anchored on fiscal consolidation,
  restoration of external balances, and realignment of the exchange rate regime to one that
  is credible to all market players. To this end, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) has
  liberalized the exchange rate regime. The official exchange rate has been devalued from
  K167 to K250 per United States Dollar; freeing of bureau market i.e. returning to pre-
  August 2011 conditions whereby exchange bureaus determined their own mid-rate;
  cancellation of the requirement to screen imports in excess of US$50,000 as commercial

                                             69
                                                 Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

  banks have now been capacitated to screen import orders;. The RBM has also reversed
  the requirements for tobacco dollars to be remitted to the Central Bank and henceforth
  tobacco proceeds will go to commercial banks.

6.       As the Government is embarking on these reforms it will be necessary to have a
  reserve cushion for timely intervention in the foreign exchange market, the RRDPG will
  be neccessary in this aspect. Furthermore, foreign exchange reserves are required to clear
  outstanding foreign exchange bill arrears, for Malawi to jump-start its growth.

7.        The fiscal anchor for the 2012/12 budget will be zero net domestic financing and
  government is expected to pursue tight fiscal stance but at the same time ensure
  prioritization of the social sectors. Due to the recent economic challenges that the country
  was facing in terms of foreign exchange shortages, fuel scarcity and power disruptions,
  growth in 2011 was revised downwards from 6 percent as earlier projected to 4.3 percent.
  In 2012, the economy is estimated to grow by 4.9 percent down from an earlier projection
  of 6.5 percent. The average inflation for 2011 was 7.6 percent but it is projected to 18.4
  percent

8.        Domestic debt has accumulated to 17 percent of GDP as at end of 2012,
  increasing from 14 percent that was recorded in March 2011. The overall fiscal deficit,
  including grants, is projected to increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to 7.0
  percent in 2011/12. The increase is primarily due to fiscal slippages and the freeze of
  budget support due to the economic mismanagement which led to the suspension of our
  Extended Credit Facility with the IMF. The deficit is expected to fall to approximately
  1.1 percent of GDP in 2012. The ratio of the current account deficit to GDP worsened
  from -1.3 percent in 2010 to -5.9 percent in 2011. As at 20th April 2012, the Official
  Reserves stood at US$132.2 million which is equivalent to one month of import cover. Of
  these gross reserves US$ 38.4 million were encumbered, implying that only US$ 93.7
  million would be freely usable.

9.        Our forecast for 2012 point to a 4.9 percent growth in real GDP while inflation is
  projected to average 15 percent reflecting the recent monetary policy reforms which
  include the 49 percent devaluation of the kwacha. The slowdown in the expected real
  GDP growth in 2012 is largely attributed to reduced agriculture output. Tobacco
  production declined because of lower tobacco auction prices in the 2010/11 growing
  season as well as s dry spells experienced in some parts of the country at the beginning of
  the growing season. The overall fiscal deficit in 2012 is projected at 3 percent of GDP.
  Inflation will be kept in check, supported by increased food production through
  intensified agriculture, tight fiscal and monetary policies aimed at reducing aggregate
  demand and controlled broad money growth. Domestic revenues are projected to average
  22 percent of GDP in the medium term. The share of Government expenditure to GDP is
  however projected to remain virtually unchanged at an average of 32 percent of GDP
  between 2011 and 2015.



                                              70
                                                 Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

10.        Government‘s macroeconomic management will however, face a number of
   challenges, including the need for continued expenditure controls, intermittent power
   supply, erratic weather conditions and the need to reduce public debt arising mostly from
   non-performing state-owned enterprises. Government, therefore, remains committed to
   sound macro-economic management and will continue with the current program of
   structural and public sector reforms.

   B.     The Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II)

11.       The Government of Malawi finalized its third poverty reduction strategy, the
   MGDS II, which covers the period 2011 to 2016 and it was prepared using participatory
   processes. The strategy's overall objective is wealth creation through sustainable
   economic growth and infrastructure development. It is organized around six thematic
   areas as follows: (i) sustainable economic growth; (ii) social support and disaster risk
   management; (iii) social development; (iv) infrastructure development; (v) good
   governance and (vi) gender and capacity development.

12.       From these thematic areas, the strategy has identified nine key focus areas that are
   seen as central to achieving the strategy's overall objective of wealth creation. The focus
   areas are agriculture and food security; energy, industrial development, mining and
   tourism; transport infrastructure and Nsanje World inland port; education, science and
   technology; public health, sanitation, malaria and HIV and AIDS management; integrated
   rural development; green belt irrigation and water development; child development,
   youth development and empowerment; climate change, natural resources and
   environmental management.

13.        The MGDS emphasizes the need for Malawi to register sustained private sector
   and export-led growth in order to make a noticeable dent on poverty. The long-term
   vision of the MGDS is to transform Malawi from a predominantly importing and
   consuming country into a predominantly producing and exporting country. The strategy
   concentrates on agriculture as the driver of growth. It focuses on increasing agricultural
   productivity and integrating smallholder farmers into commercial activities. In the long
   term, the Government has also identified four sectors with potential for high growth:
   tourism, mining, manufacturing, and agro-processing. The MGDS also acknowledges the
   role of health, education, economic empowerment and social protection among others. It
   recognizes that a healthy and educated population is necessary if Malawi is to achieve
   sustainable economic growth. The strategy further recognizes the importance of
   increasing the assets of the poor and vulnerable so that they can contribute to and benefit
   from economic growth.

14.        The strategy has identified long-term goals, medium-term outcomes, and
   constraints to achieving these outcomes. It then outlines the strategies and key actions
   that will contribute towards achieving the defined outcomes. Implementation of the
   strategies and actions will entail undertaking capital investments, maintenance of assets,
   and implementation of policy and institutional reforms. However, in this endeavour,

                                               71
                                                 Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

   Malawi is faced with the challenge of mobilizing resources to implement the MGDS II.
   Although various strategies and actions have been prioritized, there exists a financing gap
   for the Government to implement even the top priorities, and hence this request for
   financing.

   C.     Specific Reforms to be implemented

15.        In line with its macro-economic recovery program the Government in
   consultation with its Development Partners has outlined its proposed medium-term
   support to Malawi. In this context, I would like to highlight the various reforms that the
   Government of MalawiGoM intends to undertake not just for purposes of the proposed
   RRDPG to which this financing request directly relates, but also under subsequent DPG
   so as to present a holistic picture of the Government's reform program. The first priority
   will be to restore macro-economic stability, coming from a background of huge external
   imbalances, shortage of foreign exchange which crippled the private sector, the
   Government primary goal will be restore macro-economic stability.

   Market reforms

16.        In order to address the challenges that affected the tobacco prices in the 2009-
   2011 period, the Government of Malawi from the 2011/12 growing season implemented
   crop size management strategy whereby growers were allocated quota based on average
   production for the previous three years‘ production to meet demand. Growers were
   registered using biometrics system with the purpose of establishing legitimate farmers.
   For example, clubs were allocated a minimum of 1,300 kgs of tobacco and a maximum of
   10,000 kgs while estates were allocated a minimum of 1,500 kgs. This strategy has
   started giving dividends since it has helped in improving quality of the tobacco leaf as
   well as improved the prices offered at the auction floors.

17.        The Government of Malawi has started the process of reviewing the Tobacco Act
   with the aim of incorporating issues and other recent developments in the tobacco sector.
   The process is at an advanced stage and is being done in collaboration with Tobacco
   Control Commission and relevant stakeholders. Among other things being considered is
   the inclusion of the Integrated Production System. With regard to contract farming which
   is being seen as one way of addressing the supply side of the output markets, the
   Government developed a Contract Farming Strategy for Malawi in 2007. Thereafter, a
   consultancy was commissioned to assess the initial draft and based on the findings, it was
   noted that the draft lacked comprehensive elements of a contract farming strategy
   including contract provisions for other crops other than tobacco. The Ministry has so far
   included contract provisions for other crops and it is in the process of incorporating the
   other issues that were spelt out in the study.




                                               72
                                                 Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

   Fuel Pricing Strategy

18.        For the last three years the Government has been intervening on the fuel market
   through the use of the fuel stabilisation fund whose primary aim was to smoothen effects
   of sudden fuel increases on the world market. This policy worked very well in a regime
   of managed foreign exchange market. Following the policy shift from a managed to a
   liberalised foreign exchange market, the Government‘s ability to intervene on the fuel
   market through use of the Fuel Stabilisation Fund is not feasible any more. Since the
   foreign exchange market has been liberalised, the Government has now adopted an
   automatic fuel pricing policies which will be informed movements of the oil prices on the
   world market, the ruling exchange rate and inflation. This policy will help fuel importers
   and retailers to recover their costs and ensure that they get good return on their capital.

   Agriculture Output markets

19.        Having well functioning output markets is the ultimate goal of the Government,
   since they will ensure that farmers get appropriate return on their output. However the
   Government realizes that issues of overproduction and incidences of non tobacco related
   materials affected prices. With regard to maize exports, government move to stop export
   licenses for maize is a disincentive to commercial farming. The Government will
   however ensure that food security objectives are well balanced against commercial
   interest. Given low literacy levels of most smallholder farmers the Government will
   continue to issue minimum prices for agriculture prices which are there to simply guide
   the farmers when negotiating for better prices with buyers.. Better market intelligence
   will help farmers to improve their production and marketing decisions.. We also believe
   the private sector has a critical role to play in development of the agriculture output
   markets. Therefore the main policy thrust will be to encourage greater participation of the
   private sector in the output markets. Increased private sector investment in trading will
   improve availability of markets. Further, we believe that increased competition amongst
   private traders should result in better prices for farmers and lower consumer prices for
   food deficit households.

20.        Following the Operationalisation of commodity risk management strategy the
   Commodity Risk Management section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security
   is now fully operational. The Government will continue with the macro-weather
   insurance program to cushion the country against drought. The Government is also
   sensitizing local farmers to procure micro weather insurance from local insurance
   companies so that they can be cushioned against weather variations.

   Agriculture Input markets

21.       Agricultural production in Malawi is rainfall dependent. Due to changes in
   weather, agricultural production fluctuates between surpluses and deficits. Deficits have
   arisen mainly due to droughts. Low production in drought periods is made worse due to
   farmers‘ low access to improved inputs. On the other hand, surpluses have been achieved


                                               73

   due to government intervention in supply of agricultural input especially fertilizer and
   seed, and also due to good weather. Considering that Malawi faces acute shortage of
   land, increased use of modern inputs will remain a key strategy to improving agricultural
   productivity. At the same time, most Malawian farmers are poor and rely on smallholder
   farming. In the 2012/13 fiscal year the Government will continue with implementation of
   the Farm Input Subsidy Program, which will provide smallholder farmers with subsidized
   fertilizer, maize and legume seed. To minimize incidences of duplicate vouchers the
   Government has developed coupons with more secure features which make it very
   difficult for people to produce counterfeit one.

   Private Sector Development reforms

22.        Private sector development is constrained by several factors ranging from supply
   side constraints and bureaucratic bottlenecks. Studies by the World Bank, the
   Government and the Malawi Confederation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry have
   amply documented these constraints. The Government is committed to implementing
   reforms that will improve the business environment and promote private sector in the
   country. Energy constraints, unpredictable government policy, lengthy business processes
   and weak infrastructure have been cited as the major constraints to private sector
   development. In the quest to improve the business environment the Government is
   carrying out various reforms. The Government is strengthening institutions that will
   strengthen private property as well as those that facilitate business. In this area the
   Government has streamlined the regulatory environment for business in Malawi by
   reviewing and consolidating various business laws. In order to accelerate access to
   commercial justice the Government has operationalized commercial courts in the main
   business district of Blantyre and the administrative centre of the Government in
   Lilongwe. The Government is further improving services at the Registrar General
   Department and at the Land Registries to facilitate quick business registration and land
   transaction. Unlike in the past business registration and land transaction used to take
   years to complete and were manually operated but currently these processes have all been
   automated.

23.        Another aspect of the business reform program is the strengthening of institutions
   that facilitate private sector development. Following the enactment of the Malawi
   Investment and Trade Centre bill in 2011, Malawi Investment Promotion Agency (MIPA)
   and Malawi Export Promotion Council (MEPC) have merged into a one stop Malawi
   Investment and Trade Centre. The Government has also institutionalised the Public
   Private Dialogue forum within the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and
   Industry. The forum is there to facilitate regularly dialogue between the Government and
   the private sector. With regard to processing of the business and work permits, the
   Government has also automated the services at the Immigration Department. The
   automation will reduce the waiting period for business to access the results of the
   application in shorter period. Unlike in the past when applicants had to wait for ninety
   days to know the results of their application.

24.        Whilst the Government has done commendable work to address business
   registration and facilitation bottlenecks, challenges remain in the areas of power and
   water supply. Businesses are still experiencing frequent power loading shedding as well
   as water rationing. With regard to energy supply the Government is re-engaging the
   United States Government on the resumption of the MCC energy compact program. At
   the same time the Government is implementing an Energy Sector Support Program
   financing by the World Bank. This program will rehabilitate transmission lines, procure
   equipment and spare parts for the ageing energy grid. The project will also facilitate
   studies on new energy sources. With regard to water supply the Government is
   rehabilitating various water supply schemes in the country to reduce unaccounted for
   water. The Government is also developing new water sources in rural and urban areas.

   Social Protection and Human Development

25.         Social protection remains one of the priority areas of the Government. The
   Government has finalising its Social Protection Policy and it awaits Cabinet approval.
   With the new policy, Government will have a more coordinated approach in the
   implementation of social protection programs. Protecting the vulnerable groups in the
   wake of the recent economic policy reforms will be at the centre of the Government
   policy during the recovery period. With the help of the International Development
   Association the Government has prioritized its planned expenditures for health,
   education, agriculture and other pro-poor sectors so as to protect them against adverse
   cuts that would affect attainment of the e Millennium Development Goals in these areas.
   Most of the people in the country are poor and are vulnerable to various shocks including
   illness and loss of livelihoods in the wake of economic adjustment. The burden of coping
   with these shocks invariably falls on women, children and the elderly. The Government
   will therefore step in with program to mitigate negative effects of the economic
   adjustment program. First on the menu of the interventions being planned by the
   Government is the continuation of the Farm Input Subsidy Program which will be scaled
   up to 1.5 million family farm beneficiaries in 2012/13 season. The expanded program
   will ensure that more people who have been affected by the economic reforms do not lose
   their livelihood. The expanded FISP will include more legumes which will also enhance
   the nutritional status of households and increased incomes for households. In order to
   further improve on the transparency and targeting the FISP the Government will continue
   to work with civil society organisations, community leaders and Anti Corruption clubs
   that have established.

26.       The Government will expand its Public Works Support Program (PWSP) in the
   2012/13 fiscal year to cushion poor households against the economic shocks. Public
   works programs are expected to increase incomes and food security of poor households
   who participate in the creation or rehabilitation of community assets. The Government
   plans to reach an estimated 1.72 million people in 2012/13 through its PWSP, each
   working twelve days per month for a period of four month. Thus beneficiaries will be
   able to buy agricultural inputs and have some savings following participation in the
   PWSP.

27.        Improving quality and access to education is one of the Government objectives in
   the education sector. Since the introduction of free primary education in 1994, the
   education system has struggled to cope with the enrolment explosion that followed. The
   excess number of pupils placed a strain on existing infrastructure, provision of teaching
   and learning materials and qualified teachers in the system. The outcome has been
   deteriorating quality of primary education, with the challenge being even greater in rural
   schools where work stations are less attractive for qualified teachers compared to urban
   schools. Government‘s strategy to improve the quality of primary education, particularly
   in rural areas, is to increase the annual deployment of qualified primary school teachers
   to rural areas. To promote girls access to education, Government is providing bursaries
   to underprivileged girls in secondary schools to enable them buy clothes and basic
   materials required at school. The Government is also procuring teaching and learning
   materials for its secondary schools so that learners have access to references books. The
   Government is currently expanding primary teacher training facilities in order to increase
   the number of teachers being deployed. The Government also has a successful open and
   distance learning program that trains teachers from rural areas and deploys them near
   their homes. One additional teacher training college with a teacher output of 540 has just
   been opened. This initiative alongside other supply side measures is expected to improve
   the teacher/pupil ratio in rural areas in the next seven years.

28.        The Government continues to make good progress in the fight against under-five
   mortality, maternal mortality, strengthening staff capacity in the health sector and in
   reducing the transmission of HIV and AIDS from mothers to children. With regard to
   HIV/AIDS the Government is implementing its National Response strategy for 2011-
   2016. The strategy is focusing on prevention and behavior change; treatment, care and
   support; and impact mitigation. In the 2011/12 fiscal year the government will train an
   additional 4,200 health workers in the provision of integrated ART/PMTCT services and
   650 new sites will be providing ART/PMTCT services. Prevention and behavioral change
   is a key part of the Government overall strategy in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the
   2011/12 the Government implemented various programs aimed at positively influencing
   behavior. The Government imparted life skills to about 0.5 million out of school youth
   which include the disabled youth. About 90 per cent of HIV positive pregnant women
   were receiving ARV so as to reduce Mother to Child Transmission and 80 per cent of the
   HTC sites had no stock out of test kits. The Government also managed to increase
   television hours dedicated to HIV/AIDS message dissemination. This also included
   printed materials and other audiovisuals shows in communities.

29.       With regard to other health indicators like the national proportion of one-year olds
   immunized against measles reached 88%, exceeding last year‘s proportion by 4%, and
   surpassing the set target by 6%. Good progress was recorded in the fight against maternal
   mortality. Compared to the previous year, more pregnant mothers in Malawi were
   attended to by skilled birth attendants in 2011, with the proportion rising from 51% in
   2010 to 59% in 2011, exceeding the target by 10%. Good progress was registered in
   improving the quality of health services in Malawi through increase in the number of

      qualified nurses. A total of 6700 nurses were in the health system during the period July
      2010-2011.

      Public finance management reforms

30.          In order to consolidate the gains achieved in restoring macroeconomic stability,
      the Government plans to undertake several policy reforms in the area of budget process,
      external auditing, debt and aid management, and Public Finance Management.

      Budget processes

31.           The budget process is an important tool that translates the Government policies
      and programs into implementable activities. As the Government implements its economic
      recovery program in the 2012/13 fiscal year, it the Government will build its 2012/13
      budget framework on previous reforms which include: the linkages between the budget
      and the MGDS; have budgets that meet the internationally recognized classification of
      the Government Financial Statistics (GFS); and having a changed budget structure.
      Going forward the Government will build on these successful reforms to further improve
      the budgeting process. Beginning in the 2011/12 the Government adopted the Medium
      Term Expenditure budgeting framework which uses a three year rolling plan. To support
      the economic recovery program the Government will implement a zero net domestic
      financing policy. In coming up with the 2012/13 budget the Government has built on the
      recommendation of the budgeting technical assistance by the World Bank and the IMF.
      The technical assistance has helped the Government to re-examine certain budget lines so
      that the vulnerable groups are protected as the Government implements its economic
      recovery program.

      External audit and scrutiny in the use of public resources

32.           An evaluation of how well the budget has been executed is a critical element of
      sound public financial management. In this connection, the Malawi Public Audit Act
      2003, provides for external auditing and Parliamentary scrutiny of the audit reports.
      Government will continue to focus on quality, timeliness, coverage of audits and the
      independence of the National Audit Office (NAO). The Government will work with the
      NAO to ensure that regular procurement audits are done for large procurement in public
      sector. Initially the Government will carry out a procurement audit of the Farm Input
      Subsidy Program. For a very longtime the Government has been reliant on external
      expertise to undertake procurement audit. In order to institutionalize procurement audits
      the Government is capacitating the NAO so that it is able to carry out such audits
      regularly for all public procurements.

33.          In terms of timeliness and coverage, it is pleasing to note that the audit backlogs
      have been cleared and now we are up to date with Central Government audits. With
      regards to local councils, accounts for the years 2005/06, 2006/07, and 2007/08 were
      audited in 2010 and tabled in parliament in 2011. The 2009/10 accounts have also been

                                                 77
                                                 Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

   audited and awaits publication. It terms of coverage, auditing for councils is currently at
   100%.

34.         For the first time, the National Audit office conducted performance audit. Two
   audits on Viphya plantation management and supply of teaching and learning materials
   were submitted and tabled in Parliament while three audits on drug distribution, deceased
   estate management and provision of driving licences and certificate of fitness were also
   concluded awaiting publication. The NAO will continue to do financial audit for the
   fertiliser subsidy program and other performance audits.

35.        On audit follow up, all the audit reports submitted to Parliament for years ended
   June 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 have been scrutinized and discussed by the Public
   Accounts Committee (PAC). This implies that PAC is current in terms of scrutinizing all
   the reports that were submitted including a Treasury Minute.

   Procurement reforms

36.         Since the enactment of the Public Procurement Act in 2003, the Government has
   embraced modern procurement practices throughout the public sector. All public sector
   institutions now have operational internal procurement committees that oversee
   procurement. The Government is continuing with its professional development program
   with a view of building a cadre of procurement professionals. With regard to
   transparency in public procurement, the largest procuring entities are fully complying
   with the legal requirement on procurement planning and publication of tender results in
   the public domain. The Government has just completed a review of its procurement
   systems with a view of finding weaknesses and strong points in the procurement systems.
   Based on the review the Government will come up with an action plan which will guide
   its procurement reforms in the medium term. In addition, Government also plans to pilot
   use of Civil Society Organizations in the monitoring of procurement in the ten largest
   entities in the public sector. To strengthen oversight over public procurement,
   Government plans to build capacity of the Auditor General and internal audit units to
   integrate procurement audits within their work.

   Debt management

37.         Malawi‘s external debt indicators have improved significantly after receiving debt
   relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief
   Initiative (MDRI) in 2006. (According to a recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
   conducted by Government in June 2011, all the debt indicators are projected to remain
   below the respective thresholds over the period 2009-2029 under the baseline
   macroeconomic scenario. However, stress tests show that Malawi‘s external debt is
   subject to moderate risks of debt distress, particularly arising from lower GDP and export
   growth. In addition, the overall fiscal sustainability of the public debt is still fragile
   mainly due to the high domestic debt burden. Domestic debt is unsustainable due to its



                                               78
                                                  Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant

   short term nature which requires frequent roll-over and will require significant resources
   to redeem it.

38.        Since reaching the historic Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion
   point in 2006, the Government has maintained its policy to access grants and borrow
   concessional loans for all its budget and project financing needs. With the support of its
   development partners the Government is implementing a multi-year debt management
   reform program which has identified areas than need strengthening in all three areas of
   debt management (front office, middle office and back office operations).

39.        The Government has now fully operationalized its domestic debt unit. Since its
   inception in 2011, the unit has taken over the responsibility of managing domestic debt
   functions (determining the government domestic financing needs of the government,
   assessing options/costs of financing domestically and any decisions to restructure it. In
   this regard, Government has taken measures to lengthen the maturity profile of the
   domestic debt stock through issuance of treasury notes (bonds) of 2 – 5 year maturity.

   Public Financial and Economic Management Reform Program

40.        Finally, the Government realizes that continued provision of general budget
   support is contingent of having robust Public Finance and Economic Management
   (PFEM) systems in place. PFM reforms have not moved with speed due lengthy
   consultative processes which are necessary if they have to be domestically owned.
   Secondly most of the reforms require resources to be implemented. The Government is
   working with its development partners to develop a multi-donor trust fund to finance its
   PFEM reform program. The reform agenda to be financed through the Trust Fund will
   cover such areas as: (i) planning, (ii) resourcing the national development strategies, (iii)
   budgeting, (iv) budget execution, (v) accounting and financial systems, (vi) reporting,
   (vii) PFEM administration and programs. The Government is confident that
   implementation of the action plan will improve and bring our systems in line with
   international best practices as well assure our development partners that resources given
   to Malawi will be properly used, accounted for and timely report.

41.       I am confident that the outlined policies, programs and reforms will create a
   conducive environment for rapid economic recovery and create a strong foundation for
   growth to rebound.

Measures implemented by the new government, including the elimination of foreign exchange
restrictions, devaluation of the kwacha, adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, and increases in fuel
prices, have transformed the policy environment and set the stage for resumption of IMF and donor
support. The authorities have committed to implement policies and structural reforms to contain inflation,
build international reserves and promote inclusive growth. The government’s FY2012/13 budget
proposals include provisions for scaling up social protection programs to mitigate the adverse impact of
adjustment measures on the most vulnerable segments of the population.

Background

1. President Joyce Banda inherited a very difficult economic situation. Following the sudden death of
President Bingu wa Mutharika in early April 2012, Mrs. Joyce Banda (Vice President at the time) was
sworn into office as President to serve the remainder of the term of the late President, in accordance with
Malawi‘s constitution. General elections are scheduled to be held in May 2014. President Banda took
over a country facing a severe shortage of foreign exchange which led to shortages of critical imports
including fuel, inputs for production and medicines. Delays in making payments abroad led to the loss of
credit lines for several businesses, resulting in scaled down operations and the laying off of workers.
Malawi‘s long standing foreign exchange problems intensified in 2011 because of lower tobacco export
earnings and the interruption of the ECF-supported program with the IMF which led several donors to cut
their aid to the country. International reserves fell to the equivalent of ½ a month of imports.

2. Within a month of taking office, the new administration implemented a set of bold measures to
address Malawi‟s chronic balance of payments difficulties and to halt the slowdown in economic
activity. The measures implemented so far include all the commitments the government had made under
the current IMF-supported program to adjust the official exchange rate and liberalize the exchange regime
for current account transactions, which the previous administration had been resisting since early 2011.
Non-implementation of these measures led to the interruption of the program. The specific measures
implemented by the new administration include:

   Devaluation of the exchange rate from K167 to K250 per U.S. dollar, and adoption of a floating
    exchange rate regime.
   Allowing banks and foreign exchange bureaus to set the rate at which they buy and sell foreign
    exchange from/to their customers.
   Removal of the requirement for foreign exchange earnings to be surrendered to the RBM; they now
    flow directly to commercial banks.




                                                    83
                                                           Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant




   A substantial increase in fuel prices to bring them in line with import costs, and adoption of an
    automatic adjustment mechanism to ensure pass through of changes in import costs to retail prices.

   Substantial increases in electricity tariffs to ensure movement toward cost recovery.

   A tightening of monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures, signaled by the RBM raising the
    bank rate from 13 percent to 16 percent.

3. The adjustment measures are beginning to show positive results. Sales of tobacco through official
channels have increased, suggesting a decline in smuggling of the crop to neighboring countries; the
parallel market for foreign exchange has almost collapsed, with premiums over the official exchange rate
falling from 60–80 percent before the devaluation to 5–10 percent, while rates offered by banks and
foreign exchange bureaus are converging; and the private sector‘s access to foreign exchange has eased
considerably. The government is working with the World Bank and other partners to scale up social
protection programs to mitigate the adverse effects of the adjustment measures on the welfare of the most
vulnerable segments of the population.

Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook

4. Economic growth slowed significantly in 2011. After averaging over 8 percent a year during 2007–
10, real GDP grew at 4.3 percent in 2011. Sectors that are heavily dependent on imports—manufacturing,
transportation, construction, and wholesale and retail trade sectors—slowed down the most, reflecting the
impact of the foreign exchange shortage. Following the recent policy measures, the private sector has
begun to clear the backlog of external arrears which should help re-establish credit lines and improve the
flow of imported inputs to allow enterprises to gradually increase output from the current low levels of
capacity utilization.

5. Inflation has been on a rising trend since early 2011, with the year-on-year headline rate
reaching 12.4 percent in April 2012. Rising import costs have been the principal factor behind the
upswing as a growing share of imports were being priced at the parallel market exchange rate before the
May devaluation. The devaluation triggered large adjustments in the retail prices of petroleum products,
which will have ripple effects to other prices. A spike in inflation is expected in the next few months but
should be reversed with implementation of restrained fiscal and monetary policies to counter second
round effects of domestic energy price increases.

6. Fiscal performance deteriorated after FY2009/10. Government expenditure remained steady while
external grants fell sharply and domestic revenue performance (in relation to GDP) deteriorated. The
government relied heavily on domestic borrowing to finance its growing deficit. The overall fiscal deficit
widened from nearly 3 percent of GDP in FY2010/11 to 7 percent in FY2011/12, with domestic financing
rising from 1.7 percent of GDP to 5.6 percent in the respective years. The government and state owned
enterprises have also accumulated about K70 billion (7 percent of GDP) in domestic arrears over the last
few years. The new administration has taken steps to restrain spending, including by reducing the number
of official trips abroad, cutting the number of vehicles available to senior officials, and postponing new
development projects which were to be funded entirely by domestic resources.
                                                    84

7. Monetary developments in the last few years reflect a dominant influence of fiscal policy. The
RBM accommodated the government‘s financing requirement, and cost considerations held it back from
conducting open market operations to mop up excess liquidity. The RBM began tightening its policy
stance in April 2012, including by removing excess liquidity using some of its holdings of treasury bills.
In May the RBM raised its policy rate and, after the devaluation, used foreign exchange sales to further
mop up excess liquidity. Kwacha liquidity conditions tightened significantly and several banks resorted to
the RBM discount window to meet their needs.

Medium-Term Framework and Policies

8. The main objective of the government‟s development strategy is poverty reduction through
sustained economic growth and infrastructure development. In late-April 2012, the government
formally approved the second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) covering 2011/12–
2015/16; the first MGDS covered 2006–11. A key element of the strategy for achieving sustainable
growth articulated in both documents is the pursuit of sound economic policies with a view to
maintaining inflation at single digit levels and increasing the level of international reserves. An increase
in national investment—with emphases in areas such as electricity generation and supply, transportation
and irrigation, and in selected priority sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and tourism)—is
expected to deliver high growth, while prudent fiscal and monetary policies deliver low inflation.

9. The authorities are seeking support under a new ECF arrangement for a program with the
following main objectives:

   Recovery in real GDP growth from 4.3 percent in 2012 to about 6½ percent per year in the medium
    term.

   Achieving and maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation, founded on
    sustainable fiscal and external balances.

   Increasing foreign reserves coverage to three months of imports, to provide a buffer against
    exogenous shocks (e.g., weather, terms of trade, and aid flows).

   Enhancing the operational independence of the RBM.

   Pursuing reforms to deepen the financial sector and promote greater financial inclusion.

   Undertaking structural reforms to improve the investment climate and promote sustained and
    inclusive growth, including through improvements in infrastructure and regulatory reforms.

10. Fiscal policy and related structural reforms. The FY2012/13 budget is anchored by a zero net
domestic borrowing target, which represents a reduction from 5.6 percent of GDP domestic borrowing in
FY2011/12. Substantially higher donor support in the form of grants and concessional loans reduce the
domestic financing need, but a sizeable revenue effort and tight control of spending will be needed to
ensure that expenditures are aligned with the government‘s top priorities, including safeguarding social
safety net provisions. Key elements of the government‘s program include:
                                                     85
                                                           Attachment A: Rapid Response Development Policy Grant




   Domestic revenue mobilization efforts include removal of implicit subsidies on fuel and an associated
    boost in fuel tax revenues, and strengthening of revenue administration through increased audits,
    adoption and use of electronic fiscal devices in the enforcement of VAT, and the use of computerized
    cargo scanners.

   The FY2012/13 budget increases the share of total expenditures allocated to social protection
    programs, most notably the Farm Input Subsidy Program, as well as public works, school feeding,
    school bursary, and cash transfer programs. The additional spending on these programs and on the
    social sectors in general is made possible by increased assistance from donors.

   Verification of K72 billion arrears by the Office of the Auditor General and formulation of a plan for
    settlement of the verified amounts over several years. Implementation of the commitment module in
    the IFMIS will be accelerated to help prevent accumulation of new arrears. The government will
    inform the general public of its procurement rules through the media, including warnings that those
    who provide goods or services outside of the established government system will not be paid.

   The government has initiated steps to reduce the risks to the budget posed by contingent liabilities
    and operational losses of state owned enterprises. The National Oil Company of Malawi will be
    limited to its core activity of managing strategic reserves of fuel. The government will establish a
    clear regulatory regime for the public utilities that covers operating costs and avoids the need for
    budgetary transfers and that minimizes recourse to commercial bank borrowing.

11. Monetary policy. Monetary policy will be geared toward achieving price stability, while providing
room for sufficient credit to the private sector and supporting a buildup of international reserves. To help
manage domestic demand and contain inflation, broad money is programmed to grow at about the pace of
nominal GDP in the near term. Further financial deepening in the medium term would allow broad money
to grow faster than nominal GDP without fueling inflation.

12. Financial stability. Financial stability indicators suggest that the banking sector in Malawi remains
sound. Non-performing loans are at low levels, but the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment
in the last two years has elevated the risks to banks‘ portfolios. The RBM has intensified its monitoring
and surveillance of the financial system with a view to detecting at an early stage emerging threats to
financial stability. The RBM is establishing Basel II governance structures and committees, with full
compliance with Basel II principles envisaged for January 2014.

13. International competitiveness. In view of the push toward greater regional integration (including the
Grand Tripartite Free Trade Area encompassing COMESA, EAC, and SADC), the government is
determined to enhance Malawi‘s international competitiveness, including by removing structural
bottlenecks—e.g., reliable and adequate supply of energy—that are holding back growth and
diversification of the economy. The government is developing a National Export Strategy (NES) aimed at
transforming Malawi from being a predominantly importing and consuming nation to becoming a
producing and exporting nation. Investment incentives will focus on areas that contribute towards
inclusive growth and have extensive forward and backward linkages in the economy, especially through
potential for value addition. The NES is expected to be launched in the second half of 2012.

14. Data quality and transparency. The Minister of Finance recently acknowledged that, under the
previous administration, his ministry inflated revenue data for the first half of this fiscal year (July–
December 2011) that was reported to parliament in February 2012. In late-December 2011, the Ministry
of Finance (MoF) realized that revenues were unlikely to meet a target set by the late President. Senior
officials of MoF authorized the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) to obtain short-term loans from
several banks which were deposited into the MRA account at the RBM to ―boost‖ revenues. The loans
were repaid in the first few days of January 2012. The MRA insists that the data it reported to the MoF
were accurate, and that it had nothing to do with the data reported to parliament. In order to safeguard the
integrity of revenue data, the government has decided that the MRA should publish its monthly revenue
collections in the local media with a lag of no more than a month.

Risks to the Medium-term Outlook

15. The main downside risks to the medium-term outlook are related to external shocks, adverse
weather conditions, and policy slippages in the lead up to the 2014 elections. External shocks could
include deterioration in the terms of trade and shortfalls in aid flows, which would adversely affect
growth and government finances. Adverse weather conditions would lower output in agriculture, which
has been the sector that has led growth over the last five years. The liberalization of the foreign exchange
regime will help remove distortions and encourage private investment and diversified growth. More
consistent implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies would sustain increased aid flows and
make them more predictable, providing room for the authorities to build up international reserves to
create a buffer against adverse external shocks. Quarterly monitoring of the proposed new IMF-supported
program would help mitigate the risk of policy slippages.

Toward a new ECF-supported program

16. The new administration has requested a new ECF arrangement to provide a fresh start. The
current ECF arrangement, which is due to expire in February 2013, will be cancelled. A mission that
visited Malawi during May 23–June 6, reached staff-level understandings with the authorities on a
program that could be supported by a new three-year ECF arrangement. The new arrangement is subject
to approval by the IMF‘s Executive Board which is tentatively scheduled to consider the authorities‘
request on July 23, 2012. There is one prior action for Board consideration: passage by parliament of a
budget for FY2012/13 that is in line with the understandings reached with the mission (i.e., zero net
domestic financing, and total expenditures within the estimated resource envelope). The budget submitted
by the government to parliament on June 8 is in line with understandings reached with IMF staff.
Parliament is expected to pass the budget law by June 22.

17. IMF staff is proposing higher-than-usual access to Fund resources for Board consideration,
based on balance of payments needs, program strength, and scaled up donor support. If approved,
the amount of financial assistance from the IMF will be SDR104 million (about US$157 million) over
three years, with half being disbursed in the first year. The total amount is equivalent to 150 percent of
Malawi‘s quota, twice the normal level of assistance under the ECF to countries that have outstanding
                                                      87
loans to the IMF in excess of 100 percent of their quota. The higher-than-usual level of support reflects

Malawi‘s pressing and large balance of payments need (international reserves are very low), the strength
of the upfront policy measures the authorities have already implemented (devaluation, floating exchange
rate regime, adjustment in fuel prices and adoption of an automatic adjustment mechanism, tightening of
monetary policy), and the policy commitments they have made under the proposed new arrangement
(fiscal restraint underpinned by public financial management reforms, monetary policy autonomy,
transparency in data reporting).

I.          INTRODUCTION

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors for an Additional
Grant in the amount of SDR 16.6 million (US$ 25.0 million equivalent) and Credit in the
amount of SDR 16.6 (US$ 25.0 million equivalent) for the Third Social Action Fund
(MASAF 3) APL II (Local Development Fund (LDF) Mechanism) as part of a coordinated
Bank Emergency Rapid Response Package to the Republic of Malawi to address the crisis
currently facing Malawi following the exchange rate liberalization. At the same time, the project
is being restructured to reflect changes in the results framework and the closing date to be June
30, 2014.

2.       In response to the crisis, the Government of Malawi (GoM) has proposed the
implementation of immediate short term safety net mitigation measures to cushion the
negative financial effects of the exchange rate liberalization and the food price increase on
the population by providing cash support to the poorest three quintiles of the population,
approximately 1.72 million rural and urban households or 8.6 million people representing 60
percent of the population. The support to the population would compensate loss of consumption
at 33 percent. These mitigation measures would be implemented through various support
mechanisms including public works cash transfers, direct cash transfers, and agriculture input
subsidies and irrigation infrastructure support.

3.       The Second Additional Financing (AF II) would focus on a scale up of the targeted
cash transfers through MASAF 3 APL II to approximately 586,000 households of the ultra
poor urban and rural Malawians or 2.9 million people representing 20 percent of the
population38,39.

4.      The Project would build on the positive impacts of the MASAF Community

(PWSP). MASAF is ideally positioned to immediately and efficiently target cash transfers to
smoothen incomes of the poorest Malawians through public works.

II.    Background and Rationale for Additional Financing

Background

5.       The Poor in Malawi. The current national policy framework is laid out in the draft
Social Support Policy and the draft National Social Support Programme (NSSP) which identify
three categories of poor to target for assistance: the moderately poor, the ultra-poor with labour
and the ultra-poor and incapacitated. According to Second Integrated Households Surveys
(IHS2), people living below the povertyline account for 52.4 percent of the population and of
these 30 percent are moderately poor, 8.4 percent are ultra-poor with labour and 14 percent are
ultra-poor and incapacitated.

6.        The objective of the draft NSSP is to provide a framework for prioritizing
targeting of support to reduce poverty and enable the poor to move out of poverty and
vulnerability. It consists of four main pillars: (i) provision of social support; (ii) protection of
assets; (iii) promotion of productivity enhancement; and (iv) policies to reduce exclusion.

7.       The following are the principal vulnerable groups identified in studies of poverty
in Malawi: the landless, those with very small landholdings, Child-headed households, elderly
and single parent-headed households (HHs), orphans, female-headed households, widowed and
divorced, the elderly and disabled, households affected by disasters, persons living with
HIV/AIDS and the unemployed/under-employed in urban areas (see Annex 3).

8.      While the lack of employment results in substantial impoverishment for some urban
dwellers, it needs to be emphasized that deep poverty in Malawi is still overwhelmingly a
rural phenomenon where 87 percent of the total population and 96 percent of the 3.4 million
ultra-poor live. Of all of the risks and shocks affecting the poorest in Malawi, those associated
with agricultural productivity – drought and reduced yields, and higher food and input prices –
are cited in surveys as by far the most prevalent ones, and the ones which most concern the poor.

Rationale

9.       Malawi has faced a number of exogenous shocks in the past few years arising from
volatility in international commodity prices, foreign aid, climate change and natural
disasters including an earthquake in 2010. These shocks have considerable ramifications
for macroeconomic indicators as well as at household level, where rising food and fuel prices
are placing a heavy burden on poor and vulnerable families, jeopardizing human capital gains
achieved in previous years. In order to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of exogenous
shocks at both levels, the Government has requested additional support, to address
macroeconomic imbalances as well as food and fuel price increases in the face of the recent
shocks to the economy. The Government therefore has proposed the implementation of
immediate short term safety net mitigation measures in 2012-13 to cushion the necessary

                                                90
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

financial effects of the 50 percent exchange rate liberalization that has led to the price increase
on the population (in the bottom quintiles 1, 2, and 3) or approximately 1.72 million rural and
urban households or 8.6 million people. These mitigation measures would be implemented
through various support mechanisms including public works program (PWP) cash transfers,
direct cash transfers, agriculture input subsidies and irrigation infrastructure support. MASAF
is positioned and recognized for being able to quickly scale up the delivery mitigating cash
transfers to the poorest households through Public Works (Annex 3 has details).

Project Status and Performance


10.     The MASAF 3 APL II project was approved by the Board on June 20, 2008. The
original Financing Agreement, which provided financing in an amount of SDR 30.7 million
(USD 50.0 million equivalent), was signed on November 25, 2008 and became effective on
March 24, 2009. On June 30, 2010, an additional financing was approved in the amount of
SDR 9.0 million (USD14.0 million). As of June 30, 2012, the original financing had been
disbursed to 100 percent and most of the Additional Financing credit has been disbursed, with
only US$3.0 million remaining to be disbursed. The remaining amount has been budgeted to
finance already identified and agreed-upon activities communicated to local councils in the
form of indicative planning figures. The undisbursed Credit proceeds for public works totaling
US$ 3.0 million are not sufficient to address the newly emerged need for additional safety nets.
As evidenced by the MASAF experience, demand for these temporary employment
opportunities is large and growing and more financing is needed to scale up the labor-intensive
public works to protect households from falling deeper into poverty and protect the gains
achieved through the program.
 11. The Project Development Objective (PDO) of MASAF 3 APL II is to improve the
livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and to strengthen the capacity of local
authorities to manage local development. The Project includes the following three
components: (i) Community Livelihoods Support Fund; (ii) Local Authority Capacity
Enhancement Fund; and (iii) National Institutional Strengthening Fund.


    i.     Community Livelihoods Support (CLS) Fund: The Community Livelihoods
           Support Fund finances two sub-components:

         a) A Local Authority Fund: Based on local councils‘ Annual Investments Plans
            produced through Village Participatory Planning, this subcomponent finances labor-
            intensive investments that create public assets benefiting poor households. The
            Public Works Sub-projects Program targets poor households for twelve days as an
            annual intervention to address food security related shocks that affect these
            households around the time they need to purchase agricultural inputs, grains,
            and other basic necessities.

         b) A Community Fund: This sub-component supports participatory planning processes


                                                91
                                              Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

            and direct community financing to improve the functionality of existing
            educational facilities as well as educational outcomes at the community level. This
            sub-component also entails interventions to promote a culture of savings
            and investments, in particular among participants of the public works program, to
            enable them get on a pathway to graduating out of poverty.

    ii.    Local Authority Capacity Enhancement (LACE) Fund: This component supports
           the development of a comprehensive framework for addressing capacity needs for
           Local Councils to effectively manage the grants they receive, perform functions
           allocated to them under this project, and prepare them to perform anticipated
           responsibilities as devolution proceeds and more resources are available under
           the LDF or any other longer-term Government grant arrangement.

    iii.   National Institutional Strengthening Fund: The component finances national-level
           crosscutting issues aimed at improving accountability and transparency in the use of
           project resources.


12.     The Project is making progress towards achievement of Project Development
Objectives (PDO) as evidenced by the Results Framework (see Annex 1). A Mid Term
Review mission carried out in January 2012 rated the achievement as Moderately Satisfactory.
The current rating (ISR filed June, 2012) for the PDO is Moderately Satisfactory as there are
some shortcomings related to the results measurement of the improved livelihood aspects of the
PDO. The required improvements in the results framework constitute part of the restructuring
now. The preparation mission noted the following PDO outcome achievements: Out of a set
target of 900,000 beneficiaries under the Public Works Subproject Program (PWSP), a total of
1,362,444 beneficiaries of whom 48.5 percent are female had received cash transfers have been
reached, surpassing the target. The total number of beneficiaries represents 88.5 percent of the
target as of January 2012. The improved household income has enabled the beneficiaries to
enhance their livelihoods and enabled them to access basic household needs (such as education,
health, food security) as discussed below.

 13. The Public Works Tracking Studies and the Beneficiary Assessment Survey (2012)
both found that the program has been effective in addressing food security, improving
households‘ access to health and education services and also contributed in formation and
protection of household assets. The improved household income has enabled the beneficiaries
to enhance their livelihoods by purchasing farm inputs (34.6 percent of PWSP wages were used
to procure farm inputs); buying food for their families (62 percent of the PWSP wages went
into buying food); meeting their health needs (10.6 percent of beneficiaries of PWSP spent
their wages on health related expenditure); and covering education needs (12.6 percent of
PWSP beneficiaries spent their wages on education). However, the studies also show that
duration is too short to offer significant insurance and provide predictable source of income to
poor households. Beneficiaries are proposing a longer PWP intervention of up to 3 months. The
MWK 200 per day wage rate has been in place since APL II started in 2008 and thus it has
been eroded by inflation over time, and coupled with the recent exchange rate liberalization, the

                                               92
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

beneficiaries are getting less than a dollar a day. Coverage of the program is low such that up to
25 percent of the beneficiaries reported to be sharing both the work and the wages. This was
observed by the Beneficiary Assessment (2012) as a way of building social capital within the
community.

 14. Experience under the Original Project, the AF I and in Tanzania, has shown that
the Community Savings and Investment Promotion (COMSIP) intervention puts the
beneficiaries on a pathway to getting out of poverty. In order to ensure the continuity of the
complementary community savings activities encouraged in the MASAF 3 APL II program the
AF II will continue to support the Community Fund sub component. This additional support
will strengthen the existing efforts and would ensure that the activities continue during the
scaled up PW implementation. Where the PWP beneficiaries have been linked to COMSIP
intervention, the increases in household income have been phenomenal up to US$ 13 per
person in their passbook against the US$3 at entry of the program (Beneficiary Assessment
2012). This component would continue to be implemented through existing arrangements by
the COMSIP Cooperative Union.

15.     Implementation Progress. The preparation mission reviewed the Implementation
Progress and rated it Moderately Satisfactory. Project management has been rated Moderately
Satisfactory, with the Financial Management rated Moderately Satisfactory. Procurement was
Moderately Unsatisfactory in the December 2011 ISR due to several procurement delays which
include: delay in replacing a procurement manager and procurement officer, delay to
commission studies that were to feed into the MTR, which led to delaying the MTR. However
at MTR Procurement was Satisfactory and the AF preparation mission in May maintained the
Satisfactory rating as staff are in place and management of the procurement plan has been
found satisfactory. Safeguards have been rated Moderately Satisfactory as explained in the
section below.

16.     Financial Management (FM): The financial management review was carried out in
January 2012 and was updated in May 2012. The findings show that the financial management
of MASAF 3 is generally adequate with the exception of manual processing of transactions and
reports that is error prone and consequently the FM is rated as moderately satisfactory. The
implementing entity is compliant with the Bank's financial management requirements; and there
are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports.

17.    At the Local Authority level, the Project will continue to use the IFMIS which now
has added modules for project management, whereas in Local Authorities (LAs) where the
IFMIS is not yet operational, the Local Authority Management Information System developed
under MASAF will also be used for the AF II. The Local Authority Management Information
System has the ability to track physical and financial information pertaining to community-level
investments.

18.    The Audited Financial Reports have been prepared and submitted on time. All the
reports have carried a clean audit opinion. Overall, financial management and technical
supervision need to be improved in some of the local councils to be able to support

                                                93
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

communities in a timely and effective manner as they implement their sub-projects.

19.      Compliance with legal covenants and safeguard requirements. The Project is in
overall compliance with applicable legal covenants. Previous missions had noted that for
safeguards, there was inadequate facilitation, inadequate processing of documentation at some
subprojects‘ sites and inadequate monitoring of environmental and social issues resulting from
inadequate capacity of professional staff to spearhead environment and social issues at the
district level. At MTR, the rating for safeguards was Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, as
noted by the preparation mission, progress has been made and for safeguards it includes: (i)
most of the previously vacant Environmental District Officer positions have been filled; and (ii)
the Technical Support Team had carried out the orientation of the 27 Environmental District
Officers now in place and the district environmental subcommittee members to enhance their
understanding of environmental assessment and monitoring at all stages of the sub-project cycle
to ensure full compliance with the Original Project's covenants. All members of the District
Environmental Sub-committee were also orientated on safeguards. Following the May 2012 AF
preparation mission, the government has prepared a comprehensive status report showing
progress made on the Safeguard issues that were highlighted during the MTR mission (see
Annex 4) and has put into place clear action plans for addressing the remaining issues. As such
the safeguards work is considered to be Moderately Satisfactory at this time and presents a
minor to moderate risk to the proposed operation. The good efforts in enhancing safeguards
compliance will be further supported through continuous safeguards capacity building training
and workshops to all key stakeholders.

20.     The AF II remains classified as a Category B operation triggering OP 4.01, 4.09
and 4.12 as per the original project. However, it is important to note that, while MASAF 1
and MASAF 2 focused primarily on the delivery of social and economic infrastructure in
support of the government‘s poverty reduction targets, the MASAF 3 program is distinguished
by its emphasis on: (i) improving the capacity of communities to effectively manage sub-
project cycle activities and participate in local development in a meaningful way; (ii) enhancing
the capacity of local authorities to deliver services; and (iii) acting as a catalyst for enhancing
local government systems as part of the country‘s decentralization agenda.

21.    Under Component 1: Community Livelihood Support Fund, the menu of possible
investments includes reforestation and tree felling activities. Under MASAF 3, in the past
five years, reforestation activities have yielded a total of 1.44 million ha in reforested areas
across the country. The intention and practice, to date, is for communities to protect the
indigenous species by planting mostly fast growing tree species for fuelwood and construction
of houses in order to decrease deforestation and degradation of primary forests. Communities
with such sub projects are sensitized on propper harvesting to sustain their environment.
Indeed, in an effort to promote environmental sustainability, the project design mandates that a
minimum of 20 percent of the resources used by the communities from this Fund be applied to
environmental enhancement subprojects such as the aforementioned reforestation activities.

22.    Under this AF II, since the current cumulative impact of the MASAF 3
reforestation activities are relatively large in scale with respect to tree planting and

                                                94
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

harvesting, and since the focus of the Additional Financing is to significantly scale up
Component 1 activities, including reforestation and harvesting activities. Also OP 4.36 is
triggered. This OP was not previously triggered at preparation of MASAF 3 Program as it was
not envisioned to involve such a large area overall. Since OP 4.36 is now triggered, the GoM
will not later that six months after Project Effectiveness, update the previously approved project
ESMF to reflect the core considerations of this OP and include guidelines for preparation of
forest management plans for each community that uses this Fund for reforestation and
harvesting activities. The revised ESMF will be redisclosed in country and in the Bank‘s
InfoShop.

23.    Specific details related to the project‟s safeguards work is presented in Annex 4 of
this Attachment.

24.     In summary, the proposed AF II for MASAF 3 APL II is consistent with the
parameters of OP/BP 8.0 and OP/BP 13.20 related to emergency AF operations. Overall
project performance of MASAF 3 (original and AF) is currently rated as moderately
satisfactory for the achievement of project development objectives (PDO) and implementation
performance (IP). The project is in substantial compliance with loan covenants. The AF is
economically justified as discussed in the Economic and Financial Analysis section.

25.     MASAF 3 APL II is funded by the IDA, however the MASAF - Local Development
Fund Mechanism as an institution of Government is now funded by donors including the
KFW, and the African Development Bank financing specific activities. The donors have
different missions which results in an overload on the TST and causes delays in program
implementation. The Government has called for joint missions to minimize on demands on the
management‘s time.


Consistency with Country Assistance Strategy

26.     The proposed AF II for the MASAF 3 APL II project is directly related to the
Africa Strategy through the Pillar 2: Vulnerability and Resilience. The proposed Project is
also consistent with the Bank‘s CAS FY07-11 as well as the upcoming CAS FY13-16
objectives and is one of the Bank‘s portfolio instruments that aims to support the Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDSII) by assisting poor and vulnerable
households, through decentralized mechanisms, to improve their livelihoods, access basic
social and economic infrastructure and reduce household vulnerability. Consistent with the CAS
goals, the original project, the AF I and the proposed AF II serve the social protection needs of
households with limited access to and use of specified service packages, vulnerable individuals
needing assistance, and households with limited employment opportunities.

III.   Proposed Changes

27.   Project objectives and components. No change to the Project Development Objective
(PDO) is proposed, as the current objective remains relevant for scaling up MASAF 3 APL II

                                                95
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

Project activities under the AF II. MASAF 3 will continue to track the PDO and intermediate
results specified in the revised Results Framework of the AF I ). A few PDO indicators have been
modified and the target values of several indicators adjusted to realistic levels based on progress
to date (see Annex 1 Results Framework).

28.     APL Program Objective and Phases. MASAF 3 is an APL program with three
planned phases. The overall program objective is to achieve capacity building for improved
service delivery by communities, Local Governments and Sector Ministries within the MPRSP,
with decentralization as a key strategy so that Malawi can achieve its MDGs. Due to contined
lack of baseline data, the team is dropping some of the overall program results indicators. It has
been agreed that APL II will be the final phase of the series. Rather than continuing with the
third phase of the program, the upcoming CAS includes MASAF 4 which is proposed to be a
new productive social safety net operation. This will be an important operational vehicle for
moving forward the process of creating and consolidating a permanent social safety net. The
operation will simultaneously, establish appropriate social safety net delivery systems and
develop institutional and implementation capacity in the country.

29.     Proposed Activities for the Additional Financing. The AF II would focus on scaling
up the component (1) the Community Livelihoods Support Fund Component in the Local
Authority Window to scale up the Public Works Sub-project Program (PWSP) nationwide in
urban and rural areas. Based on the recommendation of the Mid Term Review (January 2012),
in order to achieve sustainable environmental and poverty impact, the number of days of work
on subprojects per household (HH) for public works would be 12 days per month for each HH
for two cycles of 2 months each instead of the current 12 days per month per year. The daily
wage has been eroded and was therefore found to be inadequate to positively impact poverty
and would be increased from the current rate of MWK200 per day to MWK300 (US$1.2) for
both rural and urban areas, subject to review. The public works program which currently
consists of one subproject per community would involve the participation of the same
households in a community over two cycles and for multiple subprojects.

30.    A maximum of 200 people will be employed on an individual sub-project. Works on a
subproject will not be undertaken during the agricultural season when the beneficiaries are
supposed to be engaed in own farm activities except for transplanting seedlings for a reforestation
subproject. This is particulary the case for the rural areas. The typology of assets to be created
under the AF II is in line with the National Social Support Program and remains as was in the
Original Project and include the following:
      i.   Forestry and Agro-forestry projects to increase area under forestry cover, agro-
           forestry and fruit tree production (for which community forest management plans will
           be prepared as per the guidance presented in the revised ESMF).
     ii.   Construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads and market access
           roads
    iii.   Drainage improvement including dykes
    iv.    Soil and water conservation activities and
     v.    Harnessing of water – construction and rehabilitation of reservoirs, and connections to

                                                96
                                              Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

           gravity fed water schemes and kiosks

The ratio of wage to inputs/ works/administration will be maintained at 80:20

31.     The Community Fund sub-component under the proposed AF II would continue
to support the COMSIP intervention which is a response to closing the sustainability gap
that exists in the implementation of PWSP. For years the implementation of PWSP tended to
end at the disbursement of wages. The COMSIP provides information on savings and financial
management of own-resources (see annex 3 for details). The implementation process starts
during the beneficiary selection and continues all the way through the PWSP-12 day work
period during which members would have self selected to be in a group. Savings and
investment with capacity building for the self selected members will continue thereafter in the
cycle.

32.    The World Bank proposes to contribute US$ 50.0 million through additional
financing by scaling up public works programs of MASAF/LDF which will be able to
cover cash transfers to 586,000 households and the associated capital costs and the costs
of administration and delivery. With the Additional Financing a financing gap of US$83.7
million would remain which would need to be met by Government own resources and/or other
Donor co-financing.

Component 1: Community Livelihoods Support Fund

1.1 Local Authority Window (AFII: US$42.75 million, total US$67.85 million).
33.    The public works would benefit whole communities and a multiple number of
community works would be conducted per community over this period of time based on the
operations and implementation manual of MASAF/LDF.

34.      The public work activities will be implemented during the slack season of major
livelihood/agriculture activities and when the beneficiaries have the most need for additional
income to cover their family needs including food and non-food expenditures and inputs for
agricultural activities. Following the existing implementation modality of MASAF, the public
works activities supported through this additional financing will be implemented in two cycles
i.e. July – December 2012 and April – June 2013.


1.2 Community Window (AFII: US$2.25 million; Total:US$28.65 million)

35.     To ensure the continuity of the complementary community saving activities and
the culture of savings by communities encouraged in the MASAF program an additional
budget of US$2.25 million would be allocated for the COMSIP component. This additional
support will strengthen the existing efforts and would ensure that the activities continue during
the scaled up PW implementation. This component would continue to be implemented through
existing arrangements by the COMSIP Promotion Cooperative Union.

                                                97

Component 3: National Institutional Strengthening (NIS) Fund (AFII: US$5 million;
Total: US$12.2 million)

36.     The component will finance national-level cross-cutting issues aimed at improving
accountability and transparency in the use of project resources. It will have two
subcomponents: (i) Technical Support Team to oversee project implementation, and (ii)
Knowledge Generation and Application to strengthen community participation in project
implementation and to document community experiences with service delivery. This
component will facilitate the dissemination of national guidelines for use by Local Authorities
and Community Organizations in project implementation, and strengthen community-level
fiduciary and accountability mechanisms.

37.    Implementation Arrangements. The institutional and implementation
arrangement for the AF II will remain the same as that of the Original project and the AF
I. The MASAF/LDF Technical Support Team (TST) has established a reputation for quality
implementation and satisfactory financial management and procurement capacity. Guidelines
developed over the years and the operational procedures currently in effect and duly
incorporated in the LDF operational manuals will apply.

38.    At the national level, the AF II resources will be channeled through the national
Local Development Fund (LDF). The main management functions at the national level lie
with the: Steering Committee, National Technical Advisory Committee, Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, National Local Government Finance

Committee, and Technical Support Team. The national LDF disburses funds directly to the
local councils‘ LDF accounts for the implementation of sub-projects. Technical oversight is
provided by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and sector ministries.

39.    At the local council level, the LDF is managed under the district commissioner
with an appropriate support system. Funds are received directly from the Ministry of
Finance in line with agreed formulae and conditions attached to each type of grant within the
national LDF budget lines, using methodologies and systems of MASAF 3 APL I. Each
local council receives investment requests from the Area Development Committees, which
obtain appropriate training from the local council and contracted trainers in order to
improve planning processes. At the village level, Village Development Committees, which
have acquired 17 years of community investment management experience under MASAF 1,
MASAF 2, and MASAF 3 APL I will continue to have the overall implementation oversight for
community-level investments.

40.   Credit Closing Date. As per the request of the GoM, the closing date for the
Original Credit and the AF I will be extended from September 2013 to June 30, 2014.

41.    Revision to the Results Framework. The performance indicators have been
updated to reflect the focus of the AF II on Public Works Subproject subcomponent and
COMSIP.

IV.    Appraisal Summary

A. Economic and Financial Analyses

42.     The economic and financial analysis that was carried out for MASAF 3
APL II fully applies to the AF II, which will continue to use the existing
implementation strategy to secure the economic and financial benefits discussed in the
MASAF 3 APL II Project Appraisal Document. The same resource allocation formula,
which is based on population, incidence of poverty, food insecurity, and vulnerability to
HIV/AIDS will be used to broaden and deepen the poverty reduction objective of the project
across the country. According to recent progress reports, 15,869 community assets for social
service provision have been created since MASAF‘s inception in 1995. The demand-driven
nature of the selected sub-projects has ensured that MASAF funds allocated for such
interventions flow to where they are most needed. The direct involvement of communities
has generated significant cost-savings when compared to the cost of similar interventions
executed by other public sector agencies.

B. Technical

43.    The design of the AF II has the advantage of benefiting from the lessons learned and
the experience of implementing the three prior phases of MASAF and the first Additional
Financing. MASAF was selected as a vehicle for channeling critically required cash transfers to
the poorest Malawians because of the readiness of its ―implementation machinery.‖ The

                                             100
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

Operational Manual is updated and amended to reflect the additional activities financed earlier
by the Additional Financing as well as the new guidelines for construction activities in all zones
including earthquake fault zones. To ensure technical viability, communities will be advised to
undertake sub-projects over a period of four months that are simple, small in size, labor
intensive, economically and socially viable, and that can be maintained and operated by
communities in a sustainable way. An Impact Evaluation at the end of MASAF 3 APLI (March
2008) and the Technical Audit carried out at MTR (January 2012) both concluded that sub-
projects implemented by communities were technically sound and were done according to
prescribed designs.


C. Fiduciary Analysis

44.     Financial Management. The most recent financial management review was carried out
in January 2012 and covered budgeting, staffing, account systems, internal and external audit,
flow of funds, and banking arrangements. The findings show that the financial management of
MASAF 3 is generally adequate with the exception of manual processing of transactions and
reports that is error prone and consequently the FM was rated as moderately satisfactory. The
implementing entity is compliant with the Bank's financial management requirements; and there
are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports. For a longtime, MASAF used a
software system called the Sun System for its financial management. The system crashed in
May 2011. The Technical Support Team is in the process of replacing the Sun system with
TEMPRO System. The staff has undergoing training and the system is in place and operational.
In the absence of the Sun System, the Project has been using excel spreadsheet to process
transactions and prepare reports. As a back-up system, the project has IFMIS which is being
used for resources it receives from Government, which is also used in 17 districts.

45.     While the project has generally been producing accurate Interim Financial Report (IFRs),
the reports for the quarters September 2011 and December 2011 have had some problems
because the details of the two loans (original financing and first additional finance) were not
separated. Coupled with the delay in replacement of the accounting package, it is has been
agreed that the project will use Statement of Expenditure (SOE) based disbursement and
documentation of expenditure. The improvement in reports and successful implementation of
the new package will be reviewed by the Bank and if satisfactory a recommendation will be
made to revert to a report based disbursement and documentation using IFRs. Historically,
annual audited financial statements have been received on a timely basis. This not withstanding,
the project is implemented at the subnational level where there is shortage of staff for financial
management and internal audit. The Government is making efforts to address the issue by
normalizing the recruitment of financial analysts that were employed on temporary terms, and
redeploying internal auditors from the center to support districts. Taking these factors into
consideration, the financial management risk associated with this project is rated substantial.


46.   At the Local Authority level, the Project will continue to use the IFMIS which now
has added modules for project management, whereas in LAs where the IFMIS is not yet

                                               101
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

operational, the Local Authority Management Information System (LAMIS) will be used for the
AF II.

47.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Local authorities, through their M&E officers,
will be the main implementing agency for this function and are expected to report to the
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. M&E will consist of the following
components; Computerized LAMIS customized into Project Management module of the
IFMIS, studies, surveys and evaluations, and participatory monitoring and evaluation.

48.      Procurement. The implementation of procurement activities under MASAF 3 APL II
and APL II Additional Financing has been successful. However, the project will now use
streamlined procedures under OP 8.00 which is defined in the agreed procurement plan for
activities to be carried out at the national level by TST. Procurement capacity enhancement
activities at the council and community levels will continue to be broad ened and
strengthened. The MASAF/LDF Technical Support Team at the national level will provide
oversight while the local councils will support procurement management at the sub-project
level.

49.    Given the demand-driven nature of the subprojects, community-level procurement
will not be planned up front. However, guidelines, rules, procedures, and process steps have
been agreed on and are incorporated in the Local Development Fund Procurement Handbook.
The procurement plan for the original project was updated at appraisal to reflect the
requirements for the Additional Financing to cover additional studies, equipment, and staff. A
Procurement Plan for the proposed AF II has been prepared.

50.     A procurement post-review of the local councils‟ 2008-2009 public works cycles
was undertaken by the Technical Support Team in February 2010. The assessment
showed the existence of procurement capacity gaps at the local councils. The project will,
therefore, continue to provide support and guidance to ensure that the local councils have
adequate capacity to carry out procurement processes in a satisfactory manner.

51.    Projects in countries and in sectors that are deemed to be vulnerable to
fraud and corruption as a result of the findings of previous INT investigations should
include Anti-Corruption action plans. There was no INT investigation in the Original Project
and the AF I. The overall risk to implement procurement is considered to be substantial due to
procurement capacity gaps in the local councils and staff attrition at the TST levels. In
order to mitigate the risks identified as a result of procurement capacity assessments, an
Action Plan is in place: The key actions are: (i) speed up the creation and filling of the post of
Procurement Officer for each assembly; (ii) basic procurement training for all procurement
designated staff and appointed procurement officers for each district: (iii) improve Procurement
Records Management by ensuring that complete procurement records are filed separately for
each contract to enable an auditor to follow the complete ―paper trail‖ of procurement; (iv)
undertake procurement and technical audits annually for at least 25 percent of the contracts
awarded at Headquarters and District level and 15 percent of community sub-projects; and (v) as
part of enhanced transparency, advertise contract awards in newspapers with national

                                               102

circulation in addition to dgMarket and UNDB online. The procurement post-review of the
Technical Support Team by the World Bank on November 10, 2011 concluded that its
procurement capacity and performance are satisfactory and there was no indication of mis-
procurement. Procurement under the Project, including under AF II, will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank‘s "Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and Non
Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits & Grants by World Bank
Borrowers, January 2011; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits & Grants by World Bank Borrowers", January 2011 .
In addition, the ―Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in
Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants", dated October 15, 2006,
revised January 2011, shall apply to the Project. National Competitive Bidding procedures
which were reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank with exceptions will also be used in the
procurement of goods, non consulting services, works and services.

D. Safeguards

52.     Environment: The original project has an Environmental and Social Category B
classification and this remains the same for both the first and the second AF. The original
project triggered safeguard policies 4.01, 4.09 and 4.12. The same policies are triggered by the
AF II investments and will be addressed in a similar manner and with the same tools as those
prepared for the original project i.e., the Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF). The ESMF was prepared and disclosed in country and in the Bank's InfoShop for
MASAF 3 APL II in April 2008. This ESMF was used for the AF I and had been re-disclosed
in-country on May 28, 2010 and in the Bank‘s InfoShop on May 27, 2010. The ESMF was re-
disclosed again at the InfoShop and in-country on May 22 and May 25, 2012, respectively. A
total of 21 Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) have been prepared for the
construction of teachers‘ houses in the following districts: Kasungu, Dowa, Mzimba, Karonga,
Ntchisi, Dedza, Ntcheu, Salima, Mangochi, Machinga, Blantyre, Chiradzulo, Neno, Chitipa,
Zomba, Nkhata Bay, Machinga, Thyolo, Likoma Island, Mwanza and Rumphi. The LDF-TST
has disclosed these ESMPs. The ESMPs are prepared in consultation with the Project
Management Committees at community level. The AF II allocated for public works will target
sub-projects that increase community assets and also those that enhance communities‘ natural
resource management awareness and skills. Nonetheless, the project also provides resources for
mitigating any identified social and environmental concerns in sub-project plans and budgets.
The project has set aside resources for further capacity enhancement at all levels.

53.     However, it is important to note that while MASAF 1 and MASAF 2 focused primarily
on the delivery of social and economic infrastructure in support of the government‘s poverty
reduction targets, the MASAF 3 program is distinguished by its emphasis on: (i) improving the
capacity of communities to effectively manage sub-project cycle activities and participate in
local development in a meaningful way; (ii) enhancing the capacity of local authorities to
deliver services; and (iii) acting as a catalyst for enhancing local government systems as part of
the country‘s decentralization agenda.

54.    Under Component 1: Community Livelihood Support Fund, the menu of possible

                                               103
                                                Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

investments includes reforestation and tree felling activities. Under MASAF 3, in the past 5
years, reforestation activities have yielded a total of 1.44 million ha in reforested areas across
the country. The intention and practice, to date, is for communities to harvest the indigenous
species used in the reforestation activities for household use to decrease deforestation and
degradation of primary forests. Indeed, in an effort to promote environmental sustainability, the
project design mandates that a minimum of 20% of the resources used by the communities
from this Fund be applied to environmental enhancement subprojects such as the
aforementioned reforestation activities.

55.      Under this Additional Financing, since the current cumulative impact of the MASAF 3
reforestation activities are relatively large in scale with respect to tree planting and harvesting,
and since the focus of the Additional Financing is to significantly scale up Component 1
activities, including reforestation and harvesting activities, OP 4.36 is triggered. Note, this OP
was not previously triggered at Preparation of MASAF 3 Program as it was not envisioned to
involve such a large area overall. Since OP 4.36 is now triggered, the GoM will not later than
six months after Project Effectiveness, update the previously approved project ESMF to reflect
the core considerations of this OP and include guidelines for preparation of forest management
plans for each community that uses this Fund for reforestation and harvesting activities. The
revised ESMF will be redisclosed in country and in the Bank‘s InfoShop.

56.     Social Impacts. Social impacts are expected to be positive, with project
activities that would gradually lead to an improved quality of life for food-insecure and
vulnerable groups by enhancing their access to social and economic opportunities. In addition
to the advantages accruing to the target beneficiaries, there will be increased economic activity
in the area surrounding the sub-project and in the rural economy. The project ensures that
women are included to access the opportunities available. The vulnerable poor that cannot work
at the PWP interventions will be included in the direct cash transfers. Public works
beneficiaries will be selected through community-based participatory methods as in the case of
the original project, which have been found to reach the intended beneficiaries successfully, as
confirmed in the MASAF 3 APL II public works program baseline analysis and the Beneficiary
Assessment (2012). There will be increased individual participation in savings to support
beneficiaries asset building and prevent negative coping mechanisms when a shock occurs.

57.     However, due to the fact that small works might be required under individual sub-
projects that may lead to loss of access to resources or livelihoods, OP 4.12 was triggered
by the original Project. Given that the Additional Financing would finance similar
investments that might require small works that that may lead to loss of access to resources or
livelihoods, OP 4.12 was also triggered by the Additional Financing. To attend to the
requirements of OP 4.12 under the original Project, the GoM prepared a comprehensive
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), which provides detailed social safeguards policies and
procedural guidance. This RPF will also be used to meet the requirements of OP 4.12 with
respect to small works that may impact community access to assets under subprojects
supported under the Second Additional Financing. To date no Resettlment Action Plans (RAPs)
have been prepared because there has been no land acquisition for the projects funded from the


                                                104
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

credit proceeds. All social issues will also be reported accordingly. This instrument is to be
applied in tandem with the ESMF for the AF II investments. Ongoing support on the social
safeguards side will be provided during implementation of the AF II in close collaboration with
the Bank‘s social safeguards expert assigned to this Project.

58.    Overall, the safeguards work presents a low to moderate risk to the proposed operation.



E. Benefits and Risks

59.     The proposed project is expected to benefit about 586,000 households or 2.9
million people representing over 20 percent of Malawians who will be direct beneficiaries
of the public works program in the form of increased income and reduced food-insecurity.

60.     The overall risk for the Project is rated as Substantial. The risks at the
macroeconomic level include vulnerability to exogenous shocks, such as weather, fiscal and
foreign exchange risks. At the sub-national level, the risks include limited capacity of the local
councils where interventions will be scaled up. To overcome these challenges, a strong linkage
will be created between communities, public sector agencies, civil society organizations, and
the private sector to augment capacity. Capacity enhancement efforts at the district are directly
supported by GIZ, Irish Aide and the DFID particularly on the issue of inadequate numbers of
financial management and internal audit staff. In line with this, the Government has instituted
changes at the district council level such that the councils are directly answerable to the Public
Accounts Committee where audit anomalies are detected; previously the Ministry of Local
Government would respond on all the audit issues on behalf of the councils. This has set
councils on a pathway to improving their performance. The Technical Support Team will
provide technical backstopping and ensure that the handbooks are simplified and copies of
implementation guidelines are available to communities. An intensive Information, Education
and Communication (IEC) will precede project rollout activities to ensure transparency and
accountability among others. However, MASAF - LDF TST have an effective monitoring and
supervision mechanism for tracking the districts that are lagging behind. In addition, the
sensitization process for the AF will include the participation of the Anti Corruption Bureau in
order to reinforce the understanding of whistle blowing and use of dedicated hotlines for
reporting on corrupt practices.

61.     Sustainability. An analysis of the PWP interventions in Malawi shows that they are
wholly funded by donors. In order to build financial sustainability, the Government will start
and increase gradually the percentage share of the total PWP budget. This will take place after
an expenditure review scheduled for June 2013. However, the current PWP under the MASAF
3 have led to sustainability at household level in as far as the beneficiaries are linked to the
COMSIP which enables them to generate additional income which they use for household
enterprises and mitigating other risks they face (Beneficiary Assessment, 2012).

                            ANNEX 3: PROJECT DESCRIPTION


   A. SCALING UP OF PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM

62.     Malawi has faced a number of exogenous shocks in the past few years arising from
volatility in international commodity prices, foreign aid, climate change and natural
disasters including an earthquake in 2010. These shocks have considerable ramifications
for macroeconomic indicators as well as at household level, where rising food and fuel prices
are placing a heavy burden on poor and vulnerable families, jeopardizing human capital gains
achieved in previous years. In order to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of exogenous
shocks at both levels, the Government has requested additional support, to address
macroeconomic imbalances as well as food and fuel price increases in the face of the recent
shocks to the economy. The Government therefore has proposed the implementation of
immediate short term safety net mitigation measures in 2012-13 to cushion the necessary
financial effects of the 50 percent exchange rate liberalization that has led to the price increase
on the population (in the bottom quintiles 1, 2, and 3) or approximately 1.72 million rural and
urban households or 8.6 million people. These mitigation measures would be implemented
through various support mechanisms including PWP cash transfers, direct cash transfers,
agriculture input subsidies and irrigation infrastructure support. MASAF is positioned and
recognized for being able to quickly scale up the delivery mitigating cash transfers to the
poorest households through Public Works.

63.         In order to compensate for 33% income loss as a result of the current of 50
percent exchange rate liberalization the Government would need to provide cash transfers
in the total amount of US$ 125.0 million. It was agreed that this would be done by scaling up
the safety net cash transfers through labor intensive public works using the existing
MASAF/LDF mechanism. This would mean a scale up of the existing MASAF Safety Net
activities by increasing the support for the existing clients in the households which are poor and
able to provide labor, and it would also expand coverage to reach an increased number of
households who would, without the intervention fall into a severe poverty trap. In addition, it
was agreed that AF II for MASAF would include provisions for Direct Support for up to 20% of
the total beneficiaries from labor constrained households who will not be able to engage in
Public Work activities. These include children and elderly heads of households and household
heads with disabilities and or chronic illnesses. The current design and implementation of the
MASAF already allows for the inclusion of HHs who are unable to work by requiring only that
the household member be present for attendance at the worksite and to carry out only light
activities. MASAF monitoring and evaluation estimates that this group under its current
implementation varies from community to community and can range from 5% to 15% of the
participants and transfers in a community. This group of direct support beneficiaries will be
identified through the existing community based targeting mechanism at the local level. The
direct support beneficiaries will also receive same wages like that of the rest of the PW
beneficiaries.

                                                128
                                                Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

64.    Food-insecure households are the main beneficiaries of public works programs
under the MASAF 3 APL II program AF II. This would specifically provide an
effective safety net mechanism for those who are poor and with limited
employment opportunities.

65.     The objectives of targeting food and cash transfers to insecure households are
to increase their cash income and employment opportunities so they can access food and
other basic needs, and to prevent them from falling even deeper into poverty. The
interventions supporting the beneficiaries promote labor intensive activities that provide jobs
for the poor and, in the process, create or improve community assets.

66.      The following principles will guide the interventions for this beneficiary group:

      (a) Public works would be defined as multiple social and economically viable urban and
          rural sub-projects per community to be undertaken over a period of two months per
          cycle that are simple, small in size, labor intensive, which can easily be maintained and
          operated by communities in a sustainable way. Public works in urban areas will be
          conducted all year round while in rural areas they will follow the agriculture harvesting
          and sowing cycle and only be conducted in lean months (except for home kitchen
          gardens). Road works will not be constructed / rehabilitated during the rainy season.

      (b) High Incidence of Poverty. The Integrated Household survey, which is a survey that is
          undertaken periodically by the National Statistical Office, ranks different districts and
          location across Malawi in terms of their relative poverty. The ranking gives weight to
          communities with (i) low literacy rates and a high share of children who drop out
          of school and (ii) a high percentage of female-headed households and a marked lack of
          job opportunities.

      (c) Food Insecurity. The Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC), which
          comprises the Ministry of Development Planning and Cooperation, Ministry
          of Agriculture and Food Security, Food and Agricultural Organization, and civil society
          organizations, undertakes an assessment of the food security situation in Malawi. The
          MVAC report identifies households with missing food entitlements in each agricultural
          planning area across the country. Data from this analysis is used to identify
          beneficiaries for the public works program. Districts that have a larger number of
          families with missing food entitlement have a higher weight in the resource allocation
          formula.

      (d) Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is one of the causes of vulnerability in Malawi.
          It causes morbidity and mortality leading to withdrawal of productive labor from
          the economy. In addition, it increases the dependency ratio through an increase in
          orphans. Data about the incidence of HIV/AIDS is obtained through sentinel surveillance
          sites. Areas with higher incidences of HIV/AIDS have a higher weight than those areas
          with lower prevalence of HIV/AIDS.


                                                 129

   (e) Population. Population is one of the factors that will be used to allocate resources for
       public works program in districts. Urban and Rural Districts with higher population
       will receive a higher weight in the formula for allocating resources than district councils
       with a lower population.

   (f) Food Insecurity. Maize is the major staple food in Malawi. Food security among rural
       and urban households is generally stable nationwide, and a variety of food is available in
       local markets. However, food insecurity and vulnerability are present in some pockets of
       rural Malawi, but these problems vary by region. The southern region has the highest
       proportion of food-insecure households. In districts such as Mwanza, Neno, Chikhwawa,
       Nsanje, Balaka, Thyolo, Mulanje, Phalombe Machinga, and Blantyre production losses of
       up to 50-70 percent were experience in the 2009/2010 growing season due to prolonged
       dry spells, the same is expected in 2012 (WFP).

67.     Rapid Vulnerability Assessment. Although the proposed AF II will have a nationwide
coverage responding to the effects of the emergence situation in the country, however, based on
a rapid assessment, 13 districts in the southern region of Malawi are projected to be food
insecure and will be deliberately targeted with more resources under the AF-II in the first cycle
of the Project implementation.

68.     Targeting and Selection Criteria. Within a district, the target group consists of poor
households with able-bodied persons. These households share many characteristics. They have
high levels of illiteracy, are often headed by women, and lack job opportunities. The children
often drop out of school, and the household is affected by economic and manmade shocks,
natural disasters (droughts, earthquakes, and floods) and crop failure. The targeting of
resources within a local council will be guided by poverty and service coverage indicators as
well as by community demands in line with their capacities. An additional 586,000 households
will be targeted with public works program under the additional financing.

69.    The community members targeted under public works investments will (in a
participatory process using the wealth-ranking tool), identify the food-insecure
households.Female-headed households will constitute at least 40 percent of the beneficiary
households.

70.     Local Councils will target local areas for funding based on food insecurity,
incidence of poverty and other criteria in conformity with guiding principles. Subprojects
will be appraised by the local councils and approved by the District Consultative Forum,
subject to conformity with safeguard requirements.

71.    Monitoring. The local councils and the Technical Support Team will conduct monitoring
to ensure that intended objectives are achieved within the set time frame in the sub-project
management cycles. A specific format provided in the Community Sub-project Management
Handbook requests specific information on physical progress and the corresponding expenditures
and compares them with the original plan. Additional information for monitoring includes:

          i.   Adherence to planned cash transfers to the beneficiaries with the set gender balance;
         ii.   Adherence to technical standards and work norms as per sector ministries‘ specifications;
        iii.   Impact assessment in regard to poverty alleviation;
        iv.    Value of the asset created (to assess whether the undertaking is cost-effective); and
               before implementing subprojects, beneficiary socio economic data will be collected.

72.     Synergies with Other Interventions. The GoM has other rural and urban programs
that are aimed at improving the livelihoods of the poor. These interventions are managed under
different sectors and institutions, but most make efforts to reach the vulnerable and food-
insecure groups. MASAF 3 APL II, through local councils, has a depth of experience in
working with these sector institutions and their programs, and at times manages
their interventions through fund management. In all these cases, an effort is made to combine
efforts with MASAF 3 APL II interventions so that benefits to the target beneficiaries are
maximized. Additional Financing will continue this tradition and make a special effort to
coordinate with other programs. This project aims to contribute to higher food production and
productivity by improving farmers‘ access to critical agricultural inputs. The food-insecure
farmers participating in the public works program activities will earn wages and they might
decide to use the income they get to access subsidized agricultural

73.    The following are the principal vulnerable groups identified in studies of poverty in
Malawi:
   a) The landless. Food insecure households are most dependent on agriculture, earning
      almost three-quarters of their income from farming. Most Malawian families rely on their
      own production of maize; half of all calories consumed are home-produced. Households
      with little or no land are thus less able to produce enough food to eat during the year; and
      suffer the double-problem of having to buy more maize to fill the gap, while at the same
      time having lower cash incomes to buy grain. Households that own no land rely on ganyu
      - providing informal agricultural labour to others – and tend to be among the very poorest.
      The Draft ―Effective and Inclusive Targeting Study of Social Support programs In Africa:
      Case of Malawi‖ (Dec 2012) indicates that the CFSVA survey found that 73 percent of
      such households had inadequate or borderline food consumption, compared to only 48
      percent in the rural population as a whole.

      b) Those with very small landholdings. The land holdings tend to be small throughout
          Malawi, due to high population density and repeated sub-division of plots55. Many
          households have some land, but the amount is so small that they are unable to produce




55
     On average, excluding the landless, households own 1.2 ha. of land (Poverty Assessment, World Bank (2007)


                                                        131
                                                       Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

          sufficient food. In the poorest decile, landholdings average only 0.17 ha per capita. One
          small sample study found that households had 63 percent higher vulnerability to poverty if
          they owned less than the mean holding of 0.24 ha.

      c) Female-headed households widowed and divorced. Female-headed households make up
          about 23% of the population. They tend to own less land, make less from off-farm work,
          and be more food-insecure; on average they have 14 percent lower consumption than
          male-headed households. Widows and divorced women suffer particularly as the result of
          lack of assets to assets.

      d) Child-headed households, elderly and single-parent-headed HHs; orphans. There
          were about 873,000 orphans in 2008, representing 12 percent of the child population.
          However many of these are children with one parent alive, or who have been successfully
          absorbed into non-poor families. Poverty is particularly acute among child-headed
          households, and those in which grandparents are supporting orphans with no working
          aged-adult in the household. Otherwise the data does not show that households with an
          orphan in them tend to be much poorer than others on average (MPVA, fig3.7, p.71, and
          Table 3, below).

      e) The elderly and the disabled. About 4 percent of the population is aged 65 or older, and
          another 3.8 percent are estimated to live with some form of disability (and clearly there is
          a lot of overlap between these two groups). There is no definitive data on poverty rates
          among the elderly or the disabled, since poverty is measured at the household level. The
          elderly or disabled may very well be poorer than average, but at the same time many of
          them are adequately absorbed within non-poor households, so identifying the ultra-poor
          among them has to be done on a case-by-case basis.

      f) Households affected by disasters. Households in Malawi are affected by both drought
          and flooding; the major drought of 2005/06 put some 5 million people at risk of food
          insecurity; in addition smaller numbers are regularly affected by flooding, with eight
          significant floods affecting 200,000-500,000 people each between 2001 and 200756. The
          more prevalent problem, however, is that lower-than-average rainfall in any given year
          results in low levels of household production of maize, and thus below-acceptable
          consumption levels.

     g) Persons living with HIV/AIDS. The HIV prevalence rate in Malawi was 11 percent in
          2009, the eighth highest in the world. By this estimate some 0.9 million persons are living
          with HIV/AIDS. While HIV/AIDS is a national disaster, and has dramatically reduced life
          expectancy, households affected by HIV/AIDS do not appear to be poorer on average than
          those who are not affected57. This is likely because of support from extended family and
          community, combined with the fact that AIDS tends to be primarily a disease of the less-
          poor. This does not mean that there aren‘t people suffering from HIV/AIDS who are in
          desperate situations, and need a safety net to support them. The issue from a targeting
          point of view is that they need to be identified on a case-by-case basis, and that providing
          transfers to all people who are HIV positive is not necessary, as a poverty-reduction
          measure.

     h) Unemployed/under-employed in urban areas. Wage employment opportunities are
          scarce in Malawi, with less than 10 percent of the work force employed in the formal
          sector. While the lack of employment results in substantial impoverishment for some
          urban dwellers, it needs to be emphasized that deep poverty in Malawi is still
          overwhelmingly a rural phenomenon, with 96 percent of the 3.4 million ultra-poor
          (including those with labor) living in rural areas in 2005.

       B. Project Components

     i.   Component 1: Community Livelihood Support Fund
       a. Local Authority Fund: Public Works Subproject Program

74.      Labor intensive public works are proposed as the main instrument for cushioning
the financial effects of the 50 percent exchange rate liberatization and the price increase on
the population. These works are expected to increase incomes and food security of poor
households who participate in the creation or rehabilitation of community assets. The public
works subproject program (PWSP) sub-component of the ongoing MASAF is proposed to be
expanded in 2012-13 with an additional financing of USD 50.0 million. The coverage of the
PWSP works is in all districts in the country. This includes both rural and peri-urban areas
(which include Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu and Blantyre Cities). In peri-urban areas PWSP
supports road rehabilitation, drainage improvements and environmental projects.

75.     The public works would benefit whole communities and a multiple number of
community works would be conducted per community over this period of time based on the

  For example the AIDS incidence is higher in urban areas, and in the Central region, both of which have lower than
average poverty rates; see also MVPA (2007)

    operations and implementation manual of MASAF-LDF. The implementation of this
    additional support will use the modality of the existing MASAF 3 APL II Project. The total
    budget to reach 1.72 million people based on an average work days of 12 days per month for 4
    months is estimated by the Government to be US$ 125 million. Towards this objective the
    Government proposed that the US$ 50.0 million from the World Bank through additional
    financing be allocated for the scaling up public works programs of MASAF/LDF which will be
    able to cover cash transfer to 586,000 households and the associated capital costs and the costs of
    administration and delivery. With the Additional Financing a financing gap of US$83.7 million
    would remain which would need to be met by Government own resources and or other Donor co-
    financing. The IDA allocation includes PW payment budget of US$ 33.75 million (68% of total
    budget; 15% of transfer budget for capital costs of PWs, equivalent to US$ 6.75 million, 5% of
    transfer budget to cover administration cost for implementing districts, equivalent to US$ 2.2;
    5% of the transfer budget equivalent to US$ 2.25 million to support the complementary COMSIP
    activities. In addition 10% of the overall budget equivalent to US$ 5 million would be allocated
    to cover the management and administration cost of the TST.

    76.         The public work activities will be implemented during the slack season of major
    livelihood/agriculture activities and when the beneficiaries have the most need for additional
    income to cover their family needs including food and non-food expenditures and in puts for
    agricultural activities. Following the existing implementation modality of MASAF, the public
    works activities supported through this additional financing will be implemented in two cycles
    i.e. July – December 2012 and April – June 2013. Public Works would target the urban and rural
    ultra poor and poor households.

       b. Community Fund: Community Savings and Investment Promotion

77.     Savings and investment is a sub component under the Community Livelihoods
Support Component within the MASAF 3 APL II LDF Mechanism Project. Activities under
this sub component aim at creating opportunities for community savers and entrepreneurs
especially beneficiaries of Public Works Program to move into higher income trajectories hence
improve livelihoods and in the process graduate from safety nets and also become resilient to
shocks such as drought. The savings and investment interventions in the PWSP are a response to
closing the sustainability gap that exists in the implementation of PWSP. Over years the
implementation of PWSP tended to end at the disbursement of wages. This initiative brings in a
scope beyond the wage disbursement function. It has become a PWP Plus initiative that sustains
beneficiaries beyond the PWP implementation period.

78.     Implementation of activities under this sub component follows a Graduation model
that entails these stages; Group formation: Institutional building: Financial Literacy:
Business Management: Cooperative/ Association management. At every stage of the
graduation model groups and members meet qualification criteria in order for them to move to a
higher level of services and receive capacity building support. As groups move to higher level of
services, their maturity improves and sustainability is ensured.
COMSIP Cooperative Union which evolved from a component under the Malawi Social Action
Fund (MASAF 3 APL I) is the implementing agency for the savings and investment activities.
The institution is a member-owned savings and Investment institution created to provide
financial services especially savings mobilization and investment promotion to the un-served and
underserved peri-urban and rural communities. The vision of COMSIP is to “create a culture of
vibrant, sustainable savings and investments amongst its cooperative societies in Malawi?. Its
mission is to “deliver flexible savings and investment products and services to economically
empower Malawians to improve their livelihoods through member owned savings and investment
cooperatives?.

79.     Funds available for the savings and investment amounting to US$ 3.72 million have
so far been used to mobilize communities to form savings and investment groups; and to
build the capacities of communities and extension workers in financial literacy and business
management over a three year period. The beneficiaries of this initiative include communities
participating in Public Works program and other phased out community empowerment projects
such as the Skills and Income Generation Project funded by AfDB. A total of 3,298 groups have
been formed with 73,655 beneficiaries of whom 61% are female covering all the 28 Districts
Councils in Malawi. Over the three years, communities have mobilized MWK216, 703,999 in
savings. Average savings amount to MWK 2,942 per individual. These groups have opened their
bank accounts with commercial banks and this contributes towards their financial inclusion and
exposure to financial institutions for other financial services.

80.   The savings mobilized have been invested by the groups for on lending to members
and in some cases for group investment such as bee keeping, piggery, irrigation farming

among other group investments. The members in turn are using the savings to invest in small
scale enterprises. The types of enterprises include buying and selling of agricultural produce,
investment in livestock cash crop farming such as cotton, production such as bakery, winery, and
mushroom growing among others.

81.     All the 3,298 groups which have been formed have gone through institutional
development to ensure group cohesiveness for sustainability of the groups. Further the group
members have been trained in Financial Literacy and Business Management and some have been
trained in cooperative member education and have been registered as cooperatives with the
registrar of Cooperatives in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The training program in
Financial Literacy equips the groups with skills to enable them to manage group savings through
proper savings management procedures and record keeping, and also build individuals towards
money management and financial freedom, while the Business Management Training program
equips the groups with skills to enable them manage their businesses successfully. A total of
1,275 groups with 27,252 beneficiaries of which 65 percent are female have been trained in
financial literacy and business management. The skills gained have helped improve their
business performance and leverage more savings.

82.     Results of the Beneficiary assessment study revealed that the savings and investment
initiatives has contributed greatly to the communities‟ access to savings and loans which has
resulted in employment generation through business ventures and has in turn led to improved
household welfare. The rural communities is poorly served by financial institutions and the
creation of the savings and investment groups has greatly improved access to financial services
provided by these groups. Through the COMSIP Union that provides support in products and
services suited to the community environment, banking alike services with associated
accountability tools have been embraced by various community members.

83.     The perceived demand by communities to engage in savings and investment
activities is overwhelming. The AF II amounting to US$2.25million will be used to facilitate
the training of groups in financial literacy and business management to close the current gap
between groups that have been formed and those that require capacity building in this area which
currently stands at 32%. The funds will also be used to train the groups in higher enterprise
development initiatives such as value addition skills as such leveraging more savings and
improving their livelihoods. Additionally, the AF II will also be used to facilitate the formation
of more cooperatives from the PWP beneficiaries and affiliation of cooperatives to the COMSIP
Cooperatives Union for sustainability.

84.      As more and more community members embrace the savings and investment
concept through the Public Works Program (PWP) Plus initiative and move into higher
income trajectories, their involvement will help create room for other community members to
enter into safety nets as they graduate from them. Thus the graduation model is geared to
nurturing community members understand their roles in moving out of their poverty through
activities initiated by them while getting initial support from government and donors.

85.    It has been observed that PWP assets once created during the period of
implementation, the maintenance of such structures is not considered and the creation of the
savings and investment groups cans be a source of community resource to take over the
maintenance as advocates of development in their respective villages. One of the tools that
COMSIP uses is the 8 Jobs that members of COMSIP need to adhere to and community
development is one such element in the 8 jobs. It will be encouraging bringing into practice this
type of intervention so that the created assets are sustainable as these are useful in conveying
products to markets; the very same products the members are producing.

 ii.   Component 3: National Institutional Strengthening (NIS) Fund (AFII: US$5
       million; Total: US$12.2 million)

86.     The component will finance national-level cross-cutting issues aimed at improving
accountability and transparency in the use of project resources. It will have two
subcomponents: (i) Technical Support Team to oversee project implementation, and (ii)
Knowledge Generation and Application to strengthen community participation in project
implementation and to document community experiences with service delivery. This
component will facilitate the dissemination of national guidelines for use by Local Authorities
and Community Organizations in project implementation, and strengthen community-level
fiduciary and accountability mechanisms.

ANNEX 4: IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

A. Implementation of Environment and Social Safeguards under the MASAF 3 APL II

1. Introduction

87.    Building upon the previous operations, the Malawi Social Action Fund III APL II
(MASAF 3 APL II) has in place both an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which were developed
and cleared by the World Bank to further guide the implementation of social and environmental
considerations and compliance with the triggered safeguards policies requirements.

88.     The parent-project (MASAF) was assessed as an environmental and social category
B project due to likely sub-project activities such as the construction of teachers‟ houses
and rehabilitation of roads. It triggered three safeguards policies, namely OP/BP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment), OP/BP 4.09 (Pest Management) and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary
Resettlement) that led to (i) the preparation - in a participatory manner with various stakeholders
- of both an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF), and (ii) the public disclosure of the above, both in-country and at the
World Bank InfoShop prior to appraisal. Hence, since MASAF 3 APL II follows the same
footsteps, therefore the same triggered safeguards policies and instruments will be maintained.

89.      However, it is important to note that while MASAF 1 and MASAF 2 focused
primarily on the delivery of social and economic infrastructure in support of the
government‟s poverty reduction targets, the MASAF 3 program is distinguished by its
emphasis on: (i) improving the capacity of communities to effectively manage sub-project
cycle activities and participate in local development in a meaningful way; (ii) enhancing the
capacity of local authorities to deliver services; and (iii) acting as a catalyst for enhancing
local government systems as part of the country‟s decentralization agenda. Under
Component 1: Community Livelihood Support Fund, the menu of possible investments includes
reforestation and tree felling activities. Under MASAF 3, in the past 5 years, reforestation
activities have yielded a total of 1.44 million ha in reforested areas across the country. The
intention and practice, to date, is for communities to harvest the indigenous species used in the
reforestation activities for household use to decrease deforestation and degradation of primary
forests. Indeed, in an effort to promote environmental sustainability, the project design mandates
that a minimum of 20% of the resources used by the communities from this Fund be applied to
environmental enhancement subprojects such as the aforementioned reforestation activities.
Under this Additional Financing, since the current cumulative impact of the MASAF 3
reforestation activities are relatively large in scale with respect to tree planting and harvesting,
and since the focus of the Additional Financing is to significantly scale up Component 1
activities, including reforestation and harvesting activities, OP 4.36 is triggered. Note, this OP
was not previously triggered at preparation of the MASAF 3 Program as it was not envisioned to
involve such a large area overall. Since OP 4.36 is now triggered, the GoM will, not later than
six months after Project Effectiveness, update the previously approved project ESMF to reflect

                                                141
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

the core considerations of this OP and include guidelines for preparation of forest management
plans for each community that uses this Fund for reforestation and harvesting activities. The
revised ESMF will be redisclosed in country and in the Bank‘s InfoShop.

90.     These two project approved safeguard instruments (ESMF and RPF) will be
updated to address the core consideration of OP 4.36 and capture the new dynamic shift in
the targeted project areas along with the project‟s vision. Since this proposed project will be
operated as an Emergency response project, thus under the guidelines of OP 8.00, therefore, all
measures will be duly taken to ensure the above mentioned updates are done within the 6-month
―Grace Period‖ granted by the policy for emergency operations. Once updated, these will
ultimately be disclosed both in-country and at the InfoShop as prescribed by OP 8.00 policy
guidelines. Meanwhile, the project safeguards team will also ensure that based on the ground
context, the right updates are brought in the safeguards instruments prior to their public
disclosure.

91.     Most of the envisaged environmental and social impacts that are being realized from
the implementation of the sub-projects under the MASAF 3 APL II are localized, site
specific, minimal, short term and can be mitigated. They include disturbance of soil from
digging of foundations and pits, localized air pollution resulting from site preparation for
construction, dust spray, especially during rehabilitation/construction, vegetation clearing during
site establishment, brick molding, and excavation of sand nearby river beds and quarrying for
quarry stone which leaves scars on the land that need rectifying.

92.      The Malawi Social Action Fund 3 APL II LDF Mechanism is being implemented
through Local Development Fund Technical Support Team (LDF TST), a government inter
governmental fiscal transfer agency that has been established to coordinate financing and
implementation of Local development activities at Local levels. The implementation of
activities, including civil works under this project is done at district and community level.

Approach to Implementation of Environmental and Social management Activities

93.     The implementation of Social and Environmental Management Activities under the
MASAF 3 APL II takes place at community level. The individual site specific ESMPs are
kept at the subproject level while the consolidated ESMPs for all the subprojects in each
district are kept at the district headquarters. As it has already been the case from the
beginning, the original project has an Environmental and Social Focal Point who works in
tandem with all the designated District Environmental and Social Officers whom facilitate the
screening of environmental and social effects of the project activities using a prescribed checklist
(See Annex 1 on page 39 of the MASAF Resettlement Policy Framework and Part D on page 40
of the MASAF 3 APL II Environmental and Social Management Framework) before the
commencement of the civil works. Through this assessment, the potential social and
environmental effects are identified, subprojects are categorized and appropriate additional
safeguards instruments prepared and disclosed accordingly. The District Environmental and
Social Officers in close consultation with both the beneficiary communities and project

                                                142
                                               Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

management committees develop the Social and Environmental Management Plans (ESMPs) and
where necessary, the Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (ARAPs). As prescribed in the
World Bank operational safeguards policies and the ESMF, this screening is done systematically
for all subprojects that are to be funded in the recipient district/ Local Council. The District
Environmental and Social Officers then consolidate the respective individual subprojects ESMPs
into a blended district Social and Environmental Management Plan (ESMP).

94.    Following is a table of the safeguards instruments that have been prepared,
consulted upon, and disclosed for the original project and the two Additional Financing
operations:

1.2 Outcomes of the Social and Environmental Screening

95.     The outcomes of Environmental and Social Screening processes across districts have
revealed that there are a number of social and environmental impacts in sub project areas.
As a result, the district authorities in consultation with the beneficiary communities have
developed ESMPs to adequately mitigate the negative effects while maximizing/mainstreaming
the positive ones. A number of mitigation measures are proposed in the ESMPs and implemented
by the communities themselves under the collaborative supervision of both the District
Environmental and Social Officer and the project Environmental and Social Focal Point. Some
of the identified social and environmental effects that have been identified include loss of top
soil, spread of dust, excavation of barrow pits, littering of soil rubble at the construction sites,
loss of vegetation, potential for spread of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV/AIDS.

1.2.1 Implementation of Social and Environmental Management and Mitigation activities

96.      Once the screening has been done and the potential social and environmental
impacts are identified, and an action plan developed, the District Council undertakes
training of the project management committees on how to deal with the identified impacts.
The mitigation measures are implemented by the communities themselves. However, the project
management committees are also allocated resources equivalent to 2.5 percent of the total sub
project cost for administration and implementation of the social and environmental management
activities. A number of District Councils have submitted their ESMPs to the Local Development
Fund Technical Support Team for consideration. These include, among others, Karonga, Ntchisi,
Kasungu, and Dedza. A monitoring report for Karonga and ESMP for Kasungu districts are
attached to this report for further information.

1.3 Outcomes of the Resettlement Screening

97.     The outcome of the Resettlement Screening for all sub projects under the MASAF 3
APL II so far have indicated that there is no need to physically resettle people or restrict
access of any individuals to land. This has therefore not necessitated the preparation of any
Resettlement Action Plans by both the communities and the District Councils. The major
contributing factors to this is that MASAF supports the construction of teachers houses on pieces
of land that is already secured by and for existing schools. As such new pieces of land are not
required for construction of teachers‘ houses.

98.     In addition, other works under the public works program involve the rehabilitation
of existing community roads. Under MASAF, no new roads, per se, are created due to the
short duration of the works (only 12 days). This means that no new road can be completed
within 12 days, especially so because only hand held tools such as holes and picks are used in the
rehabilitation of these roads. No heavy equipment is used in the proposed Public Works
Program. Owing to these two factors, no Involuntary Resettlement has taken place so far and
therefore no RAPs have been developed under the MASAF 3 APL II.

99.     The Mid-Term Review Mission also noted that, no involuntary resettlement was
recorded by the subproject as: (i) most sub-projects, especially construction of teachers‘
houses and school blocks was being done on land that already belonged to schools; (ii) road
projects under the public works program involved very slight/minor rehabilitation of existing
roads hence issues of loss of assets, restriction to access to livelihood support means, or transfer
of land ownership did not arise. However, in projects like Sefu COMSIP group in Karonga
where the committee reported to have bought the land where they constructed a fish pond, the
mission recommended that compliance with RAP requirements would need to be followed up
and established as this was not completed during the MTR mission. The MTR team could not
review the relevant documents because they were not made available on the site at the time of
the MTR mission. The project safeguards team followed up on the matter and has received
formal evidence regarding the sale of land between the owner and the Sefu COMSIP Group.

2.0 Implementation Progress of Safeguards and measures for Improvement

100. The IDA‟s Implementation Support Missions to the MASAF 3 APL II identified a
relatively good capacity of Local authorities that needs to be further strengthened for
proper implementation of safeguard measures. In order to strengthen capacity on compliance
with environmental and social safeguards issues, various training workshop were organized
countrywide for all levels. By August 2011, eleven subject matter specialists per district had
been trained as trainers in social and environmental safeguards, to enable them to
cascade/replicate the training downwards to the extension workers who would then further train
the stakeholders including women, the poor and most vulnerable groups on the ground.


                                                144
                                             Attachment B: Malawi Third Social Action Fund (MASAF 3) APL II

101. Specific points of training included (i) the relevance of the ESMF and the RPF; (ii)
public awareness raising, social and environmental inspections; (iii) audits and monitoring of
physical infrastructure; (iv) checking that the community activities are in line with District
Environmental Action Plans and (v) guidelines for appraisal and enforcement mechanisms. The
project management committees (PMCs) are also upraised on cross-cutting issues including
environmental and social issues prior to sub-project implementation.

102. The Midterm review of the MASAF 3 APL II confirmed the implementation of an
ESMF as required by the OP 4.01. However, environmental and social assessments were
implemented unevenly across sub-projects. The mission noted that the implementation of the
ESMF was not consistent and institutionalized in all projects and /or Local Councils across the
country. The Environmental and Social Screening Forms, the Environmental and Social
Management Plans (ESMPs), and reports, and Environmental Social Checklists were only
available in some council such as Karonga and Blantyre while evidence of the same could not be
found in Mzimba and Zomba. Generally environmental and social safeguards featured in the
quarterly progress reports unevenly and not in a systematic fashion. The preparation mission
rates the environmental risks to date as low to moderate.

103. As a result of the findings and recommendations of the MTR, the LDF TST noted
the challenges in the implementation of the Social and Environmental safeguards and has
developed a plan to improve the implementation of the same. The Additional Financing
preparation mission reviewed the plan and found it suitable for implementing and mitigating the
social and environmental issues. The rating for the safeguards at MTR was MU. Since
January 2012, a number of activities on the work plan have been implemented as detailed below.
The current rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

B. Financial Management Assessment

Summary

104. The MASAF Financial Management system has been rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. The financial management objective of the MASAF Midterm Review (MTR)
mission was to assess the continued adequacy of the financial management system. The project
has been submitting interim financial reports on time and in the agreed format and content except
for quarters ended Sept 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011 where the IFRs had some problems due
to lack of separation of two different loans. The Audited Financial Reports have been prepared
and submitted on time for all the years except for the year 2011 when reports were submitted two
months late. All the reports have carried a clean audit opinion.

105. There are a number of challenges that still need addressing:
   i.   At the design stage of the project it was recognized that FM capacity was weak in the
        District Councils and one of the sub-component was targeted at the addressing this.
        The FM staffing in the districts remains weak. The National Local Government
        Finance Committee (NLGFC) and Ministry of Local Government should focus on
        strengthening the FM staffing in all districts.
   ii.   While funds flow has generally worked well, a good number of councils and
        communities face problems with some of the commercial banks which are failing to
        provide timely bank statements.
   iii.  Another major issue requiring urgent action is replacement of an accounting system
        at the TST. The Sun System package that was being used got corrupted when the
        project was trying to upgrade the operating system. It is clear that the controls that
        were employed during the upgrade were weak leading to corruption of both the
        operating system and the Sun System. The problem was exacerbated by having only
        one back up that was also corrupted during the same time. This problem occurred in
        May 2011 and since then the LDF has been processing and producing reports
        manually. The project has now bought TOMPRO accounting package and the system
        is operational.

ISR FM Rating

106.   The Financial Management system has been rated Moderately Satisfactory.

FM Risk Rating

107.   There has been no change in the FM risk. The Project FM risk is still at Substantial.

FM REVIEW: FINDINGS AND ACTION PLAN

   Budgeting

108. The TST, working with the NLGFC takes the leading role in consolidating budgets
of the Project‟s implementing agencies. The TST has an established system for analyzing
variances from budget. This tool was included in the SUN system to ensure that Local
Authorities‘ budgets were closely monitored. It is important that this same tool is maintained in
the new package. It is only through this measure that Local Authorities can ensure that Projects
are completed within the allocated budget. The automation of accounting systems in the Local
Authorities would allow for faster and more reliable financial information; and proper
monitoring of budget execution of the entire Project.

   Accounting

109. The TST was supposed to migrate to EPICOR system within the MoF used by
government for its disbursement and financial reporting. This move was meant to enable the
TST to use the government IFMIS system. To date this arrangement has not materialized and the
TST has been using the SUN system for accounting and financial reporting purposes up to May
2011. The SUN system had the functionality to capture and report transactions in a multi donor,
multi components and sub components and in a multi cost category environment. The new
package will incorporate these features.

110. A significant number of the District Councils are not yet on IFMIS. To date IFMIS
has been rolled out to 27 District Councils. Seven councils are yet to be considered for IFMIS.
The District councils which are not on IFMIS are either doing their accounting manually or using
other accounting software packages.

   Staffing

111. Significant progress has been made to address capacity FM gaps at the District
Council level through recruitment of Financial Analyst under Irish Aid. The Financial
Analysts are working in support of Director of Finances. The Financial Analyst positions are
not permanent. It is important that steps are taken to ensure that there is continued capacity after
the expiry of Financial Analysts‘ contracts. Most of the District Councils have significantly
improved their staffing capacity after integration of sector ministries into the councils even
though the integration has not been formalized.

112. Staffing problems persist under internal auditing with only 10 out of twenty eight
district councils filled with the Internal Auditor position. The ten auditors are assisted by
Central Internal Audit Unit to cover all the district councils. The City/Municipal Councils have
their own internal audit functions and are all working well.

   Internal Control and Internal Audit

113. The internal control systems of the District Councils and TST were reviewed and
assessed during the mission as adequate. However, it was noted that controls would be further
strengthened by filling Internal Audit vacancies. Currently the staffing constraint is partially
mitigated as explained above.

   Funds Flow and Disbursements

114. The District Councils are operating LDF Bank Accounts which are running on a
Credit Ceiling Arrangement which is used for all Government bank accounts. There have
been delays in the flow of funds to the communities through this system due to lack of proper
knowledge of how the credit Ceiling arrangement works. It was expected that with time, the
system would work well and communities would have the funds at the right time. The flow of
funds takes a long route from MoF to communities passing through LDF, NLGFC and District
Councils. Most local councils are using MSB for operating bank accounts. MSB has problems in
producing timely bank statements and this affects verification of bank transactions and
reconciliations. The Accountant General has promised to discuss this issue with the concerned
bank and come up with a lasting solution.

115. Disbursement has been based on six months forecast reflected in the IFR. Due to
lack of a proper accounting system and errors experienced in recent submission of IFRs, it was
agreed that the project should revert to SOE based disbursement.

   Financial Reporting

116. The Project is up to date with IFRs. The IFRs have consistently been of good quality in
substance and form and are being submitted in a timely fashion. The quarters of September and
December had IFRs with problems due to lack of separation of reporting for two different loans.
This problem has now been addressed.

   External Audit

117. The project has been producing audited accounts with a clean audit opinion. The
accounts have been submitted on time except for 2010 when the accounts were submitted after
December 31, 2011.

C. PROCUREMENT

118. The implementation of procurement activities under MASAF 3 APL II and APL II
Additional Financing has been successful. However, the project will now use streamlined
procedures under OP 8.00 which is defined in the agreed procurement plan for activities to be
carried out at the national level by TST. Procurement capacity enhancement activities at the
council and community levels will continue to be broadened and strengthened. The
MASAF/LDF Technical Support Team at the national level will provide oversight while the
local councils will support procurement management at the sub-project level.

119. Given the demand-driven nature of the subprojects, community-level procurement
will not be planned up front. However, guidelines, rules, procedures, and process steps have
been agreed on and are incorporated in the Local Development Fund Procurement Handbook.
The procurement plan for the original project was updated at appraisal to reflect the
requirements for the Additional Financing to cover additional studies, equipment, and staff. A
Procurement Plan for the proposed AF II has been aggred upon with the Govenment.

2.       The proposed AF II forms part of a rapid response package to the Government of
Malawi (GoM), which has embarked on difficult economic reforms. The AF II for IRLADP
responds to GoM‘s request dated April 26, 2012, to: (i) scale-up a number of its activities from
11 to 28 districts; (ii) consolidate project achievements and successes; (iii) prepare a future
irrigation investment framework; and (iv) extend project duration beyond its current closing date
of June 30, 2013. A contingency window is being added as part of the restructuring of the
package under AF II. The justification for inclusion of this AF II in the rapid response program
is the cushioning effect that the large scale up of the Inputs for Assets Program would have on
approximately 230,0000 additional poor rural households, providing them with much needed
inputs and community assets that increase their resilience. Non-emergency elements that are
included would enhance a strategic program to address climate resilience in rural livelihoods in
the mid- and long term. This scale-up complements other elements of the GoM‘s rapid response
program through a short-term increase in the budget allocation to the Farm Input Subsidy
Program (FISP) and the permission for tobacco farmers to exchange their foreign currency
earnings at the prevailing market exchange rate. The last measure is an immediate response
mechanism, the FISP and Inputs for Assets (IFA) increase will support rural livelihoods
throughout the first year and both IFA and irrigation support under IRLADP upscaling will
throughout the first few years and thereafter support more resilient, diversified and sustainable
livelihoods. . The proposed IRLADP AF II is consistent with the parameters of OP/BP 8.0 and
OP/BP 13.20 related to emergency AF operations. Overall project performance of IRLADP
(original and AF) is currently rated as satisfactory for the achievement of project development
objectives (PDO) and implementation performance (IP). The project is in substantial compliance
with loan covenants and the AF is economically justified.

3.      Under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP)
process, GoM has developed and adopted the Agricultural Sector Wide Approach
(ASWAp), which provides a framework for further investments across the agriculture sector.
The World Bank financed ASWAp-Support Project (ASWAp-SP) has played a crucial role in the
preparation of the ASWAp. IRLADP was designed and approved before the ASWAp was
developed, but has de facto become part of the ASWAp investment framework. The
restructuring and second additional financing of IRLADP will also be used to further align the
project with the ASWAp. The proposed AF also responds adequately to the objectives of the

                                                 153
                                    Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

World Bank‘s Africa Strategy, in particular the second pillar “Vulnerability and Resilience? by
helping Malawi to get better prepared to address dry spells and droughts, reduce food shortage
and mitigate climate change. To strengthen this aspect of the project, a rapid response financing
window will be introduced which can be used for future emergencies.

4.      The project is being restructured to reflect changes in the project design, including
revised PDO, an additional component, a revised and updated results framework,
implementation arrangements, and fiduciary arrangements. The proposed AF II would
more than double the number of poor rural households benefiting from the project from an
originally targeted 196,550 to approximately 500,000. The project closing date has been
extended from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The closing date will be further extended under
the proposed AF II to December 31, 2014.

II.    Background and Rationale for Additional Financing

5.      Background. Persistent external imbalances compounded by reduced donor inflows, low
tobacco proceeds and other supply-side bottlenecks have contributed to the weakening of
macroeconomic performance over the past year. This has, in turn, contributed to a widening of
balance of payment and budget gaps and the slowdown in real economic activities resulting in
persistent fuel supply and foreign exchange availability constraints. However, with a recent
change in political leadership, Malawi has opened a new window of opportunity to implement
reforms to address serious and long-standing economic and governance challenges. The GoM
has already reached out to key stakeholders including civil society, Development Partners, and
countries in the region indicating that its top priories are to address economic, security and social
concerns. On the economic side, the GoM supports urgent steps to restore macro stability, and
would support flexible exchange rates, with full attention to its impact on the poor. Substantial
discussions have commenced with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on addressing the
restoration of its program, and with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to revive the
energy compact. This proposed AF II is part of the World Bank‘s support to the rapid response
economic package and primarily intended to support the rural poor, cushioning them from the
current economic hardships, as well as consolidate and prepare irrigation investments for longer
term sustainability of the sector.

6.     Agriculture remains the main source of growth and exports in Malawi. With 85 percent
of the population residing in the rural areas, the sector accounts for over 80 percent of the
country‘s employment, over one-third of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and about 80
percent of merchandise exports. The primary staple for most of these households is maize. Over
70 percent of all farmers in the country cultivate less than one hectare (ha) and a significant
number of these farmers still struggle to produce enough food to meet their annual consumption
requirements. Agriculture remains dominantly rain fed and dependent on one short and variable
annual rainy season. The country continues to experience severe dry spells, especially in the
southern region, rendering a significant number of households perpetually food insecure. The




                                                  154
                                       Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

largest and most costly investment program in the agriculture sector is the FISP which is
designed to attain food security and is targeted towards the poorer households. The FISP has
been successful in many ways64, but is also relatively costly and dependent on both imports and
favorable weather conditions, while rates of malnutrition and especially stunting levels among
children, remain high. In areas where production has been good, poor roads have often
prevented the marketing of surpluses.

7.      High population density and poverty have led to significant human pressure on the
environment and degradation of Malawi‟s natural resource base, notably land and forests.
The growing population increases the land area under cultivation and exploits forests and
woodlands for firewood and charcoal production. The resulting deforestation, run-off, flash
floods, soil erosion and sedimentation, are serious threats to the environment and natural
resource base. These problems are a direct result of unsustainable land use and management
practices, and insufficient soil and water conservation measures.

8.       The GoM gives high priority to sustainable agricultural land and water
management, including irrigation development, which reduces dependence on favorable
weather conditions, while boosting productivity. The ASWAp aims to increase the area under
sustainable irrigation from 72,000 ha to 280,000 ha, through the Green Belt Initiative 65. Support
to a thriving irrigated agriculture sector is predicated on a demand-driven, service oriented
approach with the full participation of farmers and commercial interests, as spelled out in the
National Irrigation Policy and Development Strategy (NIPDS). This has to take place in the
context of ongoing economic and civil administrative reform and an over-arching need to shift
from a centralized (top-down, supply-driven) system to a de-centralized (bottom-up, demand-
driven) planning, development and management system in the irrigation sub-sector. The GoM
and Development Partners have started a number of initiatives for irrigation financing and
development, and while IRLADP has pioneered some of the reforms, irrigation development is
still haphazard.

9.    Current Project. The original IRLADP was financed by an IDA Grant (US$40 million),
and was co-financed by an International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) loan in the
amount of US$8 million and Government‘s and beneficiary counterpart funding in the amount of
US$4.5 million. The original PDO was to: (i) raise agricultural productivity and net incomes of

   The Green Belt Initiative is a Government‘s Programme which aims at using the available land and water
resources to increase agricultural production and productivity mainly through irrigation along Lake Malawi.

approximately 196,550 poor rural households in 11 target districts of Malawi in a sustainable
manner by providing an integrated package of support covering irrigation,
agricultural/irrigation advisory services, marketing and post-harvest support; and (ii) strengthen
recipient institutional capacity for long-term irrigation development. The main project activities
include rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and provision of a package of technical and
advisory services for sustainable small-scale irrigation. The original four IRLADP components
were:

       (i) Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development and Catchment Conservation, which supports
           rehabilitation and gradual management transfer of four Government-owned schemes to
           farmers; development of new small-scale gravity and mini-scale schemes; rehabilitation
           of small reservoirs; and construction of 400 group civil works for water harvesting and
           catchment conservation on a demand-driven basis.
       (ii) Farmer Services and Rural Livelihood Fund (FSLF), provides support to beneficiary
            communities, especially those around the irrigation schemes to obtain complementary
            services66 needed to optimize returns to irrigation farming and access markets for their
            produce.
       (iii)Institutional Development and Capacity Enhancement, supports restructuring,
            strengthening and/or formation of smallholder farmer organizations or water user
            associations for irrigation transfer, management and related activities aimed at ensuring
            the sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of rehabilitated schemes, and also
            supports limited policy and institutional capacity building measures in the MoAFS and
            MoWDI aimed at strengthening irrigation planning, design and supervision capacity.
       (iv) Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation of project implementation and
            ensuring that the project‘s funds are used for its intended purposes.
10.     First Additional Financing (AF I). The first additional Credit in the amount of SDR 8.6
million (US$12.7 million equivalent) (Credit No. 48060) (First Additional Financing or AF I)
was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on September 20, 2010 and became effective
on June 17, 2011. With the AF I the percentages of co-financing were revised to reflect the
higher share of IDA financing. The IFAD loan is expected to be fully depleted by the original
project closing date of June 30, 2012. The additional IDA financing was accessed through the
Crisis Response Window (CRW). The AF was sought to cover cost overruns and to ensure
completion of planned rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and provision of a package of
technical and advisory services designed to build capacity for sustainable small-scale irrigation
development. The PDO was simplified (based on the version in the original Grant Agreement)
but in substance remains the same as the original. The revised PDO was to: (i) increase
agricultural productivity and incomes of approximately 196,550 poor rural households in the 11
participating districts and (ii) strengthen recipient institutional capacity for long-term irrigation



66
     Such as extension/technology transfer, inputs and marketing including post-harvest assets.

development. No changes were made to the project‘s original design in terms of component
structure.

11.      Performance of the current project. Implementation progress is satisfactory. Slow
progress related to incorporation (legal establishment) of Water User Associations (WUAs), and
delays in the completion of some irrigation works contracts contributed to downgrading the PDO
from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory in 2011. Many of the delays in disbursements in the
last year were due to the difficult economic circumstances that resulted in lack of forex, fuel and
critical building materials. During the April 2012 mission, it was noted that all the incorporation
documents were complete and had been processed by the Ministry of Justice, thereby meeting a
long outstanding covenant. Although most of the irrigation works contracts have been
completed and some are being launched and handed over to WUAs, there are 2 large irrigation
schemes and some small-scale schemes that are still lagging behind. These are likely to be
completed soon but beyond the scheduled contract period and beyond the original project period.
Most of the causes for delays have been addressed and availability of fuel and building materials
has improved. Given the good progress, implementation progress was again rated satisfactory.
The project has now reached 303,929 beneficiaries, higher than the original target.
Disbursement under the original IDA grant stands at 99.8 percent with SDR 27.5 million
disbursed from the SDR 27.6 million allocation67. However, the IDA credit under the AF I
(SDR 8.6 million) has not yet disbursed due to a delayed project effectiveness. As a result, the
combined disbursement rate is lower at 76.1 percent.

12.      Rationale for AF II. The key rationale for GoM‘s request for additional financing of
IRLADP under the rapid economic response package is that a nationwide scale up of project
activities can have a cushioning effect and enhance development impacts on the rural poor in all
28 districts while difficult economic reforms are undertaken. It would also consolidate the gains
by IRLADP to irrigated agriculture, and prepare for future investments in the irrigation sub-
sector, which is an implicit element of the PDO and a key recommendation on implementation
readiness from the 2010 Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review, but which has so far not
received financing. The proposed IRLADP AF II is aligned with the new Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS FY13-16) under preparation as it addresses the pillar of promoting sustainable,
diversified and inclusive growth, through the outcome of increased productivity and
diversification in agriculture. The project is also consistent with the principles of the ASWAp,
developed through the Bank financed ASWAp-SP.

13.     Several financing alternatives were considered. Among them were: (i) possible
restructuring of ongoing agricultural projects; (ii) a no project option; and (iii) the option to
channel support through a new investment lending operation. The first option to restructure
ongoing agriculture projects was rejected as IRLADP was about to close and the ASWAp-SP has
a different set of objectives and implementation arrangements that does not lend itself to

emergency assistance. The no project option was dropped as the potential impacts on the rural
poor were large and too acute to not justify an urgent scale up operation in support of rural social
safety nets. Finally, a new operation would not only require more preparation time but it would
not build on the well-performing IRLADP structures at national, regional and district levels to
enable the fastest response.

14.     Additional financing to IRLADP has the benefit of using a well established project
mechanism that is geared towards diversified support to rural poor, has demonstrated its
efficacy and satisfactory progress as well as its management and fiduciary controls, and is
therefore considered the appropriate channel for rapid rural response.

III.   Proposed Changes

15.     The PDO will be revised to enable the scaling up of both, the number of beneficiaries and
the number of districts and to simplify the measurement of agricultural productivity as the key
objective rather than rural income. The original intent of the PDO remains therefore unchanged.
No changes are made to the project‘s original design in terms of component structure, except for
the addition of a fifth component on contingency disaster risk response. The revised PDOs are
to: (i) increase agricultural productivity of poor rural households in all districts; and (ii)
strengthen institutional capacity for long-term irrigation development.

16.     Results Framework. The revised results framework has been expanded to reflect
additional activities and an additional component. The revised PDO indicators reflect the
different dimensions of the PDO (see Table 1 below as well as Annex 1).

17.     Changes to Project Components. The number of project components will increase from
four to five to accommodate the new component for disaster risk response. Other new activities
are accommodated through their inclusion under existing components. Table 2 below provides a
summary to component changes.

18.      Below, the additional activities are presented as per the original and maintained
component structure, and have been justified on grounds of: (i) scaling up the social safety
net function (US$29.45 million); (ii) consolidating the project‘s gains (US$9.40 million); and
(iii) preparation for new investments in the sector (US$8.10 million). In addition, there is further
support to program management and M&E (US$3.05 million). The contingent financing window
(new fifth component) will be US$0, as it provides a reallocation draw-down facility.

(a) Preparation for future investments (US$8.10 million): Prominent will be a strategic study on
the future of irrigation development and management in Malawi. The strategic study will help to
inform a comprehensive investment framework and master plan for irrigation development68.
Specifically, AF II would support a consultancy study on integrated investment planning, based
on (i) an assessment of irrigation potential (biophysical) in Malawi, disaggregated by Water
Resources Area, typology of irrigation and irrigation technology; (ii) an investment framework
based on an elaboration of a typology of irrigation categories, prioritization scorecards,
implementation arrangements and required capacities, general guidelines for investment planning
and environmental and social safeguards; (iii) an investment roadmap and pipeline with
(pre)feasibility studies, terms of references (ToRs), bidding documents and preliminary
participatory agreements, and (iv) a technical and financial assessment of the cost of irrigation,
and options to reduce costs, which are considered high as compared to regional benchmarks 69.
This support would further include a set of (pre)feasibility studies for different types of irrigation
and would also include support to a comprehensive set of feasibility and other studies
(environmental, financial, institutional, land tenure) for the proposed Shire Valley Irrigation
Project (SVIP)70.

   Malawi has considerable irrigation potential, but it is poorly identified and prioritized. There have been a number of studies,
but these have mainly supported disconnected irrigation development interventions, without addressing the breadth and width
necessary for a national irrigation planning and investment framework. The last comprehensive assessment dates back from the
1980s (National and Shire Irrigation Study). The absence of such planning in turn has led to a haphazard and isolated approach to
feasibility studies for specific investments which have both precluded a prioritization at national level and have caused delays in
project implementation.

69
   The ToR for this study will be based partly on work already carried out under the Water Sector Investment Plan, and the water
resources analysis will be based on the recent Water Resources Investment Strategy, (MWDI, 2011) and other water resources
assessments. The analysis will also be carried out in close coordination with the planned Agriculture Public Expenditure Review
(AgPER), funded by the World Bank. The AgPER will analyze the alignment of the budget with the ASWAp which includes
irrigation as one of the priority areas for investments. These two exercises will constitute useful contributions to an overall
irrigation investment prioritization exercise.

70
   Studies for the SVIP will follow the roadmap that was proposed in January 2011 and adopted by Government in a letter dated
January 20, 2012. Support to the roadmap will be closely coordinated with the support by the African Water Facility through the
African Development Bank (AfDB), and other potential stakeholders. Support to SVIP will be subject to a favorable assessment
of water resources availability, currently ongoing by MWDI under the Shire River Basin Management Program.

(b) Selective rehabilitation and development of small scale irrigation schemes (US$2.30
million): The AF II would support a modest scale up of support to Small Scale Irrigation,
funding construction of a limited number of schemes that have already been designed and for
which cost estimates, Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) and bidding
documents have already been prepared and are ready for tendering. This would cover about 250
ha of small scale schemes.

(c) Support to water use efficiency in existing rice schemes (US$0.60 million): Under this
activity there will be limited infrastructure development support to increase water use efficiency
in existing rice schemes beyond the 4 schemes supported under IRLADP. Investments will be
incremental in nature, and support interventions for improved water management as they would
be supported under Component 2, and institutional support under Component 3 with minor
infrastructure investments in flow measurement devices (flumes) and minor upgrading of flow
distribution infrastructure (gates, distribution boxes, etc).

(d) Small scale farmer demand-driven rainwater harvesting and catchment conservation
(US$1.50 million): AF II will support limited expansion of catchment conservation activities
beyond what was already planned in the critical hotspots upstream of the supported irrigation
areas. This means that more hotspots and catchments for new irrigation areas will be supported
by the project. The proposed scale up will further ensure the environmental sustainability of the
schemes, reduce inflow of silt and in time increase the base flow in rivers. The AF II will also
consolidate and follow-on support to the current activities under the rainwater harvesting and
catchment conservation programs in the targeted catchments, and especially support the
establishment of a geographic information system (GIS) based planning, M&E framework.

20.     Component 2: Farmer Services and Livelihood Fund (US$30.90 million), will scale-up
support towards the IFA program to help farmers raise their productivity through increased
cropping intensity and diversification in their agricultural livelihoods, both in the wet and the dry
season, thereby helping them avert food shortage. It further supports beneficiary communities,
particularly those covered under the irrigation schemes, to obtain complementary services and
goods for optimizing their returns from irrigated farming, to add value through micro-processing,
to improve the marketing of their produce, and to build their technical and business capacities.
Support provided is demand-driven based on proposals elaborated by eligible beneficiary groups
and approved by District Councils. Implementation is organized in three windows:

     (a) Support for extension (US$2.95 million): will provide additional agricultural technical
         advice to beneficiary producers with a focus on consolidating results achieved so far on
         irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation or construction. Particular attention will be given
         to increasing rice productivity71 by supporting the implementation of farmer-led



71 Focusing on four critical agronomic performance elements: (i) cropping techniques in connection with water management and
promotion of the system of rice intensification (SRI) to improve productivity while reducing water consumption; (ii) testing and
introduction of improved and high performing rice varieties; (iii) development of locally-produced rice seeds; and (iv)
introduction of animal-drought equipment and power tillers for soil preparation and transportation and other small cropping

                                                             161
                                                Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

            demonstrations and on-farm trials through the farmer field schools and farmer business
            schools which are already functional. AF II will also scale up the lead farmer approach
            by increasing the coverage of farmers reached through project extension activities. It will
            continue providing basic support to community mobilization, beneficiary sensitization
            and farmer group dynamic to ensure strong commitment to project objectives, ownership
            of activities and sustainability of investments. Based on the ongoing experience of
            ASWAp-SP, the AF II will finance budget programs designed by MoAFS departments
            for implementation through Agricultural Development Divisions (ADDs) and District
            Agricultural Development Officers (DADOs).

      (b) Inputs for Assets (IFA) Voucher Program (US$25.65 million): will scale-up support
          towards the IFA program to help farmers raise their productivity through increased
          cropping intensity and diversification in their agricultural livelihoods, both in the wet and
          the dry season, thereby helping them avert food shortage. So far, the project has reached
          over 192,000 beneficiaries. The planned allocation for this component from AF II is to
          cover for IFA programs in all districts in the country, reaching an additional 230,000
          beneficiaries in the coming growing seasons72. In order to accommodate this massive
          scale up of the IFA component, as well as to incorporate lessons learnt from the
          implementation of IFA over the past years the following changes are proposed to the IFA
          component:

                     Be more selective and strategic in the selection of assets to be constructed or
                      rehabilitated. By and large, the focus will be on construction or rehabilitation of
                      feeder roads and mini-scale irrigation. This will enable higher quality and
                      oversight through streamlined procedures and guidelines, and also focus activities
                      on assets that present demonstrable returns on the investments73.

                     For roads and irrigation works embark on a planning process ahead of site
                      selection, and identify parallel investments (beyond the labor intensive works
                      element) in terms of small scale infrastructure (culverts, river crossings, small




equipment to reduce drudgery in irrigations schemes. The Project will use technical expertise from DARS, DAES and Crops
Department to: (a) analyze current farmer practices and identify key constraints to rice productivity increase; (b) design
techniques and extension messages to be disseminated to farmers; (c) liaise with rice variety research programs in Malawi and in
the region, as well as seed companies, to identify high potential (yield/market demand) rice varieties to be tested on-farm and
demonstrated to farmers; (d) design and implement through DADOs on-farm trials, demonstrations and farmer try-outs based on
the approach developed under ASWAp-SP; and (e) elaborate a seed multiplication scheme in coordination with farmer
organizations and seed companies interested in rice seed production.

72
     2012 rainy season, 2013 dry season, 2013 rainy season, 2014 dry season and the 2014 rainy season.

73
   Construction of mini-schemes will follow guidelines developed under IRLADP and focus largely on the
upgrading of ‗self-help‘ mini scale irrigation schemes which have been developed across the country, which need
further investment and rationalization of their design to improve the efficiency and the impact of the schemes.


                                                               162
                                       Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

                 weirs, distribution and drop structures, pipeline sections) that are necessary to
                 complete a sustainable infrastructure intervention.

                Spread the period of work so that not all supervision works needs to be done in
                 the same short period of time. The work period of 20 days will remain unchanged
                 for an individual activity and beneficiary, but the activities will be spread over the
                 year, while the voucher is still redeemed at the onset of the growing season.

                To further support diversification the inputs package will be broadened, giving a
                 choice to beneficiaries between a maize input package (the traditional package
                 with seeds and fertilizer), a legumes package, a cotton package or a small
                 livestock package (ruminants or pigs), and potentially others.

                Targeting of beneficiaries will be more closely coordinated with the FISP
                 secretariat within MoAFS to ensure widest possible impact. Quality assurance of
                 the IFA program will be enhanced by recruiting an IFA coordinator within the
                 Project Coordination Unit (PCU), and to establish close technical linkages with
                 Public Works programs and the Department of Irrigation (DoI). Asset
                 maintenance committees will be formed to enhance sustainability of the asset.

                This program will fund the procurement and supply of the input packages
                 (fertilizers, seeds, livestock, equipment); the procurement of necessary tools and
                 equipment for labor intensive works on the assets, community based procurement
                 for works (by artisans, local contractors) to complement the labor intensive
                 unskilled IFA works; design, supervision and coordination of the program works
                 and voucher administration.

     (c) Support for marketing and post-harvest assets (US$2.30 million): Through a matching
         grant mechanism, the project has supported 75 farmer groups in developing income
         generating activities through the acquisition of marketing and post-harvest equipment74.
         The AF II will: (i) provide additional managerial and technical assistance to these groups
         to consolidate results achieved so far and ensure their sustainability beyond project
         closure; (ii) extend the approach developed so far to reach out to more farmer groups and
         cooperatives as a way to strengthen producer access to markets, to add more value into
         production through agricultural produce processing, proper handling, storage and
         packaging; (iii) support cooperatives in organizing proper input supply to access fertilizer
         and seeds, as well as veterinarian medicines, fodder and feed for groups in livestock
         production; (iv) closely monitor eight Market and Agribusiness Information Centers
         established by the project to confirm farmer interest, check replicability and assess




74
   Supported activities cover poultry and dairy production, post-harvest processing (rice milling mainly) and
transformation (bakery, cassava, juice).


                                                     163
                                          Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

         sustainability beyond project closure 75; and (v) fund the preparation and implementation
         of Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) related to Farmer Based
         Organization (FBO) activities. Based on the approach developed so far, AF II will
         provide grants to FBOs on a demand-driven basis with a minimum expected beneficiary
         contribution of percent (in cash, in kind or both)76.
21.      Component 3: Institutional Development and Capacity Enhancement (US$3.55
million), will focus on consolidation of the capacity building gains and help ensure that capacity
for irrigation development and management is maintained, through two sets of activities under
irrigation water management:

(a)    Capacity enhancement to public irrigation service delivery (US$1.75 million), which will
support:

        Elements of the DoI‘s training plan, and include short courses, three MSc degrees in
         regional/international universities on integrated irrigation management and scheme
         design.

        The provision of a pilot short term course for fresh graduates from Bunda College,
         Polytechnic and Natural Resources College on practical principles of irrigation design,
         contract management and water management, addressing deficiencies in practical skills
         to complement the theoretical knowledge from the colleges. In addition, student
         internships in districts and DoI will be facilitated to provide hands-on experience related
         to project activities.

        The design and supervision roles of the Irrigation Services Divisions and the District
         Irrigation Offices. AF II will support survey equipment to these offices, complementing
         equipment already supported by the Medium Scale Irrigation Development Project
         (MIDP - JICA funded) and Rural Infrastructure Development Project (RIDP - EU
         funded).

        The functions of the Irrigation Water Management Unit (IWMU) within DoI, which is
         responsible for all operational and technical support to irrigation development, and which




75
  Market information remains a critical service to farmers for timely and affordable access to agricultural inputs and
for rewarding marketing of produce.
76
   To provide additional technical support to existing FBOs, the Project will assess requests from FBOs and will
liaise with technical MoAFS Departments to design extension programs to be implemented by DADOs or other
service providers for specialized technical, managerial and accounting advice. Market information activities will be
designed and implemented through annual work plans and budgets prepared with the Marketing Unit of the Ministry
of Agriculture.


                                                        164
                                         Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

         is proposed to be transformed into an operational office supporting the National Irrigation
         Fund77.

        During the project extension period IWMU will continue to be responsible for all
         technical support to irrigation development, Water User Association (WUA) support as
         well as catchment conservation and rainwater harvesting support, the latter in close
         collaboration with the Department of Land Resources Conservation.

(b)     Water User Associations and Irrigation Management Transfer (US$1.80 million): An
important element of support to institutional capacity building for irrigation concerns
consolidation and further support to WUAs and Water User Groups78. In all the small scale and
large scale schemes supported by IRLADP these WUAs have been formally established and
trained. These are to be continued during the joint management phase of the next two years with
practical hands-on training on scheme management, budgeting and accounting, infrastructure
maintenance and catchment/water resources conservation. In order to scale up the processes of
WUAs and Irrigation Management Transfer this will be extended to ex-Smallholder Flood Plains
Development Project (SFPDP) schemes and other rice schemes where this process may not be
completed. This will complement support to improving water management, flow measurements
and in-field water management for rice irrigation that will be supported under Component 2 of
the project.

22.     Component 4: Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$3.05 million),
will provide additional support to enable the project management functions to continue
throughout the project extension period. AF II will fund PCU staff salaries and incremental
office running costs, which would be required for the 30 month extension period. This
component will also finance consultation and training on safeguards instruments implementation,
especially for the scale up areas. Minor investments to maintain the ageing vehicle fleet
(replacing one vehicle) and office furniture are supported. The component will also continue to
provide incremental funding to Project Steering meetings and supervision/M&E visits during the
extension period.




77
   The National Irrigation Fund (NIF) is proposed to be established under the provisions of the Irrigation Act for
financing irrigation and drainage development, planning and research. The specific functioning of the NIF
(governance, management and investment selection criteria) is currently developed by the Department of Irrigation
with support under the EU funded RIDP project and the development of the investment planning framework would
be closely aligned with this process.
78
   The governing principle in irrigation management remains full management responsibility of irrigation schemes
by the water users through legally constituted organizations that oversee all matters related to operation and
maintenance and the financial sustainability of the schemes. A cost recovery approach is promoted through the
strict collection and proper management of water users fees.

23.     Component 5: Contingency for Disaster Risk Response (US$0). A new component 5 is
being introduced (Contingency for Disaster Risk Response) that will support preparedness and
rapid response to disaster, emergency, and/or catastrophic event as needed. The provisional zero
cost for this component will allow for rapid reallocation of credit proceeds from other
components under streamlined procurement and disbursement procedures. This component could
also be used to channel additional funds should they become available as a result of the
emergency. This component would be triggered on request by GoM after declaring a national
emergency.

24.    In the event this component is triggered, the Results Framework and the ORAF will
accordingly be revised.

25.  Extension of closing date: The closing date of the overall project will be extended to
December 31, 2014.

26.      Changes to Implementation Arrangements. The number of project components will
increase from four to five to accommodate the new component that estabilishes a contingency for
disaster risk response. The implementation arrangements of the original project are satisfactory
and will remain largely unchanged. The PCU will continue to be responsible for day-to-day
project implementation. To further strengthen the linkage with the ASWAp investment
framework, the PCU will work in close coordination with the ASWAp Secretariat under the
policy guidance of the ASWAp Executive Management Committee (EMC), chaired by the
Principal Secretary, MoAFS. The EMC will replace the original project PSC. The project will
also contribute and receive advice from the Technical Working Groups established under
ASWAp to provide guidance on technical issues and methodologies for implementation of
activities and investments. The Project Executive Committee (PEC) provides technical oversight
and has the responsibility for approving sub-projects following recommendations from the
district authorities. Targeting of IFA beneficiaries will be closely coordinated with the FISP
Coordination Unit in MoAFS. The financing arrangements for community sub-projects will no
longer be undertaken by the MASAF/Local Development Fund (LDF), as the reorganization of


                                                             166
                                   Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

LDF has reduced the added value of this arrangement for the project. At project design MASAF
was proposed to manage demand driven activities under the project, given its strong experience
in community driven activities and following its implementation modalities – in collaboration
with the district councils. Since then, MASAF reformed and no longer has district based staff to
support the project, nor does it have a mechanism to oversee community level activities,
disbursements or verification for IRLADP. These roles have been taken over by the PCU, the
district councils and the National Local Government Finance Committee. The PCU carries out
all procurement, community disbursements and monitors funds flow to the Districts, following
manuals that were set-up between MASAF and IRLADP at the start of the project. To
streamline funds flow and improve implementation progress it is therefore proposed to only have
one Designated Account for AF II, under PCU.
27.     The original IRLADP was funded collaboratively through an IDA Grant, an IFAD
loan and Government‟s and beneficiary counterpart funding. IDA and IFAD funds were
co-mingled to finance all the project activities. With the IDA AF I the percentages of co-
financing were revised to reflect the higher share of IDA financing. The IFAD loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by the original project closing date of June 30, 2012, and no future co-
financing is foreseen. In preparing for AF II the Task Team discussed with IFAD and other
Development Partners supporting the irrigation and agriculture sectors, organized in the informal
coordination group on irrigation, most notably AfDB, EU and JICA on the intended AF II to
ensure harmonization in the support. Collaboration with AfDB is closely coordinated on the
jointly agreed support to the roadmap for the Shire Valley Irrigation Project preparation, which is
included in the proposed AFII for the project; and with all development partners on the
development of a harmonized investment framework for the irrigation sector along with
financing and M&E arrangements that are supported by other development partners.

28.      The Contingency component for Disaster Risk Response will only become active
when triggered by a declaration of national emergency following a natural disaster, by the
Head of State upon recommendation of the National Disaster Preparedness and Relief
Committee. The provisional zero cost for this component will allow for rapid reallocation of
credit proceeds from other components under streamlined procurement and disbursement
procedures. All expenditures under this component, should it be triggered, will be in accordance
with OP/BP 8.00 and will be appraised, reviewed and found to be acceptable to the Bank before
any disbursement is made. The Government will, depending on the type of emergency, establish
adequate implementation arrangements, in line with national policy on disaster response,
including staff and resources for carrying out the rapid response activities. The existing PIM will
be updated toclearly identify the responsible agency for specific activities, funds flow and
procurement. Disbursements would be made for goods, works, and consultant services required
to support the immediate response and recovery needs of the GoM. Type of assistance could
include construction materials, water, land and air transport equipment, including spare parts,
agricultural equipment and inputs (excluding pesticides), school supplies and equipment,
construction equipment and industrial machinery, communications equipment, seeds and
fertilizer, food and water containers and any other items which may be acceptable to the Bank
and agreed to by the GoM and the Bank.

29.     Procurement and Financial Management Arrangements remain largely unchanged
from the original grant and AF. Procurement under the project, including under AF II, will be
carried out in accordance with the World Bank‘s "Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and
Non Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits & Grants by World Bank
Borrowers, January 2011; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits & Grants by World Bank Borrowers", January 2011. In addition,
the ―Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants", dated October 15, 2006 and revised in January 2011
shall apply to AF II. Procurement under the project will use streamlined procedures under
OP/BP 8.00 which will be defined in the Procurement Plan for specific contracts. National
Competitive Bidding procedures which were reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank with
some exceptions will also be used in the procurement of goods, non consulting services, works
and services for which Bank prior review is not required. Specifically, in the event that the
contingency for Disaster Risk Response is triggered, procurement procedures allowed under OP
8.00 would apply, which would include flexibility in the use of emergency procurement
procedures, applying higher prior review thresholds, using simplified procurement methods and
drawing on prequalified procurement and project management agents through streamlined
selection methods.

30.     The PCU has a satisfactorily performing accounting team. Outreach offices are manned
by assistant accountants. Out of the 11 original IRLADP districts, seven have justification
assistants who are responsible for checking utilization of funds by the districts and communities.
The remaining districts are assisted by neighboring outreach offices as well as trained district
staff. With the scaling up, the assignment of these officers would need to be re-assessed for
maximum support to district level accounting staff. The department of public service
management is formalizing the positions of Financial Analysts, present in all districts. In
addition, different sectors in the districts have accounting staff ranging from accountant position
to accounts clerks, who support the district Financial Analysts. District staff has been trained on
FM under the ASWAp-SP. However, for new districts, the district staff will be trained before
operations commence in the new districts on the project‘s financial management and accounting
procedures. The Bank team will continue working with the Ministry to update and further
operationalize the governance and anti-corruption guidelines – where possible building on
MASAF experience.

31.    Changes are also proposed to the categories of expenditure in the disbursement
table in the legal documents. Existing categories are lumped into one all-inclusive category,
except for the sub-projects, which will maintain a separate category. An additional category has
been created for the Contingency Financing. Disbursement of the FSLF and the IFA program
will no longer be through the MASAF dedicated account, but directly through the one project
account for AF II.

IV.    Appraisal Summary
32.     The fiduciary, economic, technical, social and environmental analysis and justification
are based on an update and revision, where necessary, of the analysis undertaken at the appraisal
of the original grant.

33.      Fiduciary Analysis: The Original Grant disbursed on the basis of Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs) into the Special Accounts. During the Mid-Term Review (MTR), a
recommendation was made to change to financial management reports (FMRs)-based
disbursement so as to improve the flow of funds to the implementing districts. This
recommendation has been implemented through an amendment to the Financing Agreement for
the AF I and the IFAD Financing Agreement, and will remain in force for AF II. The project‘s
regular financial reporting will continue to be provided through quarterly FMRs submitted to the
Bank no later than 45 days following the end of the quarter. Under AF II, the GoM will continue
to produce annual financial statements and submit annual audit reports to the Bank no later than
6 months following the end of the fiscal year. There have been problems in coordination
between the project unit and MASAF resulting in delays in disbursement and documentation of
MASAF incurred expenses. Flow of funds will be simplified under AF II since payments will no
longer be made through the MASAF-designated account, as all activities under AF II will be
financed through MOAFS-designated account instead. The IFR template will be updated to
reflect this change. The external audit TOR has been agreed with the Bank for the AF I and will
continue to be used. There are no outstanding audit reports for the project.

34.     Economic Analysis: The project‘s financial and economic rates returns (FRR/ERR) were
recently revalidated (with the AF I which was to validate the analysis undertaken at appraisal of
the original project as the project faced cost overruns). These results indicated that with
complete rehabilitation of the schemes, the revised FRR and ERR are 34 percent and 29 percent
respectively. This is an improvement compared to the rates at appraisal which were 17 percent
and 15 percent, respectively. The difference is explained by the higher crop yields as a result of
the use of fertilizer and better seed provided through the project‘s IFA Voucher program as well
as the increased cropping intensity allowing farmers to harvest 2-3 crops in a year. These figures
have not been re-assessed for this AF II as the justification is to scale up the same types of
investments and to prepare for future investments rather than to change the financial and
economic parameters of the ongoing activities. It is assumed that the economic and financial
analysis for the last AF is still relevant as the results were robust with respect to cost increases,
benefit reductions as well as some considerable delays in realization of full benefits – the latter
of which occurred in the past year due to the difficult economic circumstances that led to lack of
availability of forex to import construction materials and lack of availability of fuel which led
most contractors to slow down construction progress.

35.     To conclude, there continues to be a likelihood that the ERR of 15 percent, as calculated
at appraisal of the original project will be met or even surpassed, when planned scheme
rehabilitations are fully completed. Additional activities are also likely to be within the same
parameters. No attempts were made to calculate rates of return for preparatory studies and



                                                  169
                                    Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

investment planning, but these investments are justified on basis of anticipated improved
performance of future investments.

36.      Technical Analysis: The proposed activities are focused on scaling up activities with
very similar technical parameters to the original project. Incremental activities are primarily
those that have been observed to be missing or where there was scope for further improvement.
Support to rice agronomy and in field water management are among the key new activities, as
well as the modifications to the IFA approach. Investment framework development and
preparatory studies for new irrigation schemes will follow international benchmarks for such
planning and include technical, environmental, social, economic and financial considerations,
and also explicitly include assessment of water resources availability. Implementation of
construction works will continue as before: to ensure the quality of the civil works in the
schemes, all construction works will be tendered out to private contractors or local artisans in
cases of small scale infrastructure. The project will continue to build the capacity of staff at all
levels, including the communities through the establishment and training of the WUAs to ensure
smooth transfer of scheme operations and maintenance once the rehabilitation is complete.
Differential and generally high costs for irrigation have been noted through project
implementation. These are partly due to exogenous factors, e.g., higher prices for construction
materials and fuel, but also at least partially due to management factors such as contract
management, supervision and contractor experience; technical design and contract packaging for
procurement; and type of irrigation supported. Lessons will be drawn up in the proposed
investment framework to inform a multi-pronged strategy to ensure long-term economic viability
of irrigation investments in Malawi.

37.     Environmental Analysis: The proposed AF II will not change the environmental
category of the project, which is B (Partial Environmental Assessment) or trigger any new
safeguard policies. The environmental and social impacts of the project, for the most part, are
expected to be minimal, site specific and manageable to an accepted level. The original project
triggered safeguards policies OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.09 (Pest Management),
OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) and OP 7.50 (Projects on International Waterways).
Safeguards instruments of the original IRLADP, namely an Environment and Social
Management Framework (ESMF), which included a Pest Management Plan (PMP), and a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) (revised in 2011, disclosed in country in December 2011
and in InfoShop on May 27, 2012) remain valid. New activities do not trigger any additional
safeguards policies. Scaling up of the program refers mainly to the IFA program, under which
community assets like mini-scale irrigation and rural roads will be supported, for which the
project‘s safeguards instruments are well suited. The ESA/ESMP for the original project looked
in-depth into the direct and indirect impacts of the project, as they relate to irrigation and
drainage, water harvesting activities, water quality, access roads and other physical infrastructure
to be financed by the project and identified mitigation measures commensurate to those impacts.
These remain applicable for the activities financed under AF II. In order to further harmonize
safeguards implementation it has been recently agreed to adopt the PMP that was developed by
the ASWAp-SP for use by MoAFS will also be applied for IRLADP. The PMP has been
disclosed in country and in InfoShop for the IRLADP on May 27, 2012. Where the project is


                                                  170
                                       Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

scaling up to new districts, public consultations and trainings on implementation of safeguards
instruments will be conducted early on in the project extension period.

38.     The original project obtained an exception under the Tobacco Policy (OP 4.76),
given the prominence of tobacco in the Malawi agricultural sector. For purposes of this AF
II, no new exception under OP 4.76 had to be obtained as per the recent guidance that there is no
explicit requirement for an exception to be obtained under paragraph 2 of OP 4.76 for operations
that do not support tobacco production directly or in a substantial way indirectly. No part of the
investment will be allocated for tobacco production, processing, exporting, or marketing, in
compliance with paragraph 1 of OP 4.76.

39.     The original project also obtained an exception under the Bank‟s policy of Projects
on International Waterways (OP 7.50, Para 7) because this is primarily an irrigation scheme
rehabilitation project which is not expected to significantly alter water flows to other riparians.
With this AF II, GoM intends to concentrate on consolidating the mini-schemes already
established and increase support incrementally to already water managed areas with only minor
and scattered increases in irrigated area which will not have a negative impact on water quality
and flows for any riparian. Where the AF II supports studies to create an investment pipeline for
future irrigation investments in the country, the ToRs will explicitly include consideration of
riparian issues as well as environmental screening. The investments following such studies
would not be funded under this project. A renewed exception under OP 7.50 was requested, and
approved by the RVP on May 22, 2012.

40.     The assessment undertaken during the MTR noted that there are capacity
challenges at the district level to implement the ESMPs that have been developed in
correspondence with the ESMF for the project. Since then, the project has implemented an
action plan including capacity needs assessment and training to ensure that the environmental
and social safeguards are complied with. All ESMPs79 created under the project have been
disclosed in-country and in the InfoShop on May 28, 2012. The capacity needs assessment was
undertaken and trainings were conducted for national and district level staff, and currently
documentation and compliance with Environmental Safeguards is Satisfactory. The safeguard
documents and the specific assessment for the AF II were reviewed by the Regional Safeguards
Unit, and cleared for disclosure in-country and at the Bank InfoShop.

41.  Social Analysis: The original project built into its design the experiences from the
SFPDP which was funded by IFAD. This has led to the formation and capacity building of
WUAs which includes the development of clear rules for the sharing and management of the



79
  24 ESMPs were developed for the following small scale and medium scale irrigation schemes under the Project:
Midule (Blantyre District), Nanzolo ―B‖, Nkhate (Chikwawa), Chibula, Kanthuwalya, Malawa (Chitipa District),
Windu (Dedza District), Nafumu (Lilongwe District), Limphasa (Nkhata Bay), Muona (Nsanje), Chakalamba
(Phalombe District), Chayina, Mahomero, Mphande, Tapukwa, Tchetchetche, Tiyese, Usowoya, Walutundu,
Zolokere (Rumphi District), Bikinani, Chikumbutso, Chombe, and Likangala Complex (Zomba District).


                                                     171

available water. The majority of project intervention is based on community driven development
mechanisms and group demands for project intervention to support their rural livelihoods.
Nevertheless, the MTR and subsequent assessments by land experts and social safeguards
specialists noted that documentation of voluntary land contributions was missing in cases. The
project already anticipated and developed a mitigation plan for the potential social issues that
might have arisen due to the implementation of the project. Among others, these include:
(i) possible conflicts among upstream and downstream users along irrigation schemes;
(ii) beneficiary participation in scheme design, operations and maintenance; (iii) the scope of the
irrigation management transfers; and (iv) counter-claims on land ownership within the schemes.
An assessment and subsequent action plan to regularize and document informal community
arrangements and train district level staff in safeguards screening and framework implementation
has been completed. Land and Water agreements have been drawn up between land owners and
irrigators organized in WUAs for irrigation schemes under the project. They have also been
drawn up for FBOs at district and community level to formalize previously informal voluntary
arrangements dealing with access to land and water for the irrigation schemes. There have not
been instances of involuntary resettlement and therefore no formal resettlement action plans
(RAPs) were developed as provided for under the RPF. A list of the Land and Water agreements
developed under the project has been being disclosed at the InfoShop as well as in-country. A
framework has also been developed for the GoM to offer land leases to WUAs and FBOs to
avoid future land conflicts and competing claims. Other relevant social issues such as gender
and HIV/AIDS have also been incorporated into the project to ensure equity and avoid social
exclusion. The efforts above have led to a satisfactory rating on environmental safeguards
compliance under the project.

42.     The AF II does not require any other exceptions to Bank policies. It complies with
the regional criteria for readiness for implementation: all institutional, fiduciary arrangements
and implementation have been agreed on and incorporated in project design; project staff is
already in place; and the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is already available from the
original project.

43.     Procurement arrangements: These are expected to remain the same with the PCU taking
a leading role in procurement of goods, works and services. Implementation at district level is
still a challenge. However, the project has carried out a special needs assessment on
procurement for all districts involved, and has involved more and more the project‘s Outreach
office, improving procurement performance. The PCU has increased its monitoring of
procurement activities at district level. A revised procurement plan taking into account the
additional funds has been prepared by the project and agreed to by the Bank.

44.     Sustainability: Key issues related to the institutional, technical, and financial
sustainability of the proposed AF II are summarized below.

45.     Institutional sustainability: The project is building the institutional capacity of the
MoWDI at the national, district and local levels to be able to provide technical support required
for sustainable small-scale irrigation development. The project has established the IWMU and
the Water User Association Support Unit (WUASU) as well as the District Irrigation Advisory

                                                 172
                                         Attachment C: Irrigation Rural Livelihoods And Agricultural Development Project

Services Units (DIASU) in the DoI. These non-established positions are now being
mainstreamed nationwide into the establishment of the DoI, thereby ensuring institutional
sustainability at district level. At the local level, these technical units are facilitating the
establishment and capacity building of the WUAs. Training is also being provided to other
institutions that are involved in high level education (training of graduate and diploma-level
irrigation engineers) such as Bunda College and Natural Resources College. All this capacity
building is likely to improve the institutional sustainability and support the country‘s long-term
irrigation development agenda. Scheme level sustainability has been supported under the
original project and will be strengthened with AF II through the establishment and strengthening
of WUAs, including the development of WUA constitutions, management agreements between
WUAs and the Ministry of Water Development and Irrigation, legal incorporation of WUAs
under the Trustees Incorporation Act, and formalization of land and water rights through
facilitation of WUAs entering into land leases/agreements and water licenses 80. Most
importantly, the project will provide support to WUAs to improve their financial sustainability
through budgeting and fee recovery from water users for irrigation services, to be specified in
constitutions and agreed annually. This supports MoWDI policy of irrigation management
transfer and cost recovery for scheme‘s operation and management costs.

46.     Technical sustainability: Technical sustainability is likely to be affected by the capacity
challenges in the line and sector ministries. These challenges will remain for some time. The
capacity building implemented under the original project will continue during the proposed AF II
to ensure adequate capacity for eventual technical support, operations and maintenance after the
project period by technical staff and communities. For longer term capacity and quality of
design and contract management, hands on as well as academic training will be provided under
the project.

47.     Financial sustainability: Financial sustainability of the activities supported under the
pilot project is likely to be achieved because beneficiary groups will be expected to improve their
productivity from the rehabilitated and newly developed medium, small and mini-scale schemes.
The project will also promote the integration of farmers into organized, high-value supply chains
so as to improve their profitability as a basis for sustained operations and maintenance of the
schemes. Finally, WUAs have received specific training and are being monitored for the
financial sustainability of their management of the irrigation schemes.

48.    The implementation risk is seen as Moderate. The AF II was designed under the
parameters of OP/BP 8.0 and OP/BP 13.20 related to emergency AF operations, while difficult
economic reforms are undertaken by the GoM. There are three areas of moderate to substantial
operational risk:



80
  The World Bank supported second National Water Development Program is supporting a licensing reform
campaign and water resources monitoring that will improve the framework for water rights allocation and
management, to go in parallel with the expansion of physical infrastructure in irrigation and other sector, thereby
enhancing sustainability from a resource management perspective.

(i)      Capacity and governance. With the expansion of the project area from 11 to 28 districts,
institutional capacity strengthening will be required in some or all of the new districts, especially
at administrative and technical levels. To mitigate this risk, recruitment of district level assistant
accountants and irrigation staff is foreseen.

(ii)    Safeguards, environmental and social safeguards issues, especially in relation to rural
infrastructure have been clarified and the existing instruments remain valid, but have been
updated.

(iii) Contingency financing for disaster risk response, which starts out with a zero budget, but
could become very substantial, has implementation risks since the implementation arrangements
are not fully tested.
