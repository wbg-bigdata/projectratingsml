PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
SEVE NT (HMAAWELI TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
(CR. 1210-CO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Seventh (Mahaweli
Transmission) Power Project in Sri Lanka, for which Credit 1210-CE in the
amount of SDR 31.3 million (US$36.0 million equivalent at the time of
negotiations) was approved on February 3, 1982. The credit was closed on
March 31, 1988, 34 months behind schedule. The project was cofinanced by OPEC
Special Fund to the level of US$11.0 million. The last disbursement was on
January 25, 1989, and the undisbursed balance of SDR 1.25 million was
canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Division, Country
Department 1, of the Asia Region. Preparation of this PCR was started during
IDA's supervision mission of the ongoing power projects in February 1989, and
is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit
and Project Agreements, supervision reports, and correspondence between IDA
and the Borrower. The Borrower provided information required for the
preparation of Part III of the PCR. The comments of the Borrower on Parts I
and III of the PCR have been incorporated in the final report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANRA
SEVEDN? (MABAWLLI TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
[CR. 1210-Cl)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblective
The project's main objective was to assist the Ceylon Electricity Board
(CEB) to construct the transmission works that would deliver at least cost the
output from hydropower stations in the Mahaweli basin to the principal load
centers in the Colombo area. A secondary objective of the project was to
improve the reliability of the existing 66 kV network (para. 3.1). The
project was cofinanced by OPEC Special Fund to the level of US$11.0 million.
Implementation Experience
Project implementation experienced considerable delays due to one
contractor's poor performance, compounded by the occurrence of civil
disturbances (para. 5.3). CEB performed well during project implementation,
and its effort in implementing an emergency plan to meet the commissioning
date of the first unit at Victoria power station in August 1984 was
commendable (para. 5.4).
Project Results
The project's main objectives were achieved. Apart from the physical
benefits, the project had a significant human resources development impact as
it provided CEB staff with the opportunity of wrrking closely with experienced
foreign engineering consultants in successfully implementating, for the first
time, a 220 kV transmission grid in the country (para. 6.1).
Project Sustainability
The pioject provided a least-cost linkage to vacate the energy output
from all major hydro-generation developments in the Mahaweli basin to the load
centers and is expected to provide a steady level of net benefits throughout
its economic life (para. 7.1). Given the Government's commitment towards
enabling CEB to achieve a minimum 8? rate of return on revalued net fixed
assets, CEB is expected to maintain a sound financial position (para. 7.2).
Findings and Lessons Learned
The leading role of the foreign engineering consultants during project
preparation and their active participation in construction supervision and
contract management during implementation contributed greatly to the
attainment of project objectives.

SEVENTH (MAHAWELT TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
(CR. 1210-CE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.      Project Identity
Project Name:  Seventh (Mahaweli Transmission) Power Pro,ect
Credit No.:     1210-CE
RVP Unit:       Asia
Country:        Sri Lanka
Sector:         Energy
'ubsector:      Power
2.      Background
2.1     Sri Lanka has few indigenous resources, k.f which hydropower and
fuelwood are tne most important. There re no knowr. hydrocarbon reserves.
The hydropower potential is estimated to '  about 2,300 MW, with an energy
potential of about 6,500 G'0h a year un-'er tverage hydrological conditions. In
1981, installed hydro-generdting capacity was 369 MW. Per capita energy
con?"-f.ption in 1981 was about 238 kg of oil equivalent, 67Z of which was
supp-ied by fuelwood and agricultural residues, 29Z by imported petroleum
products and 4Z by hydropower. The country's substantial dependence on
imported energy and its high cost since 1973 strongly influenced the
Government of Sri Lanka's (GCS') energy sector policy, the principal
objectives of which are to: (a) develop domestic hydropower resources to
reduce the country's dependence on imported oil; an, (b) improve the access
to, and quality of, electricity supply throughout the country. In accordance
with this policy, GOSL has given high priority to the puwer subsector's
development. The centerpiece of hydropower development was the Accelerated
Mahaweli Program (AMP), which, during 1984-1988, added 533 MW generating
capacity to the national grid (Victoria, 210 MW; Kotmale, 201 MW; and
Randenigala, 122 MW). The Seventh Power Project fit in well with GOSL's
energy sector strategy as it provided the vital link to vacate the energy
output from the hydropower stations to be constructed in the Mahaweli basin to
the principal load centers in and around Colombo.
2.2     The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), formed in 1969, is a statutory
corporation with responsibility for the generation, transmission and, to a
major extent, the distribution of electricity in Sri Lanka. In 1981, CEB's
total installed generating capacity was 519 MW, comprising 369 MW
hydroelectric plants and 150 MW thermal plants.  In parallel with the
development of hydropower plants constructed under the AMP, CEB is the
executing agency for the complementary investments required to augment and
reinforce its transmission and distribution systems in order to meet
increasing demand for electricity.
2.3     The Bank Group's involvement in the power subsector started with a
loan of US$19.1 million ('oan 101-CE) .- 1954 to helo finance a 25 MW
expansion of the Laksapana hydroelectric scheme, To date, the Bank Group has
financed ten operations in the power subsector, of which eight have been
completed.  The Seventh Power Project is cnnsistent with the Bank Group's



2
strategy for the Sri Lankan power subsector, aimed at supporting effottu to
ensure the subsector's efficient development to meet demand at least cost.
The project was cofinanced by the OPEC Special Fund. The project helped CEB
to establish, for the first time, a 220 kV grid that will serve to vacate the
energy outputs from all major hydropower stations planned to come into
operation before the end of the century.
3.      Project Objectives and Description
3.1     The project's main objective was to assist CEB to constr'xct
transmission works that would deliver, at least cost, the output from hydro
power stations in the Mahaweli basin to the principal load centers in the
Colombo area.  A secondary objective of the project was to improve the
reliability of the existing 66 kV network. The key project components were:
(a)   126 km of 220 kV double circuit transmission line from Kotmale
to the load centers around Colombo and 38 km of 132 kV single
circuit transmission line from Rantambe to Badulla;
(b)   one new 220/132 kV substation, extensions to three existing
132 kV substations, one new 132 kV switching station and
extensions to an existing 66 kV substation;
(c)   replacement of circuit breakers with new ones of higher
rupturing capacity;
(d)   equipment for power factor correction, power line carrier, and
for a loss reduction cell;
(e)   vehicles and tools and buildings; and
Cf)   engineering consultancy services, technical assistance and
training.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1   The project had a clear conceptual foundation and the main project
components, i.e., the 220 kV transmission lines and associated substations -
(para. 3.1(a) and (b)), were well prepared. The selection of 220 kV as
primary transmission voltage was based on the screening studies prepared by
CEB and its engineering consultants in 1979 and 1981, which confirmed the 220
kV a'.ternative as the least-cost option. Also, the criteria for selecting the
number and capacity of transmission circuits were sound. The project's timing
was very appropriate in light of the objective of vacating power from the
three hydropower stations under construction in the Mahaweli b.asin,
commissioning of the first unit at Victoria power station being scheduled for
mid-1984.
4.2   Since it was the first time that 220 kV voltage would be used in the
country, experienced foreign engineering consultants were engaged from the
conceptual design stage, and their services covered bid document preparation,
bid evaluation, detailed design, supervision of turnkey contracts, inspection
and testing, and construction supervision. Tl.e engineering consultants played
an important role during project implementation in assisting CEB to identify
and resolve implementation issues, thus minimizing project slippage.

5.    Prolect Implementation
5.1   The project faced a very tight construction schedule between September
1982 and May 1984. Completion by this date was necessary to permit the first
unit at Victoria to come on line as scheduled in mid-1984. The main project
components were constructed through turnkey contracts which covered: (i) 220
kV and 132 kV transmission lines; (ii) 220 kV, 132 kV and 66 kV substations;
(iii) transformers; (iv, replacement of circuit breakers; and (v) supply and
installation of reactive power factor correction equipment.
5.2   The most notable variance between planned and actual project
implementation was the delays associated with the two major project
components: the 220 kV and 132 kV lines were completed in August 1986, and
the associated substations and switching stations in March 1985. The delay
was mainly caused by the poor performance of the first contractor for the 220
kV and 132 kV lines, compounded by the occurrence of civil disturbances since
July 1983.
5.3   The supply and erection contract for the 220 kV and 132 kV lines was
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder on June 1, 1981, with a completion date
of April 30, 1984. The contractcr mobilized on site in July 1982. Progress
at site was slow due    inadequate provision of manpower and material
resources and poor site management. By December 1982, the contractor was 2-3
months behind schedule. Following the outbreak of civil disturbances in July
1983, the contractor evacuated its entire expatriate work-force and was unable
to remobilize to complete the erection portion of the contract. Following
protracted negotiations, it was agreed to delete the balance of the erection
work from the original contract and award it to a second contractor on January
20, 1984. The first contractor remained responsible for t;.e design and supply
of materials, since at that stage a change in tower design would have resulted
in unacceptable delays. However, the second contractor's progress was
ham}ered by late supply of construction drawings, late delivery of materials.,
shortages of critical tower members, and malfabrication of tower steel work,
which led to a-i overall extension of the completion date of the second
contract by 6.3 months. As a result, the Kotmale-Biyagama-Kelanitissa line
was energized in September 1985, followed by Biyagama-Katunayake line
(December 1985), Biyagama-Pannipiciya line (February 1986), and Rantambe-
Badulla line (May 1986).
5.4   As it became evident that the 220 kV Kotmale-Biyagama line would not be
completed on time to take power from the Victoria power station, CEB devis(.d a
contingency plan by using one of the 220/13k kV transformers provided for
Katunayake substation at Xotmale and constructing an emergency 132 kV line to
connect the Laksapana-Chunnakam line to the Kotmale switchyard. The scheme'e
feasibility was confirmed by load flow studies carried out by the engineering
consultants. The emergency 132 kV line was constructed by CEB's force
account. The first unit at Victoria was commissioned in July 1984, and power
was transmitted over the 132 kV system via Polpitiya to Kolonnawa and
Kelanitissa.
5.5   The contracts for the substations and transformers were satisfactorily
completed by March 1985. The delay was due to: delay in contract award (7
months behind SAR schedule): civil disturbances in July 1983 which caused
disruption of work at site; temporary use of one of the 220/132 kV transformer



4
provided for Latunayake at Kotmale; and additional 33 kV works at Blyagam  and
Katunayake.
5.6   Contracts for the replacement of circuit breakers and installation of
reactive compensation equiipment were awarded in August 1984 ana January 1986,
respectively. substantially later than the SAR schedule; however, this diL. not
m.aterially affect the system's operation.
6.    Project Results
6.1   Despite delays in project impleme.ntation, the project's main objectives
were achieved. Apart from the physioal benefits, the project had a
significant human resource development impact. CEB's engineers worked closely
with experien^ed foreign engineering consultants on the conceptual design and
specifications of the first elements of a 220 :V grid that will eventually
cover much of the country. The project also contributed to the establishment
of a system loss reduction unit in the planning group through provision of
equipment and training.
6.2   Total project cost at completion, including additional works, amounted
to US$60.4 million equivalent, 211 below the appraisal estimate of US$76.4
million. The principal reason for the cost reduction was the devaluation of
the local currency against the USS over the project implementation period.
Since the project constituted an integral part of CEB's 1982-1992 investment
program, its benefits to consumers cannot be separated fro-. those generated by
the rest of CEB's capital expenditure. The economic rate of return was
therefore reassessed for .he entire investment program, as at appraisal. The
ERR thus calculated is about 3.41 using the average tariff as a proxy cf
economic benefit, or 12-2Z if consumers' willingness pay is used ab a measure
of economic benefit. This compares with the appraisal estimates of 8.0Z
(based on average tariff) and 13.8Z (based on cons=.ers' willingness to pay).
The difference between the appraisal and completion ERR estimates was due to
overestimation at appraisal of both the sales growth and the level of fuel
surcharge.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.1   The project provided a least-cost linkage to convey the energy output to
the load centers from all major hydro-generation developments, including
Victoria, Kotmale, and Randenigala commissioned during 1984-1988, Rantambe and
Samanalawewa presently under construction ard hydropower projects under
preparation. Based on the GDP growth projections prepared by the Bank for the
Economic Restructuring Credit (Cr. 2128-CE) and the historical linkages
between GDP and electricity consumptior, electricity sales are projected to
grow at an, annual rate of 52 in 1990, 6Z in 199., 72 in 1992, and 7.82
thereafter. In this context, the project is expected to provide a steady
level of net benefits throughout its economic life.
7.2   Under the Sixth Power Project financed by the Bank Group (Cr. 1048-CE),
GOSL/CEB agreed to carry out a tariff study based on long-run marginal cost
and to implement tariff adiustments to enable CEB to achieve a rate of return
on revalued average net fixed assets of not less than 82. Tariff increases
were introduced in 1982 (322). 1985 (75Z), 1988 (172) and 1990 (402). As a
result, CEB met the rdte of return target during 1985-1988.  In 1989, the rate
of return was below 8Z, mainly due to depressed electricity sales. The tariff



5
study completed in 1981 was updated in 1984 and is now being updated under the
IDA-financed Power Distribution and Transmission Project (Cr. 1933-CE). Given
this record, it is expected that GOSL would continue to support CEB to meet
its financial objective, CEB's financial performance during 1981-1989 is
given in Annez 1.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1   The main strengths of the Bank's performance were in assisting CEB to
prepare the project in a timelv and efficient manner through engagement of
foreign engineering consultants at an early stage.
9.    Borrower's Performance
9.1   CEB's performance throughout the project cycle was satisfactory.  To
meet the comissioning date of the first unit at Victoria, the project was
given top priority. An adequate numuer of counterpart staff were assigned to
work with the foreign engineering consultants. In general, CEB's senior
cmanagement responded very quickly to the implementation issues. CEB's
initiative in formulating an emergency plan to vacate the power from Victoria
station to the Colombo load center in 1984 was particularly commendable.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1 The Bank's relationships with GO-L and CEB on the project were very
good.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1  The engineering consultants played an important role during project
preparation, taking lead responsibility for project conceptual design and
screening studies. During project implementation, the engineering consultants
were responsible for the supervision of turnkey contracts and helped to ensure
the quality of the project works and minimize implementation delays of the key
project components. Except for the first contractor for the transmission
lines, the performance of all other contractors and suppliers was
satisfactory.
12.   Ptoject Doct.unentation and Data
12.1 The ' gal documents for the project were adequate. The Staff Appraisal
Report provided a useful framework to monitor pro,ect implementation. CEB's
project cost accounting has improved since 1986 and is being strengther,ed.
CEB provided relevant information for the preparation of the PCR.
