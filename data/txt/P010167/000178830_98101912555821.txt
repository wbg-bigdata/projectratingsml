SEVENTH (MAHAWELI TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01    Sri Lanka in 1981 had a population of 14.9 million and a gross
national product of $250 per capita.  Energy consumed in 1980 amounted to
about 3.7 million toel/, of which 60% was provided by fuelwood, 13% by
hydropower and 27% by imported oil.  The country has no known reserves of
coal, oil or natural gas, and its small deposits of peat are not significant.
An Energy Assessment mission from the Bank visited Sri Lanka in June 1981 and
its report will be published shortly.
Hydro Power
1.03    Sri Lanka has an area of 25,332 square miles.  Most of its
precipitation comes from the Southwest monsoon from about May to September
and from the Northeast monsoon from about December to March. Annual average
rainfall varies from less than 40 inches in some northern parts of the island
to more than 200 inches in places on the southwest slopes of the hills.
Tlydro power potential totals about 6,600 GWh (1.7 million toe2/) per annum,
or 2,500 MW at 30% load factor, mainly in three basins centered on the
central highlands. They are the Mahaweli Basin in central Sri Lanka, the
Walawe Basin to the south, and the Kehelgamu-Maskeliya Basin to the
southwest. Some hydro power has already been developed in each of these
basins.
1.04    Installed hydro generating capacity totals 369 MW out of a total
installed capacity of 499 MW. Six more hydro stations are planned to bring
the total hydro installed to about 1,100 MW by 1990. The present yield of
firm energy is about 1,500 GWh per year; projected additions will increase
this to about 3,240 GWh by 1990 (Annexes 1 and 2).
Traditional Fuels
*        1.05      Wood is the most widely used fuel.  From such statistics as are
available it appears that annual consumption of wood from the forests is
between 3.8 and 5.4 million tons per year (1.5 - 2.2 million toe). To this
1/ toe = tonne oil equivalent = 10.2 x 106 kcal
2/ Primary equivalent based on 0.25 kgoe/kWh = 10,500 BTU/kWh
= 2,646 kcal/kWh



-2-
must be added 0.3 million tons per year (0.1 million toe) of fuelwood from
rubber and coconut plantations.
Petroleum
1.06    Exploration is taking place and it is expected that drilling will be
started in 1981. Sri Lanka was recently classified as having favourable
geological prospects for potential oil or gas discoveries, but the chances of
substantial finds are thought to be low.
1.07    Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), a statutory corporation, is the
sole importer and refiner; its refinery near Colombo has a capacity of 2.35 M
tonnes per year. The refinery does not produce enough kerosene or diesel
fuel to satisfy local demand and the deficits are imported. Kerosene is sold
on the local market at a price lower than either the cost of importing it or
of producing it locally. Furnace oil, a blend of residual and distillate
used among other purposes to fuel CEB's steam power station, is produced by
CPC in greater quantity than the local market can absorb and the surplus is
exported. Gasoline is sold at a high price to help offset the cost of
subsidizing kerosene.l/
1.08    Data from CPC given in Table 1.1 indicate that refined imports have
been rising rapidly in recent years to meet increasing demand for kerosene
and diesel fuel.

B. The Power Subsector
Sector Organization
1.09    Sri Lanka's first public electricity supply was made available in
Colombo in 1895 by Messrs Boustead Bros. The business was soon taken over
by United Planters Co., who extended it and in 1899 built the Colombo
electric tramways. In 1902, the Colombo Electric Tramways and Lighting Co.
Ltd. was formed and provided electricity supply until 1927 when the
Department of Government Electrical Undertakings (DGEU) was established to
control the utility, which had by then been purchased by the Government.
DGEU was succeeded in 1969 when the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), a
statutory corporation, was established with responsibility for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. CEB supplies power
direct to consumers and also sells in bulk to local authorities who retail to
their own consumers. The Ministry of Power and Energy is responsible for
supervision of CEB's policies.
1.10    CEB has in the past been responsible for the development of
generating capacity and is now building the Canyon (60 MW) hydro station.
For the next several years hydro generating capacity will be developed by the
Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) an agency established uiider the
Ministry of Mahaweli Development, having responsibility for the
implementation of the Accelerated Mahaweli Program. As they are completed,
the Mahaweli generating facilities will be transferred to CEB for operation.
During the next ten years some 580 MW of additional hydro capacity will be
developed in this way at Victoria, Kotmale, Randenigala and Rantembe (Annex
1).
External Assistance
1.11    Sri Lanka has in the past obtained external financal assistance
towards the foreign exchange costs of its development program. The Bank
Group has made available for power developments the following loans and
credits, totalling US$112.9 million:
(a) Loan 101-CE (US$15.9 million) to GSL in 1954 to help finance
the 25 MW expansion of the Laksapana hydroelectric scheme.
(b) Loan 209-CE (US$7.4 million) to GSL in 1958 to help finance
construction of a 25 MW thermal plant at Kelanitissa, Colombo.
(c) Loan 283-CE (US$14.1 million) to GSL in 1961 to help finance a
25 MW expansion at Kelanitissa.



-4-
(d) Loan 636-CE (US$21.0 million) to CEBI/ in 1969 to help finance
the 90 MW Maskeliya Oya Stage II project, a 25 MW gas turbine,
and management consultancy and engineering services. US$4.5
million of this loan was cancelled when the gas turbine was not
purchased.
(e) Credit 372-CE (US$ 6.0 million) to GSL in 1973 for reinforcement
and extension of CEB's transmission and distribution systems.
(f) Credit 1048-CE (US$ 19.5 million) to GSL in 1980 for the Sixth
Power Project to provide further reinforcement and improvement
of CEB's transmission and distribution systems.
(g) Further, the Bank Group made available Loan 653-CE/Credit 174-CE
(US$29.0 million) to GSL in 1969 for the multi-purpose
(irrigation and power) Mahaweli Ganga Development of which the
38 MW Ukuwela power station formed a part.
1.12    Six projects have been completed satisfactorily while that under
Credit 1048-CE is at an early stage. Project Performance Audit Reports
(PPAR) have recently been prepared for three of the above projects. That for
Loan 653-CE/Credit 174-CE, which was for both irrigation and electricity,
concluded that although implementation was seriously delayed, the
agricultural and power benefits turned out to be much greater than expected
at appraisal; the benefit of power generated was much increased by the rise
in petroleum prices in 1973 and afterwards. The PPAR report on Loan 636-CE,
for the 90 MW New Laksapana hydro station, concluded that the project had
been well conceived and constructed; it was built at low cost, and its timing
was fortunate in that it was almost complete at the time of the 1973 oil
crisis. A significant institutional advance under Loan 636-CE was the
establishment of CEB as a public corporation, replacing the Department of
Government Electrical Undertakings. Despite a promising start, CEB has not
developed as well as expected and both the Sixth (Credit 1048) and the
proposed projects are seeking to promote significant advances in CEB's
management. The PPAR report dealing with Credit 372-CE concluded that the
project met its major objectives; the extensions to the transmission and
distribution system built under it, though completed late, enabled full use
to be made of the Ukuwela and New Laksapana hydro stations.
1.13    The Sixth Power Project is about a year behind schedule.
Effectiveness of Credit 1048-CE was postponed about 6 months because of a
delay in arranging cofinancing, and further delays arose owing to the
complexities of making procurement decisions, and because of changes of
1/ CEB was established in June 1969.

senior staff in CEB. At negotiations IDA was assured that CEB would adopt
quicker procurement procedures and such delays would be avoided in future.
1.14    CEB's management shortcomings were noted in the appraisal of the
Sixth Power Project and in the PPAR report on the Fifth Power Project. A
review of CEB's managerial performance and methods, financed under Credit
1048-CE, has been carried out by consultants, and action is being taken to
restore management systems, provide support to senior management, and
implement comprehensive training programs for all types of staff (paras
2.09-2.11).
1.15    The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided finance for
construction of the Bowatenne and Canyon hydro stations and for rural
electrification. GSL has arranged bilateral financing of hydro generation
components of the Mahaweli program as follows: - Sweden (Kotmale), U.K.
(Victoria) and the Federal Republic of Germany (Randenigala). The
construction of hydro generating facilities at Samanalawewa has been
postponed until the early 1990's.
Existing Facilities
1.16    CEB's existing generating, transmission and distribution facilities
are described in Annexes 2 and 3. CEB's present installed capacity is 499
MW, all interconnected on one system. In addition there are privately owned
generating stations, most of them less than 500 kW but ranging as large as
5.75 MW in CPC's refinery at Sapugaskande and 6 MW at the urea factory. The
transmission and distribution system comprises 569 miles of 132 kV line with
17 substations, 214 miles of 66 kV lines with 9 substations, about 3,250
miles of 33 kV, and about 750 miles of 11 kV lines. The system control and
load dispatching centre is at Kolonnawa, and all important plants and
switching centers can communicate by means of power line carrier.
Development Program
1.17    Of recent years detailed planning has not usually extended more than
four or five years ahead, but in mid 1981 CEB prepared a detailed development
plan to meet its generation requirements over the next 15 years. The plan
has not yet been officially adopted by GSL. The proposed hydro program shows
additions to the end of this decade bringing the installed capacity to about
950 MW with a firm energy capacity of 3,170 GWh. In the first four years of
the next decade, additions to hydro capacity of 1,000 MW and 2,000 GWh are
proposed. To complement the hydro, some hundreds of megawatts of thermal
plant will be needed between 1985 and 1994.
1.18    At negotiations, it was agreed that the following steps would be
taken to put CEB's planning on a workable footing. The new General Manager
should make planning a matter of high priority for his personal attention.
A corporate planning department should be formed to plan generation and



-6-
transmission and their associated capital expenditures.   The same group
should play a leading role in the preparation of one year and five year
operational budgets and capital budgets. The group will be required to
produce, by the end of 1982, a comprehensive development plan for generation,
transmission and distribution. The plan will extend 15 years ahead and will
be reviewed and updated annually. At negotiations an assurance was obtained
that CEB will prepare such a plan by the end of 1982 to be endorsed by GSL
and submitted to the Association.
1.19    CEB requires an effective planning unit to pursue a number of
pressing problems, including:
(a)  the immediate addition of a diesel power station, which is
necessary if energy shortages in 1984 and 1985 are to be
minimized (Annex 1).
(b)  the timely commissioning of Victoria:  in particular the
impounding of the 1984 monsoon rains is of primary importance
and CEB must make every effort to avoid delay.
(c)  the energy shortages likely in 1982, 83 and 84:  programs to
minimize their impact, by means of economies and demand
management, have to be worked out in advance.
(d)  the need for one or two coal fired generating stations
toward the end of the present decade: sites need to be
selected and secured very soon.
1.20    In order to optimize the management and operation of the Mahaweli
resource, as well as the planning of future construction, it is expected that
CEB and MASL will cooperate closely, perhaps forming a joint planning unit.
An immediate planning requirement is an exhaustive hydro identification and
ranking study. CEB has requested GSL to have this performed and financed by
the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), who have done similar
service to other countries. The planning unit will establish and maintain
its mathematical models and computer programs in Colombo, so that forecasts
and plans can be updated as needed, and suggested changes from any quarter
can be readily and fully evaluated. Services required to assist CEB in
establishing its planning department will be funded from CrediL 1048-CE.
Access to Service and Status of Supply
1.21    The total energy generated by CEB's power stations in 1980 was 1,668
GWh, about 89% of it hydro. CEB supplied about 208,000 consumers, including
218 local authorities who distributed electricity to another 226,000
consumers, making the total number of consumers about 434,000. Of these,
about 333,000 were domestic. This suggests that at present only about one
household in eight has an electricity connection. Rural electrification has



-7--
been extended to over 2,000 of a total 25,000 villages (para 1.27), but
electricity consumption per head was less than 100 kWh in 1980. The majority
of households use firewood for cooking and kerosene for lighting.
1.22    The Bowatenne hydro station was commissioned in 1981 and Canyon is
scheduled to be commissioned in 1982. Victoria and Kotmale are to come on
line in 1984 and 1985. To prevent shortages of capacity and energy before
the new hydro becomes available it was necessary to install additional
thermal plant. Three 20 MW gas turbines were installed in late 1980 and
early 1981. A second group of three 20 MW gas turbines was installed late
in 1981.
1.23    Further generation will be needed in addition to the six gas turbines
to supply the forecast energy needed in 1984, 85 and 86, and it is expected
that CEB will order 80 MW of diesel generators in 1982 for installation in
1983 (para 4.15).
1.24    In the months of May through August 1980 there was load shedding to
the extent of about 50 GWh (about 3.5% of annual sales), made necessary by
lower than average rainfall, poor availability of steam units, and the
breakdown of one hydro unit at New Laksapana. Only one of the gas turbines
was in service before the end of 1980 because of ordering and construction
delays. CEB entered 1981 with its hydro reservoirs only 2/3 full, and load
shedding was again inevitable. It was started in February and continued into
June, with the loss of an estimated 69 GWh of sales. Toward the end of the
period, supplies to the general public were off for 8 hours per day, and 16
major public corporations were shut down to husband the little water
remaining in the reservoirs.
Plant Maintenance
1.25    The maintenance of CEB's transmission and distribution system has
been adequate although unsystematic. Less satisfactory are the distribution
lines of some of the local authorities, where for many years only the barest
maintenance has been done and more consumers have continually been added to
existing lines so that voltages at peak times are well below acceptable
levels. The largest of the local authority undertakings, Mt. Lavinia, near
Colombo, with about 14,000 consumers and serving a population of about
250,000, was taken over by CEB in 1979.
1.26    Maintenance of CEB's generating stations was done reasonably well
in the past, but has deteriorated in recent years. Adequate systems exist
for keeping plant history and maintenance records but in many stations they
are not kept up to date. There is no planned maintenance schedule for each
station to permit management to check easily that all items of plant are
provided for and have duly been serviced. These deficiencies were
particularly evident at the Kelanitissa steam plant, but efforts are now
being made to restore this station to a reasonable level of reliability.



-8-
Rural Electrification
1.27    The first rural electrification schemes were undertaken in the early
1960s. Sri Lanka has about 25,000 villages and CEB had provided service to
about 2,000 of them by the end of 1979. Some of the local authorities who
buy in bulk from CEB have extended their lines into nearby villages, adding
to the extent of rural electrification. By the end of 1984, an additional
1,150 villages will be connected under a Rural Electrification project
financed by ADB and GSL at a total cost of US$ 31.8 million.
1.28    The ADB project is expected to introduce some significant
improvements in the handling of rural electrification:
(a) the rural electrification force in CEB will be expanded and
empowered to scrutinize and monitor the formulation and
implementation of all new schemes and to implement the
ADB Project. CEB has agreed to appoint a Project Manager
for rural electrification and to establish a Load Promotion
and Monitoring Unit;
(b) economic analysis and discounted cash flow calculations will
be employed in the feasibility analysis of rural schemes;
(c) CEB will arrange installment financing of house wiring and
connection charges.
System Losses
1.29    Before 1976, energy losses on CEB's system were less than 12%, but
they have since been rising and are currently reported in excess of 16%.
Moreover, these figures do not include losses in the retail operations of
the local authorities, who buy in bulk about 25% of the energy sold by CEB
and distribute it at low efficiency. Analysis suggests that an acceptable
level for overall losses would be about 13% of gross generation. In future,
substantial blocks of energy will have to be generated thermally every year
making better control of losses even more important. It is CEB's intention
to establish a cell within the planning group to monitor and control losses.
Funds for this will be provided under the project (Annex 7).
Historical Consumption
1.30    Growth in consumption of electrical energy over the period 1961 to
1980 has averaged 9.5% p.a., ranging from 17.8% in 1966 to 3.3% in 1974.
From 1972 to 1977 there was a period of weaker growth, but it appears that a
rate higher than the long term trend is now being established.
1.31    The short and long term annual growth rates for each class of
consumer are summarized in Table 1.2. Energy sales since 1961 are analyzed
in Table 1.3.

Load Forecast
1.32    CEB compiles an annual energy sales forecast from forecasts of the
consumption of each class of consumer within each of CEB's geographical
divisions.  In so doing, historical trends are considered for each of the 23
areas which together make up the divisions.  Due weight is given to known
prospective loads such as housing schemes, industrial parks, commercial
areas, individual industries, commercial properties, and rural
electrification schemes. For longer term forecasting, correlation and
regression analyses are used. All consumers are divided into three
categories, and growth rates are related to gross domestic product, to value
added in mining and manufacturing and export processing, and to population.
1/ 1980 sales are as estimated without load shedding.



-10-
To accommodate deviations from the trend, upper and lower limit estimates are
made.
1.33    CEB's power and energy forecast of August 1981 is summarized in Table
1.4 and is shown in greater detail in Annex 4.
Table 1.4: ENERGY AND POWER DEMAND FORECAST
1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985  1986 1987 1988 1989 1990
Energy Sales GWh  1446  1795  2001  2196  2451  2816  3101 3364 3662 3987 4342
Increase      %    11.4  24.1  11.5   9.7  11.6  14.9  10.1  8.5  8.9  8.9  8.9
Generation   GWh  1728  2112  2354  2584  2884  3313  3648 3958 4308 4691 5108
Peak Demand  MW    382   447   498   546   610   698   769  834  908  989 1077
The energy sales figure for 1980 is an estimate of what consumption
in that year would have been if there had been no load shedding (the actual
was 1396 GWh), and this is used as the base for the forward projections.
Because of load shedding in 1981 the actual figure for 1981 will be less than
that shown, by an estimated 69 GWh. The figures do not provide for supplying
an extension to the Ceylon Cement Corporation's factory, which will install
its own generation to supply about 90 GWh per year. The large increase from
1980 to 1981 and the strong growth forecast for the following four years are
supported by evidence of contracts signed and construction in progress.
1.34    The heavy load shedding experienced in 1980 and 1981 may have
repercussions on some of the planned enterprises included in the forecast.
Some slippage in the construction, commissioning and building up to full
scale operation of new industrial and commercial ventures can be expected.
CEB and GSL may be expected to try to reduce demand by promoting energy
savings in the operations of Government industries and the private sector, by
raising tariff demand charges and even by shutting down uneconomic operations
in critical periods. These and other measures may cause growth in demand to
lag behind CEB's projections. For purposes of generation and transmission
planning, however, CEB's forecast is appropriate.
1.35    The growth of sales by class of consumer is summarized in Table 1.5.
It is forecast that growth in domestic consumption will be depressed by the
recent increases in tariff and by the fuel surcharge, and will fall from its
very high rates of recent years back to about 11% for the remainder of the
decade. Similarly, the rate of growth in consumption by local authorities,
whose consumers are mainly domestic and commercial, is expected to be
somewhat less than in recent years, and is taken to be about 10%.
1.36    Small and medium industries, defined as taking less than 1,000 kVA,
ave projected to have an underlying growth from 1980 to 1984 of 6%, to which
is added the Greater Colombo Economic Commission's forecast for each year;



-1 1-
for 1985 and thereafter 8% growth is used. Consumption by large industries
is forecast to increase by 13.9% per year on average up to 1985. This is
explained mainly by the considerable number of projects expected to come to
fruition in 1981-83. The underlying growth for the period 1980-83 was taken
as 4% p.a., and after 1983, 8% was applied.
1.37    Commercial consumption is forecast to continue to grow rapidly in the
years up to 1986, as it has in the recent past. Up to 1986 an underlying
growth rate of 11% is expected, and to this is added the individual
consumptions of the expanded airport at Katunayake, the substantial loads
to be fed at the Urban Development Authority's developments in Colombo, and
the new Parliamentary complex at Kotte. After 1987 a rate of 10% is
estimated for all commercial consumers taken together.

II. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Lending Arrangements
2.01    GSL will be the recipient of the proposed credit (US$36 million
equivalent) and will onlend the proceeds to CEB, the implementing agency for
the project (para 4.18). A similar arrangement was made under the earlier
sixth power project (Credit 1048-CE).



-12-
Organization
2.02    CEB was established by the CEB Act, No. 17 of 1969 (1969 CEB Act)
as the successor to the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings
(DGEU) and is responsible for the development and coordination of the
generation, supply and distribution of electrical energy in Sri Lanka. While
CEB is a public corporation the 1969 CEB Act does not endow it with fully
autonomous powers and the government has reserved to itself a substantial
role in important policy matters and in particular tariffs, capital
investment, borrowing and the appointment of the Chairman and the General
Manager. The conditions of service of all CEB staff are subject to GSL
regulation.   CEB is also subject to the provisions of the Finance Act, No.
38 of 1971 (1971 Finance Act) which regulates the finances of all public
corporations in Sri Lanka.
2.03    CEB is a corporate body governed by a seven-member Board; members
serve a five-year term and may be reappointed. Board members are appointed
by GSL - four with experience in either engineering, commerce, administration
or accountancy, and the others representing local authorities, industry and
the Ministry of Finance - and may be removed at any time. The Chairman is
appointed from amongst the Board members. The present Chairman is also the
Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy.
2.04    CEB's organization structure was designed by consultants, Urwick
International Ltd., in the early 1970's under Loan 636-CE. While some
modifications have been made in recent years including the addition of two
posts of Additional General Manager, the original pattern is basically
unchanged. Changes are now contemplated as part of the general management
improvements now taking place in CEB (para 2.08). They would strengthen the
decentralization of CEB's operations while retaining key controls in Colombo.
The assurance obtained under Credit 1048-CE that CEB will submit to IDA, in
advance, any proposal for major change to CEB's organizational structure is
repeated under the proposed project.
Management and Staffing
2.05    While the Chairman is responsible through the Board for policy
matters and close liaison with government, the General Manager is CEB's Chief
Executive Officer. He is responsible for the overall direction and control
of CEB's day-to-day business. The present General Manager was recently
promoted to the post and is an experienced and long-serving engineer. He is
presently assisted by an Additional General Manager, four Deputy General
Managers and a Finance Manager. With the exception of the Finance Manager,
who is not fully qualified in matters of finance but is a competent and
long-serving administration officer, all top management posts are filled by
engineers. The Commercial and Personnel Managers, Chief Internal Auditor
(vacant), and the Legal Officer all report directly to the General Manager.
CEB's present senior management structure is set out in Annex 5. Below this



-13-
level, CEB operations are decentralized and are controlled at plant (for
generation) and divisional level. Each of the seven operating divisions into
which Sri Lanka is organized is headed by a Divisional Manager, who is a
qualified engineer; the divisions are further divided into areas which are
the primary units for systems maintenance, meter reading and consumer
services.
2.06    CEB has had considerable difficulty in retaining experienced staff in
recent years as many engineers and accountants have left for overseas or
private sector posts offering substantially higher monetary rewards. Salary
differentials for senior CEB staff do not adequately reflect the heavy
additional responsibilities of such posts.   The lack of experienced
engineering staff in the 30-45 year range is particularly noticeable at CEB
while qualified or part-qualified accountants are now extremely difficult to
recruit. These problems appear to be common to many public sector
enterprises in Sri Lanka. A number of key finance posts which were vacant at
the time of appraisal have since been filled.
2.07    CEB's present manpower is about 11,000 against an authorized total
of about 14,000. Manpower has increased as follows in recent years:
Table 2.1: CEB MANPOWER
May
December 31       1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981
1. Managerial, pro-
fessonial and
administrative staff    235    244    285    329    312    344    336
2. Technical and
clerical staff         1,895  1,934  2,379  2,476  2,787  3,132  3,083
3. Labor Grades           6,050  6,308  6,712  6,918  6,849  7,037  7,669
8,180  8,486  9,376  9,723  9,948 10,513 11,088
Whilst CEB's staff is large in relation to the size of its operations
and the number of consumers it serves, the rate of increase over the past
six years has been held to an average of 5.2% per year, which is reasonable
in view of an expanding program of works, a rural electrification program,
undertaken by force account, and the need to cover a high turnover of skilled
labor.
Management Systems
2.08    Comprehensive management information, accounting and budgeting
systems were introduced by CEB in 1973 following a study by consultants,
Urwick International Ltd., financed under Loan 636-CE.   While the systems
are satisfactory and are relevant to CEB's operations, senior management is
not utilizing the information system, and this has resulted in a lack of
control of CEB's activities. Staffing difficulties in recent years have led
to serious delays in the preparation of periodic management reports,



-14-
particularly financial reports. Present IDA reporting requirements are
outlined in Annex 6, but are not being achieved. Internal audit arrangements
have never been satisfactorily established in CEB largely due to the
inability to recruit a Chief Internal Auditor.
2.09    In view of the acknowledged weaknesses in CEB's present management
arrangements, CEB agreed under the sixth power project (Credit 1048-CE) to
implement a program of management improvements. To this end, Urwick
International Ltd., were recalled to review the situation and, in particular,
the status of implementation of their earlier recommendations and the
effectiveness of management practices in certain specified areas and to
recommend a program of measures to restore CEB's managerial effectiveness.
2.10    This short assignment is now complete:  recommendations for the
"restoration  phase cover (a) general management advice, (b) restoration and
further development (e.g. computerization) of CEB's systems, and (c) the
introduction of management development and training programs. The
restoration of management systems and the development of training (para 2.11)
are most urgent tasks and CEB has recently appointed Urwick International
Ltd., with their extensive background knowledge for this purpose. The
appointment of a general management advisor requires a person experienced in
power utility management and CEB will be discussing a number of options with
IDA in the coming months. Funding is available under Credit 1048-CE for the
restoration" program.
Training
2.11    CEB operates a residential training center at Castlereagh for
technicians which offers courses related to CEB's operations. Accommodation
is limited and CEB is planning to develop non-residential technical training
facilities in Colombo as a result of an earlier investigation by the National
Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Washington, D.C., financed under the
USAID program. Regular training programs are required to fit engineers for
managerial positions; prior to assuming responsibility for operating
facilities newly qualified engineers should receive six-months on-the-job
training: at present this requirement is not consistently achieved. There
is no program for progressive management development. Training programs are
also required to familiarize accounting staff with CEB's financial operations
and reporting requirements for financial control. CEB agreed under Credit
1048-CE to submit to IDA a satisfactory training program for all cadres of
CEB staff by June 30, 1981, and thereafter to implement an agreed program.
CEB has submitted an outline training program after discussions with IDA and
following Urwick's recent report. This proposal will be developed to suit
CEB's needs and provision is made under the proposed project to finance
training expenditure.



-15-
Local Authority Distribution Systems
2.12    While CEB supplies power directly to some 208,000 domestic,
commercial and industrial consumers throughout Sri Lanka, another 226,000
consumers are supplied by local authorities which purchase power in bulk from
CEB.The quality of local authority service to consumers is unsatisfactory
(para 1.25). GSL planned that CEB should assume responsibility for the
distribution facilities of the local authorities. CEB would take over all
staff, assets and liabilities relating to electricity supply. In view of
CEB's present managerial problems and the heavy additional burden such a
transfer would place on CEB, including its financial position, the transfer
is presently deferred and may not now proceed. GSL has confirmed this
position (para 4.09).
Audit
2.13    The present arrangements under Credit 1048-CE require CEB to submit
(a) unaudited accounts to IDA within four months of the year-end (the time
permitted by law for their submission to the Auditor General) and (b) the
Auditor Generals report on the accounts within ten months of the year-end.
CEB-s FY 1980 unaudited accounts were submitted for audit in May 1981, a
considerable improvement on earlier years, but the final audit report is
still awaited. The above arrangements are satisfactory and will be continued
under the proposed project.
Insurance
2.14    CEB has for a number of years borne its own insurable risks and has
established an Insurance Reserve to which an annual contribution of 1/10% of
gross fixed assets values is transferred from retained earnings. This
arrangement is satisfactory.



-1.6-
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01    The main objective of the project is to supply efficieLitly, reliably
and at minimum cost the output from the hydro electric power stations in the
Mahaweli basin to the principal load centres in and around Colombo. In doing
this CEB will establish the first elements of a 220 kV grid that will
eventually cover much of the country. It was therefore essential to perform
screening studies looking well into the future to ensure that a system will
evolve that is flexible enough to accommodate any reasonable generation
program. This meant considering how to handle the outputs from all major
generation developments probable in the next twenty years, including such
hydro electric potentials as Upper Kotmale, Uma Oya, Samanalawewa and Kukule,
and possible coal fired stations at Colombo and Trincomalee. A secondary
objective of the project is to inject power into the existing 66 kV system so
as to enable it to function at acceptable levels of reliability, voltage
control and energy losses.
Description
3.02    The project consists of the following components (for details see
Annex 7 and the map IBRD 16016R.
(a) 126 km of 220 kV doable circuit transmission line and 38 km of
132 kV single circuit transmission line.
(b) One new 220/132 kV substation, additions to three existing 132 kV
substations, one new 132 kV switching station and additions to an
existing 66 kV substation.
(c) Replacement of circuit breakers with new ones of higher
rupturing capacity.
(d) Power factor correction equipment.
(e) Power line carrier equipment.
(f) Equipment for a loss reduction cell.
(g)  Vehicles, tools and buildings.
(h) Engineering consulting services, technical assistance and
training.

Project Cost
3.03    The estimated cost of the project is Rs 1,412 million (US$76.3
million) including contingencies and customs duties. The estimated costs are
summarized in Table 3.1 and shown in greater detail in Annex 8.

3.04    The cost estimates were developed by CEB and their consultants and
are based on recent quotations updated where necessary to 1981 prices.
Physical contingencies of 10% were allowed where applicable, and price
contingencies amounting to 17.3% of the project cost were calculated using
the following rates of escalation:
1981    1982      1983    1984    1985
Foreign              %                     9       8.5       8        7.5      7

Customs duties ranging from 5% to 50% on imported equipment and materials
were allowed as applicable, amounting to 15.9% of the total project cost.
The cost estimates are adequate.



-18-
Project Financing Plan
3.05    It is anticipated that co-financing of the project will be arranged
between IDA (US$ 36.0 million) and the Opec Fund (US$11.0 million). The
combined amount (US$ 47 million) would cover 100% of the foreign costs (US$
46.8 million) together with local training costs (US$ 0.2 million)1/ and
represents about 62% of the total project cost (or about 73% excluding
customs duties). CEB will be expected to meet all other local costs (US$
29.3 million) from internal cash generation.  The components proposed to be
financed by IDA, the Opec Fund and CEB are identified in Table 3.2. A
satisfactory arrangement for financing by the OPEC Fund is a condition of
credit effectiveness.

Engineering and Implementation
3.06    In view of the construction of a group of relatively large new hydro
stations totalling about 580 MW in the Mahaweli Basin, studies of the
transmission system were carried out by CEB and their consultants. They
concluded that for the main link from Mahaweli to Colombo the optimum
solution would be to complete two 220 kV circuits by the time Victoria was
commissioned, with the intention of adding a third in due course. Since this

-19-
voltage had not previously been used in the country, they decided to employ
consultants for this project, and engaged the firm which had already started
designing the 220 kV substation at Victoria and the line from there to
Kotmale. The cost of engineering for the lines and substations as far as
evaluation of tenders is being financed from Credit 1048-CE. The balance of
the consulting work comprising detailed design, contract supervision,
inspection and testing, and supervision of construction will be financed from
the proposed Credit. The contract provides for about 140 man months of
foreign engineers' services at an average man-month cost (including fees,
international travel, subsistence, allowances, and reimbursable foreign
costs) of US$ 9,300.
3.07    The specification of the 220 kV lines will be essentially that
developed for the line from Victoria to Kotmale, while the 132 kV lines will
follow CEB's established practice. The areas through which the lines will
pass have been surveyed by helicopter and then visited on land, and
provisonal routes chosen. As soon as the contract is awarded the contractor
will perform check surveys. It is expected that tenders will have been
received and evaluated by end-March 1982.
3.08    The project will be constructed between September 1982 and slay 1984
(Annex 9). Completion by this date is necessary to permit the first
generator in Victoria to come on line as scheduled in mid-1984.
Procurement
3.09    The main part of the project will be constructed under the following
contracts:
(a) A single responsibility contract for the 220 kV and 132 kV
lines.
(b) A single responsibility contract for the new 220 kV substation,
the new 132 kV switching station, and the modifications to
the existing 132 kV and 66 kV substations; this contract
will include the supply and installation of the reactive
compensation equipment, and the installation (but not the
supply) of the power transformers and the power line carrier
equipment.
(c) A supply contract for the power transformers.
(d) A supply contract for the circuit breaker replacements.
(e) A supply contract for the power line carrier equipment.
3.10    International competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's guidelines
will be employed for the major contracts. Vehicles, equipment and materials



-20-
3.10    International competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's guidelines
will be employed for the major contracts. Vehicles, equipment and materials
not exceeding US$15,000 per item and US$150,000 in aggregate may be procured
in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory. For materials
and equipment tendered internationally, the standard domestic preference of
15% on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duty, whichever is less, will be
applied in bid evaluation.
Disbursements
3.11    The Credit will be disbursed against the following items:
(a)  100% of the foreign expenditures for 220 kV and 132 kV
transmission lines.
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported items, or
100% of the local expenditure (ex-factory) for locally
manufactured items, or 65% for locally procured items
(equipment and materials for power transformers, power line
carrier, loss reduction program, and vehicles and tools).
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures on engineering consultants.
(d)  100% of expenditures on technical assistance and 100% of
training.
A schedule of estimated disbursements is provided in Annex 10. It is
consistent with the proposed implementation period for the project (para
3.08) and provides for about 90% disbursements by project completion. The
proposed credit would be fully disbursed by June 1985, some 3 1/2 years from
project approval. Similar recent Bank Group projects have been disbursed
over about 4 1/2 years, but CEB is confident that it can complete the project
in a shorter period.
Land Acquisition
3.12    No problems are foreseen.  The site for the Biyagama substation has
to be acquired but no difficulty is expected as the land is owned by GSL.
Wayleaves for transmission lines are routinely acquired without difficulty.
Risks
3.13    The project consists of normal electric utility work entailing no
unusual risks and no particular difficulty is foreseen in its execution.
Price contingencies in the estimate have been allocated to minimise the risk
of cost overruns.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
CEB's Statutory Position
4.01    CEB's finances are regulated by the provisions of the 1969 CEB Act
and the 1971 Finance Act, which affects all public corporations in Sri Lanka.
CEB is required, by Section 38 of the 1969 CEB Act, to operate in a
commercial manner so as to ensure that revenues are sufficient to meet all
outgoings, including depreciation and interest, and a reasonable proportion
of development costs. CEB's statutory obligations were amended in two
important respects following IDA approval of Credits 372-CE and 1048-CE. 1/
in 1973:
(a) CEB is permitted to charge depreciation in its accounts based
on a current valuation of fixed assets rather than the historic
cost of such assets.
(b) CEB's obligation to pay an 8% annual dividend on GSL's equity
capital is waived each year until CEB has generated cash
equivalent to a 30% contribution to the combined annual
capital expenditure on electricity supply, including interest
during construction, of CEB and any other body responsible
for undertaking a joint scheme with CEB.
Past Financial Performance
4.02    CEB's actual financial operations for the five years to FY 1980 are
summarized in Table 4.1 below and are shown in greater detail in Annex 11.
1/    These conditions are repeated under the proposed Credit.

Investment Program            37%        43%       16%        67%        58%
CEB was required, under IDA Credit 372-CE, to maintain tariffs at
levels sufficient to produce, from FY 1974, at least an 8% annual rate of
return on currently valued net fixed assets in operation. In this respect
CEB's financial performance through FY 1978 was unsatisfactory mainly as a
result of unchanged tariff levels between April 1, 1972 and December 1, 1978.
CEB has, however, satisfactorily revalued its fixed assets through FY1980
using agreed local indices. In the seven years FY's 1972 through 1978
whereas the average cost of energy (including depreciation) per kWh rose by
58% from Rs 0.11 to 0.17 CEB's average sales revenue per kWh rose by only 20%
from Rs 0.15 to 0.18. Following a tariff increase on December 1, 1978, sales
revenue rose to Rs 0.30/kWh in FY 1979. Except for an unexpectedly large (37
1/2%) movement in the indices used for fixed asset revaluation, the
a/   Operating expenses before depreciation divided by operating revenues.
b/   Following an initial valuation of CEB's fixed assets at January 1, 1972,
subsequent revaluations of fixed assets, using local indices agreed with
IDA, have been incorporated in CEB's accounts annually from FY's 1977
through 1980.



-23-
covenanted 8% rate of return would have been achieved, the actual being about
7%. Operating expenses increased in FY 1979 by about 32%, much less than
budgetted, bringing the average energy cost to Rs 0.20/kWh.
Present Financial Position
4.03    In order to achieve the 8% rate of return required by IDA, CEB was
required to make a further tariff increase as a condition of effectiveness of
Credit 1048-CE. From October 1, 1980, GSL authorized CEB (a) to increase
tariffs from an average Rs 0.30 to Rs 0.58/kWh and (b) to introduce a revised
fuel adjustment surcharge on all consumers so as to recover automatically the
monthly fuel cost of thermal generation (para 4.11). Following these
revisions CEB's rate of return on revalued assets in FY 1980 was about 9% and
is estimated at about 11% in FY 1981. This constitutes a very satisfactory
turnaround of CEB's finances since FY 1978.
4.04    CEB's financial position as at December 31, 1980, based on unaudited
accounts for FY 1980, was as follows:

Total Liabilities                           6,025
4.05    CEB's FY 1980 balance sheet indicates a highly satisfactory
debt/equity ratio of 20:80 (debt service was covered 7.3 times by earnings).
CEB's current ratio is a relatively high 3.3 times but this will fall to a
more satisfactory level (about two times) in the 1980's.   CEB will have to



-24-
maintain a tight control over the level of consumer receivables (paras 4.06 -
4.10) and inventories.l/
Billing and Collection
4.06    CEB's billing and collection performance has been reasonably
satisfactory in recent years. Under Credit 1048-CE, CEB's customer
receivables on the last day of each month should not exceed the aggregate
billings for the three months ending on the same day and this requirement
is repeated under the proposed project.   CEB has made considerable efforts
to meet this target: the position at December 31, 1980 indicates receivables
equivalent to 3.2 months billings compared to 3.6 months billings at end FY
1978. As CEB's revenues have quadrupled in this short period the present
receivables position represents a commendable performance by CEB staff.
4.07    An analysis of consumer receivables at end FY 1980 is as follows:
1/ Under the Sixth Power Project CEB agreed to reduce inventories to a
satisfactory level by December 31, 1982 and GSL agreed to ensure the
timely availability of foreign exchange for inventories: materials
management problems have already been reviewed by CEB's management con-
sultants and action is being taken to improve controls. These conditions
are repeated under the proposed project.

4.08    CEB has a separate unit to handle large consumers' accounts, which
are maintained on a manual system. The above table indicates that CEB is
maintaining a tight credit control over most large consumers, the exception
being the 218 local authorities which CEB supplies in bulk and for street
lighting. In the first three months of 1981 CEB managed to reduce local
authority arrears by some Rs 6.5 million to about Rs 30 million, equivalent
to some 7 months billings but the position is still unsatisfactory.
4.09    GSL agreed, under Credit 1048-CE to ensure the timely payment of
future amounts owed by the local authorities to CEB together with arrears in
accordance with an agreed program. At that time GSL was proposing to
transfer the local authority systems to CEB and this led to a deterioration
in the local authority arrears position. Arrears would have been settled as
a part of the transfer arrangements. The transfer has now been abandoned.
a/ Local authority billings are at pre-December 1978 tariffs by agreement
between GSL and CEB. GSL is billed separately in respect of the tariffs
increases, including the fuel surcharge, since December 1, 1978: the
billings and receivables on this account are not included under the
Government sector in this table but are shown under a separate debtor's
account (paragraph 4.09).



-26-
An assurance was obtained, therefore, at negotiations that, from October 1,
1981, the local authorities will pay the current CEB tariffs for bulk
supplies and introduce retail tariffs which are sufficient to cover CEB's
bulk supply charges and the local authorities distribution costs. Presently
GSL is responsible for payment of increases in the local authority bulk
supply tariffs since December 1, 1978, but to date has made payments to CEB
only up to March 31, 1981. Arrangements are in progress to settle the
remaining amount and the payment to CEB of the amount outstanding at
September 30, 1981 is a condition of credit effectiveness.
4.10    The bulk of CEB's billings are of relatively small amounts and are
maintained on computer.  They constitute some 25% of CEB's billings by
amount. Over 50% of such monthly accounts are for less than Rs 15. The
difficulty of recruiting satisfactory meter readers poses a continuing
serious problem for CEB and leads to some delays in billing and problems in
collection.   CEB is striving for improved performance in this sector.
Revenues and Tariffs
4.11    The details of CEB's recent tariff structure are set out in Annex
12. CEB's tariffs were unchanged between April 1972 and December 1978 but
since then two tariff increases have been made which have increased CEB's
average tariff by about 260% from Rs 0.16 to 0.58/kWh (about 3 US cents).l/
In addition to raising tariff levels in recent years, which has enabled it to
meet financial rate of return criteria, CEB has also made some structural
improvements to its tariffs. Domestic consumers now pay higher block tariffs
and non-domestic tariffs have been rationalized. Further, from October 1,
1980, CEB is recovering automatically the cost of fuel needed for CEB's
increasing thermal generation by way of a surcharge on consumers' monthly
bills. The first 200 units of domestic consumption (equivalent to a maximum
charge of US$ 5) are exempt from the surcharge and this exempts over 90% of
domestic consumers.
4.12    CEB agreed under Credit 1048-CE to carry out a study of long run
marginal cost (LRMC) pricing with technical assistance from the Bank. This
study should have been completed by December 31 1980 but staffing
constraints in particular have led to delay and it was agreed to extend the
deadline by one year to December 31, 1981. Preliminary results of the study
were submitted at negotiations but further refinements are needed for the
results to be useful for tariff restructuring. The study is now being
revised and CEB gave an assurance during negotiations to implement any
recommendations agreed after consultation with GSL and IDA.
1/ with the addition of the fuel surcharge this was equivalent to about -
6 US cents/kwh. in 1981.



-27-
4.13    An assurance was obtained at negotiations that CEB will continue,
as previously, to review tariffs annually, before the start of each financial
year to ensure that revenues are sufficient to meet operating expenses,
including fuel and depreciation, and to produce at least an 8% rate of return
on currently valued net fixed assets.   While the presently agreed rate of
return is 8%, in FY 1982 CEB will have to increase tariffs by about 50%,
(equivalent to a 12% rate of return) in order to generate sufficient internal
resources to meet the local costs of its approved investment program through
1985.  This increase in tariffs is a condition of credit effectiveness.   In
FYs 1982 and 1983 such tariffs would produce a before-tax rate of return of
16% (para 4.16). From FY 1985 onwards further tariff increases will be
required to enable CEB at least to maintain the covenanted 8% rate of return:
the amount of such increases will depend to a great extent upon the size of
CEB's future investment program.
Transfer of Assets from MASL
4.14    The 1969 Act authorizes CEB to enter into "joint schemes" with other
agencies for the generation of electricity. The Act does not detail the
arrangements for the transfer and operation of assets created under such
schemes. Subsequently, under Credit 372-CE, GSL agreed to ensure that CEB is
sufficiently involved on the formulation of all future joint schemes, and
that the power assets are transferred on completion to CEB on terms
satisfactory to IDA. This was done in the case of the 38 MW Ukuwela hydro
station constructed under the Mahaweli Ganga Stage I (para 1.11(g)). Most of
the hydro-power development in the 1980's in Sri Lanka will be carried out
under the Accelerated Mahaweli Program. CEB is not required to contribute to
the costs of these schemes during the construction phase but ownership will
be transferred to CEB on their completion. The need for adequate
co-ordination between CEB and in the design and construction of these
facilities was discussed in the context of the Sixth Power Project and again
during negotiations for the proposed project. CEB is not represented on the
MASL Board and such representation would require legislation. However,
technical co-ordination between the two agencies is now satisfactory.   GSL
agreed during negotiations to ensure proper future co-ordination between CEB
and any other agency involved in a joint scheme. Futhermore, in view of the
major impact that the Victoria and Kotmale assets will have on CEB-s
finances, GSL and CEB have agreed a satisfactory provisional basis for the
transfer of these assets.
Financing Plan (FYs 1981-85)
4.15    CEB's presently approved investment program through FY 1985,
comprises the ongoing ADB-assisted Bowatenne, Canyon and Rural
Electrification projects, the IDA-assisted sixth (transmission and
distribution) and proposed seventh (Mahaweli transmission) projects, various
small system augmentation works and the installation of a second 60 MW of gas
turbines in FY 1982. GSL confirmed at negotiations that it has recently



-28-
agreed to the inclusion of an 80 MW diesel project in CEB's investment
program (para 1.23) and to contribute Rs 800 million in the form of Equity
towards the cost of such a project. Furthermore, GSL has approached IDA for
financial assistance towards the foreign costs of the project.
4.16    CEB has not, in past years, been liable to pay income tax.  However,
from April 1981 the basis of annual depreciation allowances used in the
computation of tax liability has been changed. In future CEB will be
entitled to claim a 12 1/2% depreciation allowance on newly commissioned
assets over an eight year period as compared to the previous 100% allowance
in the first year. Consequently, it is estimated that CEB may incur a tax
liability totalling Rs 665 million in FY-s 1982/83 but thereafter the
transfer of major hydro-stations will create tax losses to be carried forward
to subsequent years.   CEB is also liable to a Turnover Tax of 2% of its
sales revenues, including those in respect of the recovery of fuel costs.
4.17    CEB's estimated financial requirements for the period FY's 1981
through 1985 and the sources of funds are as follows:

4.18    The proceeds of the IDA credit of US$36 million will be made
available to CEB by GSL at 12% interest for a 20 year period with 3 years
grace. 1/   GSL will bear any foreign exchange risk in accordance with the
1969 CEB Act. The execution of an onlending agreement satisfactory to IDA is
a condition of credit effectiveness.
4.19    To protect its future financial viability, CEB has agreed previously
not to incur any long-term debt without IDA's prior agreement unless its
maximum future debt service is covered at least 1.25 times by its most recent
12 months operating surplus before depreciation. This condition is repeated
under the proposed Credit.
Future Finances
4.20    Financial projections for the period FY 1979 through FY 1988 are set
out in Annexes 13-16. Assumptions used to prepare the projections are set
out in Annex 17. Salient features of CEB's future finances, which are
satisfactory, are summarized in Table 4.5. The fluctuation in CEB's average
revenue in future years (table 4.5, line 1) results from the operation of the
present fuel adjustment clause. As part of the tariff review now being
undertaken (paras. 4.11-4.13) base fuel costs will be included in the basic
tariff to prevent fluctuations in consumer bills from month to month.
1/ CEB's commercial borrowing is negligible and loans are obtained towards
foreign and local expenditures from GSL whose present lending rate is
10%.  Inflation in Sri Lanka was, 1978-9%, 1979-16%, 1980-24%, and is
forecast at 1981-23%, 1982-17%, 1983-14%.

V. JUSTIFICATION
Approach
5.01    The proposed project is an integral part of a total power
sector investment program in Sri Lanka, incorporating CEB's expenditures
on generation, transmission and distribution, extra thermal capacity,
the Mahaweli program of hydroelectric stations, and the Samanalawewa
hydro station. It is the critical link conveying the additional power to be
generated at Victoria and Kotmale to the load centers. The rate of return
on the small incremental investment would be exceedingly high.
However, the method employed in this report is one of justifying the entire
investment program and recognizes all inherent costs, thereby covering the
proposed project implicitly.
5.02    As two agencies are involved in the planning of parts of the
investment program, conscious efforts to identify an overall least-cost
solution have only recently begun (para 1.17), and a least-cost program
has been developed with the help of an improved computer model. However,
the only aggregate investment program at the time of appraisal may not
have been the least-cost solution, and is, therefore, analyzed with respct to
its feasibility in economic terms, rather than compared to other potential
programs.
Economic Costs and Benefits
5.03    The investment program in its present form is presented in Annex 16.
It is based on CEB demand forecasts and represents all known planned
expenditure relevant to the power sector for the period 1981-1990. Where
available, costs, and benefits are expressed in CIF or equivalent border
terms. Local values are converted to border prices using a shadow/market
wage ratio and a standard conversion factor (Annex 18, paras. 3 to 5).
Economic benefits arising from incremental supply to electricity consumers
are calculated as the total willingness to pay including the consumers'
surplus, assumed to be approximated by the cost and extent of using
alternative energy sources for economic activities and lighting (Annex 18,
paras 6 to 12).
Results
5.04    The economic justification involves quantifying benefits in the
form of user surplus, assuming various possible shapes of the demand
curve for power. In economic terms, the best estimate of the rate of
return is about 14%, and about 8% if tariffs are used as benefit proxy.
A 10% increase in costs would reduce the rate of return to about 12%,



-32-
while a 10% decrease in costs would boost it to about 16%. If a real fuel
price increase of 3% p.a. is assumed, the rate of return with consumer surplus
is reduced to about 12%, with tariff revenue as benefit proxy to about
4% (Annex 18). The investment program in its aggregate form is
justified in economic terms if a conservative estimate of consumer surplus
is used as part of the benefit. Given the large build-up of generating
capacity in the next years, tariff revenue appears to be somewhat inadequate
to recover the full cost (including headworks) of the program.
Tariffs and Marginal Cost
5.05    The average revenue for CEB (including fuel surcharge) is expected
to approach Rs 2.00/kWh in 1983 (table 4.5). Present preliminary estimates
of long-run marginal cost for the system range between Rs 1.80/kWh and
Rs 2.50/ kWh, depending on voltage level and consumer characteristics. A
more detailed study of the structure of long-run maginal cost is under
preparation and is expected to be completed by January 1982: a first draft
is being finalized by CEB with Bank Group assistance. At present, it
appears likely that average revenue will be approaching marginal cost by
1983.
VI. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION

(para 4.13)
(k) arrangements for GSL co-ordination of Joint Schemes (para 4.14)
(1) CEB's debt service coverage (para 4.19)
Conditions of Effectiveness
6.02    The following will be required prior to Credit effectiveness

(b) GSL's payment to CEB of outstanding arrears in respect of
its local authorities (para 4.09); and
(c) a tariff increase averaging about 50% (para 4.13);
(d) conclusion of a satisfactory onlending agreement for the
proposed Credit (para 4.18).

SEVENTH (MAHAWELI TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
Existing Transmission and Distribution Systems
132 kV System
1.      The 132 kV system comprises 569 miles of line, of which 361 miles
are double circuit and 208 miles single circuit.
2.      At the heart of the system are the two largest hydro generating
stations, Polpitiya and Laksapana, connected together by four 132 kV
circuits. Wimalasurendra hydro station at Norton Bridge is also connected to
Laksapana by a short double circuit line.
3.      The largest load centre is at Kolonnawa near Colombo; it is fed by
four circuits from Polpitya. There are tees off these lines to substations
at Thulhiriya and Oruwala. Also feeding into Kolonnawa are two circuits from
the steam units and gas turbines at Kelanitissa power station.
4.      From the bars at Kolonnawa a single circuit runs south to a
substation at Ratmalana, whilst another double circuit runs north up the
coast to substations at Sapugaskande, Katunayaka, Bolowatta and Puttalam.
From Polpitiya a double circuit runs north up the middle of the island as far
as Anuradhapura, from where it continues as a single circuit by way of
Kilinochchi substation to Chunnakam in the northernmost part of the country.
Between Polpitiya and Anuradhapura there is a substation at Ukuwela, into
which the line from the Bowatenne hydro station feeds, and another at
Habarana. From Anuradhapura a single circuit tap takes off to Trincomalee on
the east coast. Starting from the busbars at Laksapana, a double circuit
line runs down as far as Galle on the south coast, with substations along the
way at Balangoda and Deniyaya.
5.      The 132 kV system is being reinforced and extended.  Second circuits
are being strung on existing towers from Anuradhapura to Chunnakam, from
Anuradhapura to Kantalai, and from Kolonnawa to Ratmalana. A new single
circuit line is being built from Kantalai to Valachchenai, and at
Valachchenai a new grid substation will be constructed. The foregoing work
is financed under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE) and is scheduled
for construction in 1981-1984. Other extensions to be built in the same
period are a double circuit from Pannipitya to Neboda and a single circuit
from Canyon to Laksapana.



ANNEX 3

66 kV System
6.      The system consists of about 214 miles of double circuit line
associated with the earliest power developments. In the old Laksapana
station there are 66 kV busbars connected to Kolonnawa receiving station by a
double circuit line, which also feeds substations at Padukka and Avissawela.
Another double circuit from Laksapana runs east to substations at Norton
Bridge, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla. From Badulla a single circuit continues
east as far as the hydro station at Inginiyagala; this section was
constructed for 132 kV but is at present operated at 66 kV.  A third line
originating at Laksapana carries two circuits north as far as Kandy. From
there to Kurunegala there is a double circuit built for 132 kV but operated
at 66 kV.
7.      The 66 kV system is interconnected with the 132 kV system by interbus
transformers at Kolonnawa and Laksapana.
Subtransmission and Distribution
8.      Most of the country is served by a system of about 3,250 route miles
of overhead lines at 33 kV, and 750 miles at 11 kV. Important points have
alternative supply routes. Most of the 132 kV substations are interlinked by
33 kV subtransmission lines to facilitate maintenance. Under the Sixth Power
Project about 500 miles of 33 kV subtransmission lines will be added.
9.      The city of Colombo draws its power at 33 kV from Kolonnawa, where
there are three 30 MVA transformers. Four 33/11 kV substations designated A,
B, C and D are connected to Kolonnawa and to each other by about 28 miles of
underground cable. Each of these substations serves its own 11 kV ring. The
rings are normally open so that each is effectively two radial feeders, so as
to simplify protection. Most of the 11 kV/400 V substations on these rings
contain two 500 MVA transformers each. Ring A serves a predominantly
domestic market, while the central ring B serves the main commercial and port
areas. Ring C covers the mainly industrial part to the north of Colombo,
whilst D serves other areas of domestic and commercial consumers. There is
some overhead LT distribution in Colombo, but most is done by underground
cables. Radial feeders from the substations supply feeder pillars, from
where distribution cables run out and are tapped for consumer service
connections.
10.     The four primary substations in Colombo are nearing the limit of
their capacity. Under the Sixth Power Project two new bulk supply
substations will be established, each containing two 30 MW, 132/11 kV
transformers, fed by underground cables from Kelanitissa and Kolonnawa. At
the same time two of the existing substations will be increased in capacity
by the addition of 12.5 MVA transformers, and the 11 kV underground cable
network will be modified appropriately.

SRI LANKA
SEVENTH (MAHAWELI TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
Project Description
A first study in 1979 tentatively decided on 220 kV as the primary
transmission voltage for bulk transfer of power from the Mahaweli basin to a
major substation in the outskirts of Colombo, with 132 kV interconnectors
from there into the existing and planned substations. The link from Victoria
to Kotmale has been designed and will be constructed for 220 kV. It is
essential that network design strategy take account of long term requirements
and that the system have the flexibility necessary to accomodate alternative
programs of generation in the future. Screening studies were therefore
carried out for realistic generating programs extending to the year 2000 to
determine their transmission requirements. The components of this project
integrate satisfactorily into the long term plans. They have been selected
from a number of technically feasible alternatives as those that will
minimise total system costs.
The number and capacity of transmission circuit reinforcements have
been based on the following criteria:
(a) For loads from 10 MW to 40 MW only one circuit need be provided
but load should be capable of restoration within 15 minutes by
means of switching at manned substations.
(b) For loads in excess of 40 MW firm supply is requircd so that
loss of one circuit causes no loss of load.
(c) The loss of any transmission circuit should not result in
overloading any other.
(d) The loss of any transmission circuit should not require out of
merit generation. (This is a guideline rather than a standard.
If a transmission reinforcement were required in order to meet
it, economic justification would also have to be demonstrated).
(e) The loss of any transmission circuit should not result in
voltages lower than 0.9 p.u. before automatic tap changes
have time to readjust levels.
1. Kotmale to Biyagama 220 kV transmission line
The work consists of building 70 km of double circuit line, using 2 x
400 sq. mm ACSR conductors per phase.



ANNEX 7
- 42 -                            Page 2 of 7
This line, which will start from the Kotmale Power Station
switchyard, will receive the major part of the output from new hydro stations
either now under construction or soon to be built at Kotmale, Victoria,
Randenigala and Rantembe, and deliver it to a substation at Biyagama in the
outskirts of Colombo. The line will be of the same design as the one from
Victoria to Kotmale which has already been designed. If the substation at
Kotmale is not completed in time, the Kotmale--Biyagama part will be tied
direct to the Victoria--Kotmale line.
2. Biyagama to Kelanitissa 220 kV transmission line
This line will be 16 km long, double circuit, having two 300 sq. mm
ACSR conductors per phase.
Kelanitissa and Kolonnawa substations together will supply the
central part of the city of Colombo, where very rapid load growth is
expected. The substation at Kelanitissa at present carries only 20 MW, but
load will be transferred to it from Kolonnawa, and the projected load at
Kelanitissa is 65 MW by 1985, growing to 169 MW by 1995. The Kelanitissa
site is restricted to the extent that only one more double circuit line can
be brought into it. A 132 kV line would serve the present purposes, but the
line will be built for future operation at 220 kV (incurring a cost premium
of 10%) so as to permit its use at a later date to transmit the output from
a 350 MW steam station in Colombo to the Biyagama substation. Were this line
to be built at 132 kV and a 220 kV line constructed later for the steam
station, the 132 kV line would then become redundant.
3. Biyagama to Pannipitiya 220 kV transmission line
This will be a double circuit line 17 km long, having one 400 sq. mm
ACSR conductor per phase. It will be built for 220 kV but operated initially
at 132 kV until Samanalawewa is connected into the system.
A new substation is being built at Pannipitiya. It will be completed
at the end of 1982, when load will be transferred to it from Ratmalana and
Kolonnawa. It will also feed another new substation now under construction
at Matugama, and the parliamentary complex at Kotte. The area is at present
supplied by a single 132 kV circuit from Kolonawa and a second circuit is at
present being strung, but the firm capacity of these two will be exceeded by
1985. The present area load is 40 MW; this is forecast to reach 91 MW by
1985 and 193 MW by 1995.
220 kV is preferred to 132 kV for this line for reasons of system
stability in later years, and 132 kV switchgear rupturing capacity. There
are about 550 MW of future hydro developments at Samanalawewa and Kukule;
Pannipitiya will be the place at which some of this power will be injected
into the system and fed back to Biyagama.



- 43 -                            ANNEX 7
Page 3 Of 7
4. Biyagama to Katunayake 220 kV transmission line
This comprises 23 km of double circuit line, using one 400 sq.mm ACSR
conductor per phase. It will be operated as two transformer feeders to
transformers in the Biyagama substation.
The firm rating of the existing lines into Katunayake is 85 MW and
the load in the area including Sapugaskande is already in excess of this.
The area load is expected to increase to 147 MW by 1985 and 259 MW by 1995.
Katunayake substation is now being extended with new 132 kV busbars and
switchgear to serve the existing free trade zone, the extended airport and
the local coconut industry. Sapugaskande substation, which will be fed from
Katunayake, is in the area of a large complex of heavy industry including the
refinery and the fertilizer plant.
The requirements of this line could be met either at 132 kV using
two conductors per phase or at 220 kV using one conductor per phase, but 132
kV would be unsatisfactory in respect of system stability in later years,
fault levels on 132 kV switchgear, and higher losses. A 220 kV line will
permit a flow of power from Katunayake to Biyagama in the event that it is
decided to inject the output from the projected coal station at Trincomalee
into the system at Katunayake. The higher voltage will also permit better
voltage control in the Puttalam area by way of the taps on the 220 kV
transformers at Katunayake.
5. Rantembe to Badulla 132 kV transmission line
This comprises a single circuit line 37 km long, having a single 175
sq. mm ACSR conductor per phase, running from the switchyard of the future
Rantembe power station to a new switching station near Badulla.
The line is urgently needed to inject power into the 66 kV system,
which is heavily overloaded, and which with the present configuration must
be fed over a circuitous route causing heavy loss of energy. This new 132 kV
link will permit the Inginiyagala line and substation to be operated at their
design voltage of 132 kV instead of 66 kV as at present. Injection into the
east end of the old 66 kV system will be done by means of a new 31.5 MVA
132/66 kV tie transformer at Badulla. The effect of the link will be to
provide firm power to all points on this part of the system with the
exception of Inginiyagala which will depend on a single 132 kV line and its
local hydro station.
Although the Rantembe hydro station itself will not be on line until
1990, the adjacent one at Randenigala is scheduled for 1987. Recognising the
need for the feed to Badulla, under the Randenigala project will be included
the building of a 220 kV line from Victoria to Randenigala and 3 km beyond to
Rantembe, as well as a switching station with 220/132 kV step down at



ANNEX 7

- 44 -
Rantembe. These works will be completed to meet the schedule of the project
line from Rantembe to Badulla.
6. Badulla turn in
This consists of a 1 km long 132 kV single circuit link using a
single 175 sq. mm ACSR conductor per phase to connect the existing 132 kV
line from Badulla to Inginiyagala into the new 132 kV switching station.
7. Biyagama 220/132 kV substation
The work will provide:
- 220 kV switchgear, in a double busbar arrangement, for four
transmission circuits (with space for six more), two
transformers (with space for two more), and a bus coupler.
- 132 kV switchgear, in double busbar arrangement, for two
transformers (with space for two more), one bus coupler,
and four transmission circuits (with space for four more).
- Two transformers, 220/132 kV, 250 MVA each.
The Biyagama site has been selected as the closest possible one to
Colombo allowing access for lines into all existng or planned major
substations in and around the city. The area in which it is located is about
to be developed by GOSL as a new free trade zone for heavy industry; it is
close to the Sapugaskande substation which serves existing heavy industry.
The land imposes no restrictions on CEB's designs as it is owned by GOSL and
development on it has not yet started. It is flat, offers good foundation
conditions and will be accessible from a good road.
8. Katunayake substation
The extent of the work is: two additional bays of 132 kV switchgear
for transformers; two transformers, 220/132 kV, 250 MVA each, and a 220 kV
skeleton gantry with isolators.
9. Kelanitissa substation
Two additional bays of 132 kV switchgear will be installed.
10. Badulla Switching Station
This will comprise a single busbar with three 132 kV feeder bays in a
new switching station, and one 132/66 kV 31.5 MVA transformer in the existing
66 kV substation. The transformer will be wound so that it can later be used
for 132/33 kV.



ANNEX 7
Page 5 of 7
- 45 -
11. Reactive Compensation
It is expected that about 100 MVA of capacitors will be required.
These will be handled as part of the contract for the substations in which
they will be installed.
12. Circuit Breaker Replacement
With the addition of the new hydro electric stations the fault levels
on the system will be increased to such a degree that a number of the
existing 132 kV circuit breakers and current transformers will no longer be
of adequate rating. It may be possible to upgrade some of this equipment but
most of it will probably need to be replaced by new. The matter is under
study and it is expected that about 45 circuit breakers with CTs will be
affected. The work under this item is to cover the purchase and installation
of new equipment as necessary and the modification of existing plant where
possible.
13. Power Line Carrier (PLC)
The work will provide for protection and intertripping of the 220 kV
and 132 kV lines as well as communications.
14.  Loss Reduction Programme
It is CEB's intention to establish a cell, probably within the
planning group, whose work will include continuous monitoring and reduction
of energy losses in the system. This provision is to equip crews with
portable meters and equipment for this purpose, and also to provide for
permanent metering on lines and feeders that do not at present have them but
would benefit from being so equipped.
15. Vehicles and tools
The project provides for the purchase of vehicles and special tools
and equipment needed by CEB's construction and supervision forces.
16. Buildings
The project includes operational buildings, offices, stores and
quarters, mainly at Biyagama.

17. Consulting Services
Funds were provided under the Sixth Power Project for foreign
engineering services on the 220 kV lines and substations in this project,
to the point of receiving and evaluating tenders for the major contracts.
In this project funds are included for the remaining foreign engineering
services needed, including design, contract coordination, inspection services

ANNEX 17
SRI LANKA
SEVENTH (MAHAWELI TRANSMISSION) POVER PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.         Financial projections of CEB's activities have been prepared for
the period through FY 1988 using, as a base, CEB's FY 1979 audited and FY
1980 unaudited accounts.
INCOME STATEMENT
REVENUES (Annex 13)
2.      Energy sales are taken from the "Load Forecast through 1990" (Annex
4) with the exceptions of (i) FY 1981 where sales have been reduced by 100
GWh to 1695 GWh to reflect supply interruptions during the year.
3.      The present average tariff is Rs 0.58/kWh.  An increase of 50% to Rs
0.87/kWh has been assumed from mid 1982 to enable CEB to generate sufficient
cash to meet its contribution to the present investment program. From FY
1985 tariffs have been adjusted to enable CEB to continue to meet the
covenanted 8% rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets.
4.      The Fuel Adjustment Surcharge is included under "Other Operational
Revenues" and is assumed to recover, in full the fuel cost of thermal
generation together with the 2% turnover tax levied on CEB's sales revenues.
OPERATING COSTS
5.      Operating and maintenance costs of power generation, transmission
and distribution in FYs 1979/80 were equivalent to about 2% of gross fixed
assets in operation at previous December 31 -nd have been projected on this
basis, taking into account newly commissioned plant.
6.      Full costs are based on the projected annual thermal energy require-
ments indicated at Annex 1, with escalation of prices at 8% annually through
FY 1985 and 6% annually thereafter.
7.      Turnover Tax is assessed at 2% of the current year's sales revenues.
CEB will probably be liable to Income Tax in FYs 1982/83 but thereafter
depreciation allowances will produce tax losses.
8.      Administration costs are increased from FY 1981 by 20% in FY 1982,
15% in FY 1983 and 10% annually thereafter.
9.      Depreciation is calculated at 2 3/4% of annually revalued gross fixed
assets in operation with a half year's allowance for assets commissioned
during the year.



- 58 -
10.     Annual contributions to CEB's Insurance Fund (1/10th of gross fixed
assets) are included under operating and maintenance costs (paragraph 5).
11.     Provision for bad and doubtful debts is a nominal RS 15 million
annually.
FLOW OF FUNDS STATEMENT (Annex 14)
12.     CEB's investment program is set out in Annex 16:  the position
through FY 1985 is as approved by GSL including the proposed 80 MW diesel
project. Beyond FY 1985 the investment program is very tentative and a block
provision has been included in the years FY 1986 through FY 1988 based upon
CEB's preliminary assessment of requirements, through FY 1990 at 1981 prices.
13.     CEB's financing plan through FY 1985 comprises existing commitments
by way of GSL equity/loan in respect of ongoing projects including the IDA-
assisted sixth project, together with the onlending of US$47 million IDA
US$36 million and OPEC US$11 million) for 20 years including 3 years grace
at 12% interest in respect of the proposed seventh project.  GSL Equity of
Rs800 million towards the cost of the 80 MW diesl project is included in FYs
1982/83.  The balance coming from CEB's internal resources.  From FY 1986 GSL
loans are assumed at 65% of the investment program (terms: 10 years, 10%
interest). Consumer contributions of Rs.125 million annually are assumed
through FY 1990.
14.     Transfer of Mahaweli Assets
On completion of the various projects the power components will be
transferred to CEB for operation and maintenance. Adjustments will be made in
CEB's accounts to reflect these transfers, and will include an agreed proportion of
the common costs (e.g. dams). Provisional sums included in the financial
projections are:
Rs Million         Year
Victoria                       4,250            1984
Kotmale                        5,000            1985
Randenigala                    3,600            1987
It is assumed that CEB will become responsible for servicing an
equivalent amount of debt from the year following full commissioning of each
scheme. Final details of such transfers including the amount of any such
loans are still to be settled: they are provisionally assumed to be
repayable at 10% interest over 25 years.

BALANCE SHEET (Annex 15)
Fixed Assets
15.     CEB's fixed assets have been revalued to FY 1980 in accordance with
the movement of indices previously agreed with IDA. Thereafter, annual
revaluations have been projected based upon current guidelines of price
escalation for foreign and local goods: from FY 1981 through 1984 by 15%,
13%, 11% and 10%, and by 8% annually thereafter.
16.     Work-in-progress represents capital expenditure under the proposed
project and other CEB projects indicated at paragraph 12 above; transfers
have been made to the fixed asset account on commissioning of new facilities.
Current Assets
17.     The following assumptions have been made:
(a) Accounts receivable: equivalent to 3 months' billings.
(b) Inventories are to be reduced to "more reasonable levels" by
December 31, 1982 1/ and thereafter maintained at these levels;
in the meantime the level at end FY 1980 is escalated annually
using current Bank international price guidelines.
(c) Sundry Receivables have been reduced in FY 1981 by the amount
of GSL arrears in respect of local authority tariffs and
projected using the latest escalation rates.
(d) Rechargeable works outstanding have been escalated annually
in accordance with the percentage issued for fixed asset
revaluation (paragraph 15).
Equity
18.     Equity comprises CEB's initial capital, as increased from time to
time by GSL grants towards construction costs (mainly rural electrification),
income tax (paragraph 7), consumer contributions, revaluation surplus and
retained earnings (operational surplus).

19.     Long-term debt comprises (a) existing GSL loans to CEB including
those made under onlending arrangements with IBRD, IDA, ADB, OPEC and the
Saudi Fund (to cover foreign costs of previous and ongoing projects), and
(b) loans required in accordance with paragraph 13 above to fund CEB's
investment program through 1988.
20.     Current Liabilities comprise accounts payable, deposits and sundry
items which have been adusted annually for price escalation and current

ANNEX 1o
SRI LANKA
SEVENTH (MAHAWELI TRANSMISSION) POWER PROJECT
(Ceylon Electricity Board)
Economic Analysis
Method
1.      The proposed project constitutes a part of the transmission
expenditure necessary to transmit additional power from existing and future
generating stations to the load centers. It is an integral part of the total
power sector investment program and can be justified only as part of the
latter rather than as an independent, self-contained project. The approach
adopted in this report, therefore, is one of justification of the entire
power sector investment program in its present state, allowing the conclusion
that the part covered by the proposed project is implicitly justified.
2.      The analysis is complicated by the fact that CEB, the authority
ultimately responsible for supplying power at the retail level, controls only
the smaller part of total sector investment. While account has been taken
of power demand forecasts to a certain extent, the input of CEB into the
planning of the implementation of the Mahaweli Program has only recently
begun to be felt more strongly. While a least-cost program, using the WASP
computer model, has been completed recently, the investment sequence
available at the time of appraisal may not have been of a least-cost nature.
This situation required an analysis of the overall economic feasibility of
the only existing investment program by comparing its capital and current
costs with the implicit benefits derived from the availability of additional
power supply.
Economic Costs
3.      Cost items are valued at CIF or equivalent border prices, where
available. The remaining local costs are split into labor and other local
cost components, and adjusted by a shadow/market wage ratio of 0.67, and by a
standard conversion factor of 0.91.
4.      The foreign (CIF) and local (domestic price) components of new
capacity are estimated to be as follows:
Foreign (%) Local (%) of which Labor (%)
Gas turbines                      95              5           2.5
Diesel thermal                    80             20           10
Hydro                             75            25           12.5
Transmission & Distribution       68             32           25.5



-62-
5.      Operating and maintenance expenditure is assumed to amount to 3% of
cumulative investment, with equal shares of labor and other local cost. Fuel
cost of thermal plants is based on December 1980 international prices   1/
CIF Colombo.   The fuel cost amounts to Rs 1.45/kWh for diesel thermal plant,
Rs. 2.04/kWh for gas turbines, and Rs. 1.35/kWh for steam plant.
Economic Benefits
6.      Benefits of electricity supply, accruing to final consumers are
assessed as the willingness to pay for a given quantity of energy for
specific purposes, expressed in CIF terms or border price equivalent.
Analysis of this willingness to pay is based on (i) tariff revenue (ii)
observed expenditure on alternative energy sources in the absence of
electricity supply, and (iii) on sample interviews. The sum of revenue and
consumer surplus is estimated as the area under the derived demand curve for
energy required for output production or lighting. Low, medium and high
estimates for user surplus are examined.
7.      Domestic electricity consumption.
Almost 90% of Sri Lanka households are using kerosene lamps for
lighting; in rural areas, this percentage rises to 97%. Domestic uses of
electricity other than lighting are limited (with the exception of the
Colombo metropolitan area): about 85% of total domestic electricity
consumption is estimated to be used for lighting purposes. In the absence
of electricity supply, households would use kerosene: the total amount of
lighting, however would be significantly lower due to the high cost of the
kerosene alternative. About 15% of present total domestic electricity use
can be considered minimum lighting requirements. This portion is valued at
the economic cost of Rs 6.30 per kWh equivalent. The remainder of
consumption is assumed to be valued at a price declining to Rs 1.37/kWh (the
average 1982/83 domestic tariff revenue) at the margin: the average value of
this portion is Rs 4.20 per kWh equivalent. These values are applied to CEB-
supplied domestic consumption as well as to that part of the "bulk supply"
to municipalities that is estimated to be domestic use.
8.      The cost of kerosene lighting is arrived at as follows, assuming a
lamp with a light output of 60 W equivalent, used for 1000 hours per year
for 5 years:
1/ Gas Oil : US$326.95 per tonne Fuel Oil : US$210.22 per tonne



Capital cost                            Rs 325.00
Annuitized charge                       Rs 1.40/kWh
(13% discount rate)
Fuel cost:
0.05 1/hour at Rs 5.88/1             : Rs 4.90/kWh
Total Cost                           : Rs 6.30/kWh
9.      Commercial consumption.
As with domestic consumption, it is assumed that 15% of electricity
consumption would be replaced by kerosene lighting, the remainder declining
in value to the consumer up to the margin of about Rs 2.02/kWh, the average
commercial tariff revenue including fuel surcharge. The average economic
value of Rs 4.48 is applied to commercial consumption. Domestic and
commercial consumption together (including their shares of CEB "bulk supply")
account for about 44% of total electricity consumption.
10.     Industrial consumption.
For most of industry, the alternative to power supply is own diesel
generation. This can be in the form of maintaining a standby diesel
generating set for protection against power outages, or by supplying the
complete energy requirement of the production process. Both options are used
by industrial organizations in Sri Lanka. As the expected average industrial
tariff (includng fuel surcharge) from 1982/83 onwards is close to the cost of
user-owned diesel generation, the tariff value of Rs 2.02/kWh, is used for
both high and low estimates.
11.     The average economic cost of operating a diesel generating set of
about 100 KVA capacity at a rate of 4,400 annual hours for 20 years is
arrived at as follows:
12.     The total economic weighted value of a kWh of incremental electricity
demand is summaried as follows:
Consumer Category    % of consumption              Value (Rs/kWh)
Full Potential Conservative
Surplus          Surplus
Domestic/Commercial            7                 6.30             6.30
Domestic                      17                 4.20              1.37
Commercial                    20                 4.48             2.02
Industrial                    55.5               2.02             2.02
Street Light                   0.5               1.48             1.48
Total weighted               100                 3.18             2.21



-64-
13.     If tariff revenues are taken to be a  proxy of the minimum benefit,
the basic tariff as proposed for 1982/83 by CEB plus the average expected
fuel surcharge to be billed to the consumer is an appropriate measure for
period of analysis. The weighted value of the 1981 tariff is summarized as
follows:
Consumer Category    % of consumption              Value (Rs/kWh)
With Surcharge
Domestic                      20                         0.69
Commercial                    24                         1.02
Industrial                    55.5                       1.02
Street Light                  0.5                        0.75
Weighted                                                 0.96
However, the weighted value of the 182/83 tariff is expected to be Rs
1.90/kWh (including the new fuel surcharge).
Cost/Benefit Analysis
14.     The entire power sector investment program as shown at the time of
appraisal is presented in Annex 16. The Mahaweli (non-CEB) hydro projects
of Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala, and Rantembe are assumed to be guided by
power sector needs rather than irrigation requirements in their
implementation and the total cost of the dams is included.
15.     The economic costs of this investment program are compared to the
benefits arising from incremental sales 1/ made possible by this investment,
using tariff as well as economic valuation of electricity supply and CEB
estimates of demand. As a sensitivity analysis, the cost of the entire
program is varied by 10% up and down, and the fuel price is assumed to rise
in real terms by 3% per year. All cost and benefit streams for the base case
and the delayed case are shown in Table 1. Local costs are presented after
adjustment to border prices. The exercise is conducted in terms of constant
1980 prices. For purposes of comparison, benefits are also expressed in
terms of tariff revenue rather than in economic terms, implying a substantial
underestimate of benefits. Results are presented in Table 2.
1/ Estimated at the time of formulation of the investment program.



16.     Benefits and costs are underestimated if the irrigation component of
the Mahaweli program is taken into account. Additional costs would be
downstream irrigation investment expenditures, additional benefits the
increased net agricultural output resulting from irrigation. Table 2
indicates that the power sector investment program including the complete
Mahaweli headworks is likely to be economically justified using electricity
benefits alone. The total power-cum-irrigation investment package is
therefore likely to be justified.
