ME)OANDUM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO -THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND EXPORT PROMOTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendations on the proposed loan of
USS36.3 million to Zimbabwe are submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be repayable-over 20 years, including a grace period of five years, at
the standard variable interest rate. It would help finance agricultural credit
and production of export and import-substitution commodities. Co-financing is
expected from IFAD, BADEA, and the Governments of Japan and New Zealand.
2.       Backgrounds  Zimbabwe's agriculture supports about two-thirds of the
population and accounts for over 40? of exports. It comprises a relatively
undeveloped smallholder system, involving over 952 of the farm families, and
a modernized commercial farming system. The Government's objectives for the
sector are to ensure food security, increase exports, and raise rural incomes.
The Government's strategy to these ends seeks to reorient support services to
smallholders in order to improve productivity among these farmers for crops
suited to smallholder farmnmg, while encouraging commercial farmers to
diversify into export and import-substitution commodities that call for high
investment costs and management skills. Since independence, notable progress
has been made in reorienting the main support services to smallholders. Also
producer prices have been kept at attractive levels; market and input supply
facilities have been expanded considerably; and processing capacity has kept
pace with the needs, except for cotton. A sector study planned this year will
provide an analytical basis to further improve price and mar .ting policies.
3.       Due to the above measures in the 1980s the sector grew at about 4?
per annum in real terms; staple food grains generally exceeded consumption;
and the share of smallholders in total production rose from 15? to 35?, maize
from 10? to 401, and cotton from 7? to 50?. The expansion of smallholder
production has higglighted the need for commercial farmers to diversify into
non-traditional import-substitution and export crops, notably wheat and
horticultural products. On the other hand, horticulture is constrained by weak
export marketing strategy. and inadequate post-harvest research for fresh
products. The cotton subsector, under the Cotton Marketing Board (CMB), has
the capacity to become a major source of exports and cash income to
smallholders. However, the subsector is severely hampered by lack of a sound
development strategy; an inappropriate pricing policy, leading to heavy losses
by CMB; and inadequate ginning capacity and maintenance due to the shortage of
foreign exchange. The proposed project would help to address the above
constraints.
4.       While Zimbabwe has a well-developed financial sector, only 12? of
smallholders have access to credit and many commercial farmers are unable to
obtain loans for diversification investments. Because of the inherently high
lending costs and/or risks, these institutions, other than the Agricultural



-2-
Finance Corporation CAFC), are unwilling to lend to smallholders, or to
commerciol farmers undertaking new ventures such as horticulture for fresh
product exports. The Bank has been supporting APc sine* 19$3 through the
recently completed Small Farm Credit Project, Cr 1291-ZIM, partly as a result
of which the number of smallholdeir receiving credit increased fivefold. The
lessons learned, which the proposed project has taken into account, include
the needs to ensur. a reaUlstic project period relative to the local
implementation capability; a well-structured training program, based on
assessent of skill gaps; and guidance to the Borrower on procurement.
54.      Overall, AFC is viable.  Its operations include highly profitable
loans to comercial farmers; however, there is no cross-subsidization between
caumercial and smallholder credit operations. Government has directed AFC to
expand its lending to smallholders especially in areas not served by other
lending institutions. The costs of doing business among these smallholders is
high, and lending to them has been at a loss which Government covers through
annual subventions. The need for such subventions arises because interest-
spreads are not high enough to cover the high transaction costs for
smallholder lending. To eliminate this need, Government intends to review and
adjust AFC*s interest rate periodically to allow for sufficient spread. AFC
maintained credit arrears at at an average of about 192 of total outstanding
loans up to 1986. However, during the last two years arrears increased to 481
mainly due to recurring drought; breakdown of its computerized loan accounting
system and inadequate field staff. The Incidence of bad debts among the
arrears is small, and AFC has mounted an aggressive campaign to collect
outstanding debts by placing more staff in the field, restoring its computer
and taking disciplinary actions against defaulters. This has already resulted
in a 6X drop in arrears and it is expected that arrears will decline to 151 in
1992 as a result of further measures to be taken under the proposed project.
To improve loan portfolio performance and prevent the recurrence of high
arrears in future. EEC is providing ABC with technical assistance in financial
and loan portfolio management, and improvement of the credit monitoring
systems.
6.       Bank Strateava The Bank seeks to assist the Government in
implementing the strategy set out in para. 2 above, through lending operations
in research sad extension, rural afforestation and agricultural credit; and
through sector work in cooperatives, land use, and commodity studies. This
strategy is also fully supported by various donors, notably the EEC in
agricultural credit; IFAD In research and extension services; AfDB and ODA in
resettlement; ODA and USAID in marketing, general technical assistance and
training, research, and land and water usage; and the Government of
Netherlands in horticultural export promotion. The Bank strategy aims at
complementing the activities of the other donors.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement: The Bank has acquired considerable
knowledge of Zimbabwel's credit sector through its involvement in the Small
Farm Credit Project and is ideally situated to take the lead among donors in
promoting institutional and policy changes, as well as in mobilizing
resources, to improve the credit services. In addition, through its funding of
cotton ginning facilities and horticultural production, the Bank would be
well-placed to encourage the Government to adopt sound policies and strategies
to improve efficiency in the cotton subsector and horticultural exports.



-3'-
8.       Pint... Obiectives:  The project is an-integral part of the strategy
set. out in pars  a.-ibove. It seeks to. enable smallholderi to. increase the
,production of food, caflh and export commodities best suited to smallholder
farming, while encouraging commercial farmers to diversify into export and
impdrt-substitution crops for which they have a comparatlve advantage. Thus,
the project would aim at contributing to food security, increasing foreign
exchange earnings and savings, and improving rural incames.
9.       Proiect DescriAtLons  The project, to be implemented mainly by AFC
and CMB, would finances (a) incremental credit to smallhdlders and commercial
farmers t(b) strengthening of AFC*s institutional capacity by expanding its
field facilities; (c) a pilot scheme to organize and train farmer groups to
serve as credit, marketing and input supply channels; Id) construction of a
cotton ginnery and storage facilities, and provision of spares for the
existing ginneries; (e) strengthening of horticultural post-harvest research;
and (f) studies on the cotton subsector and horticultural export marketing.
Annex A hereto shows project costs and financing plan, Annex B procurement and
disbursements, and Annex C timetable for key project processing events.
10.      Aareements Reached:  At negotiations, agreements were reached thats
(a) filling the post of AFC*s Deputy General Manager (Finance) with a
candidate satisfactory to the Bank, and signing of subsidiary loan agreements
with AFC and CMB would be conditions of effectiveness; (b) no disbursements
would be made for the cotton ginning component until the Borrower has adopted
measures, including price adjustments and cost reduction, to enable CMB to
operate without losses; (c) AFC would ti) reduce arrears to not more than 35Z
in 1989190, 252 in 1990191, and 152 in 1991192 and thereafter; (ii) improve
loan appraisal procedures to ensure farmers' ability to repay loans as well as
satisfactory rates of return; and (iii) submit to the Bank for review and
comments the reports of the consultants funded by the EEC on loan portfolio
management and ways to continue reducing arrears, and on monitoring and
evaluation system; and take Bank comments into full account in implementing
the recommendations of the reports.
11.      It was also agreed that the Borrower would: (a) maintain attractive
producer prices; (b) periodically review and adjust AFC's lending interest
rate to maintain it at least equal to the commercial prime rate and to allow
AFC a spread sufficient to cover its costs; (c) assume foreign exchange risk;
(d) submit to the Bank for review and comments the report of the cotton
subsector and horticultural export marketing studies respectively by end of
June and December 1990 and take Bank comments into full account in
implementing the recommendations of these studies; and (e) undertake an
indepth mid-term review to assess project's progress, and implement the
review's 'findings in consultation with the Bank.
12.      Benefits:  The project would benefit about 44,000 smallholders, about
one-half of whom are likely to be women, and a significant number of
commercial farmers producing export and import replacing crops, thus raising
rural incomes, enhancing food security, and increasing export earnings. It
would also improve AFC's institutional capacity and horticultural export
marketing; encourage adoption of sound strategy and price policy for the
cotton subsector; and test ways of enhancing the role of farmer groups in
credit, marketing And input supply.

13.      Pr,olect RLikes  Apart from droughts, the main risks for the credit
component to that measures to reduce arrears may not be applied rigorously
enough while the desire to roach more suallbolders quickly may lead to-
relaxation of loan evaluation standards, thus vorsening arrears and bad debts.
The project would minimixe this risk bye (i) ensuring the adoption of better
loan evaluation procedures and providing for a aid-term review for timely
identification and implementation of further correctiv  weasures; and (ii)
expanding ArC's field facilities and promoting group lending, thus enhancing
Its capacity to maintain quality standards. ?or the cotton component, the main
risk is that political will may not be strong enough to adjust cotton prices
to the extent needed to ellminate CM8 lossce. To address this risk,
disbursement of project funds for this component would be conditional on the
implementation of an appropriate price policy for cotton.
14.      Recommedationst  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of IBRD and recommend that the Rxecutive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
