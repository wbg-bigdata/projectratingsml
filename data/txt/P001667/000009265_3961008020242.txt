MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR A NATIONAL WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation for a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Malawi for SDR 50.3 million, the equivalent of US$79.2
million, on standard International Development Association (IDA) terms with a maturity of 40 years,
including 10 years of grace. The credit will help to finance implementation of the water resources
management policy and strategies recently adopted by the Government of Malawi (GOM) as its
framework for the reform of the sector, together with capacity development to ensure sustainable
improvements in the sector, and investments to rehabilitate degraded infrastructure and significantly
increase access to safe water. US$35.4 million of the proceeds of the IDA credit will be on-lent to the
three new Regional Water Boards (RWBs) and Lilongwe Water Board (LWB) at a market rate of
interest set at approximately 2% above inflation as indicated by the National Composite Retail Price
Index. A further US$23.6 million of the credit will be passed to the Water Boards as part of the
GOM's equity contribution.
2.    Background. Malawi is a relatively small country with a surface area of 199,140 kM2, of
which Lake Malawi occupies about 20%. The topography varies widely and related to this are wide
ranges in temperature and rainfall. The average rainfall is about 1,100 mm per year with variations
from 700 min in the dry areas of the Lower Shire Valley to about 2,000 mm on the Mulanje Massif and
Zomba (Southern Region) and Nyika (Northern Region) plateaus depending on the topography. The
1992 population of Malawi was approximately 9 million, including about 1 million Mozambican
refugees, with an estimated 88% living in the rural areas. The average population growth rate is 3.3%
per annum.
3.    Malawi, one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, has recently completed a peaceful
political transition from almost 30 years under a single party system, to a multi-party democracy.
Subsequent events, however, have continued to demonstrate the vulnerability of its primarily
agricultural economy. Abnormally low rainfall in both 1994 and 1995 have cut the production of food
and export commodities, and have caused power outages in urban areas and water shortages throughout
the country. As a result of these developments, the gross domestic product contracted by about 9 % in
1994. Excessive GOM expenditures, borrowing in the first few months of the fiscal year, and a
sharply depreciating exchange rate, significantly increased inflationary pressures resulting in an annual
inflation rate through 1994 of 34.7%. This contributed to further difficulties in sustaining essential
services. Although the new GOM continued its commitment to the economic stabilization process and
its attack on the country's pervasive poverty problem, its credibility will be tested by its response to the
drought in terms of the maintenance of food supplies, and its ability to show progress in the alleviation
of poverty, including the provision of more widespread and assured access to safe water supplies.
4.    Apart from the lakes, the availability of water in Malawi depends to a great extent on the
seasonal rainfall which varies widely. This marked seasonal variation seriously limits the potential of
many streams and rivers as reliable raw water sources unless storage is provided. Groundwater
resources are widespread throughout the country, although generally at very low yields. These sources
are exploited by some 9,700 boreholes and 5,600 shallow wells equipped with handpumps. With an
estimated mean annual runoff of 51 million m3/d, there appears to be ample water resources available.
However, as a result of high levels of use relative to development, inadequate sanitation, ineffective



- 2 -
and inappropriate treatment and disposal of sewage and solid wastes, and high sediment loads due to
the increasing cultivation of steep slopes and on the banks of streams, Malawi's water resources are
coming under serious pressure in some areas.
5.     Other than in the two urban areas supplied by the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards (BWB
and LWB), water supply services are provided by the Water Department (WD) of the Ministry of
Irrigation and Water Development (MIWD). Sewerage services are provided to limited areas of the
two cities and two of the towns by local governmrent. Neither the water supply services provided by
the WD, nor the sewerage services, are adequately maintained, and many are operated poorly. Many
of the piped water supply and sewerage systems are falling into disrepair, some are already partly
inoperable, and most will need to be replaced or undergo major rehabilitation. Some of the borehole
installations will also require rehabilitation or replacement. The condition of many of these assets is,
however, such that early action will preserve much of what is currently operational. The sector, other
than the water supply services in Lilongwe and Blantyre, is characterized by a lack of sustainability,
contributed to by institutional arrangements which are poorly matched to the tasks with which the
institutions are faced, low levels of human and institutional capacity, inadequate financial management,
and until recently, the almost complete absence of a policy framework for the sector. In addition, only
about 60% of the population have access to water supply services (69% urban and 58% rural) and
water borne sanitation services reach about 15% of the urban population. Recognizing these issues, the
Government, in May 1994, adopted a comprehensive statement of directions for the sector entitled
"Water Resources Management Policy and Strategies" (WRMPS) to (a) guide the management and use
of water for conservation and environmental protection; (b) provide strategies for institutional reform
and development including the establishment of three RWBs, and for capacity building; and (c)
establish a consistent framework of policies for the allocation of water and investment funds, the
provision of services in a manner that involves stakeholders, and pricing and recovery of the costs of
supplying water. The WRMPS constitutes an important first step towards sustainability, effectiveness
and increased coverage. Its widespread acceptance has created good conditions for the implementation
of its objectives. The proposed project will assist to put in train the implementation of the strategies of
the WRMPS.
6.     Project Objectives. The primary objectives of the proposed project are (a) to initiate
implementation of a strategy for reform of the sector to ensure sustainability, responsiveness to the
needs of the community, and efficiency and effectiveness in service provision and the management of
water resources; and (b) to implement a program of investments to (i) ensure convenient access to safe
water for a progressively larger fraction of the population; (ii) provide water infrastructure capable of
underpinning economic development; and (iii) protect and develop water resources, in particular to
assure the protection and enhancement of aquatic and riparian environments.
7.     Project Description. The project would consist of: (a) Institutional Reform and Studies
(about US$13.8 million or 20% of base costs), comprising: (i) institutional restructuring, and capacity
building, (ii) consultancy services for project preparation and implementation support, and (iii) studies
of water resources and environmental management; (b) Physical Works (about US$49.7 million or
68% of base costs) including (i) rehabilitation of water supply schemes, (ii) water resources protection
and management including catchment revegetation (iii) extensions of existing systems including a dam
and water supply system expansion for the town of Zomba; and (iv) new schemes for water supply and
sewerage and sludge disposal sites; and (c) Goods and Equipment (about US$9.0 million or 12% of
base costs) including stores, workshops, spares, mechanical and electrical plant for the Lilongwe water
treatment plant, laboratories and offices, laboratory, office, field testing and telecommunication
equipment, meters, meter testing and repair equipment, together with tools, vehicles, and GIS required
for implementation. A mid-term review would be undertaken following the initial two years of the
five-year implementation period to reassess project objectives, implementation capacity and progress to



- 3 -
date. Based on the results of this review, the project would be restructured according to the lessons
learned and reviewed and recalibrated as necessary annually for the remainder of the project duration.
A summary of the project costs and financing plan is provided in Schedule A. Procurement
arrangements and the disbursements schedule are summarized in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing steps and the status of Bank group operations in Malawi are provided in Schedule C and
Schedule D respectively. Staff appraisal report No. 13189-MAI and Map IBRD 26497 are attached.
8.    Project Implementation. Project preparation has been managed by the Ministry of Works and
Supplies (MWS) (formerly the parent ministry of the WD) with assistance from a Project Steering
Committee (PSC) comprising members from all involved agencies. With the recent transfer of the WD
to the new ministry, MIWD, the overall project will now be managed by this Ministry through a
Program Leader supported by a small Project Unit within the WD. The PSC will continue in
operation, under the chairnanship of the Principal Secretary, MIWD. GOM has appointed the
Program Leader and terms of reference have been agreed. The investment components will be
managed by the new RWBs now being established, LWB and the WD as line functions. The
performance monitoring unit of the WD will provide to the Program Leader management information
on the performance of investments and processes implemented under the project.
9.    Project Sustainability. Achieving sustainability is a key focus of the project. The following
specific steps are incorporated to establish sustainability: (i) the reconstitution of the Water Resources
Board (WRB) into a high level multi-sectoral body responsible for providing policy advice to the
Minister, and able to address nationally important water resources issues more effectively; (ii) the
establishment of three new commercially-oriented RWBs to take over the roles of provision of urban
water supply and water borne sanitation services currently allocated to the WD and local government;
(iii) the introduction into the WD of a more community-driven approach to the planning and
implementation of rural water supply services; (iv) capacity building in the WD, the three RWBs and
LWB; (v) the calibration of investments against the pace of institutional reform and cost recovery as
measured against agreed performance targets; and (vi) the provision for a mid-program assessment of
performance, with the opportunity to reset targets and investment programs, together with annual
adjustments of investments against progress with reform initiatives.
10.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. This is the fifth IDA operation in the water
sector. The previous four included one with BWB (1977), two with LWB (1982 and 1987) and one
with the WD (1989). The first three built the capacity of the city water boards with relatively good
success in commercialization of operations and human resource development. These have resulted in
increased financial self sufficiency and decision-making autonomy balanced by increased accountability
through the setting of performance targets, monitoring and reporting as well as the indigenization of all
senior management positions within both water boards and a substantial reduction in dependency on
TA. The BWB and LWB are, therefore, viewed by GOM and the WD as role models whose success
should be emulated by the rest of the sector. Accordingly, GOM has incorporated in the WRMPS the
same principles that have contributed to the improved performance of the city water boards. GOM
now seeks to address issues that have become apparent through experience, among which the principal
ones are the legislative relationship between the water boards and the Minister as the strategic directing
authority, and improved processes for approval of tariff increases. The proposed project is designed to
assist it to achieve these improvements.
11.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's previous incremental approach made important
strides in the sector in particular in introducing in the cities of Lilongwe and Blantyre institutional
arrangements, policies and human resources development that have resulted in the introduction of
sustainable commercial and technical practices. If this success is to be consolidated and extended to
water resources management and water service delivery throughout Malawi, a sector-wide policy-based



-4 -
approach is necessary. The involvement of IDA in the implementation of this approach is appropriate
because: (i) IDA has had a long prior involvement in, knowledge of and experience with the sector in
Malawi; (ii) IDA played a central role in assisting GOM to develop the framework of policy and
strategies, and the action plan for implementation; (iii) successful implementation will require that all
initiatives in the sector, whether investment or sectoral reform in nature, be coordinated and integrated,
and IDA is best placed to assist GOM in this; and (iv) the proposed Malawi Social Action Project
(MASAP) will have important links with this project, and close coordination of the two is best achieved
if IDA is involved in both.
12.    Link to the Country Assistance Strategy. The project is consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy in Malawi, presented to the Board June 9, 1994 (Report No. P6236-MAI). The
overarching objective of the CAS is sustainable poverty reduction through economic growth with
equity. The institutional restructuring and capacity building component will contribute to the
improvement of efficiency and capacity of the public sector. The investments in infrastructure and the
proposed commercialization of the sector through the creation of the three TWMs, will, as already
demonstrated in the cases of BWB and LWB, create new opportunities for the private sector in a range
of construction and service contracting. This will help achieve economic diversification, capacity
building and broad based private sector participation that are priorities of the CAS. The program will
also improve water resources management and access to safe water for domestic use for a larger
proportion of the population and thus reduce the incidence of water borne disease, and improve the lot
of women by reducing the time and effort spent in fetching water.
13.   Actions Agreed. The conditions of credit effectiveness include completing the legal steps
necessary for the establishment of the RWBs, staffing key positions of the PU, selecting and nominating
the Chairmen and Chief Executives of the RWBs, and completing the project implementation manual.
Before any disbursements are made on water resources works, the water resources legislation will have
to have been reformed, and before any disbursements to the RWBs, the financing agreements between
each of them and GOM will have to have been executed, and the RWBs vested with the necessary
assets, and in receipt of the necessary funds and staff to enable effective operations. Before any
disbursements are made to the WD for rural water supply works, a study on strengthening,
restructuring and funding of the WD will have to be underway, and key staff appointed. A loan from
another donor for the parts of Third Lilongwe Water Project not assisted under the NWDP will have to
be declared effective as a prerequisite to disbursements to the LWB. Agreement has also been reached
on establishment of performance targets and other provisions regarding the compatibility of the RWBs'
operations with the WRMPS; arrangements for stakeholder involvement; the provision of water
supplies to rural communities; procedures for the implementation of monitoring; and terms of reference
for technical assistance.
14.    Environmiental Impact. Substantially improved water resources management, including
improved monitoring of allocations and abstractions and control of wastewater discharges together with
revegetation of heavily eroded catchments to arrest the degradation of water quality and of aquatic
environments, is an important aspect of the project. EnvironDmental impacts will therefore essentially
be positive and beneficial. In addition to these impacts, most individual projects will have temporary
impacts related to the construction phase. At negotiations, criteria and procedures to identify and
mitigate significant impacts were agreed and are consistent with IDA guidelines. An environmental
assessment report for the proposed dam to increase the supply of water to the town of Zomba and
environs, has been completed, reviewed and accepted by the Bank and is available on the project files.
In accordance with the recommendations of this report a site was chosen for the dam downstream of
other alternatives. The dam is to be located so as to abut the downstream face of the existing dam, and
the effect will be as if the existing dam was raised. No resettlement would be required. GOM is
constituting a panel of experts in the fields of hydrology, geotechnical investigations, dam engineering



- 5 -
and environment to ensure that the proposed dam continues to meet the Bank's directives on dam safety
and environmental assessment. The proposed environmental classification for the project is B.
15.   Riparian Rights. The proposed Zomba dam is to be constructed on the Mulunguzi River
which empties into Lake Chilwa bordered by Malawi and Mozambique. The dam was originally
included in the Infrastructure Project (Cr. 2069-MAI) and the Government of Mozambique, after
having been duly notified by Malawi, gave its no objection to the project. As a result of the
withdrawal of financial support by a number of external support agencies for Malawi in the early
1990s, the dam was never constructed. The dam is now included in the proposed NWDP and GOM
has again notified Mozambique of its intent to increase the capacity of the reservoir on the Mulunguzi
River. Besides the Zomba dam, some of the other water supplies proposed in the NWDP would
abstract raw water from international waterways that Malawi shares with Mozambique and Tanzania.
GOM accordingly notified these riparians of the project, providing relevant hydrological and water
quality data . The Governments of Tanzania and Mozambique have given their no objection to the
project. The Government of Mozambique, in its response, requested that it be kept advised of the
sewerage and sewage treatment schemes and their effect on water quality. The Government of Malawi
has agreed to comply with this request.
16.   Project Objective Categories. Revegetation of areas of heavy erosion in key catchments
would improve natural resource management. The improved access to safe water would reduce the
incidence of water related diseases and free up time, mostly women's, for economically and socially
more beneficial pursuits. Pricing and cost recovery strategies would contribute to economic
management by reducing central government contributions to the sector as sector entities contribute a
greater share of operation and maintenance requirements.
17.    Participatory Approach. The project has been designed and developed to ensure that the
institutional arrangements maximize the incentives for all those who provide services to ensure that
those who are to receive a service are involved in planning it and shaping its delivery. New
community driven processes have been developed and are to be used in the planning and
implementation of rural water supplies. The commercially-oriented structuring of the RWBs is aimed
at encouraging effective two-way communication between each organization and its customers, as is a
developing characteristic of the two existing city water boards on which the RWBs are modelled.
Similarly the restructuring of arrangements and processes for water resources management recognizes
that sustainable improvements in poor land use practices that are contributing to degraded water
quality, can only be achieved with the involvement and commitment of the farmers themselves, and the
involvement of all relevant sectors and disciplines; project resources are earmarked to stimulate this
involvement.
18.   Project Benefits. The justification for this credit derives from the economic, social and
environmental benefits which will accrue to the economy, the people of Malawi, and the natural
resource base of the country. These benefits include: (i) the provision of infrastructure that will
underpin private sector development and economic diversification, accompanied by measures aimed at
achieving sustainability, efficiency, and responsiveness to demand; (ii) increasing the proportion of
people with convenient access to safe water for domestic use, in a manner that supports community
choice, promotes a sense of ownership and conserves scarce fiscal resources, thus conferring benefits
by improving the lot of women and the health status of the community, and alleviating one of the
factors contributing to the pervasiveness of poverty; and (iii) protecting and enhancing the quality of
water resources and associated aquatic and terrestrial environments.
19.   Project Risks. The major risks are associated with (a) the institutional changes required to
establish and operate the RWBs as demand-based, commercially-oriented entities and to restructure the



- 6 -
rural programs to facilitate local choice and acceptable cost-sharing arrangements; (b) development by
the RWBs of sufficient capacity to effectively operate the program; and (c) putting the rural water
supply program on a sound demand-driven footing so its operations and maintenance can become
sustainable. Most of the activities needed to establish the urban institutions and restructure the rural
programs will have been done by the time of credit effectiveness. This will minimize the start-up risks.
The operational risks will be mitigated by the establishment of an on-going annual review process
pacing investment with capacity through annual reviews, emphasis on capacity building and carefully
constructed training and support programs and by Bank supervision which can result, if necessary, in
mid-course corrections. Two additional factors are present in Malawi which support the view that the
risks will not prove to be unmanageable. The first is the fact that the GOM has developed and adopted
a WRMPS aimed at achievement of the institutional and operational restructuring described above.
The second is that Malawi has had positive experience with autonomous, commercially-oriented water
boards in Blantyre and Lilongwe, from which the new boards can learn.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Disbursement Performance
The Bank's portfolio in Malawi is fairly large and includes 17 ongoing operations. While some
improvement in project implementation has been recorded, the Government's limited capacity to
implement projects remains the major issue. One of the issues observed in project implementation is
slow disbursement, i.e., slower than originally anticipated in the SAR. The overall disbursements (as of
May 25, 1995) were about 32% of the approved credits. The major generic problems in disbursements
are (a) procedures; (b) frequent turnover of disbursement staff in implementing agencies; (c) lack of
counterpart funds; and (d) lack of staff incentives. On the Bank's side, disbursements are slowed by:
(b) staff delays in procurement approval; and (c) project budget issues not resolved at project
negotiations. To remedy the problems, a number of disbursements workshops have been carried out. In
addition, the following actions were taken in FY93 and FY94: (i) two disbursement workshops were
conducted in Malawi (and will continue to be held yearly) for disbursement officers working in
Government and in parastatals; (ii) Bank disbursement officers have visited Malawi periodically to assist
various ministries/agencies in resolving pending disbursement issues and clearing the backlog; and (iii)
departmental procurement specialists have been providing significant assistance to local procurement
authorities to speed up the procurement process.
