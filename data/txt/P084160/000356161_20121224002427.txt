TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT


A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed change is a partial cancellation of funds – XDR 6.1 million – of the
   Cameroon Transparency and Accountability Capacity Development Project
   (TACD). In response to a request from the Government, it is proposed to cancel XDR
   6.1 million following the suspension of major Project activities after June 30, 2012.
   The fund cancellation has been requested by the Recipient following a bilateral
   discussion on country portfolio performance to optimize Cameroon’s IDA allocation.
2. With the exception of the change in funding, all other aspects of the Project will
   remain unchanged. In particular, there are no changes to the Project Development
   Objective (PDO), the safeguard category, and the main activities of the Project. The
   cancelled funds are planned to be reallocated to other projects in the IDA portfolio of
   Cameroon in accordance with Bank rules.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3. The credit of SDR 9.3 million (USD 15 million equivalent) was approved by the
   Board on June 24, 2008 and became effective on June 05, 2009. The objective of
   the Project is to contribute (i) to enhance transparency and efficiency in PFM and (ii)
   to strengthen accountability in the use of public resources in Cameroon. The Project
   comprises the following components: (i) Improving Budget Management including
   Procurement; (ii) The integration and development of the FMIS including the HRM
   and Payroll Management systems; (iii) Strengthening External Oversight and M&E;
   and (iv) Support to the Project Focal Point for PFM reforms coordination. The
   implementing entities are in full compliance with the Bank’s financial management
   requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports
   from these entities.
4. Project implementation and disbursements have been slow since the Board
   approval in 2008. The Project only became effective one year after Board approval
   due to a slow setting up of the institutional framework, including the creation of the
   implementing agency. Disbursements have remained at a low level: the disbursement
   rate stood at only 24.27 % as of December 6, 2012. The PDO reached its highest
   rating of “Moderately Satisfactory? on September 29, 2008 following effectiveness
   and has since progressively declined to “Unsatisfactory?.
5. It is expected that the Project will close with an “Unsatisfactory? rating. Even if
   executed according to plan, the activities originally scheduled to be implemented
   from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 would not have enabled the Project to
   significantly improve its development objective and disbursement rate.
C. PROPOSED CHANGE

6. The proposed change is to cancel XDR 6.1 million, as requested by the
   Government of Cameroon in its letter received by the Bank December 4, 2012.
   Following a bilateral discussion on country portfolio performance to optimize
   Cameroon’s IDA allocation, the Recipient proposed to the World Bank to close the
   Project before the original closing date (see attached copy of the letter of February 22,
   2012). During a Bank mission of March 12-20, 2012, the Bank team discussed the
   implications of advancing the Project closing date from December 31, 2012 to June
   30, 2012 with the Client, and it was finally decided that the best option was to stop
   activities and services after June 30, 2012, to be able to assess the amount of funds to
   cancel and to reallocate to other IDA projects.
7. The proposed change has no impact on project performance. Its implementation
   was prepared after the Bank mission in March 2012, and consisted of the suspension
   of Project activities after June 30, 2012, which implied the following: (i) No new
   contracts except the final audit were signed after June 30, 2012, and all on-going
   procurement processes were cancelled; (ii) Signed contracts for which services were
   delivered by June 30, 2012 were executed and paid as initially planned; (iii) Signed
   contracts for which execution was planned after June 30, 2012 were subject to
   cancellation; and (iv) Contract cancellation costs will be paid according to the
   applicable contract clauses. On the whole, the suspension of activities and the related
   funds cancellation have little impact on Project implementation and finalization of
   already planned activities (according to the procurement plan, only a few activities
   would have been delivered between June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012). In turn,
   it will enable the Borrower to negotiate with the World Bank to reallocate the
   cancelled funds of XDR 6.1 million and optimize its IDA portfolio.
8. With the exception of the fund cancellation, the Project’s Objective and Results
   will remain unchanged and will exit with unsatisfactory ratings. In particular,
   there are no changes to the Project Development Objective (PDO), the safeguard
   category, the Project components, the financial management and procurement
   arrangements, and the institutional arrangements. The financial adjustments to the
   components and expenditure categories related to the cancellation are presented in
   Tables 1 & 2 below.




                                             5
9. The canceling amount included a margin for exchange rate risk and liability risk
   related to the cancellation of contracts. Tables 1 & 2 present the changes in Project
   financing by component and by expenditure category as a result of the cancellation.
   The approximate equivalents in XDR, USD, and Francs CFA are indicated for
   information and were calculated based on the exchange rates in effect on October 30,
   2012, because the discussions between the Bank team and the Government on the
   amount to be cancelled were finalized on that date.
10. Following a principle of prudence, this margin was important, and was not
    revised by Government when transmitting the request. For this reason, unspent
    resources are not all included in the canceling.
11. The proposed restructuring package responds to a request from the Government
    and has received all the required internal clearances. The proposed cancellation of
    funds responds to a formal request of the Government received by the Bank on
    December 4, 2012. The proposal is fully supported by the Task Team, the Sector
    Unit, and the CMU. The clearances of CTRLA and the Sector Manager are attached.

    The Financing Agreement stipulates that “payments are in Euros,? and the Disbursement Letter indicates that the Designated Ac count is in XAF. There is a fixed exchange rate between the Euro and XAF.
