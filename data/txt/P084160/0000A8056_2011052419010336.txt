                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective (PDO) is to contribute (i) to enhance transparency and efficiency in public financial management, and (ii) to strengthen
                         accountability in the use of public resource. The project will play a key role in Cameroon in accelerating the pace toward a more orderly and open PFM and thus
                         more efficient service delivery.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to be challenged by management and leadership issues. After 18 months of project implementation, the project is showing little progress and having
                         less results than expected. The February mission to Yaounde conveyed the Bank's concerns with the status quo regarding the project as well as the risk of project anticipated closure.

                         The authorities wrote a letter to Africa VP reaffirming their commitment and laying out the immediate measures as well as a nine-month Action Plan to demonstrate commitment to
                         the TACD project and to the PFM reforms. They also made a decision to establish a sub-committee, headed by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, to monitor the
                         specific project activities.
