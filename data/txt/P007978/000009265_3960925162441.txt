SIXTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2302-PE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth
Agricultural Credit Project in Peru, for which Loan 2302-PE in the amount
of US$130.0 million was approved on June 7, 1983. The loan was closed on
June 30, 1988, as scheduled. Disbursements were US$98.7 million and the
last disbursement was on June 23, 1987. An amount of US$31.3 million was
cancelled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Agriculture Operations
Division, Country Department IV of the Latin Amierica and the Caribbean
Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the
Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR relied on Appraisal and President's
reports, Loan and Guarantee Agreements and Supplementary letters,
supervision and Borrower's progress reports, correspondence files and
project briefs.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PERU
SIXTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2302-PE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.      The project's objectives were:   (a) to increase the flow of
agricultural credit in support of the GOP's efforts to accelerate
agricultural sector growth and improve the living conditions of Peru's
farmers; and (b) to strengthen the Peruvian Agricultural Bank (BAP).
Imylementation Experience
2.       Project implementation progressed well initially, but the main
elements of its strategy soon collapsed, as evidenced by the followings
(a)  Interest Rates.   Maintaining adequate interest rates became
the main project focus, as negative real rates turned into a
nagging source of disagreement between the Bank and the GOP.
Attempts to resolve the dispute were unsuccessful. The Gar-ia
Government decreed that the Central Bank would set interp-.t
rates for the entire Peruvian financial system, and BAP's
rates were de-linked from inflation, forcing it into non-
compliance with a major project covenant. Attempts to secure
Borrower compliance failed.   Disbursements were accordingly
suspended in early 1987 (see para. 5).
Short-term credit funds were fully committed by BAP,
reflecting   its experience of such lending.   However, the
project overestimated the rapidity with which BAP could
process medium- and long-term credit, and volumes were
disappointing (see Part III, Table 6A).
(b)  Strentthening of BAP.   The training program envisaged at
appraisal was directed towards assisting BAP, Ministry of
Agriculture (MA) and National Institute of Agricultural
Research and Promotion (INIPA) personnel, but only the former
actually received any training.   The management information
system was prepared and implemented successfully, but not in
time to benefit from Bank financing (i.e., before suspension
of disbursements). The BAP had to request a loan from local
sources to purchase the equipment.   During the last
supervision in January 1988, it was evident that the
computerization program was well under way (see paras. 17-19).

Studies.   Project studies tot   (M) design a rediscount
facility in the BAP to help seimulate commercial bank lending
to agriculture; and (ii) complete preparation of a sugar
rehabilitation project, were not carried out.   BAP lacked
experience in preparing appropriate terms of reference or in
commissioning consultants.  In any case, events ovartook the
component before suitable arrangements could be made.
Results
3.       Project objectives of increasing the flow of credit to the
agricultural sector and strengthening the BAP were partially achieved.
Only limited information is available, however, on the incremental
production resulting from the loans.
4.       Institutional strengthening fell short of its target in the
training program, but good results were obtained on the management
information system.   In combination with better trained personnel and
continued application of Bank standards to subloan approval, the efficiency
of the RAP has probably increased (see paras. 20-21).
Sustainabili4l
5.       Although the project sought to ensure its sustainability through
market determined interest rates at close-to-positive rates, and improved
SAP management and procedures, GOP actions steadily forced BAP to lend at
negative rates resulting in its inability to mobilize local savings. By
1988, 70S of its lending (almost US$1.0 billion equivalent) was funded from
the Central Bank, undoubtedly contributing to inflation (see para. 22).
Prineigal Pindinas
6.       The project demonstrated how a potentially successful lending
program, characterized by significant innovation and full support of the
implementing agency, can be overtaken by events beyond the control of the
Bank or the agency. It is likely that, had the planned changes in credit
policy not been abandoned, something approaching a competitive market-
oriented system would now be in place for the Peruvian rural sector (see
para. 30).

Backaround
2.       The Sixth Agricultural Credit Project vas appraised once under a
military regime and then prepared, reappraised and implemented under two
civilian governments.   Project preparation originally started in the
seventies, and its first appraisal took place in October 1976. Work on the
vroject was later suspended because of the deteriorating economic situation
in the country and the far-reaching policy changes which were being intro-
duced. In general, agrarian policy was marked by a strategy of controlled
food prices and subsidized imports of agricultural raw materials for the
domestic industrial sector, further deteriorating the agricultural terms of
trade. All new lending was halted during a short period in 1977 when Peru
was not considered creditworthy. When lending resumed, and mainly because
of the Peruvian Agrarian Bank's (BAP) negative lending rates in real terms,
the Bank and the Government of Peru (GOP) could not agree on a revised
project concept.
3.       President Belaunde's civilian Government took power in mid-1980.
This government was more inclined to promote private versus public initia-
tive and incentives versus control measures than the preceding military
regimes. At the beginning of 1982, this government decided to cut direct
subsidization to the BAP. and establish a commission to study and propose a
new agricultural credit policy more reliant on higher financing autonomy
for the BAP through increased interest rates and savings mobilization. The
commission recommended that the UAP's rates gradually increase to commer-
cial rates for most borrowers, though low income borrowers would continue
to benefit from subsidized rates.   The Bank supported these new decisions
and the project was appraised in September 1982. The project became effec-
tive in September 1983.
4.       In spite of its laisser-faire inclination, the government bowed to
political pressures to curb inflation, and continued protection to indus-
trial and urban consumers. As the agrarian reform collapsed and physical
productivity of the sector continued its downward slide, the agricultural
sector entered a serious crisis.   These troubles compounded with bad
weather resulted in a 9.6S drop in agricultural GDP in 1983.



- 2 -
S.       In  1985,  a new  populist  civilian  government  headed by
Dr. Alan Garcia P6rez was voted into power. His administration's program
featured selective price controls, overvalued and multiple exchange rates,
manufactured import restrictions, agricultural subsidies, subsidized
credit, a unilateral limitation of debt service payments and an extension
of state economic intervention.   As a result of the GOP's policies on
interest rates, the BAP's rates fell out of line with Loan Agreement
covenants, and therefore the Bank had to request in November 1986 that no
further comitments for credit operations be made. Later, the GOP fell in
arrears to the Bank, and disbursements for all projects vere suspended in
June 1987. The loan was closed in June 1988.
Prolect Obiecclves _and Descrivtion
6.       The project's objectives weres   (a) to increase the flow of
agricultural credit in support of tFs GOP's efforts to accelerate the
growth of the sector and improve the living conditions of Peru's farmers;
and (b) to strengthen the BAP. The BAP contended that there was a large
unmet demand for medium and long-term agricultural credit, at least on
BAP's usual lending terms, because resources from previous World Bank loans
had already been exhausted, the BAP was rationing its short-term lending
and its minimum long-term lending had stopped in May 1982.
The project was appraised in September/October 1982 at the time of
the Special Action Program (SAP).   The objectiv8s of tue 'aAP were to
increase the flow of resources to selected countries by increasing dis-
bursement percentages on existing loans and increasing commitments under
new loans offering prospects for quick disbursement.  Following appraisal,
this project was selected as an appropriate vehicle for action under the
SAP reflecting confidence by Management that sufficient credit demand
existed to ensu.tre rapid disbursement. Accordingly, before Board presenta-
tion (June 3, 1983) the recommended loan size was increased from US$60
million to US$130 million.
8.       The project financed the following components:
(a) agricultural credit to individual farmers, cooperatives
and agroindustrial projects for: (i) long-term invest-
ments to improve irrigation infrastructure, changing
cultural practices of cropping and expansion of mixed
crop/livestock farming, acquisition and repairs of
machinery, vehicles and equipment; and (ii) short-term
needs for expanded agricultural production. Over 20,000
farm families would receive investment loans, and the
BAP's on-going working capital program would be
increased by about 25,000 operations during the project
execution period;
(b) technical assistance and training to improve the effi-
ciency of BAP's operations; and

(c) studies tot (i) design a rediscount facility in the BAP
to help stimulate commercial bank lending in agri-
culture; and (ii) complete preparation of a sugar
rehabilitation project.
9.       A. finally approved, the project's total costs were estimated at
US$239 million with Bank financing of US$130 million (542 of total coats),
including about US$24 million in local costs under the Special Action
Program. The credit component accounted for US$100 million or 972 of base
costs at appraisal, of which US$54.1 million were for medium- and long-term
lending and US$45.'v million for incremental short-term lending.
Project DesiRn and Organization
10.      The project concept and design were consistent with the Belaunde
Government's policies, but were incompatible with the policy direction
taken by the subseqttent administration. The project sought to broaden the
sources of agricultural credit and transform the BAP into a more efficient
institution able to withstand commercial competition.  The strategy con-
sisted of: (a) increasing Incentives for the banking system to lend to the
sector by means of more realistic interest rates; (b) studying the possible
installation of a second tier window in the BAP to rediscount agricultural
loans made by commercial banks; and (c) strengthening the BAP by X king up
a new management information system and providing training for its tech-
nical staff-II   One weakness in the project design, lack of support ser-
vices to the farmers, was being tackled by the newly-created National
Institute for Agricultural Research and Promotion (INIPA), a new research
and extension agency (the Bank approved an Agriculture Research and
Extension Project in May 1982 - Ln. 2150-PE).
11.     More realilstic Interest Rates.  This project was predicated on the
Belaunde's Government's decisions to phase out direct subsidization of the
BAP and to adopt agricultural credit policies more related to market
interest rates. In April 1983, the BAP adopted new policies which aligned
its practices with those of comercial banks.   All loans to commercial
farmers over a certain amount (about US$13,000) were to be charged commer-
cial rates.   The average rate of a representative sample of commercial
banks would be used as a benchmark.  Loans for lesser amounts, which
typically went to small farmers in the most impoverished areas (the Sierra
and the Selva), would remain subsidized. The Loan Agreement contained a
covenant, number 6.01, that stated that interest rates would not fall below
902 of inflation and that their levels would be reviewed each semester.
Formulas for these calculations were included in a supplemental letter to
the Loan Agreement and subsequently clarified in 1985. To avoid the risk

purposes and strategies, especially with regard to project objectives

of possible decapitalization due to subsidies, the GOP was to provide an
annual equity contribution to the BAP, as necessary to maintain the BAP's
equity at the level of June 1983 in constant terms. 2/
12.      The Rediscount Window.  The BAP was practically the only source of
agricultural credit available, because commercial banks had no incentives
to lend to the sectort/ The project financed a study to assess the feasibi-
lity of opening a rediscount facility in the BAP for commercial banks to
lend for medium- and long-term investments.
13.      Strenathening the  AP.   This project (and the previous five
agricultural credit projects) was implemented using BAP's normal procedures
but included training±I to help BAP's technical staff cope with increased
volumes of lending, particularly in medium- and long-term operations,
expected wider geographical coverage.   It also financed a computerized
management information system to streamline procedures and upgrade informa-
tion flows. A project coordinator was appointed to serve as the liaison
with the Bank and to be responsible for the collection and analysis of
information required by the Bank.
Pro-ect Imolementation
14.      Implementation of this project progressed well to begin with, but
the main elements of the strategy soon fell apart.  In August 1984, the
study on a rediscount window to broaden the sources of agricultural credit
had to be set aside because worsening inflation and prevailing banking
regulations further diminished commercial banks' interest in agricultural
lending.
15.      Interest Rates.  Maintaining adequate interest rates became the
main project focus, as negative real interest rates became a nagging source
of disagreement between the Bank and the GOP. As indicated in Annex 1,
interest rates were positive in real terms for only 9 months out of about
four years of implementation, and in compliance with covenant 6.01 for only
eleven months.  Discrepancies on the required levels of interest rates
arose due to lack of clarity in the original methodology. A supplemental
letter that spelled out details of the methodology was signed in May 1985.
Nevertheless, in the framework of the priority assigned to agriculture by
the Garcia Government, preferential conditions were established for ag.i-
cultural credit to depressed areas in the Sierra and Selva regions with a
view to promoting recovery of rural living standards. Thus the BAP's rates
1 For detailed Government comment on these issues, see Part II, Annex I,
paras. 4-8.
11 For instance, the Agrarian Reform Law did not allow land to be used as
collateral for loans. Only farm production and machinery could be used
as security against loans, and BAP had priority as a creditor in
securing its loans with the harvest.

were de-linked from inflation and it became unable to comply vith covenant
6.01.  In November 1986 the Bank requested the 5errower to abstain from
committing loan funds in its credit operations and to submit by December
17, 1986 a plan of action to ensure compliance by the end of January 1987.
The Borrower's proposal was unsatisfactory to the Bank and formal suspen-
sion of disbursements took place on February 23, 1987.
16.      The project overestimated the pace at which the BAP could handle
projected levels of medium- and long-term lending. RAP, with most exper-
lence in short-term lending, fully committed short-term credit funds
(US$55.9 million, comprised of the original allocation for incremental
short-term credit plus US$10.0 million from the unallocated loan category)
by April 1986, but medium- and long-term credit volumes were
disappointing,5I partly because their processing remained slow (see Part
III, table 6. A).
17.      Strenathening of RAP.   BAP's training program at appraisal was
directed to the needs of the BAP, MA, and INIPA's personnel, but only BAP's
staff received any training during implementation. ESAN (Graduate School
of Business Administration) and ALTDI (Latin-American Association of
Finance and Development Institutions) provided the training.61
18.      The management information system component was prepared and suc-
cessfully implemented, but not in time to benefit from Bank financing (i.e.
before suspension of disbursement) so BAP had to request a loan from local
sources to purchase the equipment. During the last supervision mission in
January 1988, the computerization progrsm was in full Implementation. The
SAP had purchased workstations and laptop computers and developed cus-
tomized software to serve their office and field needs, and trained its
staff. Field personnel were carrying out some loan processing at the farm
level on their laptop computers.
19.      A positive note is that even one year after the BAP stopped com-
mitting the loan9s resources, it was still applying standards on appraisal
and approval of subloans required by the BSank, In anticipation of possible
retroactive financing of distursements.
Prolect Rtesults
20.      The project's objectives of increasing the flow of credit to the
agricultural sector and strengthening the BAP were partially achieved. No
ex-post calculation of economic rates of return was attempted because of a
lack of meaningful information in a highly inflationary environment. How-
ever, the Government has provided data showing substantial isprovement In
yields of important crops in areas within the scope of the project. In the
Sierra and Selva regions, farmers' timely use of project credit to purchase
51 The Government claims medium and long-term lending in fact exceeded the
project target and was constrained in the early years of project
execution by competing long-term funds from IDB. See Part II, Annex I,
para. 9 and Table 1; and Annex II.

fertilizer, improved seed and peostilde resulted in impressive gains In
maize (up 2181), rice (up 731) and potatoes (up 101).   Rice and maize
yields in the Costa region, however, declined slightly due to water manage-
ment and distribution problems (see Part II, paras. 6-7 and tables 1 and
2).71
21.      The results of the institutional strengthening components were
short of target for the training program, particularly in terms of its
coverage, but good for the management information system (see para. 18
above). The combination of better trained personnel, an improved manage-
ment information system and the continued application of standard of
appraisal and approval of subloans required by the Bank has probably
resulted in a more efficient BAP.
Proiect Sustainabilitv
22.      The Project was designed with an eye on sustainability by requir-
ing market determined interest rates which were close-to-positive and
improving BAP's management and procedures. The GOP's decision to mandate
negative interest rates for the sector in an environment of very high
inflation, caused a serious erosion of BAP's capital base, despite an
undertaking in the Loan Agreement for the GOP to provide equity contribu-
tions as compensation. After the Bank's suspension of disbursements, the
Central Bank continued to subsidize internal credit to the BAP, and the BAP
was still forced to lend at rates below its cost of funds.8/ During 1987-88
BAP could not mobilize local savings due to its negative interest rates, so
70 of its lending, equal to almost US$1.0 billion equivalent, was funded
from the Central Bank. These actions no doubt contributed to the increase
in inflation.
Bank Performance
23.      Bank assistance to the Borrower sought to help the BAP become a
more viable financial institution. This was a significant advance on the
objectives of earlier credit operations, as was the condition to raise real
interest rates.  The GOP's change in its interest policies could not be
foreseen at preparation and appraisal.
24.      As far as it could, the Bank was responsive to newly identified
needs during implementation, e.g. reallocating additional funds to short-
term credit; improving the methodologies for assessing the BAP's compliance
with interest rate covenants when established methodologies proved trouble-
some; including financing for office equipment for the BAP; and accommodat-
ing subloans for investment in machinery parts. Supervision efforts were

sustained through seven full or partial supervision mis3ions from project
effectiveness to closing and there was staff continuity throughout
Implementation.
25.      The Bank's action in suspending disbursements in November 1986,
after repeated attempts to reach an acceptable position with the Garcia
Government, was fully justified.   Continuation of the loan would have
amounted to Bank compliance with the decapitalization of BAP.
Borrower Performance
26.      RAP performance during the Sixth Agricultural Credit Project was
good, and the unfortunate circumstances that led to suspension of disblurse-
ments were not within BAP's control (para. 11) .  In spite of suspension,
the Borrower continued to apply standards for appraisal and approval of
subloans acceptable to the Bank and to implement the component to improve
management information flows and computerize its operations with local
resources. BAP progress reports on project implementation were sent to the
Bank in a timely fashion even after disbursements were halted.
Project RelationshiD
27.      The relationship between the Bank and the BAP was good and had
been built stpon many years of experience.  The BAP implemented all six
agricultural credit operations in Peru, starting with the Agricultural
Project Loan approved in 1954. Therefore, as long as the Bank perceived
that the prevailing policy directions (on interest rates) seemed to agree
vith the concept and strategy of the project, it allowed the BAP more
flexibility in its management of interest rates. BAP's management always
seemed to support the objectives of the project including the agreed
interest rate policy, but the latter was removed from its control by the
Garcia Government.
Consultant Services
28.      The studies itemized in para. 8 (c) were never carried out.  BAP
had little experience in drawing up appropriate Terms of Reference or in
commissiCning consultants. This component was overtaken by events before
suitable arrangements could be made.91
Proiect Documentation and Data
29.      No standard PCR information was available for the preparation of
this report because of the Bank had to sever its project relationship with
the Borrower prematurely. Therefore, this PCR relies only on the project
correspondence files, project briefs, Appraisal and President reports, Loan
and Guarantee Agreements and Supplementary Letters, Supervision reports,
and the Borrower's Progress reports. Information on physical targets sup-
porting lAP's lending programs was not available.
9/ See Goverment's views, Part II, Annex I, para. 14.



Lessons Learned
30.      This project, like other agricultural projects in Peru, was a case
of potentially successful operation overtaken by events outside the control
either of the implementing agency or the Bank. The Peru experience should
at least have heightened the Bank's awareness that a whole lending program
can be overwhelmed by such events.10'    This lesson is particularly
poignant in the case of this project, since the conditions on interest rate
policy, competition and management of BAP were not only a major step
forward, but they were fully supported by BAP itself. It is worth noting
that the changes in credit policy being undertaken under this project were
substantially more far-reaching than those being proposed for other
countries (Mexico, for example) during the same period. Had they not been
abandoned, along with most other national economic policies after 1985,
there is a good likelihood that by now something approaching a competitive
market-oriented system would be in place for the rural sector in Peru.11/

strengthening, marketing, MNE, and technical assistance. See Part II,

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE121
I. BACKGROUND
1.      The evaluation and administration of the Sixth Agricultural Credit
Project were carried out in a time of change and under two different
governments with differing policies, a situation which inevitably impacted
the progress of the project.
2.       The loan agreement in question was concluded between the BAP and
the World Bank on June 30, 1983, for the purpose of promoting the develop-
ment of Peru's agricultural sector through the provision of credit to
finance investment projects and working capital, together with development
of agroindustries and the improvement and expansion of the BAP's banking
activities.
3.       In the initial stage the execution of the project proceeded
normally, but then faltered on account of disagreement between the parties
and disbursements were suspended in June 1987.
4.       However, the results of the project must be underscored, since it
served as an important vehicle for financing the agricultural sector and
was therefore instrumental in changing traditional crop and stock raising
systems.
II. RESULTS
Production
5.       This report provides a balance sheet of the results as regards
production of the crops of greatest economic importance within the scope of
the project, and is based on samples from the country's three regions.
6.       In the Costa region, average yields of the samples evaluated are
slightly down, by 6.91 for rice and 21 for hard yellow maize, compared with
the regional figures; this result is possibly due to shortcomings in irri-
gation water management and distribution by users.
121 This is an unedited translation of the Borrower's contribution to the
Project Completion Report.



- 10 -
7.       In the Sierra and Selva regions, on the other hand, crop yields
posted improvements, with potato and maize production up 10.42 and 2182,
respectively, in the Sierra and rice 732 higher in the Selva. The reason
for this improvement in yields was the proper use of credit, which enabled
farmers to obtain inputs such as fertilizer, improved seed and pesticides
at the right time. See Tables 1 and 2.
Accomplishment of Physical Targets
8.       The composition of the flow of funds brought about by execution of
the project is shown by the financing coverage achieved with program
resolurces, which reached 58% in relation to the total placed in 1985, then
dropped to 1.22 in 1987, the year in which disbursements were suspended.
9.       The users' preferences are well known, with loans for crop produc-
tion heading the list, followed by credit for livestock, a pattern that
remained unchanged throughout the implementation of the project.   As
regards credit for capital assets, demand was greatest for loans for machi-
nery, equipment and vehicles, followed by investments in infrastructure
facilities, permanent crops and livestock.

ANl I
CONMENTS ON THE WORLD BANK REPORT (PART 1)
DesiRn and Ortanization (Ref. Part I, paragraph 10)
1.       The purposes and strategies detailed in this paragraph are in some
measure inconsistent with the project objectives specified In paragraph 6.
On the basis of its infrastructure, the BAP has always managed its funds
efficiently.   Like any enterprise that has to expand its coverage and
Improve procedures, it needs new financial, human and physical resources,
together with a good training program, information system, technical
assistance services, etc.
2.       The strengthening of the SAP, as referred to in paragraph 6(b), is
intended to increase its flow of funds for use chiefly in lending for
capital assets.
3.       Where the Bank document refers to transforming the BAP into an
institution "able to withstand commercial competition," we do not know what
is intended.   If this relates to competition from commercial banks
reference needs to be made to complementary measures.
Interest Rates (Ref. Part 1, paragraphs 11 and 15-16)
4.       The requirement that "All loans to commercial farmers... were to
be charged at commercial rates. The average of a representative sample of
commercial banks would be used as a benchmark," was unnecessary and more-
over not applicable in practice. Since before the execution of the proj -
ect, the Central Reserve Bank (CRB) has been setting the maximum rate
authorized for the entire financial system, by category of loan, and the
board of each institution has resolved either to charge that maximum rate
or a lower figure. It was accordingly sufficient for the BAP to set its
rates on the basis of the authorized maximum. In practice, the bank always
charged the maximum rate authorized by the CRB.
5.       In the case of loans for which promotional rates were set for
reasons of agricultural policy, the Ministry of Economy and Finance is
obliged to make up the difference with respect to tha maximum rate. More-
over, as will be realized, the fixing of the interest rate by the CRB
depends on factors exogenous to the BAP.
6.       In addition, the best criterion for evaluating the interest rate
was that it should not be below 902 of the inflation rate over three con-
secutive months.



- 15 -
Page 2 of 3
7.       We reiterate that the ordinary interest rates charged by the BAP
during the project execution period were the maxima permitted by the CRB.
As to the preferential rates charged by the BAP on loans for food produc-
tion and those granted for the Sierra and Selva regions and depressed
areas, or in pursuance of laws or government regulations, the difference
between these preferential rates and those charged on ordinary loans was
covered by the Central Government, in accordance with Article 25 of
Legislative Decree No. 201 (BAP Organic Law).
8.       Thus, In accordance vith the above, the BAP has been charging the
maximum interest rates authorized by the CRB throughout the project, it
being understood that in the case of preferential rates, the differential
is being covered by the Central Government.
9.       Regarding this point, where it is stated that the volumes of
medium and long-term lending were disappointing (para. 16), It should be
noted that over the project execution period the BAP committed approxi-
mately US$116 million (according to Table 1) in medium- and long-term
loans, distinctly more than the US$73 millicl programmed in the project.
After February 1987, the RAP continued financing these commitments from its
own resources since the World Bank suspended disbursements from the loan as
of that date owing to the Central Government'a failure to service the debt
to the Bank and because the Bank objected to the negative real interest
rates.  It should also be mentioned that although in the early years of
execution of the project the pace of placement of medium and long-term
loans did not match that of short-term loans, this was because at the same
time there were projects under way that were financed by other interna-
tional agencies such as the IDB, IFAD and ADC whose resources were also
intended largely for long-term lending; these projects were executed in
full, as was the IBRD-financed project.
Instltutional Strontthenina (Ref. Part I, paragraph 17)
10.      On December 13, 1985 the BAP submitted a comprehensive training
program for 1986 which was approved by the World Bank. This program was
implemented, taking into consideration the decentralization process. The
object was to provide courses that were  important and priority In nature
and met the basic operational needs of the BAP's management, technical and
support staff.
11.      This training program was carried out in part by using the ser-
vices of specialized institutions such as the Graduate School of Business
Administration (ESAN) and the Latin American Association of Pinance and
Development Institution (ALIDE), at national level in the latter case, vith
which subprograms were executed.   In addition, the training program
organized a smaller number of courses with specialized bodies, using the
open event method.



- 16 .
Pasge 3 of 3
Pro1ect SustainabilUtv (Ref. Part I, paragraph 22)
12.      The 8AP, as an agricultural development bank, grants loans for
working capital and fixed investments from the resources available to it,
which includes those provided by the CRB through the Annual Monetary
Program.
13.      The line of credit granted to the BAP by the CRB is independent of
any funding it may obtain from other sources. The BAP's weighted average
rate of return is always greater than its cost of funds, *o that there is
never a net financial loss.
Consultant Services (Ref. Part I, paragraph 28)
14.      In accordance with the agreement signed with IBRD, concerning
upgrading of its information and procedures and computer system, and also
with a view to procurement and use of equipment best suited to its require-
ments, the BAP engaged the services of two consultants (technical specia-
lists), whose qualificaiAons, experience and terms of employment were
accepted by the World Bank.
Lessons Learned (Ref. Part I, paragraph 30)
15.      In consideration of the possibility of new loans using World Bank
resources, the following sub:omponents could be included:
(a)  Design of credit monitoring and evaluation systems:  Formal and
informal sources, costs, performance and returns, etc. Applica-
tion of statistical sampling techniques.   Study to be made by
consultants.
(b) Development of marketing systems: Consultant services.
(c) Institutional strengthening: Training programs run by the execut-
ing agency; study and analysis of loan portfolio.   Consultant
services; Development of financial analysis techniques. Consul-
tant services; Equipment.
(d)  Technical assistance programs:  Include as a component of the
loan. Execution to be the responsibility of the executing agency.
(e) Alternative evaluation criteria for the interest rate on the sub-
loan portfolio: This evaluation could be done semi-annually, on
the basis of weighted average actual interest rates per category
of loan, by period, compared with inflation in the half-year con-
sidered, in order to finally calculate the real rate. An accepta-
bility range or margin could then be set on this basis.

ANNEX II
FURTHER CONMENTS
Comments by the Directorate General of Public Credit on the
Completion Report of the project financed by Loan 2302-PE, are given belows
Paragraph 5s       "headed by Mr. Alan Garcia" should read "headed by
Dr. Alan Garcia P6rez."
Paragraph 10:      "The project concept and design were consistent
with the Belaunde Government's policies, but were
incompatible with the policy direction taken by the
subsequent administration."
This sentence should be omitted.
Paragraph 15:      "This did not resolve the conflict, however, as the
Garcia Government...."
This should be replaced by: "Nevertheless, in the
framework of the priority assigned to agriculture
by the Garcia Govsrnment, preferential conditions
were established for agricultural credit to
depressed areas in the Sierra and Selva regions
with a view to promoting recovery of rural living
standards; thus the...."
Paragraph 16:      "....but medium and long-term credit volumes were
disappointing, partly because their processing
remained slow..."
This should read:  "...regarding medium- and long-
term credit, the pace of lending was slower,
basically because the amount of competitive
external resources exceeded the demand for agri-
cultural credit."
Paragraph 30:      This project, like other agricultural projects in
(first sentence)   Peru, was a case of a potentially successful
operation overtaken by events outside the control
either of the implementing agency or of the Bank."
This sentence should be omitted.
Paragraph 30:     "...*a whole lending program can be overwhelmed by
(second sentence)  such events."
This should be amended to read: "... flexibility
needs to be introduced into the requirement that
real interest rates be positive in order to
harmonize with the Government's economic policy and
at the same time pursue the project objectives."

Comments
(a)  Identification
This 4. the Sixth Agricultural Credit project implemented by BAP.   The
Fifth Agricultural Credit project was closed in December 1978 but because
of BAP's negative interest rates no agreement could be reached on a follow-
up project until the GOP agreed to maintain BAP's rates at competitive
commercial levels.
(b)  Preparation
A civilian government took power in mid-1980. At the beginning of 1982,
this government decided to cut direct subsidization to the BAP and estab-
lish a commission to study and propose a new agricultural credit policy
reliant on higher financing autonomy for BAP through increased interest
rates and savings mobilization.   The commission recommended that BAP's
rates should gradually increase to commercial levels for most borrowers,
though low income borrowers would continue to benefit from subsidized
rates.
(c)  A22Laisal
After appraisal, the loan amount was increased from US$60.0 million to
US$130.0 million under the Bank's Special Action Program.
(d)  Issues Identified at Decision Meeting
A satisfactory interest rate system for agricultural lending.
(e)  Loan disbursements were suspended on May 5, 1987, due to none performance
by the Borrower under the Loan Agreement.
