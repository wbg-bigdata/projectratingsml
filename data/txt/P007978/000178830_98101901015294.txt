PERU
SIXTH AGRICULTURAL (REDIT PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTCURE SECTOR
General
1.01      The performance of the agricultural sector in Peru in the 1970s was
poor. At a time when the population was increasing at 2.8% per annum (4.1%
in urban areas), the value of total agricultural production rose at only 0.7%
per annum compared to 2.5% per annum between 1950 and 1970 and in real terms
actually declined by 0.6% per annum in the decade of the 1970s.
1.02      The long decline in the value of Peru's per capita agricultural
production, which was temporarily halted in the 1980/81 crop year, was caused
mainly by the drought that had been affecting a large part of the country
during the entire past decade, particularly from 1978 to 1980. However,
there were additional reasons for the dismal performance of the agricultural
sector, namely the agrarian reform and the manner of its implementation; the
dismantling of the extension service; and the official marketing and pricing
policies during the 1970s which acted as a disincentive to producers during a
period of high running inflation. With the return of a constitutional
Government in 1980, high priority has again been given to agricultural
diversification and to increasing agricultural production, and policies
designed to achieve these goals have already been put into effect.
The Resource Base
1.03      Peru's agricultural resource base is limited compared to other
Latin American countries. While the total area of the country is 128.5
million ha, only about 3.0 million ha are currently in agricultural use,
about 1.2 million ha of which are under irrigation and 1.8 million ha are
rainfed.  Of the balance, about 22.0 million ha are under natural grass, and
the rest is either suitable for forestry or unsuitable for cultivation
because it is too dry, too poorly drained, or too steep for any form of food
or fiber production. There are three well-defined topographic and climatic
zones in Peru - the Costa, the Sierra and the Selva.
1.04      The Costa, which constitutes the Coastal zone in the west of the
country, consists mainly of flat desert plains, sand dunes and the dry,
heavily eroded Andean foothills. It is a narrow 3,000-km-long belt, covering
about 13.1 million ha (10.2% of the total land area), where about 46% of the
country's population lives.  Coastal agriculture is limited to the river
valleys where irrigation is possible; thease valleys produce over 40% of the
country's gross value of crop production, including sugar, rice, cotton,
maize, potatoes, citrus, olives and grapes. The region enjoys relatively
close proximity to the urban markets, a good transportation network, and
other infrastructure and is relatively prosperous.
1.05      The Sierra, which constitutes the Andean highland zone, covers over
33.4 million ha (26% of the total land area) and accounts for about 44% of
the population. It consists of steep mountains, reaching over 5,000 m and



- 2 -
high valleys located between the mountain ranges. Some 2.3 million ha in the
Sierra are cropped and about 17.3 million ha are used for grazing, mostly
under marginal conditions because of steep slopes and high altitudes. Severe
topography, erratic rainfall and extreme changes in temperature make farming
difficult and limited to a short season, leading to low agricultural
productivity. While there is little scope for bringing new land into
production, there is some potential for improving productivity through
extension, research and use of production inputs.
1.06      The Selva, which constitutes the tropical forest zone east of the
Andes mountains, covers about 82 million ha (63.8% of the total land area)
and accounts for 10% of the total population.  It comprises two subzones:
the eastern slopes of the Andes at medium altitude - the Ceja de Selva; and
the Amazon jungle - the Selva Baja (lower Selva). Although most soils in the
lower Selva are classified as marginal and suitable only for grazing and
forestry, soils in the Ceja de Selva are generally of better quality and are
concentrated primarily in four river valleys. With the construction of the
Trans-Andean Highway System and oil exploration, the Selva has been gaining
in economic importance over the last decade, and the related migration of
experienced, commercially motivated farmers from the Sierra to the Ceja de
Selva in particular has provided considerable impetus to agricultural
development. This dynamic development has led to the conclusion that the
Ceja de Selva is likely to be an important new agricultural frontier with
potential to help meet the rapidly rising food needs of the large urban
population along the coast.
Rural Population, Employment, Income and Trade
1.07      Between 1961 and 1981, the percentage share of rural population in
Peru had declined from 53% to 33% while the share of urban popu:Lation
increased from 47% to 67%. Unemployment in the rural sector is almost nil
compared to about 10% among the urban labor force, but underemp:Loyment (as
measured by income below the minimum wage rate), is about 61% compared to
about 48% in the urban sector. As a resu:Lt, agricultural productivity is
low, which explains the disproportionately low 12% contribution of the
agriculture sector to the country's GDP.
.fln      As a result cf population increases, the massive migration of the
rural population into the cities, and the slow development of agricultural
production during the last decade, Peru's agricultural balance of trade has
become significantly negative. At the beginning of the 1970s, the trade
surplus was typically in the order of abouit US$100 million, but by 1981 there
was a trade deficit of about US$230 million. Although this deficit could be
decreased to some extent by the recently iincreased production of import-
substituting crops and because prices of exportable commodities such as
cotton, sugar and coffee, which have been unusually low recently, would
probably rise in the near future, it will still require a massive effort to
bring back a balance to the agricultural trade of Peru.
Government Policies
1.09      The most significant change in Government policy at present as
compared to that under the military Government during the 1970s is in the



relative emphasis on private versus public initiative and on incentives
versus control measures. This has been especially translated into the ending
of agrarian reform actions such as transfer of private farms into
cooperatives, and the concomitant freeing of domestic and foreign marketing
of farm products by allowing private marketing channels to develop, which
were prohibited previously. Furthermore, the present Government decontrolled
prices of most commodities, which, until 1980, were highly regulated and
eliminated direct subsidies on most food products and inputs. The inte-rest
of the new Government was promulgated in the Agricultural and Deve1 ;pm,-,.
Law, issued on November 17, 1980. This law guaranteed among other things,
the improvement of marketing and distribution channels; the restoratior of a
free market for all products except under extreme circumstances which would
justify otherwise; and the right of individuals to import and export
agricultural products, raw materials and inputs. One of the most sign: ficant
institutional changes made by the present civilian Government was the
creation of the National Institute of Agricultural Research and Promotion
(INIPA). This was done in order to recreate a public sector capability for
agricultural research and extension, which, it was universally agreed, had
for all practical purposes disappeared under the previous regime.
Previous Bank Participation
1.10      The Bank has made 13 agricultural loans to Peru.  Five of them, in
the period of 1954-73, totaling US$55.0 million, were for agricultural credit
and were channeled through the Peruvian Agricultural Bank (BAP) (105-PE,
162-PE, 257-PE, 415-PE and 933-PE). In general, BAP performance has been
reasonably good (para 3.01). Disbursements on the last loan (933-PE) were
completed in 1979. Two other loans 167-PE of 1952 and 98-PE of 1954),
totaling US$3 million, were for farm machinery imports. Loans 114-PE of 1955
and 418-PE of 1965, totaling US$24.5 million, financed irrigation works and
land settlement in the San Lorenzo area within the Chira-Piura basins. Owing
to managerial problems, inadequate counterpart funding and shortage of water,
the second of these loans encountered considerable difficulties and took 11
years to disburse, but it nevertheless achieved its basic goals and produced
important benefits (Project Performance Audit Report, SECM-48 of January 1978
and Impact Evaluation Report of October 1981). A third irrigation project
(Loan 1403-PE) of US$25 million approved in 1977 financed the rehabilitation
of drainage and irrigation systems in six valleys in the southern part of the
Coastal zone. Another irrigation rehabilitation project in the Lower Piura
area in the northern part of the Coastal zone (Loan 1771-PE) of US$56 million
was approved in 1980. Both have experienced early management problems but
implementation is progressing satisfactorily although the latter is plagued
by a shortage of counterpart funds. The recent loans approved by the Bank
were for an integrated rural development project in the Sierra, Puno Rural
Development (Loan 1812-PE) of US$15 mnillion; the National Agricultural
Research and Extension Project (Loan 2150-PE) of US$40.6 million, which was
signed on September 13, 1982; and the Alto Mayo Rural Development Project in
the Ceja de Selva (Loan 1812-PE) of US$30.0 million, which is not yet
effective. The Bank generally supports the Government's development policy
and therefore the Bank's lending strategy is well aligned with the
Government's sectoral objectives, which are: (a) rehabilitation of irrigated
coastal areas where the potential for improved productivity is great; (b)
beginning development of the potentially rich Ceja de Selva;



- 4 -
(c) assisting the poorest of the rural poor, particularly in the Altiplano,
through rural development projects; and (d) building up agricultural credit,
research and extension programs to provide much needed improvements in
agricultural support services.
II. AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
General
2.01      Agricultural credit in Peru has been in recent years practically
confined to the Government owned Banco Agrario del Peru (BAP), which has been
providing about 93% of the total institutional credit, while commercial
banks' loan portfolios captures the remaining 7%, mostly in short-term
lending for marketing. Other non-institutional sources, such as suppliers of
equipment and inputs, and distributors of farm products, provide credit, but
while the exact amount is unknown, this is not believed to account for
a significant portion of the total credit. Prior to the 1970s, commercial
banks were more active in agricultural credit, capturing about 35% of the
total. The reasons for the decline in their share can be attributed mainly
to: (a) the overall institutional changes that occurred in the agriculture
sector during the 1970s, which affected traditional clients through agrarian
reform and created an atmosphere of uncertainty and oriented marketing and
lending primarily to the public entities; and (b) the lack of acceptable
guarantees for commercial bank lendings, because of the agrarian reform law
did not allow land to be mortgaged. Only farm production and imachinery could
be used as security against loans, and BAP has a priority as a creditor in
securing its loans with the harvest.
BAP's Past Lending: Volume, Distribution and Sources of Funds
2.02      Only about 10% of the total number of about 1.8 mill:ion farm
families in Peru receive institutional credit, a very low perc(entage compared
with other Latin American countries, of whom about half are members of
cooperatives. Some 65% of this credit has been lent in recent years to
farmers in the Costa, 15% to the Sierra and 20% to the Selva. Approximately
50% of BAP's lendings in 1981 was extended to cooperatives and 50% to private
farmers. In previous years the share of cooperatives was larger, but with
the changes of Government policy in 1980 (para 1.09), the share of the
private sector in agricultural lendings h1as been growing (Tables I and 2).
2.03      Analysis of BAP's credit indicates the following:  (a) in current
terms its lending increased by more than 11 times between 1976 and 1981;
however, accounting for inflation, real 'Lending growth was about 3.4% per
annum. Its total lending in 1981 was US'$643 million and its loan portfolio
for December 31, 1981 was US$564 million,, 16% of which was overdue (Tables 3
and 4); (b) its lending has been almost exclusively concentrated on
short-term credit which provided about 92% of its annual lendings (86% for
crops and livestock production credit and 6% for marketing credit) during
1979-81. Crop production credit has been heavily concentrated on about five
commodities: cotton, sugarcane, rice, potatoes and coffee; (c) about



- 5 -
one-third of BAP's short-term lendings have been financed by the Peruvian
Central Bank at preferential interest rates (currently 29% per annum compared
to 44% to commercial banks); about one-third by additional equity contributed
by the Government; and one-third by its own revolving equity. The need for
continuous injections of Government funds to supplement BAP resources for
lendings reflect the erosion of BAP's equity resulting from its strongly
negative lending rates (para 2.04). Long-term loans have been financed
almost exclusively from external funds and, to a small extent, from specially
designated Government funds. Since early 1982, BAP has introduced a vigorous
and successful campaign to attract savings at competitive market rates; this
*           accounted for about 20% of BAP's sources of funds in 1982.  However, because
the lending rates were substantially below the interest paid to savers, the
ensuing results contributed to decapitalization of BAP.
Interest Rate Structure
2.04      Until recently, it was the policy of the Government to charge low
interest rates for agricultural loans. Up to April 1, 1983, BAP lent at
nominal interest rates ranging between 32.5% and 49.5%, which until mid-1981
was the highest nominal lending rate allowed in Peru, and was subsequently
increased to 57% for medium- and long-term loans and 49.5% for short-term
loans. The Government was reimbursing BAP for the difference in interest
rates for all loans which were below 49.5%. While the effective and the
nominal rates were identical for short-term lending, the effective rates for
medium- and long-term lending were actually lower, between 23% and 31%, due
to the interest grace periods allowed. These rates compared with an
inflation rate in the country of about 70% during 1982 and with commercial
bank interest rates, effectively ranging between 65% and 80%.
2.05      Because of the burden this has represented to the Government budget
in the face of increasing budget constraints, and after extensive discussions
with the Bank, the Government decided in August 1982, to change its interest
rate policy. The new policy became effective on April 1, 1983 and has the
following main characteristics: (a) BAP's borrowers are charged commercial
interest rates; (b) farmers who are borrowing less than S./ 20 million are
entitled to subsidized lending rates, which have remained as they were before
April 1, 1983 for short-term lendings but are substantially higher for
medium- and long-term lendings; (c) BAP is charging interest during grace
period; and (d) BAP is charging interest for part of the period in advance,
in line with commercial bank practices. BAP's past and present interest
rates are shown in the following table:

BAP's Lending Program for 1983-86
2.06      BAP is experiencing strong demand for agricultural credit, more
than it can satisfy for short-term lending and considerably more so for
medium and long term. In order to determine the amount of additional funding
needed to satisfy its requirements, BA]' has drawn up a lending program,
approved by the Government, for the 1983-86 period in which it expects to
increase, in 1982 constant prices, its short-term lending by 17.6% (4tA 7er
annum) and in its medium-/long-term leniding by 93% (about 18% per an-uMn
which, in the light of present demand, is considered realistic. According to
a study commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), the expected change
of the interest rate structure is not likely to significantly affect the
demand for agricultural credit because the incremental cost of financing
would comprise only a small percentage of the cost of production.  The thrust
of the BAP program would be to augment food production in order to reduce the
current high level of imports. In addiLtion, it would complement the
Government's National Plan for Development to support rural and regional
projects. BAP's investment plan would be coordinated each year with the
Ministries of Agriculture and Finance and be approved by the Board of
Directors. Projections show that, over the four-year period, some 60% of
BAP's increased lending would have to be financed from external assistance,
even if taxes on BAP's profits would be ploughed back into BAP as
Government's contribution to meet its :Lending requirements. About a third of
the external assistance required would come from other sources such as the
Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and others; the remainder would be
covered by the proposed Bank loan (Tables 5 to 8).
BAP's Organization and Management
2.07      BAP's Board of Directors comprises seven members, four of whom
represent the Ministry of Finance, one being, by statute, the president, and
three representing the Ministry of Agriculture. The Board is responsible for
(a) setting BAP's economic and financial policies; (b) making organizational
and procedural changes; (c) maintaining control of accounts and budgetary
policy; and (d) approving medium- and 'Long-term loans over S/. 1,500 million
(US$2.1 million) to cooperatives and ovier S/. 240 million (US$336,000) to
individuals. Generally, BAP is a sound organization, although, as it has
been entirely dependent on Government intervention for a long time, its
management has been somewhat lax and not quick to take decisions. As a
result, good control over cash management and the loan portfolio have been
lacking. To remedy this situation the proposed project would include several
components that would enhance the management control of BAP (paras 4.06 and
4.07).
2.08      BAP's General Manager is appointed by the Board and is in charge
of day to day operations and administration. He has, under his direct super-
vision, the sub-departments for accounting, administration, legal affairs,
public relations, and inspection and auditing. He also supervises the
directors of BAP's three main operational departments: (a) Credit, which is
responsible for lending activities, monitoring and supervision of loans; (b)
Finance, responsible for budgeting and administration of financial resources;
and (c) Planning and Economic Studies, responsible for preparation of feasi-
bility studies, training and programming of BAP's budget and activities.

Altogether, there are 19 branches, 65 agencies and 25 inspectorates of BAP
located throughout Peru. Of the total of about 3,400 employees, 2,800 are
located in branches and other field offices, with about 600 professionals,
mainly agronomists.
2.09      Internal auditing is done by the Inspection and Auditing
Department, which refers directly to the President of the Board and carries
out auditing of accounts and operations according to regulations established
for all state banks by the state Controller General. The internal auditors
are quite active and showed evidence of pursuing identified weaknesses and
recommendations.   BAP carries out annually an expost evaluation of about 15%
of its sublendings from external resources. This economic evaLluation is
carried out by staff from the Office of Planning and Economic Studies and
does not involve the relevant field offices and technicians.  Inspection of
accounts financed from BAP's resources is undertaken yearly at headquarters
and in a representative number of branch offices and agencies under its
jurisdiction.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECTS
3.01      The Bank has to date financed five credit projects, totaling US$55
million, to support lending for crop and livestock development. The benefits
derived from the first four loans to BAEP are difficult to evaluate because of
the changes induced by the land reform after 1968 and because the impact of
the projects on production was not recorded. However, from sample data, BAP
estimates that the gross value of increased production on farms receiving
credit from the first three projects amounted to about US$44 million in 1963
(about US$170 million in 1982 dollars). Spot checks carried out by BAP in
1963 on about 10% of the loans made to representative categories of farmers
in the different regions indicated a significant degree of success in the
sense that the overall value of crop production increased by about 42% and
livestock numbers increased by about 45%, which was compatible with or even
better than the estimates at appraisal.
3.02      The Fifth Agricultural Credit Project with a Bank loan of US$25
million became effective in 1973 and its closing date was the end of 1978.
The project commenced slowly because of competing funds, but after those were
exhausted, about a year after effectiveness, the project gathered momentum.
Total project cost at appraisal were estimated to be US$41.7 million but the
final project cost was in fact about US$51 million equivalent, as BAP
continued sublending even after full commitment of the Bank loan in 1978, in
anticipation of a rapid repeater. This, however, did not materialize, so
that BAP's share of project cost was actually 31% rather than the originally
expected 20%. Also, the total number of subloans was 4,620 rather than the
2,500 anticipated at appraisal.
3.03      Before commencement of the Fifth Agricultural Credit Project
subloan arrears were above 30%. The Bank loan agreement called for BAP to
make plans to improve its loan recovery. Progress was slow but steady. By
1976 the arrears had fallen to 18.6% and by 1978 dropped further to 11.8%;
however, this level remained unchanged through 1981. In view of the



- 9 --
difficulties which Peruvian agriculture encountered during the agrarian
reform years, BAP's performance on collections can be regarded as quite
remarkable. Further improvement of thLe collection rate would be possible,
but at a relatively slow pace.
3.04      The main issues attributed to the Fifth Agricultural Credit
Project, as defined by the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) were:
(a) deficiency in the capacity of BAP to evaluate properly and promptly
subloan applications, which resulted mainly from shortage of qualified
staff; the proposed project, therefore, would include a component of training
to remedy any shortage of technical staff envisaged (para 4.06), and specific
outline of planning and programming of the lending program each year (para
5.03); (b) the absence of extension services to provide technical assistance
to borrowers under the project; this situation has been remedied since, to a
great extent, with the establishment of INIPA which carries out the extension
program for the country and in which the Bank has been involved under
a separate project loan (para 1.10); and (c) the substantial losses to BAP
due to negative real interest rates that the Government of Peru insisted that
BAP should charge. Even though interest rates had been raised during the
course of the project, they were still maintained at about half the inflation
rate level. Consequently, BAP's capital base had declined in real terms
between December 31, 1973 and December 31, 1979, despite massive injections
of funds by the Government. In addition to the above issues, the project
completion report identified, among other things, a deficiency in the
monitoring by BAP of project results. Sub-borrowers' performance, even on a
sample basis, was not tracked and assessed. To remedy this situation in the
proposed project, requirements for monitoring and evaluation of the project
results would be spelled out from the outset in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank (para 5.12). Despite the criticism leveled above of the project, its
economic rate of return, estimated by the Bank audit mission, was about 30%,
compared to about 26% estimated at appraisal.
3.05      The Fifth Agricultural Credit Project was implemented during a
period in which the Government was preoccupied with land reform, and it did
not deem it prudent to introduce policy changes in agricultural credit
practices that could have ensured a self-sustaining operation by BAP.
According to the PPAR, the Bank, in responding to the challenge to work with
the "reformist" Government had largely to forego its attempt to impose sound
credit policies. Nevertheless, eventually more realistic policies were
adopted by the Government. The November 1980 agricultural promotion law,
emphasizes the role of the private sector and relies more on incentives than
on direct controls. Hence, the Government is now more amenable to proposed
changes in the institutional structure of BAP, such as creating a rediscount
facility in BAP to allow other banks to participate in agricultural lendings,
as well as to the changes proposed under the new agricultural credit policy
which eliminated most of the subsidies inherent in the previous interest rate
structure (para 2.05).

IV. THE PROJECT
Introduction
4.01      The Government has requested Bank assistance for BAP to help
finance, through an Agricultural Credit Project, its four-year lending
program (1983 through 1986). The project preparation report was prepared by
BAP in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, approved by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance, and submitted to the Bank in April 1982.
A list of studies and working papers related to the project is given in
Annex 3.
Project Objectives
4.02      The main policy objectives of the Government are to increase
agricultural production, increase farmers' income, improve marketing
channels, and strengthen agricultural institutions, including the credit
system. Provision of agricultural credit, both for medium-/long-term and for
short-term, is one of the most essential elements in this policy. The
objectives of the proposed project, which are compatible with those of the
Government, are basically threefold. First, it would help satisfy a strong
demand for agricultural investment credit in the country, which BAP's own
resources are in no position to fulfill, as well as for short-term working
capital, in order to accelerate agricultural export growth, reduce dependence
on imported foodstuffs and alleviate poverty and underemployment in the
sector. Second, through elimination of most of BAP's subsidized lending, it
would arrest the strong erosion of BAP's capital, progressively improve its
position to finance lending requirements out of its own resources and expand
its presently very limited credit coverage of the farming population.
Elimination of subsidized interest rates except for small and underprivileged
farmers (para 5.04) would also enable private banks to participate to a
greater extent in agricultural sector letnding. To achieve this, the proposed
project would provide funds to design a rediscounting facility in BAP, which
would further expand credit coverage. T'hird, the project would help
reinforce BAP as a more efficient lending institution by improving its
management control through setting up a new information system and providing
training for its technical staff.
Brief Description
4.03      The proposed project would be BAP's lending program for
agricultural activities over a four-year period (1983-86). Investment loans
to individual farmers, farmer groups and cooperatives, comprising about 50%
of tne lending program, would be based on sound development plans for a wide
array of activities related to crop and livestock production and
agroindustries. Investments for institutional improvement of BAP and studies
would comprise about 2% of the project cost. Incremental short-term loans,
comprising the remaining 48% of the lending program, would be made to cover
the additional working capital requirements of borrowers having made
investments in their enterprises and to fe-rmers and farmer groups borrowing
for short-term production requirements f-or the first time. Type and size of



- 11 -
medium- and long-term as well as short-term loans Auld vary considerably
given the wide range of borrowers and variations in regional conditions.
Detailed Features
4.04      Medium- and Long-Term Financing. Components of the project under
this category would comprise about US$120 million, including contingencies.
In line with the present structure of BAP's lending portfolio, it is expected
that about two-thirds of the total value of loans under the project wcvld
benefit irrigation farmers in the Costa. The remainder would benefit rainfed
crop and livestock farming in the Sierra and Selva. The most important
improvements expected in the Costa would include: (a) improvements in the
on-farm irrigation infrastructure: canal and drainage construction, canal.
lining, irrigation control structures and land levelling; (b) changes of
cultural practices of cropping: higher crop intensities, improved yields and
establishment of perennial crops such as bananas and fruit orchards; and
(c) expansion of mixed crop/livestock farming by the introduction of alfalfa
under irrigation and expansion of the dairy herd. In the Sierra, livestock
production would be expanded by: (a) the expansion of improved pastures
(mainly by rye-grass seeding) as well as forage crops (such as oats); (b) the
purchase of cattle (bulls and heifers) and sheep (rams and ewes); (c) the
purchase of machinery and equipment, and the construction of fences and
livestock building facilities; and (d) an expansion of the area under
subsistence food production: potatoes and quinua. In the Selva, major
improvements would include: (a) an expansion of the rice cultivated area and
improvements in rice yields; and (b) an increase of livestock production by
improving pastures (brachiaria) and purchase of cattle and equipment. The
investment component in BAP's lending program is estimated on the basis of 10
illustrative farm models representing typical farming enterprises in Peru
that are expected to participate in borrowing under the project.
Accordingly, four models represent farmi'ng activities in the northern Costa
region, two in the central Costa region, one in the south central Costa and
Sierra regions (Tacna and Arequipa), one in the Sierra, one in the northern
and central Selva regions, and one in the Costa and Selva regions (Tables 9
to 13).
4.05      Short-Term Financing.  This component would comprise about US$114
million and cover the financing needs for increased production that would be
generated from the project and from esti'mated expansion of production in the
agriculture sector by and large (para 2.06). In 1981 BAP's short-term loan
portfolio was about S/. 188 billion (about US$445 million) compared to
projected needs of about S/. 462 billion in 1986 (about US$616 million). Due
to mounting fiscal pressures, the Government would be unable to provide BAP
with all the additional financial resources necessary to carry out the
short-term lending program. If not provided by external sources such as the
Bank, this would cause a stagnation of agricultural production or would force
BAP to borrow in external commercial markets at extremely unfavorable terms.
4.06      Training and Consultant Servic:es.  The cost of this component would
be about US$1 million. BAP presently hats an impressive contingent of
technical agricultural staff, but is short of financial analysts and
economists who can properly evaluate subloan applications. Out of about 650
technical staff, only 47 are accountants and six are economists.



- 12 -
On the basis of the experience&ained from the previous Bank project (para
3.04) and in order to successfkly carry out the proposed project, more staff
would need to be trained.  BAP has already started a training program,
carried out by the Department of Planning and Economic Studies (DPES), but it
is short of funds and qualified training personnel. This prompted BAP to
request funding for a technical assistance program, including consultant
services, through the project. BAP has already prepared a detailed training
program for 1983 and outlines for a prograin over the following three years,
including designation of resource persons, participants, location, budgets,
and a program for about 30 man-month consultant services, valued at about
US$10,000 per man-month. The consultants would: carry out inventory and
assess the qualifications of existing staff; review and evaluate ongoing
training programs; and assist in defining responsibilities and dlevelop a
system for effective mutual support between technical and credit staff of
INIPA and BAP. In addition, the program would finance the training program
for lending policies, accounting, banking techniques, training fellowships
and equipment and material. Details on the proposed program and objectives
for the training program, with terms of reference for the consultants, are in
Annex 1. Technical staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, especially INIPA,
managers of cooperatives, and farmers, would participate. Courses at
headquarters and branch offices would concentrate on: (a) investment project
formulation and evaluation; (b) accounting and banking techniques; and
(c) operation and management of agricultural credit. The project would
provide 30 man-months of training fellowships abroad. Assurances were
obtained that consultants with qualifications and terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank would be engaged for the above purposes by March 31,
1984.
4.07      Improvement of Information System.  This component would cost about
US$3 million. The project would provide technical assistance in computer
hardware and for the upgrading of information procedures, which would be
determined by a study carried out under the project that would precede the
investments. While BAP's information system was upgraded in 1981, there is
still room for much improvement to cope with the wide geographic spread of
branches and the extended lending program. There is currently a considerable
delay in receiving information from the branches and agencies, and
information that is provided is usually lacking in sufficient details to
allow comprehensive analysis. The objectives of improving the information
system are to provide BAP's management with current information on which to
base decisions on lending; improve coordination and communications between
the headquarters and branches, thereby making supervision and monitoring by
management more effective; and enhance BAP's organizational structure by
standardizing the information flow and allowing management to reach more
prompt decisions (see Annex 2 for proposed outlines of terms of reference to
implement the improvement of the information system).
4.08      Organization of Rediscount Facility.  The cost of this component
would be about US$0.6 million.  The project would provide technical
assistance to BAP in establishing a second-tier rediscount facility, which
would enable other commercial banks to participate in medium- and long-term
lendings for agriculture using the financial resources available under this
project. Other commercial banks have not lent regularly for agriculture for
many years. Hence, this mechanism would allow an increase of the resources
available for financing investment in the sector. However, participation of



- 13 -
other commercial banks in agricultural lendings through the rediscount
facility would depend on: (a) BAP's increasing its lending rates to average
market rate; (b) the extent of the operating margins allowed; (c) the
required share of the participating bzLnk in the lendings; and (d) the
security to be provided for subloans.   The technical assistance provided by
the project to organize the rediscount facility in BAP would, therefore, need
to: (a) set out a program in which other banks' opinions on the above issues
should be taken into account in structuring the facility; (b) prepare all the
procedures related to rediscounting between BAP and the participating banks
and operation manuals of the rediscounting facility; and (c) train and
prepare staff to carry out the operations of the facility.  If a program for
the operation of a rediscount facility, which is satisfactory to the Bank, is
developed, then Bank funds could be used for lending through the facility.
4.09      Studies (Sugar Rehabilitation).  The project would provide supple-
mental funds, amounting to about US$0.3 million, for completion of a
feasibility study on rehabilitation of the Peruvian sugar industry. About
half of these funds would be required to cover local costs. The Bank has
already provided some funds under a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for
the aforementioned project, and the sugar cooperatives have provided the
counterpart funds from a loan which they received from BAP. The study is
presently being carried out by foreign consultants, and is expected to be
completed by the end of 1983. However, because of substantial cost increases
since the PPF approval, and the inability of the sugar cooperatives to
provide additional funding due to their severe economic and financial
difficulties, it is proposed that all the necessary supplemental funds, both
for the local and foreign components, would be provided through the project.
Since the feasibility study is managed by a joint commission which represents
the beneficiaries, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Labor,
BAP would sign a subsidiary agreement with Government by November 1983 to
ensure the repayment of the feasibility study cost. This component would
constitute a bridge loan until a Bank loan could be approved for sugar
rehabilitation, and if this loan were not forthcoming, the Government would
guarantee its repayment. Assurances on the above procedure were obtained in
negotiations.
Cost Estimates
4.10      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$239 million,
about 44% of which represents foreign exchange requirements. Costs have been
estimated at September 1982 prices and include allowances for domestic and
international inflation amounting to about 25% of the base cost.  Domestic
price escalation has been estimated at the same rate as the foreign price
escalation, assuming that any changes in domestic inflation would be fully
compensated in the exchange rate by corresponding devaluations of the local
currency (as has been the policy in thea recent past). The contingency for
international inflation is estimated at 8%, 8%, 7.5%, 7% and 6% per annum for
1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986, respectively. Project costs are summarized
below and details are presented in TabLes 14 and 15.

4.11      The proposed Bank loan of US$130 million equivalent would finance
about 54% of the total project cost. This would cover the full foreign
exchange cost and 17% of local currency expenditures as well as the
capitalized front-end fee. Beneficiaries would provide the equivalent of
US$13.7 million, or 5.7% of total project cost; this is an estimated weighted
average based on the assumption that farmers would contribute 5% of their
investment cost when possessing less than 5 ha in the Costa, 10 ha in the
Sierra and 50 ha in the Selva; 10% with 5 to 50 ha in the Costa, 10-100 ha in
the Sierra and 50-100 ha in the Selva; and 20% with more than 50 ha in the
Costa, 100 ha in the Sierra and 150 ha in the Selva. Cooperative shares in
investment financing would be determined on the basis of cultivated area per
member, after which the same percentages, which are applicable to private
farmers, would apply. BAP would provide counterpart funds equivalent to
about US$38 million, or about 16% of tolal project cost.  The Government
would provide the remaining counterpart funds, about US$57.3 million, or 24%
of total cost, which would be necessary to finance the proposed expansion of
BAP's lending program. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
Government would agree to provide to BA' on a timely basis any funds required
to carry out the project. Moreover, the Government would guarantee the value
of BAP's equity in constant soles from the time that the loan will be signed,
while BAP would assume the responsibility to limit the size of its debt in
relation to its equity by a ratio of 5 to 1. The proposed financing plan is
presented in the following table:

1/  Government would also reimburse BAP for the difference between commerical and subsidized lendings.
April 6, 1983



- 17 -
4.12      The proposed loan would be made to BAP at the Bank's standard
terms. The Government would guarantee the loan. It would also assume the
foreign exchange risk, and BAP and the Government would, by December 31,
1983, make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, for this purpose.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
Procurement
4.13      Procurement of investment works, material and equipment by
sub-borrowers would be through normal commercial channels and directly from
suppliers, as it would not be practicable to arrange for bulk procurement and
international competitive bidding (ICB), considering the number of
sub-borrowers and the wide range of items to be financed under the project.
An adequate selection of farm machinery and other agricultural equipment is
available through local and international suppliers, and servicing and supply
of spare parts is satisfactory. For farm machinery and equipment, BAP would
require its borrowers, wherever feasible, to obtain quotations from at least
three sources of supply. BAP would make available to sub-borrowers a catalog
of suppliers of agro-industrial machinery, including those from Bank member
countries as well as their agents or their representatives in Peru.
4.14      Procurement of equipment for carrying out the improvement of the
information system, which would be determined by a feasiblity study, would be
implemented under ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines for procurement.
Procurement of consultants to carry out assignments established; in the
training component, improvement of the information system, and organization
of the rediscount facility, would be implemented in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the
"Guidelines for the use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency", published by the Bank in 1981. Assurances
on the points mentioned in this and the preceding paragraph were obtained
during negotiations.
Disbursements
4.15      The investment period would extend over four years and Bank
disbursements are expected to run about four years. The disbursement profile
for the project was determined mainly onI the basis of BAP's experience with
recent credit projects financed by IDB, as well as by evaluation of BAP's
credit demand and its management capacity to carry out the scheduled
investment program. Similar projects in Latin America indicate a range of
between three and seven years for their disbursement.  Since BAP's management
capacity is known, the proposed disbursement profile is considered to be
realistic. Disbursements from the loan would be made against:
(a) 45% of amounts disbursed to individual farmers and
cooperatives for irrigation infrastructure, land improvement,
construction, perennial crops and livestock;
(b) 50% of amounts disbursed for short-term capital subject to a
predetermined limit that would be set each year;
(c) 90% of foreign expenditures for machinery, equipment and
vehicles procured under the project subloans;



- 18 -
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported machinery
and equipment, and 80% of local expenditures for imports
procured locally for improvement of the information system in
BAP; and
(e) 100% of total expenditures of the studies program agreed with
the Bank.
Disbursements would be made against certified statements of expenditures for
(a) and (b).  Relevant documentation would not be submitted to the Bank, but
would be retained by the borrower and be made available for review by Bank
project supervision missions. All other disbursements would be fully
documented. A schedule of estimated Bankc disbursements is given in Table 16.
V. ORGANIZATION AkND MANAGEMENT
Management
5.01      BAP would implement the project using its normal procedures.  BAP
would appoint a project coordinator who would serve as the liaison between
BAP and the Bank and would be responsible for the collection and analysis of
results of subprojects; for supervision of the application of the specific
technical guidelines agreed with the Bank in regard to implementation of the
project; and for submitting quarterly reports to BAP's management and the
Bank, prepared according to guidelines mutually agreed with the Bank. The
project coordinator's position would be maintained throughout project
implementation, and persons appointed to the position should have experience
and qualifications acceptable to the Bank. Assurances on this were obtained
at negotiations.
5.02      BAP's branch offices, agencies and field offices have adequate
office staff for operations being carried out at present. But with
implementation of the proposed project which would expand the volume of
operations in BAP, there is a need to ensure that field staff are used more
efficiently in project formulation and subloan appraisal. The main need is
to expedite processing of medium- and long-term loans which presently takes
several months to prepare. BAP is aware of the need to simplify its
procedures in order to speed up loan processing time. A monitoring program
(para 5.12) would be carried out in BAP by DPES. Investments for
exploitation or groundwater resources through drilling new wells or equipping
existing wells, investments in irrigation and drainage works, and financing
of water users' associations wouid require the Ministry of Agriculture's
approval.
Planning and Programming
5.03     Planning for short-, medium- and long-term development credit is
done in BAP by DPES in accordance with national priorities and determined on
the basis of: (a) response to questionnaires from DPES to branch offices;
and (b) coordination with the MA regardi'ng investment funds needed for new



- 19 -
projects.  In regard to short-term financing, DPES also takes into
consideration: (a) the area of specified annual crops financed in previous
years (cotton, rice, wheat, potatoes, maize/sorghum); (b) availability of
funds for short-term lending; and (c) analysis of variable costs per hectare
of crops and livestock, which determines the short-term credit needs per crop
or per unit of livestock. Based on physical lending targets assembled by
DPES, the Office of Finance elaborates the financial consequences for BAP's
annual plan. BAP's overall planning andl programming capacity, strengthened
by training and improvements of the management information system, would b
considered adequate to implement the proposed lending program. For the
proposed project, BAP would prepare each year during project execution: (a)
an annual investment program and mediuim-term plan, including funds needed for
BAP's updated annual lending, with follow-up reports for comparisons; and (b)
an estimate of short- and long-term crelit requirements by agricultural
activities throughout the country.  BAP's updated annual lending, including
its funding program and medium-term plan, would be reviewed by MA and Finance
each year, and the proposed program wit]h comments of the ministries would be
submitted to the Bank for review by September 30 of each year.  The final
program, approved by the Ministry of Finance, would be submitted to the Bank
no later than December 31 of each year. Assurances on the above were
obtained at negotiations.
Lending Terms
5.04      The recent changes in the Goviernment's interest rate policy for the
agricultural sector already decided upon (para 2.05) will have a profound
effect on BAP and its borrowers mainly because most of BAP's lendings would
be closer to market rates. BAP's lending rates would be reviewed by BAP's
management at biannual intervals and adjustment of the rates would be carried
out within three month from the date of the last review to reflect changes in
market rates. For the purpose of reviewing its lending rates BAP will use a
reference rate which would represent an average of short- and medium-/long-
term effective lending rates of the largest commercial banks of Peru,
weighted by the proportion of short- and medium-/long term lending balances
in BAP. BAP would adjust its weighted interest rates whenever the reference
rate would change by more than three percentage points or five percent,
whichever is larger. A decline in BAP's average lending rate, excluding the
subsidized rates, by more than 10% from the rate of inflation in Peru which
was not remedied in three months would give the Bank the right to suspend or
cancel the loan. Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.
Sublending Policies and Procedures
5.05      The lending period of subloans that would range between three and
15 years and the grace period of up to four years would be determined on the
basis of cash flow projections of beneficiaries. When a subloan to an
individual sub-borrower resulted in the beneficiary holding an outstanding
credit balance exceeding US$200,000 equivalent, or to a cooperative holding
outstanding credit exceeding US$1 million, Bank approval prior to the new



- 20 -
lending would be required. Complementary short-term credit for working
capital would be provided within the project on a medium- and long-term
basis, if analysis of the beneficiary cash flow indicated such need, or on
the basis of a representative model, if the subloans were relatively small.
Assurances for the above were obtained alt negotiations.
5.06      Criteria for Incremental Short--Term Lending.  To determine
incrementality, short-term loans eligible for financing under the Bank loan
would be those made to farmers who: (a) are receiving short-term credit for
the first time; (b) would make capital investments financed by medium- and
long-term lendings; or (c) would increase their demand for short-term capital
due to changes of cropping pattern or production technology. Ilowever,
complying with the above criteria would be possible only after carrying out
the improvement of the information systetm in BAP. From the initiation of the
loan, however, incrementality would also be determined by the planned
increase in real terms of short-term lending on the basis of the annual
lending program as compared with last yeiars' short-term lending. Bank funds
would be disbursed up to an annual ceiling agreed upon between the Bank and
BAP by December 31 of each year. In the event that, upon review of the
results of BAP's actual short-term lending during the previous year, the Bank
determines that the projected targets were not achieved, the ceiling for the
disbursement for short-term operations would be reduced until the shortfall
is made up. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
5.07      Subloan Appraisal and Supervision.  Overall quality of subloan
appraisal in BAP is reasonable, and BAP is taking steps through its training
program to further improve the work. BAP field officers, would assist
sub-borrowers, when necessary, to preparie farm development plans which would
become part of subloan applications. Each subloan, considered by BAP, would
be appraised in accordance with guidelines satisfactory to the Bank that is
based on: (a) detailed development plans, including farm budget, an income
and operating expense statement, and a financial cash flow; or (b) a
financial cash flow and representative models whenever the size of such
subloan or similarity to other subloan investment projects so justifies.
Assurances for the above were obtained at negotiations.
5.08      Financial and Economic Criteria.  In appraising subprojects, BAP
would ensure that: (a) the detailed development plans and the representative
models, are technically feasible, financially viable and economically
justified for their incremental production; and (b) enterprises should have a
satisfactory management and credit standing. Creditworthiness would be
contingent on their not having any arrears on outstanding loans. For
cooperatives, an analysis of their financial statement would also be required
to determine creditworthiness. The financial rate of return of approved
subloans based on development plan or the representative model, should be
equal to at least the opportunity cost of capital. Assurances for the above
were obtained at negotiations.



- 21 -
5.09      Reporting Requirements.  Quarterly progress reports summarizing
project performance, and subloan disbursements by categories (beneficiaries,
principal activities, and subloan size) would be submitted to the Bank no
later than 60 days after the end of each quarter. Detailed reports, which
would include subproject costs, subloan commitments and disbursements by
categories, lending by activities and regions, type and number of
beneficiaries, and sub-borrowers' contributions, would be prepared annually
and submitted to the Bank no later than four months after the end of each
year. BAP would also send to the Bank annually: (a) a summary of its loan
portfolio showing loans to be collected and those collected and uncollected;
(b) total loans rescheduled; (c) a sumtary statement of changes in its own
staffing on an overall and regional basis; (d) a statement on the progress of
its training programs; and (e) a summary statement of project impact prepared
by DPES. Within 12 months of the closing date of the Bank loan, BAP would
submit a Project Completion Report prepared in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Suitable assurances were obtained at negotiations on the above.
Accounts and Auditing
5.10      BAP would maintain adequate records to reflect, in accordance with
generally accepted principles of accounting, its operations and financial
condition, its credit operations, the cost of consulting services and the
training program under the project. Auditing arrangements, which are
satisfactory for the ongoing project, would be that: (a) the annual accounts
of BAP would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, whose
reports would be of such scope and in such detail as to include in their
comments: (i) the accuracy of statements of expenditures submitted to the
Bark for reimbursement; (ii) the compliance with the criteria set for
incremental short-term sublending (para 5.06); and (iii) such other
information as the Bank may reasonably request; and (b) copies of BAP's
audited accounts and the auditors' reports (including the long form report or
a management letter) would be submitted to the Bank within six months of each
financial year end. Assurances that accounting and auditing would be carried
out as outlined above were obtained during negotiations.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.11      The results of the agricultural lending would be monitored by BAP,
through the DPES. Presently the monitoring system is inadequate as stated in
the Bank Completion Report of the previous credit project to BAP (para
3.04). DPES, however, for the purpose of this project, would design a
recording system which would show: (a) the value of assets and liabilities
of sub-borrowers as well as farm operations (physical and financial) before
development; (b) a comparison between expected and actual achievements using
a system of main indicators such as yields, calving rates, production
and income; (c) the number, nature, and size of loans made and their phasing
or timing; (d) the source of the sub-borrowers' investment funds; (e) changes
(on designated reporting dates) in the number of physical assets; (f) level
and sources of beneficiaries income; and (g) expenses and production costs,
showing details of important items. A careful stratified sample of
subprojects would be selected for monitoring. This information would be made
available for inspection by Bank supervision missions, and summaries and
analysis of the information would be included in the annual progress
reports. Assurances for the above were obtained at negotiations.

VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
Illustrative Investment Plans
6.01      Subloans to individual farmers, farmer groups and cooperatives
would be made for a wide range of activit.ies for crops and livestock under
varied ecological conditions throughout the country. Consequently, subloan
amounts would vary considerably by benefiLciary categories and principal
activities. Based on BAP's past experience, 10 investment plans (farm
models) have been selected to demonstrate the development effects of
investment programs, each showing the investment mix, development concept,
technical change, and financial and economic results. The following table
summarizes the financial and economic results of each investment plan.

6.02      The underlined assumptions in estimating the economic results from
the project are as follows:  (a) agricultural production figures are derived
from investment of the medium- and long-term loans over four years; (b)
production costs are priced at local 1982 constant market prices; (c)
economic prices for cotton, rice, grain feeds and oranges are derived from
estimates of border prices and Bank projections, adjusted to farmgate level,
while prevailing farmgate prices were used for other products (non-tradables)
(Table 17); all project works, equipment, and physical contingencies are
included in investment costs; (d) social expenses (such as social security)
of 46.2% were assumed only for hired labor; and (e) the life of the project
is assumed to be 30 years.
Project Benefits
6.03 Based on the illustrative farm model analysis, the incremental volume
of production resulted from the project at full development is expected to be
quite substantial (Table 18). The estimated increases by key crops are
summarized in the table below:
Comparison of Benefits With and Without Project
Without              With
Volume of Production (tons)            Project              Project
Rice                                   73,000              108,000
Potatoes                               71,000              86,000
Beans and Soybeans                        800                3,200
Sorghum                                29,000              46,000
Fruit and Vegetables                  142,000             238,000
Milk (million of liters)                    22                  78
Beef (liveweight)                       3,200               14,000
Mutton (liveweight)                        180                 380
Wool                                        80                 150
Consequently, the gross value of production is expected to rise from about
S/. 79 billion per year (about US$106 million) to about S/. 131 billion per
year at full development in the tenth year (about US$175 million) (Table 19);
costs of production are expected to rise from about S/. 57 billion (about
US$76 million) to about S!. 83 billion (about US$111 million) per annum at
full development (Table 20); and consequently, the net value of production is
expected to increase from about S/. 22.8 billion (about US$30 million), to
about SI. 48 billion in the tenth year (about US$64 million) (Table 21). The
incremental value of production is expected to reach about S/. 25.1 billion
per annum (about US$33 million) in the e:Leventh year (Table 22).
6.04      About 21,000 families would benefit directly from the project
medium- and long-term lending program. 'Income per family, which ranged
between S/. 255 thousand and 3,825 thousand (US$340-US$5,100) per family
before project, is expected to increase to a range between S/. 517 thousand
and 4,687 thousand (US$490-US$6,250) at full development. In addition, many
more farmers would benefit from expanding short-term lending, which would



- 25 -
allow new farmers to participate.  The direct economic benefits from the
project realized by the beneficiary farmers would come from: (a) increased
income compared to without project situation; (b) increased employment and
job security as work on the farm would absorb about 10.7 million mandays per
annum at full development compared to about 5.4 million mandays per annum
without the project (Table 23).
6.05      The project would have a substantial impact on institution building
by: (a) strengthening BAP's information system, and planning and programming
capabilities; (b) increasing agricultural lending capabilities by involving
other commercial banks through a rediscount facility; and (c) by training BAP
personnel to improve their lending efficiency.
6.06      From a national point of view, the project would yield the
following benefits: (a) it would support the Government's rural development
policies because it would raise the income of the rural poor; (b) it would
contribute toward improvement of the balance of payment by about US$30
million per annum, as a result of increasing production of import
substitution crops, such as rice and feied grains, as well as increasing
foreign exchange revenues from export of cotton; (c) it would help decrease
income disparities between rural and urban areas, thereby reducing rural
urban migration; (d) it would increase activities of commerce and banking as
more produce and crops would be marketed; and (e) it would create a more
efficient allocation of resources in the agricultural sector that would stem
from adoption of an interest rate policy that is adjusted to market rates
rather than heavily subsidized rates.
Marketing and Storage
6.07      Given that agricultural production in Peru tends to lag behind
domestic demand, the incremental production generated by the project should
have no difficulty in finding internal markets. There is a risk that some
production surpluses would be created, but it is limited to good years and
involves only few crops such as potatoes, of which some can be exported.
Cotton and wool, which are traditional iexport crops, should find satisfactory
markets abroad and expanding demands domestically.
6.08      In the Sierra and Selva, marketing channels are poorly developed,
except near major cities. The more prosperous coastal areas, on the other
hand, have sufficient collection centers and storage facilities. These
factors were taken into consideration in the project design and the
calculations of project benefits.
Project Risks
6.09      The project is subject to a certain degree of risk because it
depends on the farmers' reaction to the new Government agricultural credit
policy, which could result in their borrowing much less than expected. The
success of the project also depends on Government policies both in regard to
input and output prices. However, farm models of this project show that
farmers could bear the cost of the interest rate and prevailing market prices
quite adequately. Though prices have been largely liberalized from
regulation, any reversal of the Government policy is likely to affect the



- 26 -
project adversely. An equally important risk is the political climate
which is reflected mainly in the ability of the Government of Peru to abide
by its decision to carry out the new agricultural credit policy.
6.10      Though BAP is a reasonably efficient and mature institution, the
success of the project also depends on training of BAP's staff which
presently lacks sufficient financial and economic expertise. Analysis and
evaluation of subprojects at the branch and agency levels would need to be
improved to meet Bank requirements. Despite the risks mentioned above, the
project has a high probability to succeed because the Government and BAP are
presently fully committed to carry out the new credit policy.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that:
(a) by March 31, 1984 BAP would initiate its training program and
hire consultants with qualifications and terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank (para 4.06);
(b) by November 1983 BAP would sign a subsidiary agreement with
the Government to transfer US$300,000 to a Government
commission which manages a study of rehabilitation of the
sugar industry, and the Government would guarantee repayment
of the above sum, including interest, to BAP (para 4.09);
(c) Government would agree to provide to BAP on a timely basis any
funds required to carry out the project. The Government would
also guarantee the value of BAP's equity in real term and BAP
would limit its debt in relation to equity by a ratio of 5 to
I (para 4.11);
(d) by December 31, 1983, BAP and the Government would enter into
agreement satisfactory to the Bank under which the Government
would assume the foreign exchange risk (para 4.12).
(e) procurement procedures would be followed as outlined in
paragraphs 4.13 and 4.14;
(f) the project coordinator position in BAP would be maintained
throughout project implementation and persons appointed by BAP
to the position of project coordinator should have experience
and qualifications acceptable to the Bank (para 5.01);
(g) BAP would submit to the Bank by September 30 each year its
proposed lending program, including its funding, and comments
of the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance for review.
Final lending program would be submitted to the Bank by
December 31 of each year (para 5.03);



- 27 -
(h) BAP's lending terms and. their adjustment under the project
would be as set out in paragraphs 5.04 and 5.05;
(i) incremental short-term capital lending entitled to
disbursement under the project would be in accordance with the
criteria set out in paragraph 5.06;
(j) BAP's procedures in appraisal of subloan applications and its
financial and economic criteria would be as outlined in
paragraphs 5.07 and 5.08;
(k) BAP's reporting requirements to the Bank would be as outlined
in paragraph 5.09;
(1) BAP's accounting and auditing arrangements would be as
outlined in paragraph 5.10; and
(m)  BAP's monitoring and evaluation procedures would be as set out
in paragraph 5.11.
7.02      With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$130 million, of which about US$324,000 is a
capitalized front-end fee.

Technical Assistance and Training
Background
1.        BAP has an impressive contingent of technical agricultural staff
but there exists a shortage of economists and financial analysts as reflected
by its staffing under major categories:

Source: BAP, Office of Planning and Economic Studies, as of December 31,
1980.
Salary levels, although below those of comparable positions in other
Bank-supported projects (Agricultural Research and Extension and Alto Mayo),
are in line with those of MA. Provision of vehicles, operating expenses and
field allowances is satisfactory and ensures staff mobility. Time elapsed
between filing and approval of medium/long-term applications ranges between
one and three months, about two weeks for short-term loans. Subsequent to
subloan approval and disbursement, the technical staff makes follow-up visits
and submits brief reports.
Proposed 1983 Training Program
2.        To update and reinforce the technical competence, BAP's Office of
Planning and Economic Studies has initiated a training program for 1983 which
covers the following areas:



- 53 -
ANNEX I
Page 2 of 4
Topics                                     Participants
Accounting policies, procedures                Accounting, bookkeeping, admin-
istrative staff
Lending policies, procedures                    Mid-level managers, technical
staff of branches, sub-branches
BAP's organization, policies,                  Potential clients, staff of
functions, services                            other agencies
Systems of classifying, storing                Administrative and technical
documents and information                      staff
Specialized training for handling              Selected staff
mechanized accounting and
computerized information systems
3.        Planning and programming of various training activities has been
elaborated with remarkable detail, including designation of resource persons,
participants, duration, location and budgets. Implementation has however
been curtailed by budgetary and other constraints. As of August 16, 1982,
for example, only 18% of the training program budget was utilized, oriented
primarily to training in accounting and banking techniques. Training for
agricultural project formulation and training for subloan appraisal and
supervision had not yet materialized. Recognizing the shortfall in human and
financial resources and the anticipated need of qualified staff commensurate
with future lending programs, BAP has requested financing a technical
assistance component, including consultant services to strengthen its
recently initiated training activities. Further details supporting this
request are in Table 1.
4.        The consultant would constitute a team of one expatriate training
expert (team leader) and one assistant training expert to be recruited
locally. The experts would serve full time during the first 12 months until
the training program is fully operatiLonal and nine months each during the
second and third year.
Responsibilities of the Consultant
5.        Under TOR to be agreed with BAP during negotiations, the consultant
would, in close cooperation with BAP's Office of Planning and Economic
studies, inter alia:
- inventory and assess the qualifications of existing staff
responsible for: (a) agricultural project formulation and
subloan appraisal/supervision, (b) accounting and banking
techniques, and (c) operation and management of agricultural
credit;



- 54 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 4
- review and evaluate ongoing training program in light of
anticipated man-power requirements;
- prepare specific proposals for strengthening the ongoing
training program;
- study and help improve methods and procedures of subloan
appraisal, processing, supervision and recovery; and
-  assist in defining responsibilities and developing a system for
effective mutual support between technical and credit staff of
INIPA and BAP.
Formulation, Implementation and Evaluation of Agreed Program
6.        After reaching agreement with BAP and the Bank on the training
needs and a program to meet these needs, the consultant shall: (a) develop
detailed training programs, procedures and courses; (b) jointly with their
BAP counterparts, prepare training manuals and implement the courses; (c)
train counterparts and select staff to be further trained locally and/or
abroad as instructors to take over and continue all training operations in
BAP after the consultant's departure; and (d) design an evaluation system
which would enable BAP to assess the resuilts of training.
Time Schedule for Consulting Services and Reports
7.        The consultants shall submit the following reports within the time
limits specified:
(a) draft proposal (20 copies) for review by BAP senior management
and IBRD--within two months of the starting date;
(b) final proposals (20 copies)--within one month af'ter receiving
comments on the draft; and
(c)  semi-annual progress reports--during implementation of the
program, including a terminal report at the end of the three
year program.
The reports mentioned in (a) and (b) shall contain concise summaries of the
body of the report.
Data, Local Services and Facilities to be Provided by the Government
8.        BAP would provide the experts with:  (a) any available information
that may be reasonably required for the accomplishment of their work,
including reports prepared by other agencies, and (b) office space, clerical
assistance and transport. It would also provide liaison with such agencies
as considered necessary and assign, full time, an appropriate number of
counterparts to work with the experts for training and liaison. The experts

ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 4
would involve their counterparts in all phases of the training project,
including data collection, assessment of training needs, design of suitable
programs and training materials, and, finally, in implementation and
evaluation of the courses. The counterparts should, on completion of their
training, including any instruction abroad deemed necessary, be assigned as
Training Officers within BAP.

SIXTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
BAP Technical Assistance Study
Draft Terms of Reference
Objective
1.        The proposed study would identify the data processing and related
equipment needs of BAP, the manpower resources and the need for technical
training. Furthermore it would identify key organizational changes necessary to
develop, accelerate and streamline the flow of comprehensive information to
management. Within the objectives of the study, the following areas would be
included:
(a) analysis and evaluation of the systems and procedures for managing
the loan portfolios, with emphasis on debt collections and
management information in general;
(b) analysis and evaluation of the systems and procedures for
determining planning and programming and the management thereof;
(c) analysis and evaluation of all other branch and head office
activities, reports and files to be created and maintained, and
their respective locations;
(d) determination of the information flow between branches and the head
office and the feasibility of developing regional computer centers
compared to the expansion and upgrading of central facilities;
(e) determination of the feasibility of converting current operations
from a batch environment to on-line environment, including the
related cost factors;
(f) study of the technical feasibility, including telecommunications
network, lines to be used, speeds, modems, and other facilities
available showing the costs respectively;
(g) analysis of the timing of information necessary to allow decision
making and determine the type of telecommunication and other systems
needed; and
(h) determination of technical parameters necessary to complete the
plan.

2.        The analysis and determination of the system, procedures, and equipment
should not be biased in favor of any particular language or acquisition of a
particular package and equipment. Furthermore, the evaluation should result in an
overall outline of the management information system and the computer facilities
required. It should indicate the estimated cost involved in respect of each item
and an assessment as to the duration of the implementation period, further studies
required, and an evaluation of manpower and training needs.
Experience Required
3.        A team of consultants, preferably from a reputable firm with
international experience in development banking and systems development, would be
sought. Invitations would be solicited from known firms.
Duration
4.        Invitations should be reviewed and a contract awarded in year 1 of the
project. A total of about 20 man-months of consultant time over a three to six
month period would be required to complete the task.
Administration
5.        The team would report its findings directly to the General Manager of
BAP.
