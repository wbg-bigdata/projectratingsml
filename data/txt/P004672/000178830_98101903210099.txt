KINGDOM OF THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDTUCATION PROJECT
SUMkARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The first loan made by the Bank to assist education in Thailand
was for US$6 million in 1966 (471-TH) and designed to expand and improve
technical and agricultural education at secondary level; the project will
be completed satisfactorily in mid-1973. The proposed second education
project would concentrate entirely on higher agricultural education.
ii.       The Government approved the Third National Economic and Social
Development Plan (1972-76) in September, 1971. This emphasizes the develop-
ment of agriculture, aiming at growth, diversification and productivity im-
provement in the sector. Success will depend heavily on the expansion of in-
tensive agriculture and modernized production and distribution methods.
These will require a substantially greater number of university-trained
personnel in agriculture and related fields.
iii.      Higher agricultural education has not responded adequately to
labor market requirements and has expanded in an unsystematic way. The
quality is low; there exist shortages of experienced university staff and
agricultural school teachers. It is necessary to expand and improve agri-
cultural education at university level with due attention to the needs of
the economy.
iv.       The proposed project would asslst in improving and expanding
university training and research in agriculture and related fields at
Kasetsart University. The project would finance the construction and
equipment of 4,165 places in teaching and research. To assist in curri-
culum development, staff training, administration and project implementa-
tion, 36-man-years of technical assistance would be included in the
project. In addition, 6 man-years of technical assistance would be pro-
vided for a study of veterinary education and a study of agricultural
education, research and extension.
v.        Kasetsart University, located in a suburb of Bangkok, has in-
adequate facilities for field work; it is overcrowded and cannot expand
at its present site. Enrollment expansion and quality improvement require
the addition of a new campus located in a rural environment. A suitable
site for the new campus has been obtained at Kamphaengsaen, 80 km from
Bangkok.
vi.       There would be a sufficient number of qualified students for entry
to the University. Qualified teaching staff now in service, reinforced by
additional staff provided under the fellowship program of the proposed proj-
ect, would be adequate.



- ii -
vii.      A project unit, to >e established by Kasetsart University, would
be responsible for the implementation of all aspects of the project with the
exception of the agricultural and veterinary education studies which would be
organized and administered by the Ministry of Agriculture. A master plan for
the physical development of the university would be prepared by a campus
planning consultant and the design and construction of building works within
the framework of this plan would be handled by consultant architects. Accom-
modation schedules and furniture and equipment costs are considered suitable
bases for the planning of physical facilities.
viii.     Including technical assistance, the project would be implemented in
about six years; construction and equipment procurement would be completed
in about four years. Contracts for civil works and for the procurement of
furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. It is expected
that all civil works contracts would be awarded to local firms. Local manu-
facturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of preference
equivalent to the existing customs duties applicable to competing imports
or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever is the lower.
ix.       The total project cost is estimated at US$28.3 million equivalent.
The proposed loan would meet the foreign exchange component of US$14.5 million
and also the local currency portion of the ex-factory cost of furniture and
equipment likely to be procured locally, which amount is estimated at
US$0.9 million equivalent.
x.        The project is suitable as a basis for a Bank loan of US$15.4
million to the Kingdom of Thailand for a period of 30 years including a grace
period of 10 years.



I. INTRODUCTION
The Request
1.01      The first Bank education loan to Thailand, made in 1966 (471-TH),
provided US$6 million for equipment to expand 14 trades and industries
schools, 10 agricultural schools and 2 industrial and agricultural instructor
training institutions. The project will be satisfactorily completed in mid-
1973.
1.02      Recent Bank economic missions have emphasized the lack of qualified
manpower at various levels and the need for change in education and training.
In November, 1968, the Thai Government requested Bank financial assistance
to develop Kasetsart University (K.U.). Reconnaissance missions in November,
1968 and April, 1969, discussed the university's proposals for expansion.
These mainly concerned the already crowded Bangkhen campus in suburban Bangkok
but included gradual development of a rural campus at Kamphaengsaen, 80 km
from Bangkok. The Bank pressed for major development at the latter site
so as to provide adequate facilities for field work. A joint FAO/Bank project
preparation mission visited Thailand in May/June, 1969. However, project
preparation could not be completed because of differences between the Bank
and K.U. regarding the rate of development of the Kamphaengsaen campus. In
December, 1969, an understanding with K.U. was reached on the simultaneous
and compatible development of the two campuses. Project preparation was com-
pleted in April, 1970, and an appraisal mission comprising Messrs. K. Bahr
(economist), D. Lewis (architect), C. Vidalon (agricultural education) and
consultants I. Cunningham (veterinary education) and G. McClymont (agricultural
education) visited Thailand in September-October, 1970. The project data were
reviewed subsequently by Messrs. S. J. C. Burt (educator) and K. Bahr (economist
who visited Bangkok in December 1971.
1.03      The proposed project relates only to Kasetsart University but, in
determining the size and content of the project, the present situation and
foreseen development of the agricultural faculties of the Universities of
Khonkaen, Chiengmai and Songkla, the veterinary faculty at Chulalongkorn
University (Bangkok) and other relevant faculties have been taken into
account. The proposed project includes only those areas of education and
research in which K.U. possesses advantages over other Thai universities.
1.04      The project would assist the expansion and improvement of the
agriculture faculty, the faculties of forestry, fisheries, education,
veterinary science and the departments of agricultural engineering and agri-
cultural economics; it would also provide necessary supporting facilities in
the faculties of science and arts, engineering, and economics and business
administration. The Kamphaengsaen campus would be developed into a viable
unit to provide the production oriented programs and the courses related to
agricultural practice for the entire university. There would be some expan-
sion at Bangkhen.



-2-
1.05      The proposed project would comprise:
(i) site development, construction, furniture and equipment
for teaching and research laboratories at Bangkhen and
Kamphaengsaen; lecture rooms at Kamphaengsaen; boarding
facilities, staff housing, a primary school and staff and
student communal facilities at Kamphaengsaen; ancillary
premises, such as libraries, central maintenance and
storage rooms, administrative offices at both campuses;
(ii)  technical assistance for curriculum development, university
management and project unit support; studies of veterinary
education and agricultural education, research and extension;
and overseas fellowships for staff development.
The estimated total project cost would be US$28.3 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$14.5 million.
Social and Economic Background
1.06      Preliminary results of the 1970 population census indicate that
the population was approximately 36.2 million by mid-1970, and had increased
by 3.1% p.a. since the 1960 census count. About 70% of the population is
literate. Some 80% of the population live in rural areas. 45% of the
population is below 15 years of age. Of over 16 million labor force, 12.8
million persons are engaged in agriculture. Of the 3.5 million wage earners,
34% are employed in government services. Rural underemployment is wide-
spread, particularly during the dry season.
1.07      Agriculture is the leading sector of the economy, accounting for
about 30% of GDP and 78% of all employed persons in 1970. Agricultural
commodities account for about 70% of merchandise exports; rice alone
accounts for 17%. The economy has grown at the rate of 9% p.a. in 1966-69;
agricultural production increased by 5.6% p.a. during 1966-70. In 1971
per capita GNP reached US$183 (in current prices).
1.08      The Third Five-Year Development Plan (1972-76), was approved by
the Cabinet in September, 1971. Its major objective is to sustain GDP
growth of 7% p.a. while maintaining monetary and financial stability. The
Plan gives high priority to the agricultural sector, aiming at increased
productivity and greater diversification.

II. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
2.01      Education in Thailand is marked by wide discrepancies of opportun-
ities between rural and urban areas, uncoordinated planning, divided admin-
istrative responsibility and partly inappropriate curricula.
Structure, Organization, Administration
2.02      The system of education comprises a 7-year elementary (4 years
lower and 3 years upper) and a 5-year secondary program (3 years lower and
2 years upper level) (Chart 1). Compulsory education, originally for the
first 4 years, is being extended gradually through the seventh grade. Higher
education consists of two-year diploma level colleges and 4-year degree level
universities, including graduate programs in various fields (Annex 2 and
Chart 2). At the secondary level private schools play an important role
with 48% of total enrollment in 1970.
2.03      The effectiveness of the Ministry of Education is limited by a
lack of coordination among its departments and by the fact that the Ministry
of Interior is responsible for primary schools and the Prime Minister's
Office for universities.
2.04      Educational planning is not well developed and its impact on
education policy has so far been small. The National Economic Development
Board (NEDB), the government planning agency, assesses the manpower
requirements which serve as guidelines for educational development. Its
Executive Committee approves the education plan along with the Executive
Committee of the National Education Council (NEC). These two bodies and the
Ministry of Education established joint planning procedures in preparing
the Third Plan's education policy. This policy has a dual emphasis:
(i) to expand enrollment to meet the educational needs of the rapidly
increasing school-age population, and (ii) to improve the quality of
education in order to produce the qualified manpower needed by the devel-
oping economy.
2.05      Thailand has eight universities, the National Institute for Devel-
opment Administration and six diploma-level institutions. Six of the uni-
versities are located in the Bangkok area. In 1969 some 44,700 students
were enrolled: 39% in social sciences, 16% in education, 15% in natural
sciences and engineering, 14% in medicine and 8% in agriculture, forestry,
fisheries and veterinary science (Annexes 3 and 4). Programs and curricula
have to be approved by NEC. The annual budgets are submitted separately
by each university to the Budget Bureau (under the Office of the Prime
Minister). Within the universities the individual faculties or departments
have a high degree of autonomy and the academic and administrative power
of the deans is very broad. Appointments, promotions and salaries are
determined by the Civil Service Commission. This division of responsibi-
lities for current operations and university development seriously limits
academic and administrative performance. Recently, the Government has
taken steps to rationalize procedures.



- 4 -
2.06      Students are admitted to university through a national entrance
examination administered by NEC. At the undergraduate level, Diploma
(2-3 years) and Bachelor degree (4-years) courses are offered. At the
graduate level, Higher Certificate (1-year) and Masters (2-vear) courses
are given. Graduates of teachers' colleges and technical institutes can
enter universities and earn a Bachelor's degree in a 2-vear course. In
1967, out of 1,800 university teaching staff, 167 held Doctorates, 643
Master's degrees and 990 Bachelor's degrees.
Agricultural Education
2.07      Agriculture is part of the curriculum of some lower secondary
schools (grades 8-10). There are 26 vocational agricultural schools of
which 23 offer a three-year certificate course (grades 11-13) and three
provide a 2-year diploma course (grades 14-15) to certificate holders. In
addition, there is one agricultural teacher training college at diploma
level and two agricultural schools offering a 3-year course for young farm-
ers. Enrollment in vocational agricultural schools reached 7,770 in 1970.
2.08      Three universities (Kasetsart, Khonkaen and Chiengmai) have
agriculture and related faculties, with 3,200 students in 1969-1970, produc-
ing some 400 graduates in agriculture, agricultural engineering, agricultural
economics and agricultural education, 100 graduates in forestry, 50 in fish-
eries and 30 in veterinary science in 1969.
2.09      Graduates from all levels of agricultural education primarily
seek government employment although the private sector is taking an increas-
ing number. About 40% of university graduates are employed in the Ministry
of Agriculture, 35% in public and private industry, 15% in the Department
of Land Development in the Ministry of National Development and the remain-
der in universities.
2.10      Agricultural education institutions in general, including the
universities, suffer from lack of adequately trained staff, practical
orientation and experience with modern agricultural techniques.
Kasetsart University
2.11      Kasetsart University evolved from a Ministry of Agriculture
college established in 1939 at Bangkhen, then a rural area outside Bangkok.
In the course of time, suburban Bangkok has grown and now surrounds the
university site. Simultaneously, the university has added several facul-
ties and now comprises faculties of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, vet-
erinary science, engineering, arts and science, education, economics and
business administration. The University operates five experimental farms,
four forestry stations and two fishery stations located in various parts of
Thailand, all mainly used for research. The University also offers infor-
mation programs for extension personnel and farmers. Although the level



-5-
of agricultural education in Thailand is generally low, teaching and research
standards at K.U. are well above those of the agricultural faculties of the
universities of Chiengmai and Khonkaen. The number of subjects offered is
also greater. For many years K.U. will continue to be the country's main
source of graduates trained in all fields of agriculture, providing about
70% of these graduates.
2.12      To fulfill its training and research function properly and to
support the intended Government programs for modernization of agriculture,
K.U. is implementing a development plan (1968-74), formulated with assis-
tance from the Rockefeller Foundation. Under this plan, enrollment will
increase from 3,800 in 1970 to 5,800 in 1980; the number of teachers will
increase under a staff development plan and their qualification and experi-
ence level will improve substantially; research, teaching and training
facilities and equipment will also be improved. The development of a second
campus, at Kamphaengsaen, has begun. The proposed project is based on this
plan.
Educational Finance
2.13      The Budget Bureau (Prime Minister's office) allocates all public
funds in close cooperation with NEDB, which is responsible for coordinating
development expenditure. Until 1970 the universities and even indivi-
dual faculties negotiated directly with the Budget Bureau but, in the
future, university budgets are to be reviewed by NEC prior to the submission
to the Budget Bureau. Two major weaknesses of educational finance in Thailand
are: (i) the wide salary difference between government and private employ-
ment for equally qualified personnel (adversely affecting the numbers and
quality of secondary school teachers and especially university teachers);
and (ii) the lack of incentives for qualified teachers to seek employment
in schools and universities outside the Bangkok area. NEC has recently
completed proposals for a major reform of the university salary structure.
2.14      The following table summarizes educational finance for 1965 to
1970 (Annexes 5, 6 and 7) and indicates trends up to 1975:

Expenditure                  24          88      29.5%              250
2.15      Education expenditures (Annex 5), amounting to 4.9 billion baht
(US$236 million) in 1970, accounted for a slowly but steadily increasing
share of both GDP (3.2% in 1965; 3.6% in 1970) and Government expenditure
(16% in 1965; 15.8% in 1970). Both ratios are low by comparison with most
other developing countries. Education expenditures grew by 13% annually
compared to 10.2% annual growth of overall enrollment.
2.16      University expenditures are increasing at a faster rate than
total education expenditure.  In 1970 they represented 16% of government
education expenditure against 13% in 1965. The average annual expendi-
ture increase was 18% while enrollment increased by less than 4% p.a. The
share of capital expenditure rose from 31% in 1965 to an unusually high of
41% in 1969.
2.17      Expenditures on Kasetsart University (Annex 7) have increased by
30% p.a. since 1965, which is the second highest growth rate of all
universities in the country. Enrollment increased by almost 12% p.a. during
the same period. The extensive construction program underway since 1968
led to more than 45% average annual growth of capital expenditure raising
its relative share from 33% to 52%. This high percentage, typical for a
development period, would tend to fall considerably in the long run.
2.18      Education expenditure trends are not likely to change before 1975.
The increase in government education expenditure is not expected to exceed
14% annually. Kasetsart University expenditure growth will decrease to
about 24% annually, which would still be very high compared with other
educational institutions in Thailand.



- 7 -
2.19      About 15% of an estimated US$ 20 million in foreign education
assistance (both in money and in kind) during the period 1967-1970 went to
universities in support of regular teaching and training activities. In
addition, an estimated US$3 million of foreign assistance supported
university research programs. Kasetsart University has received assistance
for fellowships and research from various bilateral and multilateral
sources; in particular, from the Rockefeller Foundation, USAID, FAO and
Colombo Plan. At present, the Rockefeller Foundation is assisting teaching
and research activities with staff and funds. The Foundation also provides
university planning support.
III. NEED FOR THE PROJECT
General
3.01      To a large extent, Thailand's economic future depends on the intro-
duction of basic changes in agriculture, affecting production techniques and
patterns, product diversification, marketing, rural community development,
and private and public agricultural services. Major development objectives
of Thailand are to: (i) maintain and possibly improve the present food supply
for the fast-growing population; (ii) expand agricultural exports; and (iii)
increase employment opportunities for rural manpower who cannot be absorbed
by the non-agricultural sectors.
3.02      These objectives can only be met if agricultural output increases
faster than in recent years. Intensive production methods will have to be
used since the possibility for expansion of the cultivated area is limited.
The possibilities for both output and employment growth are good. In Thailand
only about 50 persons are employed per 100 acres, as compared to 70 in Taiwan
and 100 in Japan. At the same time the average acre yield (for all cereal
crops) in Taiwan and Japan was more than 2.5 times that of Thailand. Al-
though possibly as much as 20 percent of the cultivated land in Thailand is
under some form of water control only about 3 percent is under double cropping.
The integration of livestock production into farming systems is only beginning.
3.03      UJnder the Third Plan (1972-76) agricultural production, including
livestock, fisherv and forestry, is expected to be intensified and diversified
in specific areas suitable for export crops or domestic consumption. The use
of agricultural infrastructure will be increased and the forestry and fisheries
sectors will receive particular attention. At present, however, two serious
obstacles endanger these goals: the low level of modern agricultural knowledge
and the inadequacy of extension services.
Agricultural Education, Training and Research
3.04      Agricultural education and training at all levels are not of high
quality and contribute little to agricultural development.  The reasons for



this are lack of qualified teaching and research staff, obsolete curricula
and training methods not related to the need for intensive use of the land,
crop diversification and better utilization of rural labor resources. The
establishment of four regional agricultural research centers in recent
years should help meet Thailand's agricultural research needs but they need
to be further strengthened with suitably trained staff.
Agricultural Extension
3.05      Extension services are the responsibility of the Department
of Agricultural Extension, established in 1968 within the Ministry of
Agriculture. It operates through regional, provincial and local offices.
Few extension workers have a farm family background: their practical train-
ing and agricultural experience is insufficient. Moreover, they tend to be
administrators rather than extension workers since at least half of their
working time is spent on administration; they are under the supervision of
the provincial Governors who report to the Ministry of Interior and not to
the Ministry of Agriculture. The present operational ratio of extension
agents to farm families is as low as about 1:4,000.
Kasetsart University
3.06      To help overcome the shortcomings and achieve the goals described
above, it is necessary to strengthen agricultural training and research
at the university level. The country's three faculties of agriculture
(para. 2.08) and the related faculties (forestry, fisheries, veterinary
science, agricultural engineering, economics, and education) provide uni-
versity trained manpower for: (i) agricultural education and training at
lower levels; (ii) agricultural research institutions; and (iii) extension
and other public and private agricultural services. Although K.U. is the
best equipped and staffed higher agricultural education institution in the
country, further improvements are urgently needed. The academic qualifica-
tions of its teaching staff are relatively low; only 37% hold a Masters
degree and as few as 8% have a Doctorate (Annex 8). The majority of its
buildings are sub-standard, overcrowded and scattered. Its laboratories
and other academic facilities are largely insufficient, some being obsolete,
for effective teaching and research. The available land at the Bangkhen
campus is inadequate for teaching and research.
3.07      A new site in a rural environment for all production oriented teach-
ing and research programs of K.U. is required. In addition, improvement in
research facilities including equipment, improvements in curricula and train-
ing methods and a rapid increase in qualified staff are needed. The latter
can best be achieved through a comprehensive fellowship program. In order
to cope efficiently with the foreseen expansion of the academic activities,
K.U. management also needs assistance.

Requirements and Supply
3.08      Enrollment expansion in Kasetsart University is determined by
the requirements for qualified university graduates in agriculture and
the national supply of graduates to meet these needs. Requirements and
supply estimates for 1976-1985 are shown in Annex 9 and 10 and summarized
below:
REQUIREMENTS

3.09      The table shows the widening gap between requirements and supply of
university graduates and the essential contribution of the proposed project
in meeting manpower needs in that sector. In addition to meeting quantita-
tive requirements the project would very substantially narrow the qualita-
tive gap (para. 3.04) through provision of laboratory facilities and through
a staff development program.  The figures also show that the veterinary
sector tends to develop in an unbalanced way and special measures would be
required to prevent long-term over supply of veterinary graduates.  The
proposed project, therefore, includes provision for a study of veterinary
education in the country.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Technical Description
4.01      To assist in expanding and improving the faculty of agriculture
and other related supporting faculties of Kasetsart University, the project
would finance:
(i) site development, construction, furniture and equipment
for specialized teaching and research premises for the
Faculties of:
Existing Campus      New Campus
(Bangkhen)      (Kamphaengsaen)
Agriculture                    380 places            955 places
Fisheries                       165   "
Forestry                        170
Veterinary Science              -                    400 places
Engineering                     -                    130
Economics and Business
Administration                90 places             35   "
Science and Arts (Agric.
related fields only)          740   "
TOTAL               1,545 places         1,520 places
Central Lecture Premises        -                  1,100
Multi-purpose Hall                                 1,550
Students' Dormitories                              1,550
Staff Housing                                        380 units
Primary School (for children of KU staff)            300 places
Administration and Communal Facilities
Administrative offices, a university center, two central libraries,
two health centers; faculty club and farm and research premises.



- 11 -
(ii) Technical Assistance:
A total of 42 man-years of technical assistance would be
provided: 27 for curriculum development, 6 for studies,
9 for university management and project unit support;
together with 400 man-years of overseas fellowships.
4.02      The greater part of the project would relate to the development
of the new campus at Kamphaengsaen to which would be transferred all courses
requiring practical training in an agricultural environment. During negotia-
tion, it was agreed that the university would prepare a program for the
transfer of facilities and courses from Bangkhen to Kamphaengsaen. In par-
ticular, the new campus would offer complete programs for: (i) 3rd and 4th
year students in soils, animal science, plant science, agricultural economics
and farm mechanics; (ii) 4th year students in agricultural engineering, ir-
rigation and agricultural education; and (iii) 3rd to 6th year students in
veterinary science; all incorporating facilities also for the Graduate school.
4.03      The proposed project would lead to a substantial improvement in
the quality of teaching and research and would increase the enrollment ca-
pacity of K.U. by 1,520 places. It would also provide the infrastructure
for the new campus at Kamphaengsaen, thus allowing completion of this campus
under a future development program.
Faculty of Agriculture
4.04      The project would provide academic buildings and equipment at
the suburban campus at Bangkhen for expansion and improvement of undergrad-
uate and graduate programs. All the buildings and equipment for teaching
and research in soils, crops, pastures and livestock, would be built on
the Kamphangsaen campus.
Faculty of Fisheries
4.05      A new building would be constructed at Bangkhen to provide staff
offices, research facilities for staff and students and special laborator-
ies for undergraduate and post-graduate teaching in fish culture, fish
biology, fish management and fish processing. A field station at Kamphaeng-
saen would provide for research programs in breeding and management of stock
for inland fisheries.
Faculty of Forestry
4.06      The project would provide an additional building at Bangkhen to
allow for increased enrollment and improved facilities for undergraduate
and postgraduate teaching. All buildings are located in the area earmarked
for the use of the Ministry of Agriculture (para. 2.11) and most of them
are new and suitable for the programs of the Faculty. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Government would, until suitable



- 12 -
replacement facilities are made available to the University, permit the
use of those buildings and premises by the Faculty of Forestry and would
furnish to the Bank a copy of its authorization to that effect.
Faculty of Veterinary Science
4.07      The K.U. Faculty of Veterinary Science is located in an inadequate
building far from the rest of the campus; it is too small for the curricu-
lum, its animal clinic is poorly equipped and the urban environment
of Bangkhen is not suited for training veterinarians for work on farm
animals. The second veterinary faculty of the country, at Chulalongkorn
University in the city of Bangkok, is disconnected from any rural environ-
ment and its curriculum aims at training veterinarians for clinical practice
with individual sick animals. In their present structure and at their
present location, neither of the two faculties meet the country's needs for
veterinary services. The existing facillties of the two faculties cannot
be expanded or converted to achieve this aim. The project would therefore
include new facilities for a complete veterinary faculty at K.U.'s
Kamphaengsaen campus, to provide a curriculum aimed at the design, implemen-
tation and supervision of diagnostic and disease control programs.
4.08      The decision to be taken is whether continued support of two
faculties in the future would be justified or whether one faculty, applying
a curriculum fully adapted to the country's needs, would be adequate (para.
3.09). Therefore, a study on veterinary education and training, on the vet-
erinary services and on requirements and employment opportunities for
veterinarians, is included in the proposed project.
4.09      Because the K.U. veterinary science courses should, in any case,
be relocated at Kamphaengsaen, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the Veterinary Faculty buildings at Bangkhen would not be expanded,
that the university would transfer to Kamphaengsaen all facilities for the
professional years of veterinary science courses when the facilities at
Kamphaengsaen are completed. The equipment and furniture provided under the
proposed loan could be used at Bangkhen but transferred to the new campus
when the Kamphaengsaen facilities have been completed.
Faculty of Engineerlng
4.10      Facilities would be provided at Kamphaengsaen for all fourth year
students in agricultural and irrigation engineering.
Faculty of Economics and Business Administration
4.11      The project would provide teaching and research facilities for
the Agricultural Economics Department at both campuses.



- 13 -
Faculty of Education
4.12      An enrollment increase from 135 in 1971 to 700 by 1980 is planned
by the University. This latter figure comprises 320 students in programs
for physical education teachers and 380 students in agricultural educa-
tion. The project would assist only the department of agricultural education;
its curriculum contains 75% of agricultural subjects taught in the Faculty
of Agriculture and other faculties and 25% education related subjects taught
in the Faculty of Education. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that the Government would make the necessary financial allocations to enable
the Faculty of Education to achieve a total enrollment of at least 280 agri-
cultural education students by 1976 and 380 students by 1979 and in each suc-
ceeding year thereafter.
Faculty of Science and Arts
4.13      The project would expand and improve facilities used for service
courses to other faculties in basic physical, biological and social sciences,
mathematics and languages. These courses involved the equivalent of 1,400
full-time students in 1970 and would involve 2,000 after completion of the
project. The Faculty also teaches four-year degree courses in physics,
chemistry, biology, social science, humanities and mathematics.
Technical Assistance
4.14      The Project would provide for 27 man-years of specialist services
for curriculum development (Appendix 2). Detailed allocation between fields
and between short-term and longer term appointments would be determined by
the Project Unit. The appointment of curriculum development specialists
would be under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
4.15      The project would also provide 2-1/2 man-years of specialist services
for university management to strengthen the administrative organization of
the university. For project unit support 6-1/2 man-years would be provided.
The appointment of these specialists would be under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.
4.16      Considerable fellowship assistance for graduate training i8 needed
to bring the academic staff up to satisfactory standards for teaching, re-
search and graduate training. The objective (para. 3.06) to be achieved, as
soon as possible, is that 75% of the staff will have higher degrees (25%
with Ph.D's and 50% with Masters) and so enable K.U. to develop its own
graduate programs and make the country to a great extent self-sufficient in
training at this level.
4.17      The 400 man-years of overseas fellowships included in the proposed
project would advance K.U. towards this objective. The project includes: for



- 14 -
the Faculty of Agriculture 111 fellowship man-years; Engineering 31; Veteri-
nary Science 30; Education 33; Economics and Business Administration 40;
Science and Arts 96; Fisheries 22 and Forestry 37. The selection of
fields of study, personnel, training programs, and training institutions
would be undertaken by the University Fellowship Committee. Before fellow-
ships are awarded, the University would discuss the proposed program with
the Bank.
4.18      Veterinary education should be adapted to the needs of the economy
(para. 4.08). Specialist services would be included in the project for a
study on veterinary education and training, on the veterinary services and
on requirements and employment opportunities for veterinarians.
4.19      Agricultural education and training as well as agricultural re-
search and extension services have grown largely unrelated to renuired
agricultural developments (para. 2.10 and 3.04).  In view of their great
importance for Thailand, the proposed project would include specialist
services for a study of all levels of agricultural education and training
and of agricultural research and extension services.
4.20      The two studies referred to above (paras 4.18 and 4.19) would be
carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture for which the
project would provide six man-years of specialist services. The terms of
reference for the studies as well as the terms and conditions of apDointment
of the experts would be acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Government would complete these studies within
eighteen months from the date of the Loan Agreement, and would discuss with-
the Bank the results of these studies and the Covernment's proposals for
giving effect to any recommendations therein.
B.   Cost of the Prolect
4.21      The total cost of the project is estimated at Baht 589.3 million
(US$28.3 million). Some 54% of the total project cost relates to the
establishment of the new campus at Kamphaengsaen; 337 to the expansion and
improvement of the Bangkhen campus and about 137 to technical assistance
provisions, including contingency allowances.  A cost breakdown by component
items is given in Annex 11.  The project cost by types of accommodation,
furniture, equipment, services, etc. is estimated as follows:

4.22      The university's new campus at Kamphaengsaen covers nearly 3100
acres. Bangkhen has sufficient land for the new construction on that site.
4.23      Campus development estimates for roads, electricity, water supply,
drainage and other services necessary to support construction, are based on
recent costs for similar works.
4.24      Construction estimates are the product of re-assessed accommodation
schedules and of revised unit area costs. Accommodation schedules have been
adjusted to standards appropriate for the combination of courses offered.
The relatively large academic and training area per student place (24m2) is
due to the high proportion of courses with exceptionally high space require-
ments, e.g., veterinary science and agricultural engineering.
4.25      The estimated unit area costs are based on the construction costs
for recent university proje2ts of similar type in the Bangkok area. They
averape about US$67.5 per m for academic and communal facilities and US$65
per m for boarding facilities, whiPh is reasonable for the standard of con-
struction required. The cost per m in the Bank assisted first education pro-
ject in Thailand was $55; the rates for corresponding facilities in the Uni-
versity of Singapore project are estimated at US$100 and US$80.7 respectively.
4.26      Furniture and equipment cost estimates have been reviewed for
all courses; it is expected that all furniture would be manufactured locally
and all equipment would be imported. Local currency cost estimates for
equipment include import duties, local taxes, port, warehousing and handling
charges, transportation to sites and checking and assembly costs which
together are equivalent to about 50% of c.i.f. landed costs.
4.27      The foreign exchange component of US$14.5 million equivalent
consists of 100% of the c.i.f. landed costs of equipment (or 67% of total
cost at the point of installation); 100% of total costs of fellowships; 80%
of campus planning services; 80% of the costs of foreign specialists; 37%
of construction and campus development costs; 19% of costs of furniture
(representing the import element of locally manufactured furniture) and
11% of costs of consulting architects.
4.28      Contingency allowances (Annex 12) are based on:  (i) possible cost
increases estimated at 5% p.a. for imported goods and services and 3.5% p.a.
for domestic goods and services; and (ii) a 10% provision to cover unforeseen
events in campus development, construction, furnishing and equipping and
consultants' fees. All contingencies account for 16.9% of total project
cost and 20.4% of the cost before contingencies.

4.29      Facilities provided at the Bangkhen campus would be an expansion
of existing premises whereas those at the Kamphaengsaen campus would be en-
tirely new. Housing for all staff to be stationed at Kamphaengsaen is in-
cluded. Estimated costs per student place at Kamphaengsaen, excluding con-
tingencies and professional fees, are as follows:

4.30      The unit costs given above are not readily comparable with those
for institutions in other Bank-Group financed education projects due to
differences in levels, length, complexity and specialization of courses.
Given these limitations, the unit cost for academic and communal facilities
is in line with estimated costs of $3,800 per place for the University
of Singapore and $3,718 per place for the School of Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Zambia. The cost per boarding place may be compared to the $2,600
per place estimated for the University of Singapore and $2,300 per place for
the University of Zambia.
4.31      The estimated recurrent costs created by the project would amount
to less than 2% of all public recurrent education expenditures. The govern-
ment should be able to meet these costs and its share of the capital costs
without curtailing expenditures for other on-going education activities and
without overburdening the education budget.
C.   Implementation and Disbursement
Execution of the Project
4.32      Construction work and furniture and equipment procurement would be
completed in about four years but the completion of technical assistance ser-
vices and of fellowship programs would require about six years (Chart 3).
An estimated schedule of disbursement is shown at Annex 13.

Administration
4.33      A Project Unit to be established within the office of the Univer-
sity Rector would be responsible for the financial and administrative control
of the project (with the exception of the studies of agricultural and vet-
erinary education) and its proper execution, including (a) the engagement
and briefing of campus planning and architectural consultants and the coordi-
nation of their services; (b) the engagement, briefing and coordination of
specialists to be employed at K.U. under technical assistance; (c) the
preparation of master lists of furniture and equipment; (d) procurement of
civil works, furniture and equipment, and the subsequent evaluation of bids
with recommendations regarding the award of contracts; (e) the supervision
of construction; (f) coordination with relevant agencies such as NEC, NEDB
and the Ministries of Agriculture, Education and Finance; and (g) liaison
with the Bank.
4.34      The Project Unit would be headed by the Rector of the University
who would be the project director. The Bank has agreed to persons already
designated by the University for the positions of deputy director, project
secretary and the full-time coordinator to whom the project director would
delegate authority for day-to-day supervision of the units' operations.
The Bank has also agreed to the architect selected by the University for
the position of project architect to be provided under technical assistance.
The unit would be further strengthened by an administrative adviser accept-
able to the Bank, also to be provided under technical assistance, and would
include an accountant and adequate supporting staff.
4.35      The University Fellowship Committee would award the fellowships
provided under the project (para. 4.17). It would be chaired by the project
director; the Dean of the Graduate School and the Vice Rector for Develop-
ment would be ex officio members. The Project Unit would be responsible
for the administration of the fellowship program.
Professional Services
4.36      The organization of the studies on (i) agricultural education,
research and extension and (ii) veterinary education and the engagement and
briefing c- the specialists to be supplied under the technical assistance
section of the project would be undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture
which would provide direct liaison with the Bank concerning the implementation
of these project items.
4.37      To coordinate and control the construction under the project and
to provide guidelines for the future physical development of the university,
experienced campus planning consultants, acceptable to the Bank, would be
retained. They would prepare a comprehensive plan for the simultaneous
development of both campuses and establish criteria to control the archi-
tectural design of individual buildings. They would also prepare specifi-
cations for roads, utilities and other preparatory campus development works
and supervise their implementation under civil engineering contracts.



- 19 -
4.38      Experienced consultant architects, acceptable to the Bank, would
be employed to design individual buildings or groups of buildings in accordance
with the criteria established by the campus planning consultants.  Local firms
are capable of providing such services.
Campus Development and Construction
4.39      Civil engineering contracts (for campus development work) and con-
struction contracts would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. It is expected that
such contracts would go to local firms as the country has a competitive con-
struction industry with sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of the
proposed project.
Procurement of Furniture and Equipment
4.40      Contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive biddding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. Local furniture and equipment manufacturers would be
allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. cost of competing imports
or the existing rate of customs duty applicable, whichever is the lower. It
is expected that all furniture contracts would go to local manufacturers and
all equipment contracts to foreign suppliers. Thailand does not participate
in any arrangement which gives import duties preference to certain foreign
suppliers.
Maintenance
4.41      Budgetary allocation for the maintenance of university buildings,
averaging only $19,000 annually (or less than $0.30 per m2 of premises), has
been inadequate. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that adequate provision will be made in the future to ensure effective main-
tenance of all Kasetsart University buildings, equipment and furniture.
Disbursement
4.42      The proposed loan of US$15.4 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component (US$14.5 million) of the total project cost and
the local currency portion of the ex-factory cost of furniture and equipment
which may be procured locally after international competitive bidding
(para. 4.40). It would be disbursed to meet:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported instructional
equipment and furniture and of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured furniture and equipment;
(b)  65% of the total expenditure on imported and locally procured
furniture and equipment;
(c)  100% of foreign exchange costs of technical assistance and
fellowships;



- 20 -
(d) 36% of the total cost for civil works, including campus
development and construction, and of the professional fees
for campus planners and consultant architects; this percentage
representing the average of the estimated foreign exchange
components.
The above percentages would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursements
over the implementation period of the project. Savings in any category
would be available to cover cost overruns in other categories or would other-
wise be available for cancellation. In the event that expenditures would
exceed the total estimated cost, such excess would be met by the Government
of Thailand.
4.43      Retroactive reimbursement is recommended for the services of the
project architect and administrative advisor, to be provided for the Project
Unit under technical assistance (para. 4.34) and for the professional ser-
vices of the campus planners (para. 4.37). A project architect has already
been selected and the university will shortly select a campus planning con-
sultant from a short list agreed with the Bank. The amount of expenditure
before the date of the Loan Agreement and subsequent to March 1, 1972 which
would be recommended for retroactive financing would not exceed US$50,000.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
points:
(a) the preparation of a program for the transfer of equipment
and courses from Bangkhen to Kamphaengsaen, including the
transfer of Veterinary Science courses to Kamphaengsaen
when facilities there are completed and the use by the
Faculty of Forestry of buildings situated on Ministry of
Agriculture land at Bangkhen (para. 4.02, 4.06 and 4.09);
(b) enrollment in agricultural education courses (para. 4.12);
and
(c) the completion of studies on veterinary education and
agricultural education, research and extension services
(para. 4.18 - 4.20).
5.02      Retroactive reimbursement is reco mended for the services of the
project architect and administrative adviser to be provided for the Project
Unit under technical assistance (para. 4.34) and for the professional ser-
vices of campus planners (para. 4.37).
5.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$15.4 million equivalent to the Kingdom of Thailand for a term of 30
years including a 10-year grace period.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
The Project provides for 27 man-years of technical assistance for
curriculum development. Detailed allocation between Faculties and fields
and between short-term appointments (2-6 months; primarily for senior peo-
ple advising on development of particular curricula and courses), and longer
term appointments (2-3 years; primarily for assisting with developing
courses in particular fields and taking an active part in teaching, research
and graduate training programs), vould be determined by the Project Unit in
consultation with the Fellowship Committee.
The distribution of technical assistance for curriculum develop-
ment would be as follows:
