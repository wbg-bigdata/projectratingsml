CIRATA HYDROELECTRIC PHASE U PROJECT
LOAN AN) PRoJEcr SuMMARY
Borwer:             Republic of Indonesia
Bedciay:            State Electricity Corporadon (PLN)
Amount:             $104.0 million equivalent
Terms:              Repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace at the standard
variable interest rate.
Onleadbig Terms:    The proceeds of the loan, except $2.3 million for technical assistance
to the Government of Indonesia (GOD, will be onlent from GOI to
PLN for 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; the onlending
rate will be equal to the Bank's standard variable fee equal to the
average of the annual rate of change in the value of Rupiah during the
previous three years, with respect to US dollar, plus one percent. The
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Pro -t
De.  dion:         The main objective of the project is to provide economical and
environmentally sound expansion of PLN's peaking electricity
generating capacity in Java, and improve service reliability. Its
components are:  (a) inplementation of Phase II of the Cirata
hydroelecttic development on the Citarum River in West Java,
consisting of:  (i) insllaion, within the existing cavern of the
powerhouse of four additional units each of 125 MW, including
turbines, generators, governors, regulator and control equipment; (ii)
constructionof two headrace tunnels, two surge shafts, four steel lined
pemtock tunnels, and four tailrace tunnels, with associated outlet
structures; and (iii) installion of transformers and switchgear for
connection to the grid; (b) consulting services for the eineering and
construction supervision of the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase II
development; (c) studies to upgrade hydrological and environmental
data bases, and improve data collection practices; (d) studies to update
PLN's hydroelectric inventories, and determine pre-feasibility of
selected schemes; (e) studies to identify options to enhance
environmental conditions in the existing PLN reservoirs on the Citarum
River, and training of PLN staff in environmental management;
(f) training of PLN's staff in dam safety and instrumentation
monitoring; (g) power sector institutional and regulatory framework
studies for GOI; (h) studies aimed at assisting GOI to determine a long-

tam strategy for financing power sector investments; and (i) pre-
consucton stage engineering services for the Besai hydroelectric
project in South Sumatra.
Bemb:               The project would help PLN meet inrease in peak demand for
electricity in Java and improve service reliability. The project would
also help strenghen PLN's financial position by enhancing the dialogue
on the introduction of a nechanisn for the periodic adjustment of
electricity tariffs, improve PLN's instiutional capabilities, and achieve
greater efficiency in the power subsector by promoting reform in the
institutional and regulatory framework in the sector to empower public
and private sector institutions in the sector to perform to their full
potetials.
Rsk:                The main risks of project imple ion relate to potental cost and
schedule overruns due to geological and hydrological unertainties, and
conactor and construction supervision inadeuacies. The geological
risb are minor because of the knowledge gained in the construction of
the Cirata Phase I development, extensive investigations of new tunnel
alignments, and the fact that the undeground power cavern is already
complete. Hydrological uncertainties are low, since only smal work
is to be done in the river down stream of the dam where flood risk is
negligible. Appointment of a fully qualified civil works contror
trough a prqualification process, use of experienced international
conultants in the construction supervision process, and PLN's
aointment of a project manager for the Cirata Phase II development
would reduce project management risks to a minimum. There is little
risk that the proposed project would become redundt if the projected
level of electricity demand does not matrialize, since the project is a
part of the core expansion program of PLN and is justified under all
demand scenarios considered. Overall, there is a risk that the planned
large esion program for the sector may not be carried out for lack
of sufficient financing and/or implementation capacity, which may
result in supply shortages and consequent disruptions in the national
economy. This risk is addressed through Bank-spported measures
aimng at enhancing sector efficiency through changes in the
ituonal and regulatory framework of the sector, as well as in the
organitional structure of PLN, which would enable the public and the
private sectors (including coperatives) to apply their full potential
towards meeting the technical, managerl and financial r irements
of the sector.

TEENERGY SECTOR
1.1       Indonesia is endowed with a large and dir  energy resource base including crude oil,
natural gas, coal, bydropower and geothemal. Oil has played a cricial role in the country's development.
In the early 1980s, oil's iwportance in the Indonesian economy peaked as oil accounted for 80 percent
of the country's export earnings, and most of the governmnt's revenues came from oil. Pollowing the
collapse of oil prices in the first half of the 1980s, Indonesia inidated a series of fundamental reforms to
restucture and diversify the economy, and provided incentives for non-oil/LNG m a   and
exports; the latter amounted to about US$19.0 billion in 1991/92. However, the oil and gas sector
conine to retain a fudamental role in Indonesia's economy, with oillLNG exports providing revenues
of about US$10.7 billion in 1991/92, constitting roughly 36 percent of total exports.
1.2       Indonesia's domesdc energy consumption has been growing rapidly in recent years. Overall
domestic net energy use grew from about 166 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 1985 to about 232
million boe in 1990, a compound rate of 6.8 per cent per anmum; with liquid petroleum products
accountg for about 78 percent of net energy consumed, and the share of natural gas at approximately
10 percent. Liquid petroleum product co_nspon is curreny increasing at about 13 percent anmually
after having grown at an average annual rate of about 6 percent from 1986 to 1989. During the 1980s,
electricity conumption grew about 15 percent annually and gas sales grew about 9 percent annually.
1.3       A primary objective of energy policy in Indonesia is to satisfy the rapidly growing demand
for energy while mnnimizing the diversion of liquid petroleum products from exports. The Govenmnent
is conscious of the need to conserve Indonesia's exportable surplus of crude oil and thereby slow
Indonesa's transition to net oil importer stus. This requirs the efficient use of energy resources to be
acomplished trdough efficiency pricing and other means, and the development of alternative energy
resources that can economically substiute for domestic petroleum use, such as coal, non exportable gas,
geothrm  and hydropower. In the power sector, a major user of petroleum fuels, plans call for fi-ther
reducing oil's share of power generation, from about 44 percent in 1991/92 ( about 33 million barrels
of diesel and fuel oil), to about 5 percent by the end of this decade (10 million barrels per year).

Sector Overview
1.4      0Ol.  Indonesia's proven and potental reseves of oil have been estimated to be about 11
billion barrels as of January 1991, of whidh proven reserves are estimated to be 6 billion barrels. The
production of crude oil and cotdensates in 1991 was about 581 million barrels, which implies a reserves-
to-production ratio of 19:1. The World Bank's medium term projections indicate tbal whereas in volume
terms Indonesia would still appear to be a comfortable net exporter of oil through this decade, in value
terms it could become a net oil importer well before the end of this century. The major reasons for the
decline are the rapid growth in domestic product demands and the growing imporation of such petroleum
products, as welH as the cost recovery and factor service payments which have to be made to oil
contractors.
1.5       The Bank's participation in the development of the oil sector has been primarily through its
dialogue on energy pricing issues. The Bank has being advocating the use of efficiency pricing as the
basic guideline for demmining petroleum product prices under Indonesia's administered pricng approach.
An appropriate guidelme for adjusting domestic fuel prices is the world market price for refined
petroleum products with selective departures from this benchmark for reveme and equity reasons.
President Suharto's Budget Speech in January 1993, enunciated the principle that energy should be treaed
"as an ordinary commodity with the going price at the international market", and in the price adjustments
announced shordy thereafter, the Government has raised overall product prices by about 24 percent, and
elinated the overall subsidy that existed prior to the mcrease. With these incrases in product pries
that became effective on Januwy 8, 1993, only kerosene retains a sizeable subsidy, equivalent to about
30 percent of its efficiency price. All other product prices are at or above interational price levels, which
more than compesate for the subsidy on kemsene.
1.6       Natural Gas. Indonesia's indicative geological reserves of naual gas are estimated to be
about 217 trillion cubic feet (T), of which 65 TCF are classified as proven, and 39 TCF classified as
potential reserves. Among the proven and potential reserves there are about 8.4 TCF recoverable reserves
in structures too smali to support LNG exports, but large enough to be exploited for the domestic market.
It is estimated that firther exploration could result in the addition of 4 to 15 TCF to this category. The
current gross natura gas production is about 2.46 TCP (424 million boe), implying a reserve-to-
production ratio of 42:1, which is high by international standards.
1.7       Production of LNG exports contine to rise, rsondig to strong demand in the Far East.
In 1991192, LNG exports were valued at about US$3.8 billion (export volume of 19 million tons), and
represented about 81 percent of totl sales, with only 19 percent going to the domestic market, mainly
in fertilizer, iron and steel, and cement production. LNG demand in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan is
projected to expand in the 1990s by about 30.40 million tons, and Indomesia expects to have a significant
share of that market. Over the longer term, as oil's share of export revenmes decline, the Government's
expectation is that natural gas exports will compensate for the revemue losses.
1.8       Notwithstandig the acal and projected growth of the LNG export markets, the use of
natural gas for domestic energy consumption is becoming economically more attactive. Domestic
consumption of gas is projected to increase from 0.3 TCF in 1991 to over 1.0 TCF by the year 2000.



The largest increase in domestic gas conumption is projected to take place in the power sector, to supply
combined-cycle plants that represent a major element of the strategy to cut back on oil-based generation.
Plans call for increasing the share of natural gas-fired generation to about 22 percent by the end of this
decade (195 BCF), from 5 percent in 1991/92 (26 BCP).
1.9       The Gcvermment's strategy is to meet the projected domestic gas requirenents by developing
the non-exportable gas reserves and the necessary gas transmission infrastructure. The Bank has recently
completed a 'Natural Gas Development Planning Study" which provides an in depth assessment of the
issues and formulates a development strategy for the efficient domestic use of the resource. The findings
of the study were reviewed with the Government in June 1992. The Government's development strategy
is being refined in the context of preparing a second Gas Utilization Project. Bank loans are also helping
to finance Gas Distribution (Loan 2690-IND) and Gas Utilization (Loan 3290-IND) projects.
1.10      Coal. Indonesia's coal reserves are estimated to exceed 32 billion tons, located primarily
in Sumatra (23 billion tons) and Kaimantan (9 billion tons). The "measured reserves" are 4.2 billion
tons, divided nearly equally between Sumatra and Kalimantan.
1.11      Indonesia's anmnal production of coal has increased substially from about 600,00 tons in
1983 to over 15 million tons in 1992. Coal production is expected to exceed 30 million tons by 1994 and
could reach 50 million tons by 2000. Thus the rado of measured reserves to annual production is about
280:1. About 60 percent of the production at present comes from Sumatra and the remaining amount from
Kalimantan. Besides one state enterprise, a dozen foreign contractors share in joint ventures and in
firther exploration and mining activities.
1.12      In general Indonesian coal has low sulfur, low ash, high moisture, and high volatile matter.
The South Sunatra and Kali_antan coals have the potential for sustaining the large coal-fired power
generation program in the country that has been identified as part of the least-cost expansion plan for the
power sector. Under this plan, coal's share of power generation will increase from about 30 percent in
1991/92 ( about 5 million tons) to about 50 percent in 1999/00 (23 million tons). In addition to increasing
domestic consumption, exports of coal are also being developed, and Indonesia could become a
significant coal exporter in the coming years. In 1991, coal exports reached about 6.0 million tons and
an export capability of about 20 million tons is expected by 1994.
1.13      Geothenmal. The geothennal reserves of lndonesia are estimated at 10,000 MW, of which
5,500 MW is on Java. The first geothermal power plant with a capacity of 30 MW was built in 1976
at Kamojang near Bandung in West Java. The expansion of this plant to 140 MW was funded by the
Bank Loan 2214-IND. This geothermal field has potential for further expansion by 55 MW. Two more
power stations in Java, totalling 165 MW, are being constructed by PLN with financial assistance from
the Italian Govermment and the ADB respectively.
1.14      The main issue in the exploitation of geothermal potential is to locate sites that can be
developed at costs competitive with other options. In Java, where the electricity grid is well developed
and where PLN is able to achieve economies of scale by constucting large coal-fired or combined cycle
gas-fired stations, the geothermal option is not competitive at the current fuel prices. However, in the



-4 -
outer islands, where the cost of the alternatives are high, geothermal development would have greater
justification. PLN and (01 have, therefore, directed their priorties to developing geothermal sites
outside Java.
1.15      Hydropower. Indonesia has considerable hydroelectric resources, but their development
to date has been limited by their geographic distribution relative to the load centers where there is demand
for electricity. The greatest potential (over 35 percent) lies in Irian Jaya, which has less than one percent
of total electricity demand, while Java, which accounts for 80 percent of current electricity consumption,
has less than 10 percent of the total potential. In Java, about 2,000 MW of hydro potential has been
already developed, including two major projects viz. Saguling (750) MW) and Cirata (500 MW) funded
by Bank Loans 1950-IND and 2300-IND. The proposed project will add 500 MW of capacity to the
existng Cirata project. Hydroelectric plants outside Java totalling about 2,000 MW are also cuffently
under either planning or implementation.
1.16      Nuclear. Development of nuclear power in Indonesia has a lower priority compared to
power generation using natural gas and coal. However, in the long-term, when coal usage for power
generation becomes large enough to cause environmental concerns and when suitable sites for locating
coal-fired plants become difficult to find, nuclear technology could provide a viable alternative. The need
for a nuclear power plant is not envisaged until year 2005. The Government has recently commissioned
a feasibility study for a nuclear plant. This study will determine the opportune tining for the first nuclear
power plant and also recommend an appropriate technology.
Envfrnment
1.17        The Environment Law in Indonesia (Law No. 4, 1982) provides that every project likely
to have a significant impact on the environment must be accompanied by an environmental impact
analysis (ANDAL). Pursuant to this law, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, in its Decree 1158 (1989),
established uniform procedures and guidelines for preparation, submission and approval of an
enviromnental impact analysis, as well as subsequent and periodic reporting during the project
implementation phase. However, energy projects funded by different agencies do not follow a uniform
policy in respect of environmental standards. The Indonesian standards are not fully developed and the
capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy for prepanng such standards is limited. Also, the
Ministry does not have adequate trained manpower or equipment to monitor and enforce environmental
regulations in operating facilities. Technical assistance was provided under Loan 3098-IND (Paiton
Thermal Power Project) to train a number of staff of the Ministry of Mines and Energy on environmental
management, and provide documentation for environmental guidelines and monitoring [para. 1.20(f)].
The TA was satisfactorily completed in October 1992. The proposed project includes technical assistance
to PLN for strengthening its capacity to undertake environmental studies and improve its monitoring
practices (para. 5.21).
Poverty Alleviation
1.18      The role of the energy sector in poverty alleviation is largely indirect except for the specific
government interventions through its pricing policies, involving subsidy for kerosene, low life-line rates



for use of electricity by small households and industries, and a uniform price structure for electricity
throughout the country. The rural electrification program is the most direct intervention of the sector in
the poverty alleviation effort. The Government, through PLN, is investing considerable resources to
expand electricity supply to the villages, generally at subsidized rates, since provision of electricity to
rural areas enhances the quality of life and permits the poor to have access to a service they value highly.
While the economic and social rationale of the rural electrification program is strong, measures to reduce
costs and promote local participation require special attention. In the Bank's sector report (Indonesia:
Rural Electrification Review, Report 6144-IND of November 1986), recommendations for such
improvements were made, which are being pursued through the ongoing Rural Electrification Project
(Loan 3180-ND). Potential actions center around the need to (i) address constraints that currendy inhibit
household connections, (ii) increase productive use of electricity, (iii) improve the village selection
criteria for electrification, (iv) improve physical system design and service standards to enhance cost
effectiveness, and (v) provide opportunity for the development of village-level managerial, technical,
labor, and entrepreneurial resources. A Second Rural Electrification Project, currently under preparation,
will build on the experience gained from the ongoing Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND).
The Goverment's Objectives and Strategy
1.19       In light of Indonesia's rich endowment in energy resources, and the rapidly growing demand
for energy to fuel economic growth and development, the energy sector is expected to continue to play
a key role in the future development of the economy. The GOI's main objectives for the sector are:
(a)  the economic (effciency) objective: to meet the country's energy requirements in a least
cost way, and conserve exportable petroleum reserves, principally by encouraging the
domestic market to substitute oil consumption by alternative fuels for which there is a non-
exportable surplus (e.a., natural gas and coal) or that are non-tradeable (e.g., hydropower
and geothermal).
(b)  the resource mobiiAion (fiscal and finandal) objective: to maximize the country's
foreign exchange earnings and budgetary revenues from the sector, mainly through the
export of tradeable energy resources, including oil, gas and coal, and to enable producers
of energy to recover their costs and obtain sufficient resources to finance their growth and
development.
(c) the social (equality and fairness) objective: to promote a regionally balanced development
of the country and to enable the majority of the people to afford the basic services provided
by electricity (lighting, cooking, transportation).
(d) the environmental objective: to promote the production and utilization of energy resources
in a manner that will ensure sustainable development and help conserve the environment for
future generationss.
1.20       Key elements of the GOI's strategy for the pursuit of the above objectives may be
summarized as follows:



-6-
(a)  peftreum produc prces: In setting its pricing policies, the GOT is guided by the principle
of maintaining the average price of petroleum products at international parity, (efficiency
pricing) while cross-subsidizing the price of kerosen with an implicit tax on gasoline
through the operation of the BBM (petroleum products) Fund (para. 1.5).
(b) electricity tariff: In pursuit of its social objectives, the GOI maintains electricity rates at
low levels for small residential, and small commercial and industrial consumers, who
account for about forty percent of PLN's sales. Periodic adjustnents in the average sale
price (the latest adjustment of 13 percent, effective February 1, 1993) have generally
maintained the financial performance of PLN at satisfactory level and the average price close
to the long-run marginal cost of supply (paras 3.7 and 6.17).
(c)  private sector partidpadon: While the public sector is expected to continue to play a
leading role in the supply of gas and electricity, there is scope for increased private
investment to take advantage of the additional resources and implementation capacity. As
initial steps towards enhancing private participation in the power sector, the Govermnent has
eannarked specific power generation projects totalling about 6,000 MW of capacity for
private investment on build, own and operate (BOO) basis (para. 2.11).
(d)  protectng the poor: To enable the majority of the people to afford the basic services
provided by energy (lighting, cooking, public transport), the GOI subsidizes the price of
kerosene, and the consumption of electricity by small residential, as well as small non-
residential customers. Although there are more effective ways to assist the poor, the social
and political implications of a change in price subsidies have not permitted rapid progress
towards their elimination.
(e)  regionaly balanced devdopment: To promote a regionally balanced development of the
county, the GOI has (i) maintained a uniform price strcture for petroleum products and
electricity in all parts of the country, and (ii) extended the supply of petroleum products and
electricity in a balanced manner to all parts of the country. These policies entail the cross-
subsidization of the higher cost of energy supplies to remote areas through net revenues
earned in the major urban areas.
(f) environmental protection: The GOI has put in place an institutional framework for the
management of the enviromental impacts of energy production. In 1992, the Government
created a Bureau of Enviroment in the Minstry of Mines and Energy with permanent staff
to supervise various environmental aspects in the energy and mining sectors. In addition,
a separate body in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Commission for Environment has
the authority to review and approve Enviromental Impact Assessments for all investment
projects.

Insitutions In the Euerg Sector
1.21       The principal agency responsible for implemening Government policies in the energy sector
is te Miistry of Mines and Energy (MME). MME coordinates all activities in the energy sector and
supervises the state enterprises in the sector: Pertamina (oil, gas and geothermal), P.T. Bukit Asam
(coal), PON (gas distribution) and PLN (dectricity). Other ministries and agencies are also involved in
the sector, for example, the Ministry of Public Works is responsible for hydropower resource surveys
and the operation of multipurpose hydro plans and the National Atomic Energy Commission is
responsible for nuclear development. An inter-ministerial National Energy Board (BAKOREN)
coordinates energy policies and development with those of other sectors. BAKOREN is supported by a
Technical Committee (PTE) consistng of senior officials of different departments, chaired by the Director
General of Electricity and Energy Development (DGEED). The organizadon chart of the MME is shown
in Annex 1.1.

ELECTRIC POWER
The Electricity Subsector
2.1       The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework for
electricity subsector. The subsector comprises: (i) PLN, the State Electricity Corporation;
(ii) captive plants installed by private parties for their own use; (iii) three Goverment-sponsored
rural electric cooperatives; and (iv) a large number of infomal microterprises providing
electricity to clusters of customers in rual villages not served by PLN. The provisions of the
Electricity Act are amplified in Government Regulation No. 17/1990 for PLN and No. 10/1989
for others. The regulation of the subsector is the responsibility of the Minister of Mines and
Energy, who is assisted by the Director General of Electricity and Energy Development
(DGEED). DGEED is the chairman of the Supervisory Board which oversees PLN's operations
and reviews PLN's investment plans, budgets and tariffs. The Electricity Act also permits
establishment of private power producers, distributors and licensees. Presidental Decree No.
37/1992 issued in June 1992, clarifies the role of private power generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity for public and private use.
The Mlarket
2.2       During the 1970s and 1980s, the power sector of Indonesia has grown rapidly. The
installed capacity of PLN, grew from 0.5 GW in 1970 to 2.5 GW in 1980 and 9.2 GW in 1992,
as its sales grew from 1.6 TWh in 1970/71 to 6.5 TWh in 1980/81 and 31.5 TWh in 1991/92.
This achievement is impressive, particularly considering the expanse and archipelagic nature of
the country. Even so, the proportion of electrified households in Indonesia of 31 percent, is low
by regional standards. PLN is currently able to serve only about 48 percent of urban households
and 25 percent of rural households, whereas it is estimated that at least 90 percent of urban
households and two thirds of those in rmual areas can afford to purchase electricity. Annex 2.1
shows the growth in PLN's consumers and sales.
2.3       In spite of its rapid development, PLN accounts for just over half of the electricity
used by industries with the rest being provided by captive generation facilities operated by
industrial plants. The rapid emergence of captive generation in the 1970s and its continued
growth in the 1980s, bridged the shortfall in electricity supply from PLN, although at a cost, as
grid supplied elecricity is generally more economical than captive generation. Total installed
capacity of captive generation is about 5,900 MW, of which about 1,900 MW are connected to
PLN and operate on a standby basis, and 3,000 MW operate in isolation. Annex 2.2 shows the
growth in captive plants in Indonesia. In addition to industrial captive generation, the shortage



of electricity and absence of supply facilities has also given rise to thousands of village-level
microenterprises operating very small generator sets and providing a precarious service of
generally low standard to small cfAsters of rural customers.
The Demand for Electricity
2.4       The potential for growth in electricity demand in the future remains high. Even
though PLN's sales grew by 15 percent during the 1980s, there is still a backlog of unmet
demand at efficient prices, that has been supported by exanding the use of captive generation
and the proliferation of informal microenterprises in rural areas.  Further, the overall
electrification ratio remains low at 32 percent (para. 2.2), and the per capita electricity
consumption estimated to be about 270 kWh per year in 1991/92 is low compared with other
developing countries with similar or lower income levels. As a practical matter, not only has
PLN been forced to abandon for the time being the objective of takeover of existing captive
generation that is un-economic compared to grid supply, it has been signalling to potential new
industial customers seeking grid supply that such comnections may be slow in forthcoming.
Thus, the amount of captive generation capacity in industry is expected to increase well beyond
current levels.
2.5       It is estimated that the electricity demand will contine to grow rapidly, due to the
rapid economic growth led by export-oriented industries. The expectations of GDP growth range
from 6 to 8 percent per annum for the current decade, with the industrial GDP growing at 10
to 14 percent per annmn. PLN has prepared three sets of sales projections for its Java-Bali
system where the proposed project is located, based on low, medium and high growth scenarios,
with the following assumptions:
(a)  Low Growth. This was the scenario on which REPELfIA V (1989/90 - 1993/94)
was based. It assumed the average GDP growth rate of 5.4 percent per annum and
the growth in the industrial GDP at 7.0 percent per annum.
(b)  Medum Growth. This scenario assumes an average GDP growth of 7.2 percent
per annum until 2003/04, with industrial GDP growth assumed at 11.6 percent per
annum. The target ratio for the electrification of the households is 75 percent and
PLN's share of industrial demand is assumed to increase from about 50 percent at
present, and reach and stabilize at 68 percent.
(c)  High Growth. This scenario assumes an average GDP growth of 7.8 percent per
annun until 2003/04, with industrial GDP assumed to average 12.2 percent per
amnm. It targets the ratio for the electrification of households at 98.7 percent and
PLN's share of industrial demand is assumed to reach 97.4 percent.
The projections of sales for the Java-Bali interconnected system under these scenarios are shown
in Table 2.1.
2.6       The low growth scenario is considered too conservative as both the overall and
industi GDP growths since 1988 have consistendy surpassed the corresponding assumptions
underlying this scenario. The cur  discussion is centered around the selection of a projection
from among the medium and the high scenarios, to facilitate the planning of the generating
capacity additions for REPEITA VI (1993/94 to 1998/99). The projected growth in sales in

1992193 reflects supply constraints.
2.7       The investment program is currently under review by the GOI, taking into account
factors such as (a) the most likely scenario of the growth in total GDP and its sub-components,
such as manufacturing GDP; (b) targets for extension of PLN's supply areas, and rural
electrification; (c) strtegy for captive takeover; and (d) private sector participation through BOO
projects. The medium scenario is used by PLN to identify a core investment plan for
REPELITA VI. Anmual reviews will be carried out to adjust the investment plan based on
updated projections of economic growth, availability of fi'jance and implementation capacity.
The proposed project is justified under all the demand scenarios and is a part of the core
investment program of PLN.
Generating Capacity
2.8       The expansion plan for Java-Bali would be based on the use of hydro, geothermal
and gas-fired generating capacity to the maximum extent feasible. Current indications are that
about 1,200 MW of hydro, 220 MW of geothermal and 5,200 MW of combined cycle gas-fired
generating capacity could be added during 1991-2003 on the basis of known prospects to date.
The balance of the capacity of about 9,000 MW would need to come from coal-fired generating
plants. The Government has earmarked 6,400 MW of this latter capacity to be built and
operated by the private sector. The composition of the generating capacity in the Java-Bali
system in 1998/99 compared to that in 1991192 is expected to be as shown in Table 2.2 (details
in Annex 2.3).

Power Invesnent Progm
2.9        Based on the demand projection and knowledge of feasible projects available for
implementation, PLN has prepared a least cost generation expansion plan for the lava-Bali
interconnected system and its 11 regions outside Java. Annex 2.3 sumnmrizes the generation
expansion plan for the Java-Bali system up to the year 2003/04 and Annex 2.4 provides the
consolidated information regarding the generation expansion plan for the Outer Islands. The
plans up to about 1998/99 are based on reasonably precise information. The plans for the outer
years are less firm.
2.10       Based on the generation plans and sales composition, the investment requirements
for transmission and distribution facilities are estimated. Since the development of the
transmission and distribution network is closely linked with the spatal distribution of demand,
precise plans for them can only be fonmulated 3-4 years ahead of the need. They are subject to
detailed annual reviews.
2.11       The issues associated wih the power investment plan are of two types. One, the
determination of the appropriate size of the investment plan consistent with the country's overall
economic development plans, resource availability and implementation capacity. This issue will
be resolved in the context of the formulation of REPELITA VI, the five-year national
development plan for 1994/95 - 1998/99. The Bank presented a report to the Government
(Indonesia: A Strategy for Infrasucture Development, Report No. 9672-IND of June 1991) that
deals with the issues and options confronting the Goverment. The second set of issues pertaim
to the optimm strategy for funding the investment program. In addition to PLN, the
Govermment intends to seek a more active role from private investors. For this purpose it has



- 12-
earmarked several generation projects (totalling about 6,000 MW capacity) from the expansion
plan to supply electricity on a "Build, Own and Operate" (BOO) basis. The total cost of these
projects is estimated to be over US$5.0 billion. The Bank is closely associated with the
Government's effort to expand private participation in the power subsector. It is providing
technical assistance to the Private Power Team in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, under the
Infrastructure TA Loan (3385-IND), for the ongoing negotiations of the first 1,200 MW coal-
fred power plant at Paiton in East lava on a BOO basis. To foster private sector participation
on a large scale in grid based supply using efficient technology, there is need to design an
appropriate institutional and regulatory framework. Towards this end, a study on the
institutional framework and regulation of the power sector in Indonesia is currently being carried
out by the Bank using Norwegian trust funds (para. 4.8).
2.12      A significanm part of the proposed investment program will still need to be
implemented through PLN. Annexes 2.5 and 2.6 provide estimates of PLN's annual
requirements of investments up to year 2001/02, expressed in constant 1991 US dollar
equivalent. The requirements for the period 1993/94 to 1998/99 (end of REPEULTA VI) are
shown in Table 2.3.

2.13      The strategy for financing PLN's investment program has been a subject of
intensive dialogue between GOI and the Bank. The Bank has advocated the following principles
to the Government:
(a)  With a combination of measur, including efficiency improvement and tariff
adjustments, PLN should maintain a self-financing ratio above 25-30 percent.
Periodic tariff adjustments will be needed to permit this.
(b) The Government's contribution to PLN's investment requirements should be
gradually reduced and ultimately limited to that required for supporting socially
directed programs such as rural electrification. Also, the financial losses incurred
by PLN due to the Government policy of uniform tariff throughout the country and
life line rates for small residential and industrial consumers, should be compensated
on the basis of a tasparent mechanism.



- 13 -
(c) An optimal capital structure for PLN should be determined with an appropriate mix
of debt and equity (paras. 6.12-6.13). PLN should borrow in local and
international markets, and pay full cost of borrowing.
2.14      The Government is receptive to the above principles and expects to pursue it
through the discussion of PLN's five-year corporate plan with the Bank (pam. 6.22). Also, a
study for periodic formula-based tariff adjustment is being finalized. The study proposes
formula-based tariff adjustments to compensate for the variations in the cost of fuel and inflation
(para. 6.8), by providing for efficiency improvements in the base tariff.
2.15      The Government has requested a detailed study on the various issues involved in
the long-term strategy for financing of the power sector investment program, including the role
of the private sector. The proposed loan provides fuids for technical assistance to the
Government to carry out this study (paras. 5.24 and 6.22).
2.16      To ensure contanued soundness of the development program, the Bank agreed with
the GOI and PLN under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND), that: (a) each
year, PLN and GO will review with the Bank PLN's investment program so that the Bank can
exress its views on the priorities and the balance among generation, transnmssion and
distribution investments; and (b) the GOI will ensure that PLN has access to sufficientfunds to
finance its capital expenditures as reviewed and agreed with the Bank. These covenants are
currently being observed and were also agreed under the proposed project.
Demand Management, Conservation, and Efficiency Improvement
2.17      Supply Effiiency. PLN and GOI are conscious of the need for enhancing
efficiency in electricity supply as well as in end-use. On the supply-side PLN's efficiency along
many dimensions is generally in line with the better managed utilities among its regional peer
group. Coal-fired plants in Java, that account for about a third of all grid-based generation
operate at world class standards in terms of plant performance parameters such as fuel
consumption, and availability. A time series analysis of PLN's performance reveals a consistent
trend of efficiency improvements as well. Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses have
come down from a high of about 21 percent of net generation in 1983/84 to 14.1 percent in
1991/92. Looking to the future, PLN has targeted further efficiency improvements in operations
by reducing T&D losses on its Java-Bali grid system, which at present accounts for about 80
percent of all PLN generation, to 10.5 percent by the end of this decade. This efficiency
improvement would result in incremental energy savings of about 3,067 GWh in 2000/01, and
is equivalent to about a 500 MW savings in generating capacity. PLN is also undertaking a
program to increase the efficiency of its diesel plant operations, to reduce oil consumption and
increase plant availability.
2.18      Demand M              PLN is addressing efficiency improvement in end-use,
both indirectly through pricing, and direcdy through technological and behavioral interventions
in the manner in which electricity is used at present. The electricity tariff structure is designed
to reflect the long-runm marginal cost of supply, especially for large industrial and conunercial
consumer categories. The energy charges are suitably differentiated during peak and off-peak
times for these consumer segments. PLN's five-year corporate plan (para. 6.22), also identifies
explicitly target levels for savings from demand management, of about 317 GWh by 1996/97,
using a variety of direct measures (para 2.19). Institutionally, PLN has constituted a



- 14-
Conservation Steering Committee to coordinate, plan, and implement targeted efficiency
improvements on the supply- and demand-side. In particular, the Demand Managenent group
within this committee is responsible for designing, pilot testing, and encouraging implementation
of full-scale demand management programs in support of the demand management targets in the
corporate plan. To gear up for the task ahead, four individuals (three from PLN and one from
DGEED), undertook in July 1992 a two-week study tour of the US to learn first hand about
demand-side management practices and experience of the utility industry. Ongoing technical
assistance to PLN provided under a recent Asian Development Bank Loan (Power XXI Project,
May 1991), is facilitating the collection of data on customer load profiles and on electricity end-
use characteristics; data that constitute some of the building blocks for designing and developing
demand management programs.
2.19      PLN's draft corporate plan and strategy for meeting projected consumer demand
for 1993194-1996/97 identifies the following preliminary targets for demand management in
GWh:
Year            1993/94  1994195   1995196  1996197
Residential          13      27         44       63
Commercial           2        4          5        6
Public               2       3           5        6
Industry            24       60         120     240
Total Savings (GWh)  40      94         174      317
PLN expects to capture thest savings praily from lighting efficiency improvement programs
targeted to each sector. The share of electncity use for lighting vanes by consumer group and
location. A recently completed study on demand-side management in Indonesia, funded by the
US Agency for International Development (USAID), estimates these shares to be 7 percent for
industry, and between 20 to 25 percent for commercial buildings, 53 percent for urban
households and 60 percent for rural households. The study reports that the replacement of
commonly used incandescent bulbs by compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) can save about 75
percent of energy consumed for lighting. Although the initial cost of a CPL is significantly
higher than that of an incacent bulb, these high efficiency lamps are cost effective provided
the lamps perform to specifications under field conditions.
2.20      PLN has designed two pilot projects to field-test the technological and other key
aspects of program delivery. One pilot project, already approved by PLN's Board and for which
consultant selection is underway, is to be field-tested in the Jakarta area during 1993/94. The
second pilot project, for which PLN has undertaken a preliminary design, focuses on demand



- 15-
management in rural areas. This project has three program components: (i) a residential program
involving the use of CFLs to reduce peak load, (ii) a public buildings program that focuses on
the use high efficiency lighting alternatives and better electronic ballasts, and (iii) a comnercial
buildings programn that has two sub-components. One sub-component that centers around the
introduction of CFLs, and a second one that involves curtailing large cental air conditioning
loads in i_ntances where the consumer has a backup generation facility. The Bank is also
providing technical assistance to PLN in reviewing the building design of PLN's new
headquarters project from the perspective of energy efficiency, and to evaluate and recommend
specific opportunities to incorporate and thereby "showcase" building demand management
measures including building envelope improvements that result in inore efficient utilization of
electricity, high efficiency lighting and air conditioning systems, and opportumities for solar
thermal for hot water and solar photovoltaic systems for parking area lighting. Discussions are
also underway with USAI) to coordinate and prepare a demand management component to be
included in a future Bank loan, to implement the action plan for demand management in
Indonesia developed in the USAID study.

3.2         Project Perfornance Audit Reports (PPARs) and Project Completion Reports
(PCRs) on the first 14 projects have been issued. The PPARs have concluded that the projects



- 17-
reviewed so far achieved the objectives set out at the dme of appraisal. Specifically, these
projects and the concomitant technical assistae programs, enhanced PLN's institutional
capabilities in many areas of utilities operation and management, particularly in the area of
project implementation, and helped PLN meet crical demands for electricity (para. 3.6). The
last PPAR (No. 7902 of June 26, 1989) concludes that the Bank has made a positive contribution
towards the developmen of the Indonesian power sector over the past 20 years. It attributes this
to the facts that: (a) there was a long-term vision for the development of the subsector and this
vision was shared by the Bank, Government and PLN; (b) the vision was translated into a long-
term strategy which was resolutely pursued, while remainmng flexible in the designing and
implementation of individual measures that fitted into this stegy and complemented each
other; and (c) a reasonable balance was struck between the physical and the institutional
development components of the projects. These conclusions drawn from the experience in
Indonesia are consistent with the Bankwide experience reviewed in OED's report of 1990,
entitled "Issues in World Bank Lending Over Two Decades." This report evaluated the outcome
of 180 Bank-financed power projects from 1974 to 1988 and suggested that sustainability of these
projects was highly influenced by institutional and country economic conditions as well as by
technical and policy factors.
3.3       In broad terms, the Bank's involvement with the power subsector in Indonesia can
be distinguished in four phases. In the initial phase (1968 until the mid-1970s), the Bank
concentrated on creating a national entity, PLN, to deal with sectoral problems and helped put
in place procedures and systems to manage and improve its initially small-scale operations. In
the second phase, (from 1975 to 1985), the primary thrust of the Bank's work was to assist in
a rapid expansion of the electricity supply infrastructure. In the third phase, the focus was on
strengthening the financial position and efficiency of PLN. In the current phase, the focus has
shifted towards the restructuring of the sector's regulatory framework and PLN's organization,
and increased private sector participation. Specific aspects of the Bank's involvement and
experience in the Indonesian power subsector are described below.
3.4       Initial Phase. In the late 1960s, when the Bank became involved in the power
subsector in Indonesia, PLN was in an exceedingly poor organizational and financial state. The
first power project (FY70) helped at once to identify PLN's weaknesses, as well as approaches
to overcoming them. Under a second operation in 1972, a long-term power development study
for Java was carried out that defined the objectives and conponents of the power system
development on which to base the Bank's involvement in most of the work under the second
phase. Another result of the first phase of the Bank's involvement was the promulgation of
Government Regulation No. 18 of 1972, that provided PLN with a higher, albeit still limited,
degree of autonomy, including responsibility for procurement and construction of most of its
facilities. This first phase also resulted in a new accounting system and a comprehensive training
program.
3.5       Capacity Expansion. During the second phase (from 1975 until 1985) of capacity
expansion, the Bank approved about one project every year. The infrastrucure components of
this series of projects helped PLN expand its generation capacity of thermal, coal-fired, hydro-
electric and geothermal power plants, and transmission and distributionfacilities. These projects
also supported the Government's objective of diversifying domestic energy consumption away
from oil by the use of coal, hydropower and geothermal. At the beginning of this decade,
PLN's installed capacity had grown to more than 10 times what it was at the begining of the
1970s, and to more than 2.5 times what it was at the beginning of the 1980s; Bank-financed



- 18 -
projects h; I made substantial contribudons to adding 3,800 MW of the approximately 6,400
MW of ge erating capacity operating in Java in 1991.
3.6       Institutional Development. The first major effort at institutional development at
PLN took place with Bank assistance in the mid-1970s, through the implementation of a
comprehensive Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) which took into account all aspects of PLN's
administration and operations. As part of the PRP and sibsequently through a long series of
loans, technical assistance was provided to improve PLN's skills in diverse areas including
system planning, demand forecasting, system operation, design of generation and transmission
facilides, operation and mainenance of power plants, project management, personnel
management, management information system and accounting. As a consequence, PLN has
made significant progress in improving the efficiency of its operations (Annex 4.2). In
particular, its transmission and distribution losses decreased from 20.8 percent in 1983/84 to
15.6 percent in 1990/91. The operation of the 1,600 MW coal-fired thermal power plant at
Suralaya in West Java (funded by four Bank loans), accounts for about 40 percent of the
electricity supplied by PLN in Java. The station achieved an availability factor of 93 percent
in 1991/92, which is comparable to the best in developed countries. Overall, PLN's capacity
for implementation, as well as for operation and maintenance, has grown substantially during
its association with the Bank. It now carries out on average an investment program of over $1
billion per year and connects over one million new consumers anmnally. The rapid expansion
has strained PLN's ability to improve its quality of service in terms of interruptions and voltage
stability. The Bank's dialogue on institutional development is now focused on providing PLN
with a stable financial environment, greater delegation and decentralization among its various
regions, stronger strategic planning, clearly defined accountability, and improvement in
distribution management and transmission reliability (paras. 4.4-4.8).
3.7        FInandal Perfonnance. The objective of the Financial Recovery Plan for PLN
to achieve the fill operating cost recovery was met in 1975/76. Thereafter, a self-financing ratio
(SFR) covenant was adopted in 1978 under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND). The
agreed SFR target was 30 percent for 1985/86 with indicative targets for intervening years.
While the indicative targets for the self-financing ratio were met, the rate of return on assets
remained negative. Therefore, a rate of return (ROR) covenant was adopted under the
Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) in 1984. The ROR covenant was modified in 1987
under the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 2778-IND), to provide for separate
fiunacial performance targets for PLN's operations in Java (ROR of no less than 8 percent) and
outside-Java (financial breakeven situation), in view of their different operational characteristics.
Projections showed that PLN would be able to achieve a self-financing level of 25-30 percent
with these covenants. However, the government did not permit the corresponding tariff
adjustment in 1987/89. Consequently, although project preparation continued, the Bank did not
approve further loans in 1987 and 1988, pending the Government's required action on tariff.
The Govermient increased tariffs by about 25 percent effective April 1, 1989 and again by 20%
from August 1, 1991. As a result, PLN's financial performance has been satisfactory.
Electricity prices have been raised further by an average of 13 percent, effective February 1,
1993. However, for PLN to achieve the financial performance targets agreed under the
proposed project (paras. 6.5 and 6.8), further adjustment of the tariff would be needed in
1994/95 (para. 6.10). Also, in order to institutionalize the adjustment of tariff and provide
financial stability to PLN's operations, the emphasis of the Bank's dialogue on electricity pricing
has been shifted towards designing a mechanism thw would permit periodic and formla-based



- 19-
adjustment of electricity price to take account of variations in fuel prices, and inflation (para.
2.14 and 6.9).
3.8        Fuel Price Subsidies. The Bank has had a continuous dialogue with GOI on
petroleum products prices. Until 1979, the aggregate level of domestic fuel oil prices was about
one third of the international level. In 1980, in the context of the Ninth Power Project (Loan
1872-IND), the GOI agreed in principle to the elimination of subsidies, which were implemented
during 1980-84. The average price for a basket of petroleum products was raised to an
interational price equivalent, and has been maintained roughly at international prices by
subsequent adjustments (para. 1.5).
3.9       Implementation. Problems with the implementation of power projects have been
caused by delays in three major areas:  (i) selection and appointment of consultants,
(ii) procurement of equipment and goods, and (iii) acquisition of land and the right-of-way for
the construction of transmission and distribution facilities. At times, rigid budgetary procedures,
scarcity of local funds, unsatisfactory performance of local contractors, and shortage of trained
personnel within PLN, have delayed the implementation of previous projects. These problems
are not specific to the power subsector but are germane to the implementation of projects in most
sectors in Indonesia. In response to this experience, the Government has become conscious of
the need for improvement and has been taking corrective steps, such as dismantling the
organization for centralized control on procurement in 1988. However, approval of major
contracts is still centralized through the Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Development Supervision. Also, PLN is implementing cLanges in its internal procurement
procedures to optimize the procurement cycle for the award of contracts for goods and
equipment, and appointment of consultants, based on a strategy agreed under the Suralaya
Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND signed August 26, 1992).
Bank Role and Strateg
3.10      The legal framework and regulatory process that has been in place in Indonesia
(para. 2.1), had been adequate to deal with the sector growth in the 1980s. However, some
sector issues are becoming increasingly important in the context of the rapidly growing size of
the electric power infrastructure needed to sustain the projected economic growth. While PLN's
implementation capacity, technical expertise and operating efficiency have grown significantly,
coping with the rapid growti in the infrastructure and providing reliable electricity supply
requires actions that include (a) institutional restructuring of PLN that involves decentralization
and corporatization of functions that have predominantly commercial objectives; (b) ensuring that
the development task is shared by the private sector so as to introduce greater efficiency through
competition and reduce the financial and managerial burden on the Government and PLN; and
(c) changing the regulatory framework to empower public and private institutions including
cooperatives in the sector to perform to their full potential.
3.11       Continuing improvement in PLN's efficiency in constructing, operating and
maintaining the electricity infrastructure still remains a major challenge since PLN will continue
to have a dominant role in the sector development for many more years. Considering that only
40 percent of the over 60,000 villages in the country have access to electricity, a large program
of development with social content remains an important part of the Government's strategy for
improving the welfare of the people. PLN is the only institution with the capability and
motivation for implementing the task. Similarly, the expansion of the generating capacity by



- 20 -
about 20,000 MW during the next 10 years is a large task that will need the technical and
funancial resources of both the private and the public sector. PLN's weaknesses are currently
perceived in its inability to meet all the economic demand in a timely manner and have service
reliability of a high standard. An appropriate institutional response to both these problems is a
reorganization of PLN that provides greater autonomiy to its regional units and leads to
progressive corporatization of the more efficiently organized units such as generadon,
transmission and distribution in Java. The required institutional measures were discussed in the
Bank's report on Power Sector Institudonal Development Review of December 1989. Under the
Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND) it was agreed that such reorganization of PLN
will be carried out and implemented over a three year period ending June 30, 1995. Action
plans for the implementation are currently being finalized and expert assistance to PLN is being
provided using funds from that loan (para. 4.7). Also, technical assistance is in progress to
strengthen PLN's corporate and financial planning and accounting functions; funded by the
Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND). Various initiatives included in that project
have succeeded in improving several efficiency indicators of PLN, e.g., during 1986/87-1991/92
system transmission and distribution losses reduced from about 20 percent to about 14 percent,
capacity utilization improved from 55 percent to 67 percent, sales per employee increased from
287 MWh to 584 MWh, and overall consumers' accounts receivable reduced from 48 to 37 day's
sales (para. 4.4). Targets have been set for further improvemnent in these indicators for the next
five years in the PLN's corporate plan (para. 6.22). Further improvements in efficiency are
sought under this project (para. 4.5).
3.12      PLN is an autonomous corporation defined under the Electricity Act (1985) and the
Govemrnent Regulation (No. 17 of 1990). It is fully responsible for all aspects of the
construction operation and maintenance of its facilities (para 2.1). Its budget is approved by the
Government annually; the approval requires PLN to achieve a set of agreed objectives.
However, the Government exercises close control over several key areas of PLN's operations.
For example, electricity pricing has to be approved by the Government and there is no
mechanism for passing through variations in input costs such as those for fuel, in a timely
manner. Over the past few years PLN has been made free to select and recruit all its staff.
Although the staff salary and benefit structure has to be approved by the Minister of Mines and
Energy, the Governmuent has enabled PLN to increase its level of remuneration beyond that of
the Government employees to reduce differential from the market level and to enable it to attract
and retain qualified staff. The capital structure of PLN is closely controlled by the Government
who provides equity without any expectation of return on equity. However, there is currntly
emphasis on the financial performance and the Government has endeavored to make PLN
profitable and comply with the financial performance targets agreed with the Bank and other
institutional lenders. The Government guarantees PLN's borrowing but since 1992 the
Government has decided not to subsidize any new borrowings. PLN has also begun to raise
funds in the capital market through issuance of bonds. In order to introduce transaey in the
accunting of the cost for socially directed activities such as rural electrification that PLN is
required to pursue, an accounting system is being developed (paras. 4.12 and 4.14) to identify
the cost and subsidy required for such social activities. While privatization of PLN is not
currently on the agenda, steps for further conmnercialization are being pursued in the Bank's
dialogue with the Government on the above issues (paras 6.8 and 6.23).
3.13       Efficient pricing of electricity and fuels is an important objective that is pursued in
order to promote efficiency in consumption, conservation and resource mobilizadon. The Bank's
work in the sector is continuing to emphasize the importance of pricing from all these aspects.



- 21 -
Consequently, the prevailing (effective February 1, 1993) average selling price of electricity of
Rp. 150.5 per kWh (US cents 7.3) is close to the estimated average long-term marginal cost of
supply of about Rp. 168 per kWh (para 6.17). The average selling price does not include
connection fees paid by consumers. Maintaining the prices at the desired level has so far been
carried out by the Goverrnent through annual reviews and administrative approval. Currently,
the Bank is advocating the introduction of formula based tariff adjustments that would allow cost
increases due to changes in fuel price, and inflation to be automatically passed through during
the period between biannual reviews, while providing for efficiency improvements. A report
on this subject is currently under consideration by the Government (para. 6.9). On the front of
the pricing of primary fuels, the latest revision of the petroleum product prices in January 1993
has brought the price of all products except kerosene, at or above efficiency prices. Kerosene
price is still about 30 percent below the efficiency price, but the subsidy is being compensated
by the higher price of gasoline for automobile use (paras 1.5 and 3.8). The price of coal is
determined by the market. The price of the natural gas is above its economic costs for most
users, main exceptions being fertilizer and steel industries owned by the Government. The Bank
is prompting the Government to correct this situation as well. A recently completed study by
the Bank (Natural Gas Development Planning Study of July 1992) was discussed with the
Government; it is planned to follow it up by a "Gas Development Project" that will address the
pricing and the institutional issues (pam. 1.09).
3.14       Promoting the involvement of the private sector in the electricity sector is another
main objective that is being pursued by the Bank- in its dialogue with the GOI. Currendy, the
private sector provides a variety of services to PLN such as construcon of its facilities, serving
as contractors for a number of operations and maintenance activities, and providing services such
as meter reading, bill collection and distribution lines maintenance. The Government has also
earmarked a number of generating projects, totalling about 6,000 MW capacity, for the private
sector investment, on Build, Own and Operate (BOO) basis. The Bank is providing technical
assistance to the "Private Power Team" of the Ministry of Mines & Energy to negotiate the first
project at Paiton in East Java consisting of the construction of 2 x 600 MW coal-fired thermal
units (para. 2.11). The Bank has also promoted the concept of greater involvement of the
private sector in the rural electrification program, through cooperatives and organizations of the
beneficiary communities. The ongoing Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) includes
components to reduce cost of rural electrification, promote day time and productive use of
electricity, and the development and training of personnel from rural cooperatives to take up a
larger role in the program. A second Rural Electrification Project, currently under preparation
will build on the experience gained from the ongoing project (para. 1.18). Other areas of private
sector involvement are cogenerationby industries, purchase of electricity from captive generators
licensing private generation in industrial estates and franchising geographical areas to licencees
to generate and/or distribute electricity. Also, the Govermment is encouraging private sector
participation by facilitating the sale of power to the grid from unsolicited power projects, as well
as the wheeling of such power supplies through the grid to third parties. In order to accelerate
these developments, the Bank is assisting in the reform of the regulatory framework in the sector
(para. 3.15).
3.15       On the regulatory side, a special Presidential Decree (No. 37/1992) was issued in
June 1992, to clarify the role of the private sector in the electric power sector. In addition,
some changes in the existing regulations are needed to promote greater efficiency in the sector.
The Bank is currently carrying out a study of the organizational, institutional and regulatory
framework in the sector. The study is funded by a grant from the Government of Norway and



-22 -
will discuss options for reform in the structure, institutional set-up and regulation of the sector.
The report is expected to be discussed with the Government in May/June 1993. The proposed
project provides for funds for technical aistance to Government to fiuther define and implement
the changes in regulations that are agreed (paras. 4.8 and 5.23).
3.16      The Bank along with USAID and ADB, has also increased its focus on the demand
side management and conservation activities (paras 2.18-2.20). The Bank's role in the proposed
project and in future projects will be to provide the Government with policy analysis and
technical assistance for the introduction of the required changes, while still supporting actions
to improve PLN's efficiency and implement economic investment projects to build the required
infrasructure.

THE BENEFICRY
4.1       The proposed loan would be made to the Government of Indonesia (GOI). The
proceeds of the proposed loan, except for a part for technical assistance to GOI for carrying out
policy support studies to be managed by DGEED, would be onlent to PLN (para. 5.29), which
is responsible for the implementation of the proposed project. PLN, the sole govermment-owned
national power utility, has been the beneficiary of Bank Group lending to the power sector in
Indonesia since 1969 (para. 3.1).
PLN's Organization and  Ignent
4.2        PLN was established as a public corporation (Perum) under Government Regulation
No. 18 of 1972, with responsibility for the generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity, and the planning, construction and operation of electricity supply facilities. That
governing Regulation No. 18 was amended by Govermment Regulation No. 54 of 1981, and
superseded by Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990. PLN is managed by a Board of
Directors headed by a President Director, who is appointed by the President and is accountable
to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The President Director has authority for all operations
of PLN. The Board currently includes five other directors with functional responsibility,
respectively, for planning, construction, operations, finance and administration. Operational
responsibility devolves upon 18 regions, and responsibility for major construction upon 13
project managers. Also reporting to the Board are several staff units responsible for power
research, education and training, management services, an internal audit unit called the
Corporation Inspectorate, the Java-Bali system operation and control unit, and an Engineering
Services Center (PPE). PLN's organization chart is shown in Annex 4.1. PLN's management
consists of dedicated professional staff of proven competence. Most of the managerial staff have
many years of experience in various facets of the company's operations. The staff morale is
generaUy high and the turnover low.
Institutional Development
4.3       PLN has grown rapidly in the past decade (para. 2.2). Since 1977/78, it has
connected new consumers at an increasing rate, from about 370,000 in 1978/79 to about 933,000
in 1991192. The rapid expansion of supply facilities, which is expected to continue over the next
several years, involves increasingly complex technical and managerial tasks, for which PLN will
need to continue to strengthen its insutional capacity. Areas that need strengthening have been
recognized, and actions and programs are either already underway or planned, in many cases
with assistance from the Bank. These include corporate and financial planning, general



- 24 -
accounting, inventory management, distribution management, consumer administration,
transmission reliability and manpower developmen.
4.4       In the area of operations, the main emphasis rests on improving the planning,
operation, maitenance and management of distrbution facilities. Under the Power Sector
Efficiency Project (Loans 3097-IND), PLN agreed to carry out an action plan for efficiency
improvements, which is under implementation. The major components of this action plan are:
(i) efficiency improvement in distribution including improvement in reliability; (ii) improving
corporate and financial planning and accounting; (iii) improvements in the operation of major
thermal power plants; (iv) improvements in the operation and maintenance of diesel power
plants; and (v) renovation of small hydro plants.  The inefficiencies in the distribution
management are considered to be one of the major problems facing PLN. These are manifested
in the form of high losses, low reliability of supply, long waiting lists and inadequate
information systems. PLN's distribution management functions are being strengthened through
technical assistance being provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND).
The consultants have prepared and presented to PLN a number of programs that need to be
implemented over the next few years. These include: (i) changes in the organization dealing
with distribution at the district level, manpower training and matpower development; (ii)
development of information system and mapping; (iii) improvement in planning, construction,
materials management and design standards; (iv) changes in consumer administration, meter
reading and billing procedures; (v) improving cosmmications and maintenance facilities and
reporting systems; and (vi) loss reduction. Actions have been initiated on some of these
activides. Technical assistance providedunder the Rural ElectrificationProject (Loan 318-IND)
will help improve the planning of rural electrification subsector development. Also, PLN's
corporate planning and financial planning functions are being developed further with technical
assistance provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND). Annex 4.2
shows some of the performance indicators for PLN for the years 1980/81 to 1991/92; they
indicate significant achievements in several areas. Specifically, manpower productivity improved
from a sale of 223 MWh per employee in 1983/84 to 584 MWh per employee in 1991/92, partly
due to subcontracting to private contractors for services such as meter reading and bill collection
(pam. 3.14); operating ratio improved from 102 to 84, and transmission and distribution losses
reduced from 20.8 percent to 14.1 percent, in the same period.
4.5       The areas that need closer attention of PLN are now (a) the efficiency of the
distribution system, to improve service reliability; and (b) the inadequacy of the transmission and
distribution network that has resulted in long lists of consumers waiting for supply. In order for
PLN to achieve quantitative ard monitorable improvements in these areas, agreement was
reace  ring the negotiations of the proposed loan, that PLN shall: (a) by October 31, 1993,
formulate and submit to the Bank, for its review and comments, proposals and action plans for:
(t) creating a databose for service reiabily and consumer waidng lists in its operations; and
(ii) improving servce reliabiltty and reducing consumer waiting lists in its operations; and
(b) tiereafter, implement the said action plans taing into account the commnus, if any, by the
Bank, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
4.6       To provide a broader framework and longer-term perspectve for the institutional
development of the power sector, the Bank carried out a Power Sector Institutional Development
Review (Report No. 7929-IND, dated December 20, 1989). The objective of the review was
to identify the regulatory and institutional conditions under which the continued rapid expansion
of the sector could be carried out with the greatest efficiency and effectivenss. The results of



- 25 -
the review suggest that the principal condition is the creation of an environment within which
PLN and the other participants in the sector will be motivated to apply their initiative and
creativity to reduce costs and improve sevice in the course of achieving the targeted expansion.
As a general direction, the creation of such an enviroment will require a shift towards greater
reliance on guidance through incentives rather than administrative intervention and on
decetraizd decision-making rather than centalized control, while also taking advantage of the
pressures created through competitive comparison. Based on the r eons of the study,
several issues relating to PLN's finances are being pursued through the proposed project and the
Bank's ongoing dialogue with the GOI. These issues include (a) electricity tariff, including its
periodic adjustment (paras. 2.14 and 6.9); (b) financing of investment program (para. 2.15); and
bearing of fill cost of capital by PLN (para. 6.23). In addition, initiatives are ujderway to
define and implement changes in the ins"tional framework and reguation of the power sector,
and the corporate structure of PLN (paras. 4.7 and 4.8).
4.7       To follow-up on the ro nions of the Bank's Power Sector Institutional
Development Review (para. 4.6), PLN has conducted a study to define the organizational
changes necessary for managing its operations more efficiendy and develop a plan of action to
implement these changes. The main elements of the plan consist of (a) providing greater
autonomy to the regional units for distribution management; (b) strngthening regional units for
planning and consumer administidon, and improving cutomer relations and billing;
(c) modifying budgetary procedures to enable the budget to be a management tool;
(d) introducing the concept of cost per kWh sold as a primary measure of performance;
(e) combining generation and transmission fiunctions in Java under one manager; (f) providing
semi-autonomous status to the four Distribution Units in Java; (g) simplifying and delizing
procurement; and (h) imple     a manpower devepment program. The Bank has reviewed
PLN's draft proposals on the actions required to implement these initiatives. As agreed under
the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND), detailed action plans for implementation
were submitted by PLN to the Bank, and have been reviewed and discussed in April 1993. The
implementtion will commence soon, and the program is expected to be implemented in about
three years. Highest priority is bemg given to actions (e) and (f), for their completion by
December 31, 1994. The Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND) provides for
technical assistance to PLN in implementing the proposed actions.
4.8       The institutional measures discussed above are a prerequisite first steps towards
achieving the objective of cm ralon and corporatization of PLN. Concurrently, the
need is also recognized for evolving an institutional suctre and regulatory framework in the
sector that will promote competition and greater private sector participation in the areas of
generation and distribution of electricity. Such a development is necesary to mobilize requisite
resources for the continued expansion and efficient operation of the sector. In order to achieve
these objectives, a study (tided "Institutional Framework and Regulation of the Power Sector in
Indonesia") is being carried out by the Bank with the assistance of consultants, using Norwegian
trust funds, to define an appropriate institutional structure including the role of PLN and its
institutional arrangements, and also the roles of the private sector and cooperatives. The study
would also recommend necessary changes in the regulatory framework to facilitate the
implementation of a long-term sector development strategy. During the negotiations of the
proposed loan, underst uings were readed with the Govenment and PLN that they would
jointly discuss with the Bank the report on Insttutond Framework and Regulation of the Power
Sector in Indonesia, and that GOI would provide to the Bank by October 31, 1993 its proposals
for basic eleme of sectorfrwneworko nd a planforfunher acton, for the Bank's review and



- 26 -
comments. The proposed project provides technical assistance to the Government for further
studies and implementation of the changes in the regulatory framework (para. 5.23).
Staff Development and Trng
4.9       As of March 31, 1992, PLN had53,882 employees, of whom42,194arepermanent
staff. PLN has no difficulty in recruiting staff educated at levels up to technical high school,
but faces constraints in recruiting those with higher academic qualifications. Less than 5 percent
of its staff have university degrees, which is low by utility standards. To address its training
needs, PLN has a separate training department that plays an important role in PLN's efforts to
upgrade the skills of its technical and administrative staff. These efforts have been largely
successful. In 1991/92, about 9,260 staff received training-about 9,105 received training
domestically and about 155 abroad.
4.10      The Bank has supported PLN's training activities and human resources development
efforts, including the establishment of several training centers. Current efforts being supported
by the Bank include training in the areas of diesel/thermal plant operations, distribution
management, corporate and financial planning, general accounting and cash management, as well
as specific training activities in the rural electrification area and in public utility practices.
Accountin and Budgetin
4.11      PLN's accounting system, installed in the early 1970s, follows generally accepted
accounting principles, and normal utility practices, but it needs upgrading to keep pace with the
growing complexity and volume of accounting transactions. There is need for improvement with
respect to the completeness and accuracy of fixed asset accounting, depreciation, inventory
accounting and accounts receivables. The accounting system needs to produce more accurate
information in a timely manner for decision-malcing purposes. Also, PLN's internal procedures
for preparing budgets and monitoring actual expenditres need to be strengthened through better
coordination among and participation by the various functional directorates and regional offices
in the process, to enhance the budget's value as a management tool.
4.12      A major constraint to PLN's accounting has been a lack of trained senior
accountants and uniform application of accounting procedures. Since 1987, PLN has been
implementing an action plan to improve its accouning practices and functions by (i) establishing
a uniform accounting system, (ii) improving related support systems, (iii) sensitizing concerned
nonfinancial managers and staff to the importance of timely and accurate accountmng,
(iv) upgrading the skills of the accounting staff through in-house and external training courses,
and (v) computerizing the accounting process. PLN is also attempting to improve coordination
between its departments and its regional offices in the areas of budget preparation, and
monitoring and evaluation of performance. Technical assistance is provided under the Power
Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND) to improve the accounting system. The Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) provides technical assistance to continue to enhance the
system for the segregation of PLN's accounting of its RE operations.
Billing and Coietfions
4.13      PLN's bills are computerized and prepared monthly at the Jakarta headquarters.
Overall collection performance is generally satisfactory. The receivables position of general



- 27-
consumer accounts has been good, as it has been kept below one and one-half months of the
yearly billing. The overdues from government users (including the Armed Forces and local
governments), which account for about 10 percent of PLN's total sales, have also been
maintained to under two months' billing.
Audit and Inernal Control
4.14       PLN's accouns are required by its charter to be audited by Govenment auditors.
The audits are carried out following geneci1ll accepted accounting practices and standards. The
audit reports in recent years had received qualif?Wd opinions from the auditors, most recently
with respect to the inventory accounts. PLN has made substantial improvements in the areas
commented upon by the auditors. In the reports for 1989/90 through 1991/92 there were no
qualifications. PLN makes special efforts to expedite the closing of accounts and has succeeded
in completing them usually within six months after the close of the fiscal year, as stipulted by
Government for all public corporations. While the unaudited accounts were generally finalized
and received in time by the Bank, there had been delays in the auditing of accounts. As a result
of joint efforts by PLN and its auditors, the time required for completing PLN's audits has been
reduced significantly. For 1991/92, the accounts were finalized in four months after the closing
of the fiscal year and the audited accounts were available within five months of the close of the
fiscal year. PLN's audited accounts are henceforth expected to be available within six months
of the close of fiscal year. During the negotiatons of the proposed loan, agreement was reached
that PLN would submit to the Bank its auditedfinancid statements and the report of such audits
no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. In addition, PLN would furnish to
the Bank (i) a copy of its unaudited annual accounts whenever they are sent to the auditors; and
(ii) its segregated financial and operating information on rural activities within six months after
the end of each fiscal year.
4.15       PLN has an effective internal audit group which reports to the President Director
for various special investigations, in addition to keeping general and project accounting matters
under review.
ibsrace
4.16       PLN currentiy carries transit and marine insurance on equipment and materials in
transit. Projects under construction are covered by the contractor's all risk and erection
insurance. Fire and other hazards on most of the assets in operation are self-insured. In view
of the geographical spread of PLN's assets, any single loss would be relatively small by
comparison with total assets and operations, and this policy has been considered satisfactory by
the Bank. However, with some very large projects having been completed in recent years and
others now under implementation, there would be a greater concentration of assets in certain
locations than in the past. An understanding was reached under Loans 3097-IND and 3098-IND
that major works, plant and equipment at large power projects would be insured with outside
agencies. Accordingly, PLN is curently carrying commercial insurance for major operating
plants and equipment at several large power projects totalling about 4,900 MW, in and outside
Java. PLN is also considering proposals for creating a fimd for self-insurance of the remaining
assets.

THE PROJECT
Backrounld
5.1       The Cirata Hydroelectric Development is located in West Java on the Citarum
River, the third largest river in Java. The Bawk's involvement in hydroelectric development of
the Citarum River dates back to 1981, with the financing under the Sixth Power Project (Loan
1365-IND), of the feasibility studies for the Saguling and Cirata developments. That was
followed by the financing of the Saguling development under the Tenth Power Project (Loan
1950-IND) and Phase I of the Cirata development under the Thirteenth Power Project (Loan
2300-IND). In determining the installed capacity for Cirata, it was recognized that ultimately
it could provide economical peaking capacity to the grid, given its low incremental capacity cost,
and proximity to the main load center. It was concluded that, ultimately, 1000 MW of
generating capacity could be supported by available hydro energy. However, consistent with the
growth of base load thermal generation capacity, an initial capacity of 500 MW (4 x 125 MW
units) was selected, and substantial provisions were implemented in the initial project for future
addition of 500 MW. They included the construction of the underground powerhouse cavem
to accommodate the additional 4 x 125 MW units under Phase II of the project, which constitute
the investment component of the proposed project.
Rationale for Bank hvmolvement
5.2       To date, Bank involvement in the Citarum hydro development has encouraged
rational, responsible and environmentally safe and sustainable development of Indonesian hydro
resources. The proposed project is an appropriate vehicle for continuing the support of such
development, both through the Cirata extension, upgrading of PLN's environmental monitoring
capabilities particularly in relation to reservoirs, and through hydro inventory studies aimed at
identification of appropriate projects to enter the preparation pipeliie based on PLN's current
needs. In addition, institutional development objectives of the project are an integral part of the
Bank's broader strategy to develop PLN into a modern, commercially-oriented utility, that
reliably and efficiently meets the electricity needs of Indonesia.

5.3       The objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) provide economical and
environmentally sound expamsion of PLN's peaking electricity generation capacity in Java and
improve service reliability; (b) update hydro inventories and carry out pre-feasibility studies for



- 29 -
promising hydroelectric schemes; (c) strengthen PLN's capability in the planning, investigation
and operation of hydroelectric schemes and in environmental management of power projects; (d)
study options for enhancing the environmental conditions inthe area of PLN's existing reservoirs
on the Citarun River. The institutional and sectoral objectives include: (a) strengthening of
PLN's financial position; (b) enhancing the dialogue on introducing a mechanism for formula-
based adjustment of electricity price; and (c) continuing the process of institutional restructuring
of PLN to provide for greater decentralizon, delegation and commercialization.
Projec Descipdon
5.4        The first stage (Phase I) of the Cirata project was constructed, with Bank assistance
(Loan 2300-IND), over the period 1983-88. It consists of a 125 m high rockfill dam and 3.9
million n' reservoir on the Citarun River, with intake structures and power tunnels delivering
water, at a head of A12.5 m to four 125 MW generating units installed in an underground
powerhouse, before discharging back into the river. The proposed project would include:
(a) implementation of Phase II of the Cirata hydroelectric development consisting of:
(i) construction of two 690 m x 8.4 ni diameter headrace tunnels, two surge
shafts 80 m x 18.6 m diameter, four steel lined penstock tunnels 200 m
x 5.2 m diameter, and four tailrace tunnels 138 m x 6.4 m diameter, with
associated outlet structures;
(ii) installation, within the existing cavern of the powerhouse of four
additional units each of 125 MW, including turbines, generators,
governors, regulator and control equipment; and
(iii) installation of transformers and switchgear for connection to the grid.
(b)  consulting services for the engineerng and construction supervision of the Cirata
Hydroelectric Phase II development;
(c)  studies to upgrade hydrological and environmental data bases, and improve data
collection practices;
(d)  studies to update PLN's hydroelectric inventories, and determine pre-feasibility of
selected schemes;
(e)  studies to identify options to enhance environmental conditions in the existing PLN
reservoirs on the Citarum River, and training of PLN staff in enviromnental
management (in relation to both hydro and thermal power projects);
(f)  training in dam safety and insumentation monitoring;
(g)  power sector institutional and regulatory framework studies for GOI;



- 30 -
(h) studies aimed at assisting GOI to determine a long-term strategy for financing
power sector investments; and
(i)  preconstruction stage engineering services for the Besai hydroelectric project in
South Sumatra.
Status of Devdopment of the Citun River
5.5        There are three major reservoirs with associated hydroelectric powerhouses on the
Citarun River; namely, Saguling, Cirata and Jadluhur. Jatiluhur, the furthest downstream was
developed in 1964 primarily for irrigation. Its 150 MW powerhouse provides about 820 GWh
of electricity per year to the PLN system. Saguling (700 MW, 2156 GWh) and Cirata Phase
1 (500 MW, 1424 GWh) constructed by PLN with Bank assistance, were completed in 1985 and
1988 respectively. Planning studies leading to the development plan for the Citarm river basin
are summarized in Annex 5.1. Salient features of the Cirata Phase II development are included
in Annex 5.2. No additional energy would be generated as a result of the 500 MW addition to
Cirata. Instead, the available energy would be concentrated into four hours daily in the peak
load period. This method of operation is described in more detail in para 7.4 and Annex 7.1.
Status of Preparation of Cirata Hydroelectric Phase II Project
5.6        Provisions in the Cirata Phase I project for future extension included (i) intake
srres, complete with gates and stoplogs serviced by an existing gantry crane; (ii)
underground powerhouse cavern, to accommodate the four units of Phase U, and (iii) short
lengths of power tunnels adjacent to intake structures and powerhouse. Furthermore, in
preparation for the project, PLN awarded contracts for fabrication of turbine spiral cases for the
Phase II units, and this work is now complete. PLN has also awarded a contract for the only
access road required (to the ventilation adit), and for base camp extensions. All land acquisition
for access roads, location of transmission towers, and switchyard extension is complete.
5.7        Final designs and bid documents, largely based on those for Phase 1, have been
prepared by PLN with assistance from foreign consultants. Prequalification of civil works
contractors has been completed and bids will be invited shortly. To date, PLN has been assisted
by consultants under a pre-construction engineering contract financed by PLN. Consultants have
been selected for the constucdon supervision phase of the proposed project.
5.8        Considerable geotechnical investigations were conducted in support of the Stage II
design process. These included 56 diamond drill holes with a total length of 3430 m.
Information from this program was supplemented by a complete review of rock conditions
encountered during the Phase I tunnelling. These investigations have led to an unusually high
degree of certainty of the geological conditions to be expected in the tunnels.
De A
5.9        Geology. Headrace tunnels will be driven through alternating beds of tuff breccia
and sandstone. The tuff breccia is intact and massive while the sandstone is fresh and well
layered. Favorable tunneling conditions are expected, with temporary support limited to
shotcrete and bolting. Por the large diamete surge shafts, rock conditions are expected to be
similar both to the headrame tunnel and the Phase I surge shafts. Temporary support as used for



- 31 -
Phase I, consisting of prestressed anchors, shotcrete and rock bolts, has therefore been assumed.
Favorable rock conditions in similar strata are also expected in the penstock and tailrace tunnels.
Again, support would be limited to shotcrete and bolting except near the tailrace portals, where
consolidation work and heavier support are expected. Geological conditions at the portals appear
to be considerably better than those encountered in the outlet area of Phase I.
5.10       Consucatn Materials. The existig andesite quarry will provide favorable
aggregates meeting the specifications. No significant problems are expected to be encountered.
5.11       Hydrology. No significant additional energy will be generated under Cirata Phase
H. With the additional capacity, energy generation will be largely concentrated in the four hour
peak period every day, thus enabling better utilization of the base load capacity. Cirata energy
estimates, derived in the Saguling/Cirata feasibility studies, were based on a 62 year series of
discharge data, indicating a very high degree of reliability of estimates. During its first six full
years of operation, Sagu}ing generated an average annual energy of 2,147 GWh, in comparison
with feasibility study long-term estimates of 2,156 GWh, despite an abnormally dry year in
1991/92, apparently associated with the El Nino climatic disturbance. This provides further
confirmation of the reliability and probable conservatism of the hydrological estimates for the
basin as a whole.
5.12       Sedimeon. Saguling/Cirata feasibility study esfimates indicated an average rate
of catchment erosion in the Citarum catchment of 1.5 mm per year, with the catchment above
Saguling yielding 1.2 mm per year. It was firther estimated that about 95 percent of the
sediment originating above Saguling would be trapped in the Saguling reservoir. Based on these
sediment rnoffs, sediment aggradation in Cirata reservoir was projected to begin to impair
seonal regulation after about 50 years with significant enoachment on live storage after about
100 years. Live storage was projected to fill after a further 60 years, after which generation
would be on a run of river basis. Measurements of sediment deposition in Saguling over the 6
1/2 years since reservoir filling have indicated an average deposition of about 0.9 mm, in
comparison with the 1.14 mm expected, indicating that feasibility study estimates were
conservative. Initial deposition surveys for Cirata have indicated a similar trend. A very long
life for the Cirata reservoir is therefore projected.
Envhronental Aspects
5.13       The existing Cirata dam, the related reservoir and an underground powerhouse that
contains 4 x 125 MW generating units, were all constucted under the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase
I development financed under the Thirteenth Power Project (Loan 2300-IND). Since the Cirata
Hydroelectric Phase II Project represents an underground extension of an existing project,
environmental impacts are not significant. Permanent works above the surface are limited to
extension of existing tailrace outlet structures and switch yard. Some surface areas will be
required for contractors' use and access, but these are not expected to exceed 10 ha in total.
PLN already owns suitable land for this purpose, and no resettlement of families/households is
required. The power station draws water from an existing reservoir and discharges slightly
upstream of another existing reservoir. Therefore the effect of concentrating flows during the
day will have no significant effect on existing riverine and lacustrine environments.
Environmental management, therefore, is primarily during the construction period with
appropriate provisions included in the bid documents for such aspects as: erosion control for
access roads and temporary works, disposal of uumel excavation muck and other spoil in existing



-32 -
disposal areas, potable water supply, waste disposal, health and amenities in contractors'
temporary camps and facilities. A total of about 2 ha of land in several parcels, required for
switchyard extension and location of transmission towers, has been acquired. This is low
productivity land for which compensation has been provided to 17 owner families at a rate of
Rp 2,000 per square meter. None of the affected 17 families needed to be relocated, since the
land acquired from them did not constitute their place of residence or a major source of
livelihood. With the amount of compensation paid, several of such families have already
purchased more productive land of comparable size. The project was approved by the Central
Commission for Envirownent, Ministry of Mines and Energy on January 26, 1993, for
implementation. A technical assistance component for studies relating to the environmental
conditions and management of PLN's existing reservoirs is also included in the project (para
5.21).
Implementton
5.14       Constuction Ar       ts.  PLN has appointed a project manager for the
construction of the hydroelectric plant, and a manager for each contract. The functions of the
"engineer" as defined by the FIDIC conditions of cotract will be assigned to fully experienced
international consultants with local associates. The consultants will be appointed in accordance
with the Barn's guidelines for the use of consultants. The construction organization will be
modelled on that successfully employed for the Saguling and Cirata Phase I projects.
5.15         pmta    Schee. A summary implementation schedule is included as
Annex 5.3. The critical path for implementation of the project passes through prequalification,
bidding and award of civil works contract, construction of penstock tunnel and installation of
steel lining. However, there are a nmiber of other potentially critical paths, and close schedule
control will be essental throughout the construction period. Bids for the civil works contract
are scheduled to be received in June 1993, contracts awarded in December 1993, and works
completed by August 31, 1997. Units 5 and 6 will be commissioned by April 30, 1997, and
Units 7 and 8 by August 31,1997.
Technical Asssne
5.16       The technical assistance components of the project consist of (a) assistance to PLN
in preparation of construction drawings and supervision of construction of the Cirata Phase II
component; (b) studies to upgrade hydrological and enviromnental data bases, and improve data
collection practices; (c) studies to update PLN's hydroelectric inventories, and carry out pre-
feasibility studies of selected schemes; (d) studies to identify options to enhance environmental
conditions in the existing PLN reservoirs on the Citarum River, and training in environmental
management; (e) training in dam safety and instrumentation monitoring; (f) regulatory framework
studies for GOI; (g) studies aimed at assisting GOI to determine the optimal financing strategy
for power system expansion, and (h) pre-construction stage engineering services for the Besai
hydroelectric project.
5.17       E    e      and Constructn Supervision.  The consultant will fulfil the
functions of the "engineer" as defined by the FIDIC conditions of contract. About 600 staff
months of foreign consultants, and 700 staff months of local consultants time are estimated to
be required.

5.18      Data Base Upgrading. The overall objective of this study is to improve the quality
and availability of the data required for hydro inventory and hydro preparation studies through
data base upgrading and data collection improvements. The data base upgrading will consist of
the establishment of a computerized archiving data base of climatic, hydrologic, and
environmental data (for primary and secondary data collected by PLN) within the framework of
long term plans for national date base upgrading, and training of PLN staff in its operation and
maintenance. The data collection component will consist of a review of PLN procedures for the
collection of hydrologic, climatic and environmental data and of the design of the PLN
hydrologic network, leading to recommendations for improvement, and training of PLN staff in
data collection procedures. Terms of reference for this study are included in Annex 5.4.
5.19      Hydro Inventory and Prefeasibility Studies. PLN's hydro inventory was last
updated in 1983. Since that time there have been a number of developments including the
completion of 1 in 50,000 mapping for Sumatra, completion of a number of pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies, including those financed under Loan 2300-IND and upgrading of the hydro-
meteorological network financed under the same loan. There has also been a high rate of
demand growth and interconnection of isolated networks, with consideration also being given to
further large scale connections, such as a Java-Sumara interconnection being studied under the
Sualaya Thermal Power Project. In addition, with large scale additions of base load plant in
the Java-Bali system, and limited possibilities for future hydro development, pumped storage
developments offer potential for economic peaking power. In this context, the project will
include a re-assessment of hydro/pumped storage inventories, with the following objectives:
(a)  update hydroelectric and pumped storage inventories taking into account
developments since completion of previous studies;
(b)  formulation of a long term strategy for hydro-resource development consistent with
Government long term objectives in relation to Indonesia's energy resources, and
the relative economics of hydropower in comparison to fossil fuel based power
production;
(c)  identification of priority schemes for preparation, and carrying out of investigations
and studies up to prefeasibility level for selected schemes;
(d)  identification of suitable candidates for implementation through a shortcut design
and construct process following feasibility studies;
(e) strengthening of the hydro-planning group within PLN (Survey Division,
Directorate of Planning) so that they have the capability and resources to carry out
this type of work on a continuous basis;
(f)  strengthening the capabilities of the national consulting industry in this field, so that
they are capable of supporting PLN in such studies in the long term.
5.20      Terms of reference for the inventory studies are included in Annex 5.5.
5.21      Envhronmental Studies. The expansion of the Cirata hydropower plant does not
pose any significant negative environmental impacts. Also, the sustainability of the existing or
proposed expansion is not affected by environmental factors. However, the Citarum River



- 34 -
reservoirs (Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur) are being polluted due to the discharge into the river
system of effluent from urban, industrial and agricultural activities. The pollution is not caused,
nor can it be controlled by PLN, and abatement measures are also outside its jurisdiction.
However, since PLN wishes to insure the long term sustainability of its reservoirs, it is in its
interest to obtain a better understanding of the sources of pollution, its effects on PLN
reservoirs, and appropriate methods of reservoir management to minimize its effects. Therefore,
under the proposed project, a study (with terms of reference in Annex 5.6) wiUl be undertaken
to:
(a)  review PLN's water quality monitoring program for the Cirata river, with the
objectives of obtaining a better understanding of the sources of major pollutants,
their effect on PLN reservoirs, and to provide calibration data for reservoir models;
(b)  develop and calibrate mathematical models of the PLN reservoirs, to help establish
biological assimilative capacity, enable prediction of the effectiveness of pollution
control measures, provide better predictions of stratification and seasonal de-
stratification, and enable definition of measures to minimize the effects of the latter
on fisheries;
(c) obtain a better definition of factors which lead to fish kills during reservoir de-
stratification, and to define mitigation measures that will minimize them;
(d)  identify the major sources of floating wastes, the removal and disposal of which
accounts for a large proportion of PLN's maintenance expenditures.
Representations would then be made to appropriate authorities to deal with the
problem at its source;
(e) study practices in rural/urban communities bordering the Saguling and Cirata
reservoirs which impact on reservoir management and water quality (e.g. sewage
and solid waste disposal, erosion protection and fertilizer use), with the aim of
identifying measures that could inexpensive!y reduce impacts, which could be
brought to the attention of the responsible authorities;
(    training of PLN staff in environmental management in relation to both hydroelectric
and thermal power plants.
5.22       Dam Safety and Instrumentation Monitoring. PLN has several dams which are
categorized as large dams under the ICOLD definition, including the 99 m high Saguling and
125 m high Cirata rockfill dams. Para 5.37 discusses the proposed strengteing of PLN dam
safety procedures.  Training of PLN staff in dam safety inspections and instmenation
monitoring, to enable them to fulfil their role in the upgraded procedures will be carried out
under the project. Terms of reference are included in Annex 5.7.
5.23       Insfitutional and Reguatory Framework Studies. A study is currently underway
(funded by a grant from the Governmmit of Norway, and managed by the Bank), to analyze the
current status the regulatory and institutional structure of the power sector in Indonesia, the
models and experience in other counties, and recommend an institutional and ownership
structure, and an appropriate regulatory framework of the power sector (pan. 4.8). The



- 35 -
proposed project provides for technical assistance to GOI in carrying out fiurher studies and
implement actions in this area.
5.24       FInabncng Strateg  Study. The investment requirements of the power sector are
large, and there is need to formulate a long-term comprehensive financing strategy (paa. 6.22).
The proposed project provides for technical assistance to GOI for a detailed study of this subject
for which draft terms of reference are included in Annex 5.8.
5.25       Pre-Constucon Services Besd  Hydro-Project. The 90 MW Besai hydroelectric
scheme on Sumatra is a component of the proposed Outer Island Power Project. The
consultancy services for the pre-construction stage will be financed under the proposed loan.
The services in this phase cover assistance to PLN in pre-qualification, calling and evaluation
of bids, assistance in supervision of local contracts for preparatory works, establishment of
project management systems, and commencement of construction drawings.
5.26       Table 5.1 shows the allocation of the proceeds of the loan among the various
technical assistance components, excluding that for engineering and construction supervision of
the investment component of the project.

5.29      The proposed Bank loan of $104.0 million equivalent would meet 42.6 percent of
the foreign cost of the project (excluding I)C) or 26.1 percent of project financing requirements.
The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Republic of Indonesia at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate for a 20 year term including five years of grace. GOI ill onlend the
proceeds of the proposed Bank loan, except $2.3 million for technical assistance to GOI for
policy support studies, to PLN under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20 year term includng
five years grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus afee (dfifned in para. 6.22).
The foreign exhange risk will be borne by the Government. Execuion of a suibsidiary loan
agreement between GOI and PLI, satisfactory to the Bak wilU be a condition of effectiveness
of the loan. Cofinancing from Austria, of about US$138 million equivalent, is expected for the
turbine generating equipment, metalworks and transfomers. Other cofinancing is being sought
for the 500 kV switchyard extensions (about US$12 million). During the negotiations of the
proposed loan, an agreement was reached with GOI that cofanang for the twbine generaing
eqWipment, metal works, transformers and 500 kV switchyard extensions mil be secured by
March 31, 1994.

Disbursements
5.32      Retroactive financing in an aggregate amount of $5 million, would be provided
under the loan for expenditures which may be incurred before the date of the loan but after
December 31, 1992, for construction stage engineein services for Cirata Phase II, and for the
pre-construction engineering services for Besai hydroelectric schene, referred to in Para 5.25.
Employment of consultants for these contracts is currently proceeding in accordance with Bank
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. As far as possible, requests for reimburement or direct
payment would be aggregated into withdrawal applications with amounts not less than
US$100,000. Because of the large size of the contracts being financed by the Bank, and
expected payments, there is no need for special account or statement of expenditure facilities.
5.33      The disbursement schedule for the proposed loan is given in Annex 5. 10, together
with the standard disbursement profile for Indonesia power projects. The disbursements against
the loan wiU be somewhat faster than the standard profile, owing to the fact that the Cirata Phase
II is an addition to an existing development; the advanced state of project preparation and
prelimnnary works; and the presence of infstrure constuctd as part of the Cirata Phase I
project. The project is expected to be completed by August 31, 1998, and the loan closing date
will be June 30, 1999.
Monitoring and Reporting
5.34      The terms of reference for engineering consultancy services provide for the
establishment of comprehensive cost control and schedule control systems, using as a base the
cost estimates of Table 5.2 and the implementation and procurement schedules of Annexes 5.3
an 5.9. The quarterly reports produced by the consultants will form the basis of Bank's
monitoring of the hydroelectric plant construction. Monitoring of the technical assistance
components will be carried out with reference to the key dates set out in Annex 5.3. PLN will
be requested to submit a separate quarterly progress report, detailiDg progress on the technical
assistance component.
Operation
5.35      For the Saguling and Cirata dams financed by the Bank under the Tenth and
Thfirtnth Power Projects (Loans 1950-IND and 2300-IND) respectively, PLN has been carrying
out routine maintenance in accordance with progrms agreed by the Bank, together with regular
monitoring of dam instruntation, and head office review of monitoring reports. Also PLN's
Engieerng Services Center (PPE) has formed a group to carry out dam safety inspections of
all PLN's large dams. Dam safety procedures were discussed during appraisal. PLN has
followed procedures satisfctory to the Bank for the inspection of the Saguling and Cirata dams,
and has used a foreign consultant to review the inspection data. PLN has agreed that it would
have no objection to a procedure of having an international panel of experts to review dam
safety. Proposals are also under consideration by the Director General of Water Resources
Development (DGWRD), Ministry of Public Works to establish procedures and panels of experts
for dam safety monitoring for all major dams in the county. At one to two year intervals, PLN
would present a report on its inspections and monitoring in the intervening period, for review
by a panel of experts. The panel would inspect the larger dams and any others where PLN
monitoring had revealed problems. Agreements were reached during the negotiatons of the
proposed loan, that PLN would contine to matain, and have pertodicaly inspecte4 the Carata

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Opatg Result ad  nanel Posion
6.1          PLN's operting results and financial position for 1984/85 to 1991/92 are shown
in the financial statements in Annex 6.1 and are summarized in Table 6.1.
6.2          Prior to 1985/86, in the absence of ROR targets from the intemational lending
institutons, the Government's policy on electricity tariff permitted PLN's operations to function
at or near financial break-even. The Government provided substantial equity contribution
towards PLN's sizeable capital investment during this period. In 1986/87, PLN achieved a
positive rate of reurn (3.4 percent) on net revalued assets and its annu  self-financing rado
(SFR) was 23.0 percent. However, in 1987/88, PLN's financial performance deteriorated
substantally (ROR of -0.2 pecent and SFR of 7 percent). This result was due mainly to the
devaluation of the Indonesian currency in September 1986, price escalation, and substantial
increases in the proportion of oil-based generation in 19871/88 because of the drougt of 1987.
PLN's financial performance showed only marginal improvement in 1988/89. An average
ncrease of about 25 percent m the electricity rates approved by the Government, effective
April 1, 1989, and a subsequent increase in the rates by about 20 percent effective August 1,
1991, restored and improved PLN's profitability from 1989/90 through 1991/92.
6.3          PLN's oprating performance varies considerably at regional levels. PLN's Java
operations, which supply electicity through an n ed   systm, are largely commercially-
oriented and profitable. PLN's outside-Java operations, which are mainly small-scale and
dispersed over a large mnuber of islands, are mostly unprofiable, and have a negative impact
on PLN's overall finances. The selected 1990/91-1991/92 financial indicators for PLN's Java
and outside-Java operations are presented in Table 6.2.
6.4         In 1990191, PLN's Java operations generated an operating profit of Rp 562
billion, with an ROR of about 7.5 percent. The outside-Java operations, however, incurred an
operating loss of Rp 248 billion with an ROR of about -8.3 percen, and thereby reduced PLN's
overall operafing profit to Rp 314 billion, with an ROR of 3.0 percent. In 1991/92, the
operating loss incurred by the outside-Java operations increased to about Rp 273 billion, with
an ROR of -7.6 percent, whereas the Java operations produced an operating profit of Rp 934
billion with an ROR of 11.7 percent. PLN's fiial performance in 1990/91 was adversely
affected by domestic fuel price increases in May 1990 averagmg about 15 percent, which were
not passed through until August 1991, when tariff adjustments were made. The May

1990 increases in fuel prices impacted more severely on the outside-Java operations than the Java
operations, as most electricity generation outside-Java is oil-based, and the diesel oil prices were
increased by 22.5 percent.
FIancal Objecives
6.5              Under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND signed August 26,
1992), PLN was required to: (a) realize for its Java operations, in 1991/92 and each fiscal year
thereafter, an annual ROR of not less than 8 percent on the average net revalued fixed assets in
operation in Java, and (b) for its outside-Java operations, achieve a break-even situation in each
of its fiscal years beginning with fsal year 1993/94, i.e., total revenues equivalent to no less
than the sum of their (i) total operating expenses, and (ii) the amount by which debt service
r uirements exceed the provision for depreciation.
6.6              The principal financial objectives underlying the revenue covenant discussed
above are that PLN should cover its operating expenses, realize positive annual rates of return,

of its aual capital expendiures, and rely mostly on borrowings to fiance the balance,
confinig the Government's contibutions to progam that involve the socially directed activities
such as rural electrification, mainly outside-Java.
Present and Future Peformance
6.7          PLN's financial performance for 1991/92, the estimate for 1992/93 and
projections through 1999/00 and related iwcome saements for its Java and outside-Java
operations are summized in Table 6.3. (Deails are given in Anaex 6.1; notes and assumptions
underlying the projections are given in Annex 6.2). In the projections, for the Java and non-Java
operations the sales growth is based on PLN's demand projections and generation expansion
plans (para. 2.9), and the invesent requrements are based on the proposed investment
program to be implemented by PLN and exclude that proposed to be implemented by private
investors (paras. 2.11 and 2.12)
6.8         To enable PLN to achieve for its Java opera , the covenanted ROR targets
(para. 6.5), GOI approved increases in electricity tariffs by an average of about 20 percent

effecdve August 1, 1991, and by an average of 13 percent effective February 1, 1993. The
Government also increased the petroleum products prices in January 1993, and eliminated
subsidy on diesel oil (pam. 1.5). The price for diesel oil was increased by about 27 percent and
that for fuel oil by about 9 percen. Of the tariff increase of 13 percent effective February 1,



-46 -
1993, 7 percenge points represent pass through of these increases in fuel prices. As most
electricity generation outside-lava is oil-based, the fuel price increases would impact more
severely on the outside-Java operations than the Java operations. PLN is expected to achieve
for its Java operations the ROR target of at least 8 percent in 1992/93 and 1993/94. For the
outside-Java operations the profitability would deteriorate in 1992/93 with operating loss
expected to reach about Rp 453 billion in that year, compared to an operating loss of Rp 273
billion in 1991/92 (parm. 6.4). With the February 1993 iease in electricity prices the outside-
Java operations would show subsial improvement with the operating ratio declining from an
estimated 140 percent in 1992/93 to 115 percent in 1993/94 but not enabling a financial break-
even in that year, as required under the revenue covenant for the outside-Java operations (para.
6.5). It is estimated that a tariff inse of about 17 percent effective April 1, 1993 (or a
correspondingly higher figure at a later date) will be needed for PLN to achieve the financial
break-even in 1993/94 at the prevain fuel prices. As the Govemment has only recently
approved a large electricity tariff increase which, in percentage terms, is nearly double that
required to pass through the recent fuel price increases, it has indicated its inability to further
raise electricity prices soon, because of the need to contain inflationary pressures, and in view
of social and political considerations. For the short term, i.e., for 1993/94, the Java operations
would be able to meet the 8 percent ROR target of the revenue covenant, but the outside-Java
operations would be unable to achieve the covenanted financial break-even. In view of the
above, it was agreed under the proposed project to retain the rewnue covenants agreed wider
the Suralaya thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-N)D), but sluft the target date from 1993/94
to 1994/95for the outside-Java operatons to acideve the break-even (para. 6.5). The rationale
of using the break-even revenue covenant to promote efficiency improvements in PLN's outside
Java operations needs to be revisited in view of the overriding impact of fuel price increases on
financial performance, and the continued rapid expansion of the infrastructure to meet the
projected demand growth. Moreover, since the formulation of the financial break-even covenant
in 1987, the characteistics and the size of PLN's operations has been changing, with some of
its regional operations outside Java becoming increasingly commercial in nature. Consequently,
there may be a need to review the revenue covenant and to prepare, if necessary, an alternative
covenant for the future. Among options that could be considered would be more conventional
measures of financial performance, such as annual RORs on PLN's average net revalued fixed
assets in operation in Indonesia as a whole and cash generation measured against capital
expenditure.
6.9         To ensure the continued achievement by PLN of its financial objectives.
discussions have been held with the Government and PLN for introduction of a mechanism for
periodic formula-based adjusutent of the electricity tariff to take into account, inter alia,
variations in fuel prices and inflation. Under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-
IND), agreemen was reached tbat, by Septmber 30, 1993, Government will fiurnish to the Bank
for its review and comments, proposals for a tariff adjustment mechanism and an action plan to
implement such mechanis-. The Bank has reviewed and commented on a draft report prepared
by PLN on a tariff adjus_tm   mechanism. During the negotiations of the proposed loan,
understandings were reached with the Government that by June 30, 1993, a revised draft report
would be submitted for revew by the PLN's Board of Supervsors and other governmental
agencies, and that the proposed taiff adjustment mchanism would be submitted to the Minister
of Mines and Energy, by August 31, 1993.  These would be followed by higher level
consulations to obtain governmental decision to permit the application of the mechanism,
staring in 1994/95.



- 47-
6.10        The financial projections, which are based on compliance with the financial
break-even covenant in 1994/95 (paras. 6.5 and 6.8), show that PLN's overall profitability
would improve substatialy with its overall anmual rate of return rising from about 2.1 percent
estimated for 1992/93 to about 4.3 percent in 1993/94. With a tariff increase of about
20 percent, effective April 1, 1994, that is estimated to be required for PLN's outside-Java
operations to achieve financial break-even in 1994/95 (para. 6.8), the annual rates of return in
subsequent years would be around 9-10 percent and the annual tarff increases required would
be mainly to compensate for the variation in the input costs, e.g., fuel and inflation. The capital
structure would remain satisfactory; the debt as a percentage of debt plus equity (excluding
revaluation surplus) would rise from about 30 percent in 1991/92 to about 42 percent in
1994/95, and would thereafter remain in the 40-43 percent range during the projection period.
PLN's debt service coverage ratio would be in excess of 2.0 throughout the projection period.
An existing covenant under Loan 3501-lND requires that PLN may not incur any additional debt
unless a reasonableforecast of its net revenues after expenditures for each year during the term
of the debt to be incurred shall be at leastl.5 times its projected debtservce reqWirements. This
covenant was also agreed under the proposedproject. PLN's current ratio is expected to be in
the range of 1.2 to 1.4 through most of the projection period; this would provide adequate
liquidity.
6.11         The financial projections show that during the forecast period, PLN's operations
outside-Java would show a deterioration in 1992/93, with the operating ratio rising from
131 percent in 1991/92 to 140 percent in 1992/93; however, the operating ratio would improve
to 115 percent in 1993/94 and to 100 percent in 1994/95, the latter would result from an
electricity tariff increase of by about 20 percent (para. 6.10) to achieve the covenanted financial
break-even in that year (paras. 6.5 and 6.8). For PLN's Java operations in 1992/93, the
operating rato and the annual ROR will be 81 percent and 8.1 percent respectively and a similar
result is expected for 1993/94. With a 20 percent tariff increase in 1994/95, the operating ratio
would decline to 59 percent and the ROR would rise to 17.7 percent in that year. Thereafter,
while the operating ratio will remain around 65 percent, and the annual RORs would be about
13-16 percent. Consequently, during the forecast period the Java operations would exceed
substantially the minium ROR target of the revenue covenant (para. 6.5), the result of the
policy of mainining uniform tariff and the requirement to achieve the financial break-even for
PLN's outside-Java operations. This provides another reason for reviewing the revenue covenant
(para. 6.8).
6.12         In the financial projections, PLN's capital expenditures (including interest during
construction) projected for 1992/93-1999/00 are derived from the investment requirements shown
in Annexes 2.5 and 2.6, and total about Rp 67,300 billion ($32,830 million) in current prices;
they exclude the capital expenditures for generation projects proposed to be implemented by
private investors (para. 2.11). The Bank financial projections assume that for the proposed
investment program to be implemented by PLN, the financing strategy will follow the principles
discussed in para. 2.13. The financing plans assumed in the financial projections for the
REPELITA V (1989/90-1993/94) and REPELITA VI (1994/95-1998/99) are presented and
compared to that for the REPELHTA IV (1984/85-1988/89) in Table 6.4. Details are given in
Annex 6.1.
6.13         In the projected financing plan for the REPELITA V (1989/90-1993/94), the
Government's contribution is estimated to be about 38 percent, compared to about 40 percent
for the REPELITA IV period, with the annual contribution declining to about 39 percent in

1992/93, and to about 24 percent in 1993/94, compared to about 60 percent in 1991192. PLN's
own contribution from its internal sources is projected to increase from about 14 percent during
REPELITA IV to about 19 percent during REPELITA V, and 48 percent in REPELITA VI.
Borrowings would cover about 37 percent of financial requirements in REPELfTA VI compared
to 43 percent for REPEL1TA V and 46 percent for REPELITA IV. The self-financing levels
projected for REPELITA VI are substantially higher than the levels PLN has achieved
histoncally and largely reflect the fact that prvate power projects account for substantial
investment during this period that would otherwise have been carried out by PLN. If PLN were
to carry out all investment during the REPELITA VI period, its contribution to investment would
be about 43 percent, or about 5 percentage points lower for that period.
Performance Monitoring
6.14         For monitoring the financial performance under the revenue covenants discussed
in para. 6.5 for PLN's Java and outside-Java operations, PLN has been providing the Bank with
separate bistorical financial results (beginmng with its fiscal year 1986/87) and forecasts on a
proforma basis, but not separate audited financial statements. Accounting for PLN's Java and
outside-Java operations is separate except for overhead expenses, for which regional accounts
are not maitained.
Tarffs
6.15         PLN's tariff schedules, which became effective February 1, 1993, comprise 24
consumer categores. For medium and large industrial consumers, large conmnercial consumers,
large social institutions, and for large office buildings, time-of-day pricing is in effect. The
February 1993 and earlier tadff schedules are shown in Annex 6.3.
6.16         Under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND) it was covenanted
that (a) PLAV will periodically review its long-rn marginal cost (LRMC) and tariff structure, and
discuss the results of the review with the Government and the Banks and O) before December 31



- 49 -
in each year, PLN will review the adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirements of the revenue
covenants (para. 6.5). Such a review will take into account the results of the review of the
LRMC-based structure. 7hese covenants were also agreed under the proposed project.
6.17         In June 1992, PLN completed a study of its LRMC of supply in Java, which was
reviewed by the Bank. The study indicated that PLN's average revenue in 1991/92 would have
been Rp 168/kWh, if the tariff of each consumer category was set at the estimated LRMC of
supply in Java. PLN's average revenue, based on the current tariffs (effective February 1,
1993), is about Rp 151/kWh, not including the connection fees paid by consumers. Therefore,
the level of the electricity tariff is close to the average LRMC of supply. However, cross-
subsidies exist between different consumer groups. At present, 99 percent of all residential
customers (93 percent of all PLN customers) that are on tariffs S-1, R-1 and R-2 are subsidized.
This group has an average monthly consumption of 61 kWh. Despite the subsidies, the
household electrification ratio in rural areas remains low at about 25 percent. The lump sum
payment required to pay for the initial installations and connection, as well as the fixed monthly
demand charge serve as barriers. There is clear evidence that the household electrification ratio
in rural areas can be increased significantly by rolling these charges into the energy charge.
Regarding the subsidies to small industries and businesses, there are far more direct and efficient
means to stimulate enterprise creation and expansion, since the cost of electricity is well under
five percent of total production costs in most instances and it is simply not an influencing factor
in most business decisions regarding capacity utilization or expansion. Indeed evidence strongly
Lnudicates that most businesses are more concerned about the reliability of supply than its price,
and are willing to pay the price for reliable source. To compensate for subsidies to the small
consumers, electricity prices to the large industrial customers (tariffs 1-4, 1-5), the large
commercial customers (tariff U-3), the large hotels (tariff H-3), and the large residental segment
(tariff R-4) are therefore higher than the economic cost of supply. Further rationalization of the
structure of electricity prices is necessary, but it is being thwarted by strong social and political
seniment in favor of small consumers.
Taxes
6.18         In accordance with the prevailing tax legislation effective since 1984, PLN is
subject to a 10 percent value-added tax (VAT) and to corporate income tax. The Government
currently bears the VAT on the foreign contracts, and PLN bears it on the local contracts; this
policy is assumed to continue throughout the projection period. With respect to corporate
income tax, the cuurent Indonesian tax code permits the use of accelerated depreciation of assets
in operation, instead of the straight-line method used by PLN in its financial accounting. As a
result, PLN does not expect to pay any corporate income tax for its fiscal year 1991/92, and
during the projection period. In calculating the rate of return, however, any income tax
payments will be taken into account.
Overl Developmet Fund
6.19         Under Government Regulation No. 18 of 1972, that established PLN (para.
1.10), the provisions relatng to the disposal of PLN's annual net profit after corporate income
tax require that 55 percent of such profit be set aside for "Dana Pembangunan Semesta" (DPS),
or the Overall Development Fund for which the required payment should be made to the state
treasury. Regulation No. 18/1972 also provided that the Minister of Finance may directly
reinvest in PLN for the expansion of its facilities the DPS funds payable by PLN. A



- 50- 
Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990 has superseded PLN's govermng Regulation No. 18 of
1972, and the earlier provision that allowed the Minister of Finance to reinvest in PLN the
proceeds of the DPS funds payable by PLN is no longer applicable. During the negotiations of
the loan for the Power Transmission Project in March 1991, the Bank noted that PLN had a
sizeable investment program that was expected to grow substantially over the next several years
and expressed the concern that any large payments by PLN to DPS (as required under
Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990) would significantly reduce its self-financing capability.
Recognizing the need to ensure that PLN would have sufficient funds available to carry out its
investment program, the GOI indicated that its equity contributions in the past had accounted
for a large share of PLN's investments and that it would continue to make its best efforts to
provide funding to ensure that PLN would be able to implement its investment program. Under
the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND), it was covenanted that GOI will take aU
such actions as shall be necessary to ensure that any transfer of profits from PLV to the DPS
shall not prevent PLN from inplementing its agreed investment program (para. 2.16). This
covenant was also agreed under the proposed project. With respect to the about Rp 70 billion
payable by PLN to the DPS, for the period up to 1989/90 based on the provisions of
Government Regulation No. 18 of 1972, the Government has agreed for PLN to pay that amount
in ten equal ammal installments, the first of which was in 1991/92. For later years, the amounts
payable by PLN to the DPS would be spread out in five equal anmual installnents.
Thaning Policy
6.20        PLN formulates its long-term investment program spanuing a ten-year-horizon,
which is updated periodically. The plan is reviewed by the GOI and a five-year time-slice of
it is incorporated in the country's development plan, the latest of which (REPELITA V)
commenced on April 1, 1989. Based on the approved framework of the five-year plan, PLN
prepares an annual plan and a budget, which is approved by the Government. In recent years,
the Government has shown a strong commitment towards these plans and has taken steps to
enable PLN to implement them. During REPELITA IV, the Govermnent's contribution
amounted to about 40 percent of PLN's investment expenditures, whereas PLN's own
contribution was only 13.6 percent with the balance of about 46 percent being financed by
borrowings (paras. 6.12-6.13). The level of PLN's own contribution was low because it was
not permitted any upward adjustment in its tariff during the REPELITA IV period.
6.21        An existing covenant (Loan 3501-lND) relating to the long-term aspects of PLN's
financialplanning was also agreed under the proposedproject. This covenant requires that, as
part of its ongoing annual planning activities, PLN should prepare a ten-year financial forecast
based on its proposed development plan, and also prepare for the first five years of the forecast
period a financing plan that should indicate the amount of external financing and the appropnate
mix of equity and debt, and if possible the potential sources of financing. The covenant also
requires that PLN's development plan, and related financial forecast and financing plan will be
reviewed and adopted by its Board, and that these plans and the forecast will be submitted to and
discussed with the Government and the Bank. Technical assistance is being provided under the
Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND) to help develop furher the financial planning
capability in PLN (para. 4.4).
6.22        The Government proposes to continue to finance PLN's investment from three
sources, namely, PLN's internal funds, borrowings and Govermment contributions. In view of
the large and rapidly growing investment requirements of the sector, there is a need to develop



-51 -
a strategy for the long-term financing requirements of PLN. Also, there is need to develop a
suitable framework that will allow PLN to reasonably formulate and implement investment plans
in a predictable flnancial environment. As a step towards developing such a framework, there
is a need to define the strategy for PLN's borrowings, including access to local capital markets.
During the negotiation in May 1992 of the loan for the Suralaya Theml Power Project (Loan
3501-IND) an understanding was reached that for PLN's Five-Year Corporate Plan
(RENSALITA) for 1992/93-1996/97 that was under preparation and expected to be finalized by
September 30, 1992, the various planning assumptions to be used for the preparation of the
RENSALITA were discussed and agreed to by the concerned Government agencies such as the
office of the Coordinating Minister for Economic and hdustrial Affairs and Development
Supervision (EKUIN & WASBANG), the Ministry of Finance and BAPPENAS so that PLN's
corporate plan is consistent with the macroeconomic prospects and resource availability. A GOI
interdepartmental group had been established for this purpose with the coordinating responsibility
vested in the Director General of Electricity and New Energy, Ministry of Mines and Energy.
In October 1992, PLN completed its draft five-year corporate plan for 1992/93-1996/97. The
plan, which was submitted to GOI, has been reviewed by the Bank. It outlines the key issues
that emerge from PLN's intemal and external enviromnent; analyzes different scenarios of its
development program and financing requirements; identifies its development program and
financing requirements; identifies its medium and long-term objectives; and lists key performance
targets and outlines action programs to achieve those targets. The overall investment
requirements (both of PLN and the private sector) of the sector for 1992/93-1998/99 are
estimated to be in excess of $25 billion equivalent in constant 1991 prices (paras 2.11 - 2.13).
The Bank has communicated to GOI its comments that there is need to decide on the demand
growth scenario, the role of private power, electricity pricing, demand side management
measures, and a clear strategy for financing the large investment requirements of the power
sector, keeping in view the availability and expected growth of captive generation (paras 2.3 and
2.4). The Government, has now decided to formulate a long-term national electrification plan
that would form the basis of a detailed electricity development plan that would be prepared for
inclusion in REPELITA VI (1994/95-1998/99). For this purpose, an interdepartmental
committee headed by DGEED, would consider various issues including those raised by the Bank.
These exercises are expected to be completed by January 1994. The provisions in REPELITA
VI would provide the framework for revising PLN's RENSALJTA. During the negotiations of
the proposed loan, understdings were reaced with the Govermnent tha it will (r) keep the
Bank informed of the progress in theformuAidon of a long-term national electrification plan and
the preparation of a detailed electricity development plan for inclusion in the sixth Five-Year
Development Plan (REPELITA) and revision of PLN's five-year corporate plan (RENUSALTA),
and (ii) provide draftproposals to the Bankforits review and comments. The proposedproject
provides for such technical assistance to GOI for a detailed study of the vanous issues involved
in the long-term strategy for financing the overall investment requirements of the power sector,
for which draft terms of reference have been prepared (para. 5.24).
6.23         PLN is authorized by its charter to borrow from local and foreign lenders and
to issue its own obligations. Until recently, PLN's local borrowings had been only from the
Government-owned Banks. By Government Regulation No. 60/192 dated September 19, 1992,
PLN has been authorized to issue bonds in stages up to a maxiwum amount totalling Rp. 1.2
tr; on, with the approval of the Minister of Finance. In September 1992, PLN issued the first
annual tranche of such bonds amounting to Rp. 300 billion, which was oversubscribed. It is
proposed to raise a further Rp. 900 billion through bond issunce in 1993/94, and the practice
is expected to continue in later years. To support the bond issue, PLN has strengthened its



- 52 -
treasury functions and reduced the time required to finalize the annual financial accounts and
complete their audit (para. 4.11). In line with its policy for all State Corporations, the
Government secures all foreign borrowings on behalf of PLN and bears the foreign exchange
risk. Until the Power Transmission Project (Loan 2778-IND) approved in January 1987, the
onlending rate included a banking fee of only 0.25 percent over the Bank's standard variable
interest rate to cover the admistratve charges. In line with the Bank's objective of gradually
adjusting the onlending rate to a level comparable to one that would apply if the loan was made
directdy to PLN, fees were increased to 3.5 percent under the Power Transmission Project (Loan
3349-IND) approved in June 1991. Under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan
3501-IND) approved in June 1992, the Government agreed to onlend the proceeds of that Bank
loan to PLN for 20 years including a grace period of 5 years, at an interest rate equal to the sum
of (a) the Bank's standard variable interest rate, (b) a variable fee equal to the average of the
annual rate of the change in the value of the Rupiah against the US dollar, during the previous
three years, and (c) a service charge of 1.0 percent per annum. The onlending interest rate
would be applied to the principal amount outstanding under the related subsidiary loan, expressed
as the aggregate of the Rupiah equivalent, determined as of the respective dates of withdrawal,
of the value of the currency or currencies deemed to have been relent to PLN. This
arangement, which ensures that PLN compensates the Government for the foreign exchange risk
that will be borne by the Government, would also be agreed in respect of the onlending terms
of the proposed loan (pam. 5.29). Similar arrangements now apply to PLN's foreign borrowings
from multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank, and increasingly to those from
the bilateral agencies as well.
Asset Revaluation
6.24         PLN's assets have been revalued periodically. The last detailed revaluation was
done in 1979 as required of all public corporations under instructions of the Ministry of Finance.
The revaluation was recorded in the books and was accepted by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired
after March 31, 1979 are appraised at cost. Following the currency devaluation in September
1986, the Govemment issued Regulation No. 45/1986 dated October 2, 1986, providing for the
revaluation of assets of businesses and public corporations, acquired through September 12,
1986. The Regulation specifies the annual revaluation factors for the years 1970 to 1986 for
adjusting the asset values as of January 1, 1987. For purposes of monitoring the revenue
covenants (para. 6.5) PLN has prepared a revaluation of its assets for 1979/80-1986/87 based
on the Regulation. The methodology used by PLN for asset revaluation is satisfactory to the
Bank. A covenant, under Loan 3501-AD, that requires PLN to revue annualy itsxfied assets
(including work in progress and conswners' contriuons) and accumulated depreciatonfor the
purposes of the rate of return and break-even calcuations under the reven  coven
(para. 6.5), was also agreed under the proposed project.

PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Demand Growth and Need for the Project
7.1         Over the past decade, the sales of PLN in the Java Bali system, which accounts
for approximately 80 percent of PLN's total electricity sales, increased from 5.1 TWh to 22.4
TWh at an annual rate of 15.9 percent. A summary of the acual and projected annual growth
of electricity sales by sector for the period 1980-2000 is presented in Table 7.1 below.
Despite this substantial increase in supply, PLN has not been able to meet the overall electricity
demand, and captive generation facilities continued to grow at a sustained rate of about 9 percent
per annum.
Table 7.1: JAVA-BAu SYSgm
ACTUAL AND FORECASU ELECTrrY SALES OF PLN (1902000)

7.2          Over the last year, the supply/demand imbalance has worsened.  Power
curtilment by rotation has been enforced in the Java Bali system for industrial users, thereby
limiting their operation to only five days a week, leading to considerable loss of production. In
addition, as at December 1991, PLN is carrying a backlog of new connections totalling an
estimated load of 3840 MW. The proposed project, as part of the least-cost generation plan for
the Java-Bali system, will assist in improving the balance between demand and supply.

Project as a Least Cost Generating Alternatve
7.3          PLN's least-cost generation plan for the Java-Bali system  includes the
commissioning of Cirata Phase 11 in 1997. The project was selected by PLN's dynamic
programmig based optimal generation expansion model, even after allowing for savings
expectd from energy conservation and demand side management measures (paras. 2.17-2.19).
Further, the project imposes insignificant enviromnental penalties (para. 5.13). Hence, the
project is an ideal candidate for system expansion even under integrated resource planning
metbodology.
7.4         In addition to the study by the least-cost generation model, a determnistic
analysis (prented in Annex 7.1) was carried out to compare the addidon of Cirata II to the
system in comparison with a thermal alternative. In accordance with this analysis the existing
500 MW at Cirata operates pardy on base load (95 MW for 24 hours) with the remainng 405
MW operating only dunng the four hour peak penod. With the addition of the 500 MW of
Cirata Phase II, the entire capacity will operate on peak. With this addition, therefore, there is
a net loss to the system of 95 MW of dependable base load capacity, in retrn for a net gain of
595 MW of dependable peaking capacity. The system expansion with Cirata Phase II plus a
dependable 95 MW of coal capacity is therefore compared with a dependable 595 MW of gas
turbine capacity. The discount rate at which the two alternatives yield the same PV (equalizing
discount rate) is 31.8 percent, indicating a very strong preference for the Cirata Phase II
alternative.
Project Size and iming
7.5         Insaled Capacty.  Studies carried out at feasibility stage convincingly
demonstrated that the low icremental capacity cost of Cirata justifies the maximm practicable
installed capacity. Given the shape of PLN's daily load curve, and operating consrain, a
minijmu capacity factor of 16.66 percent, corresponding to an average of four hours per day
was stipulated. This indicated an overall installed capacity of 980 MW, which was rounded up
to 1000 MW (i.e. operation at slightly less than four hours per day). The first stage installation
was 500 MW, and the remaining 500 MW will be provied under the project.
7.6         Tlming. PLN's least cost planning studies indicate that Cirata II should be
commissioned (as early as possible) in 1997. This is to be expected given the large blocks of
base load capacity which will come on line over the net five years, and since rtrements of
peaking plant with capacity approximately eqfal to that of Cirata Phase I are planned during this
period. Since the additonal pealing capacity can be completely absorbed by the system in its
instalation year, there is no need for staging the instalation.
Enomic Rate of Return
7.7          The project is a component of PLN's least cost expansion plan for the Java-Bali
interonneted system. Its benefits depend upon complementary investments in transmission and
distnrbution as well as coordinated operations within PLN's power system. Therefore, economic
viability has been established by calculafting an Iternal Economic Rate of Return (IERR), on the
basis of the incmental cost and benefit streams associated with the 1992/93-1997/98 time slice
of PLN's least cost expansion plan, of which the project is a part.



- 55 -
7.8          Capital costs considered for the economic analysis include investments in
genemion projects with commissioning dates duriag the selected time slice 1992193-1997198.
In addition, transmission and distribution investments over the same period are included. These
costs are exclusive of taxes and duties. Estimates of incremental fuel consumption are derived
from the results of an operation simulation model of the power system. Incremental fuel costs
were then estimated by applying fuel prices defined in Annex 7.2.
7.9          Benefits of the investment program have been estimated by the revenue from
electricity sales on the basis of the average electricity tariff, and supplemented in the case of
residential and industrial consumers by the consumer surplus.
7.10         In the case of industrial consumers, their willingness to pay is estimated by the
cost of self generation from captive diesel plants. These costs are estimated to be typically in
the range Rp 150/kWh to Rp 300/kWh, depending upon plant scale and utilization. The analysis
conservatively assumes an average willingness-pay of Rp 200/kWh, or about 1.4 times the
present average tariff of Rp 140/kWh (6.83 USM/kWh). This implies an average consumer
surplus of 2.93 USO/kWh.
7.11         For residential consumers, their consumer surplus is estimated by two
components: (a) consumer surplus in the diverted market i.e., cost savings resulting from the
substitution of kerosene by electicity for lighting, and 0b) the incremental consumer surplus in
the new market i.e., the benefit of increased consumption because of the availability of lower
cost electricity (Annex 7.3). With the average residential tariff of about Rp 147/kWh (7.17
USc/kWh), the components together are conservatively estimated to be 5.95 USC/kWh.
7.12         The internal economic rate of return (IERR) on PLN's investment program time
slice 1992/93-1997/98 works out to 19 percent under prevailing tariffs and taking into account
the consumer surplus for residential and industrial consumers as discussed in paras. 7.9-7.11.
The economic rate of return based solely on PLN's current tariff (i.e., excluding consumer
surplus) works out to 11 percent (Annex 7.4).
Senidtivity Analysis
7.13         The internal economic rate of return decreases to 17 percent if all investments
in generation, and transmission and distribution increase by 10 percent. With benefits calculated
solely as revenue at the current tariffs, the economic rate of return would reduce to 9 percent.
Benefis
7.14         The project would help PLN meet increases in peak demand for electricity in
Java and improve service reliability. The project would also help strengthen PLN's financial
position by enhancing the dialogue on the introduction of a mechanism for the periodic
adjustment of electricity tariffs, improve PLN's institutional capabilities, and achieve greater
efficiency in the power subsector by promotng reform in the institutional and regulatory
framework in the sector to empower public and private sector institutions in the sector to
perform to their full potential.



- 56 -
Project Risks
7.15         The risks generally associated with hydroelectric projects are related to potential
cost and schedule overruns due to geological and hydrological uncertainties, and contractor and
construction supervision inadequacies. For the current project, geological risks normally
associated with underground hydroelectric projects are reduced to a minimum, because of the
knowledge gained in the construction of Cirata Phase I development, extensive investigations of
the new tunnel alignments, and the fact that the power cavern is already complete. Hydrological
uncertainties are also at a very low level, since only a small amount of work is to be done in the
river downstream of the dam where flood risk is negligible. Care has been taken in the
prequalification process to ensure a fully qualified civil works contractor, and the full
involvement of experienced international consultants in the construction supervision process and
PLN's appointment of a project manager for the Cirata Phase II development would reduce the
project management risks to a minimum. As a result the risk of cost overruns and time delays
is small.
7.16         There is little risk that the proposed project would become redundant if the
projected level of electricity demand does not materialize, since the project is a part of the core
expansion program of PLN and is justified under all demand scenarios, i.e., low, medium and
high (para. 2.7). There is a risk that the planned large expansion program for the sector may
not be carried out for lack of sufficient financing and/or implementation capacity, which may
result in supply shortages and consequent disruptions in the national economy. This risk is
reduced through Bank-supported measures aiming at enhancing sector efficiency through changes
in the institutional and regulatory framework of the sector, as well as in the organizaional
structure of PLN, which would enable the public and the private sectors (including cooperatives)
to apply their full potential towards meeting the technical, managerial and financial requirements
of the sector.

INDONESA
CIRATA HYDROELECTRIC PHASE II PROJECT
DEVELOPENT PLAN FOR THE CITARUM  IVER
1.          Water resources development in the Citamm River has proceeded in
accordance with an overall development plan, shown schematically in Figure 1 of this annex,
providing for the full development of the three major storage sites: Jatiluhur, Cirata and
Saguling. These storages provide a very high degree of regulation, enabling average annual
energy generation of 4400 GWh, irrigation of about 300,000 ha of land, and supply of about
34 m3/s of water for municipal uses in and around Jakarta.
2.           The optimization of the Cirata development was carried out as part of the
1981 feasibility study, using funds provided for this purpose under the tenth power project
(Loan 1950-IND), within the framework of the overall basin development plan. The
taliwater level of the Cirata power station was fixed considering: (a) the duration of high
water levels at Jatiluhur, and (b) the length of the waterway. Several alternatives were
considered to utilize the remain  head between the tailwater of Saguling (+252 m) and
Jatiluhur (full supply level + 111.6 m) of Jatiluhur. These included various full supply levels
for Cirata in the range of +205 m to +235 m, various minimum operating levels and a
possible run-of-river development between Cirata and Saguling at Rajanandala where the bed
level is 225 m. The optimum solution was found to be a Cirata full supply level of +220 m
and a minimum operating level of +205 m.
3.           The Department of Water Resources Development (DGWRD) and Jatiluhur
Dam Authority (POJ) concurred with PLN on the conclusions of the study, but noted that
some experts had raised the possibility of trans basin diversions from rivers in Western Java,
to supplement flows in the more arid regions of Central Java. This possibility could militate
in favor of a higher dam at Cirata. With this in mind the detailed engineering for the Cirata
dam was carried out considering the possibility of an eventual increase in full supply level
to the extent technicaUy feasible. During the subsequent investigation phase the project
board of consulas advised their opinion that geological features on both river banks limited
the maximum safe operating level to +235 m. Designs were therefore developed for an
in,tial full supply level of +220 m, with minimm provi lons included for a possible future
raising to +235 m. During the preparation of the current project DGWRD advised that
alternatives involving raising of the Cirata dam are low on their list of possibilities for future
supplemenation of water supply to Jakarta. Therefore no specific provisions are made in
the current design for future increases in reservoir level. Nevertheless, the possibility
remains open. It will be noted from Figure 1 that future pumped storage development has
been postulated at Cirata, in parallel with the existing power development. This addition is
not planed in the near future, because of the existence of more economically attative
pumped storage sites elsewhere in Java. No provisions are necessary in the current project
for fiture pumped storage additions.

4.           Reservoir operation studies carried out as pan of the Cirata optimization
considered the best method of operation of the three reservoirs. These studies confirmed the
intuitive conclusion that Jailuhur, the furthest downstream and largest reservoir should
continue to operated primarily to meet irrigation and water supply requirements. Saguling
should operate to maximize energy generation, and Cirata releases should be adjusted
according to the needs of irrigation and power. These operation studies confirmed that the
proposed storages could meet the overall multi-sectoral targets of the basin development plan
(pam 1). operations of the various reservoirs and co-ordination of the operating authorities
have proceeded smoothly, since the commissioning of the PLN reservoirs. The proposed
project will not change operations of Cirata, except on a daily basis. This will have no effect
on the multipurpose operations of the reservoir system.

CIRATA HYDROELECTRIC PHASE H PROJECT
TERmS OF REFERENCE FOR UPGRADE OF HYDROWGICAL DATA BASE
Bakgound
1.        The final report on the hydropower potential of Indonesia, dated October 1983,
made a number of recommeendations. These recommendations were designed to provide
Perusahaan Umun Listrik Negara (PLN) with a hydro-planning capability and to address
deficiencies in the hydrologic data and topographic mapping that were noted during the study.
Progress has been made in both of these areas but further work, particularly in the archiving of
hydrologic data, is now urgently required to enable the planned hydro inventory review to
progress. At the completion of the hydro-power potential study, the consultants passed over to
PLN a data base of the monthly rainfall and streamflow data collected for the study. This data
base was supplemented by a number of programs that used this monthly data to evaluate hydro-
power potential. Up to the corpletion of the inventory study in 1983, the software and data
base were stored on an IBM 370, at which time they were transferred to an IBM 4341, where
they remained until 1985 when this computer was transferred to Semarang. No data has been
added to the data base since then. Attempts to transfer the software and data to a nuinfram
computer in PLN Pusat have been unsuccessful.
2.         At present, hydrologic data is collected by PLN-LMK from the approximately 160
streamflow and 350 rainfall stations installed following the 1983 review. The recorders are
mainly weekly or monthly chart types with some long period chart recorders. PLN has begun
introducing some data loggers that will be unloaded by PC in the field. The stations are serviced
by local operators and the stations are visited and gauged by PLN-LMK staff from Jakarta
approximately once a year. This limits the number of gaugings, and hence the quality of the
rating curves, and a training program to teach local operators to carry out gaugings is in
progress.
3.         PLN-LMK has set up the data collection procedures, maintenance and provide
material needs for hydrological stations through the PLN regions. The collected data is sent to
PLN-LMK. PLN-LMK in Jakarta plot the gaugings, produce rating curves, check and process
the charts and then archive both the charts and the summarized data. For rainfall, hourly values
extracted by hand and stored on a PC as ASCII text files with one flle per station-year.
Individual station-years are identified by their eight character MS-DOS file names consisting of
an abbreviation of the station name and the year. Yearly rainfall data is published in monthly
summary format of the Agency for Research and Development of Public Works, the Research
Insttute for Water Resources Development, Bandung (RIWRD). For streamftow, average daily
values of stage height are extracted by hand and then converted to stream flow using a rating
table derived from the occasional gaugings. Streamflow data is not archived on the computer
and is only available in manuscript form. Because of the manual processing, re-rating after
control changes is not feasible, while missing record periods are not estimated and the digitizer
is not used.



-78-                          ANNEX 5.4
4.         PLN also have a mober of telemetered stations that transmit operational hydrologic
data by radio to the Public Works hydrology organiation (RMWRD) in Bandung. At present the
hourly data is stored on the telemetry master stations at the RIWRD with floppy disc backup.
The RIWRD are the main collector of hydrologic data in Indonesia and in the past they archived
PLN data. At present R1WRD hydrologic archiving system needs some improvement. The
Honeywell based system, funded some years ago, is no longer usable due to operation,
maintenance and software problems. As a temporary alternative the data is being stored using
the digitizing PC's. An APPLE n is used to digitize weekly pluviograph charts. However, this
software cannot handle long period chats and dtese are extracted by hand. Data is stored on
floppy discs and not backed up due to the large mnbers of floppies involved.
S.         Streamflow charts are digitized and archived using an IBM PC. At present the
Bandung office can only handle about 100 of the over 1300 stations each year. To improve this
situation 10 of the 27 regional offices have been provided with the software and hardware to
digitize streamflow charts. The RIWRD intend to have all the digitizing done by the regions
with only central archiving done in Bandung. The RIWRD have problems with unstable controls
and carry out 10 to 12 gaugings at their stream flow stations each year and use a manual rating
curve estimation procedure. Rating extrapolation is done using conventional techniques.
6.        In March 1992 the various parties involved in the collection of hydrologic data in
Indonesia held a symposium and agreed that:-
-    the long term objective is to have a common hydrologic data base for Indonesia;
-    the RIWRD Bandung should be the manager of this common data base.
Hence any decision on a hydrologic archiving system for PLN must also consider the RIWRP
in Bandung and work towards the agreed long term objectives.
OBJECTIVES
7.         The overall objective of this study is to improve the quality and availability of the
data required for hydro inventory studies by data base upgrading and data collection
improvement. Because of the need to upgrade the data base ahead of the hydro inventory studies
the data base improvement section should proceed expeditiously.
Data Base Upgade Objectives
(a)  To upgrade PLN's hydrologic, climatic and environmental archiving data base.
(b)  To train PLN staff in the operation and maintenance of the adopted archiving
system.
(c)  To provide a system that meets the short and long term needs of PLN and also the
agreed long term objectives of R1WRD and PLN.
Data Colection h_provenaits
(d)  To review, and make reoendations to improve, the collection of hydrologic,
climatic and environmental data by PLN.



-79-                            ANNE4
(e)   To review the design of the PLN hydrologic network.
(f) To train PLN staff in data collection procedures.
SCOPE OF WORKS FOR DATA BASE IMPROVEMENT
Review of Current Data Bases and Archiving Systems
8.         The consultant will carry out a detailed review of the curent status of hydrologic,
climatic and environmental data bases in Indonesia, with particular reference to the short tenn
needs of PLN and lon& term needs of both PLN and RlWRD. In consultation with RIWRD, and
in accordance with long term aims agreed in March 1992, the consultant will make
recommendations to PLN on a suitable system to process, archive and evaluate their hydrologic,
climatic and envirotnmental data.
Softwar
9.         When the planned RIWRD hydrologic archiving system is operational the data base
management will be transferred to the RIWRD and the PLN and RIWRD archives merged. The
chosen system must allow PLN to operate their section of the archive to meet the needs of hydro
nventory studies before and after this merging. The chosen systemn must be either a system used
by an operating authority or an adaptation of a system used by an operating authority.
Compatibility with other existing systems (e.g. the IBM 370 or the Inst. of Meteorology &
Geophysics) must also be considered.
10.        The consultant will make recommendations concerning the  provision of an
archiving system for hydrologic, climatic and environmental data that meets short term and long
term PLN objectives. The archiving system should include the following features:
(a)   Flexible Data Input. The system must accept data from a wide range of sources.
e.g. text files, digitizers, telemetry, data loggers, computers and manual entry.
(b)  Flexdble Data Output. The system nmst output raw and processed data as prinm-
outs, plots, floppy discs, tapes, etc. or as required by users.
(c)   User Interfce.  The user interface must be user friendly and suitable tor
occasional as well as skilled or routine users.
(d)  Multple User Aecess. Several users must be able to access the data base at one
time with little loss of system performance.
(e)   Archive security. The archive needs to be partitioned to limit edit access to some
sections to designated users only. While a system of user privileges is necessary
to limit user access to some options e.g. low, intermediate and high skill plus data
base manager.
(t) Back-up. The system must provide regular back up to ensure the safety of both
software and the data.



-80-                          ANNEX 5t4
(g)  Data storage. The system must be capable of storing all hydrologic, climatic and
envirownental data collected to date and all data that will be collected for the
foreseeable future. The system should store all raw data and some processed data.
A variety of time series data types are needed (e.g. spot samples, event totals,
continuous instantaneous and the average, maximum, minimum and total in
preceding interval.)
(h)  Customized Input/output. It should be possible for skilled users to alter output
formats, change units, use English or Indonesian text, combine files (e.g. flow x
concentration = mass rate), import and export spreadsheet and statistical package
data and generally devise new processing and output methods without the need for
computer programmers or software alterations.
(i)   Peripherals. The system should support digitizers, plotters, printers, graphics
terminals and links to PC's. The peripherals should be queued devices rather linked
to one work station to make them available to all users.
(j) Gauging and Ratings. The system should store and calculate gaugings and have
a data base of current meter ratings. Rating plots should label individual gaugings
and a range of rating estimation and validation tools are needed.
(k)  Manag_eent Tools. A range of data base management tools are required to keep
track of data input progress, rating development, percentage of missing or
estimated data and auditing of any editing of time series data by each user.

CIRATA HYDROELECTRIC PHASE H PROJECT
HYDRO INVENTORY AND PREFEASIBILITY STUDIES
TERms OF REFERENCE
Background
1.        Perusahaan Umum Listrik (PLN) completed a Hydro Power Potentials Study in
1983. The study estimated an overall hydropower potential of ... MW of which ... MW was
considered to be economically viable. Out of a total of 1,275 schemes identified, 101 schemes
were evaluated as proniising schemes for development in the short to medium term taking into
account both the relative economics of the schemes, and the current and potential demand in the
systems served. Since that time there have been a number of developments including new I in
50,000 mapping for Sumatra, completion of a number of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies,
an additional period of hydrologic data collection and upgrading of hydro-meteorological
networks. There has also been a high rate of demand growth and interconnection of isolated
networks, with studies recently being completed for the full interconnection of Sumatra and
consideration also being given to further large scale connections, such as a Java-Sumatra. In
addition, with large scale additions of base load plant in the Java-Bali system, and limited
possibilities for future hydro development, pumped storage developments offer potential for
economic peaking power. In this context, PLN are commissioning a study to re-evaluate
hydro/pumped storage inventories.
Objecdves
(a)  update hydroelectric and pumped storage inventories taking into account
developments since completion of previous studies;
(b)  formulation of a long term strategy for hydro-resource development consistent with
Government long term objectives in relation to Indonesia's energy resources, and
the relative economics of hydropower in comparison to fossil fuel based power
production;
(c)  identification of priority schemes for preparation, and carrying out of preparation
works and studies up to prefeasibility level for selected schemes;
(d)  identification of suitable candidates for implementation through a shortcut design
and construct process following feasibility studies;
(e)  strengthening of the hydro-planning group within PLN  (Survey Division,
Directorate of Planning) so that they have the capability and resources to carry out
this type of work on a continuous basis;



-86-                           ANN  5.5
(f)   sr ig   e capabilities of the national consulting industry in this fteld, so that
they are capable of supporting PLN in such studies in the long term.
SCOPE OF WORK
Data Colection and Review
2.         Assembly and review of all existing relevant reports relating to: hydro and water
resource development; power system development; and energy resource development; power
system development; and energy resource development. Assembly of existing topographic,
meteorological, hydrologic, geologic, land use and cost data relevant to the study. In this
context it should be noted that PLN is in the process of upgrading its computerized data base's
of this includes a GIS, and setting up a cenhtalized hydrologic, climatic and environment data
base.
Inventory Update
3.        In principle, it is envisaged that the inventory update will cover at least the 360
schemes which passed the first screening of the 1983 study. However, this rule should be
applied flexibly particularly, where significant new basic data has become available in the
intervening period. In such cases it may be appropriate to re-evaluate schemes which did not
pass the first screening, or even to edevelop the inventory for areas where completely new
mapping is now available. Promising schemes which have been identified since the original
inventory should also be included. Prospective pumped storage developments with the potential
to serve the Java/Bali system should also be identified.
4.         The inventory update should be based on a computerized system, capable of
developing power and energy estimates, quantities and cost estimates from basic data. In
principle the system should have the capability to be upgraded by PLN to incorporate new cost
dat or improved functional relationships (e.g. turbine cost curves versus head, power output and
number of units). PLN have an exisdng program developed under the 1983 studies, which has
the advantage of staff familiarity, and existing data base. During proposal preparation, the
consultant is expected to review the existing program and data base, and tai  into account
technology developnt since the development of the program, recommend the course of action
to be taken with regard to program conversion/modification/updating, software
purchase/development and eqwpment reuiements. His technical and financial proposals should
be based on these recommendations. If proprietary software is proposed the proposal should
include provisions for maintaining and upgrading this software during the study period and at
least five years beyond it.
EnvfronUeNMulpose Scening
5.         As far as possible, each scheme in the inventory should be subjected to preliminary
screening to assess major   me l ips, resetlement implications, conflicts with other
potential users, and any favorable multipurpose impacts. This screening should be a pre-
requisite to selection of a scheme for the reduced inventory (par X).

Load Growth/System Develspuent Studies
6.         in parallel with te inventory studies, the consultant will develop load growth
projections in a form suitable for use in the study which are consistent with PLN overall load
growth projections. In large int  ed systems PLN aW lomerated data is likely to be
sufficient. In less developed regions, projections should to be developed by load ceer in the
detail necessary to formulate generation/transmission options for the region in question. Since
the primary purpose of load growth studies is to determine the speed at which hydro energy
could be absorbed, load growth projections should in princple be unconstrained i.e. not
determined by the ability of the system to meet demand.
7.         Costs of thermal generation alternatives, specific to the region in the question (unit
size, fuel source), should also be developed.
8.         Based on the above, and taking into account exisng commitments and short term
plans, and the lead times required for hydro project development the consultant shall cary out
generation/planning studies in sufficient detail to determine how hydro potential, together with
associated transmission can economically be incorporated into PLN system expansion plans.
9.         To assist PLN in long term strategic planning, the consultant should not constraint
the planning studies to individual regions, but should also consider inter-region and inter-island
transfers e.g. Sumatra to Java and possibly Kalimantan to Java. Both such transfer could also
be considered in the context of possible coal based energy transfers.
Selection of Reduced Inmveutory and Schems for Preparton
10.        Based on the above studies, the consultant should derive a reduced inventory of
most promising schemes for possible implementtion or preparation during the planning period.
Since circumst     will undoubtedly change over this period with a shifing focus of bydro
development, this inventory should be a long list rather than a short list. The inventory and
associated potential demands in the areas served should be prepared in tabular, graphic and data
base formats for reference by the various managerial and planning persomel who will need to
access and update the data over time.
11.       In presentation of this inventory the consultant should indicate which schemes
would be candidates for fast track implementtion, short-cting the long gestation period of
hydroelectric schemes. Very promising schemes at inventory/reconnaissance level could be
slated to go directly to feasibility study. Relatively straightforward schemes with limited cost,
low geotechmical uncertainy, and limited envrnmetlresettlement impacts could be slated for
design/construct implementation from feasibility stage.
12.        Based on the above, PLN in consltation with the consultant will select a number
of schemes (tentatively estimated at 9) to be carried out by PLN personnel with the assistance
of the consultant over the remainder of the study period. As input to this selection process the
consultant will prepare, together with PLN, budgets for field investigations for prospective
schemes.



-88-                           ANNEX 5.5
Investigations
13.        Under the study, two categories of investigations may be carried out:
-    regional investigations, as identified to be desirable during the inventory evaluation
phase; this could include, for example, small scale topographic mapping of an
unmapped promising river basin, or installation of stream gauges and pluviometers
over a similar ungauged area:
-    site specific investigations related to those sites selected for prefeasibility
investigation, including topographic, hydrographic, geologic, geotechnical and
environmental.
14.        To maximize the utility of the investigation budget, site investigation programs
should be carefully devised, appropriate to the needs of the particular scheme. The objective
of the prefeasibility studi,s is to determine likely feasibility and rank schemes for priority in
carrying out full feasibility studies. The investigation program should be the reasonable
minimum which will achieve these objectives.
15.        The consultant will subcontract the programmed investigation works under LCB
procedures satisfactory to the World Bank and purchase equipment on the basis of compaison
of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers eligible under the World Bank's
procurement guidelines.
Prefeasiblity Studies
16.        The consultant will assist personnel in carrying out the prefeasibility studies. It
is the intention that the studies will be carried out progressively over a two year period. The
consultant's involvement would be expected to be heavy at the outset, planning the studies and
training PLN staff in carrying out the work. Towards the end of this period, foreign consultant
iput should be limited to review of PLN products with studies being carried out by PLN with
assistance of local consultant. Particular emphasis should be given to developing environmental
(including consideration of other potential users), and resettlement studies to an appropriate stage
in accordance with Government and World Bank guidelines.
Transfer of Technology
17.        PLN Survey Division includes a core group of senior personnel who received
training as part of the 1983 invenory studies. Since that time they have carried out similar work
but have been constrained by limited resources and other responsibilities. A primary objective
of the study is to strengthen the capability of PLN's Survey Division, such that at the end of the
study period they will have the resources and capability to carry out in the long term the
following tasks:
-    regular updating of hydro inventory, with receipt of new data and in case of
changing circumstances;
-    carrying out regional hydrological studies (e.g. regional flood frequency, regional
low flow frequency, PMP determination, PMF storm cataloguing, regional rnoff



-89-                           ANNEX 5.5
and sedimentation estimates, to provide a basis of fuiture inventory, prefeasbility
and for initial stages of feasibility studies;
-    carrying out prefeasibi}ity studies, with support of national consultants and with
investigations subcontracted to national firms.
18.       On the job training should be supplemented as appropriate by lecures and seminars
by visiting personnel, and should be aimed at covering over the period of the study a full range
of topics likely to be encountered by the PLN personnel in the course of the work.
19.       Early in the study period the consultant should also prepare for the use of PLN
personnel, manuals for carrying out the various aspects of the study. These manuals may draw
heavily on published material but should comprehensively cover all areas. The manuals should
be updated during the study period based on experience with their use, seminar course materials
etc.
21).       PLN will reinforce the Survey Group as required to carry out the study. The
consultant is encouraged to recommend both in his proposal and throughout the study period his
recommendations conceming the appropriate level of human and other resources to take full
advantage of the opportunity for transfer of technology.
Work Schedue and Reports
21.        The overall study period will be 40 months. The following reports will be
submitted at the times indicated:
-    Inception Report: About 3 months after conmtmement, based on the results of the
data collection and review activity, the inception report will provide a detailed
methodology for the remainder of the study.
-    Interim Report: Within 12 months after commencement, the interim report shall
cover all the stages up until, and including, the selection of the reduced inventory
and recommended schemes for preparation.
-    Prefeasibility Reports 1 to 3: Within 24 months of commencement.
-    Prefeasibility Reports 4 to 6: Within 32 months of commencement.
-    Prefeasibility Reports 7 to 9: Within 40 months of commencement.
Locaton of Studies
22.        To maximize transfer of technology, the studies shall in principle be carried out in
Indonesia. Minor exceptions may be justified on the grounds of cost and efficiency.

NDONESIA
CIRATA HYDROELECTRIC PHASE II PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ENVIROMNENTAL STuDIES AND TRAIIG
BACKGROUND
1.        The Ciratum river -s located in western Java and the three main reservoirs on the
Ciratum River are Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur. The downstream reservoir, Jatiluhur, was
developed in 1964, mainly for irrigation. With assistan  from the World Bank, PLN have
constucted the upstream reservoir, Saguing (completed 1985), and the niiddle reservoir, Cirata
(completed 1988). All three reservoirs are used to produce hydropower with the current
installed capacities being: Sagulig 7'0 MW, Cirata 500 MW and Jatiluhur 150 MW. Table 1
gives further technical details of the reservois, civil works and power station outputs.
2.         Cirata Phase II will double the instilled capacity the Cirata power station to 1000
MW and improve PLN's ability to med peak loads. Included in the Cirata Phase II project is
an enviromnental study of the Saguling/Cirata system. This environmental study has been
included because of concerns about the enviromnental condition of the PLN reservoirs on the
Ciratum River.
3.         Some 5 million people live in the cachens of the Ciratum River. They produce
large volumes of industial and domestic waste causing enviomenl problems in the reservoirs,
particularly Saguling where runoff from the Bandung area discharges into the reservoir. Other
rural land uses, such as forestry and agricuture, add to the sedimentation and nutrient loads.
PARTICULAR ENVIRON1MNTAL PROBLEM
4.         When PLN created the Saguling and Cirata reservoirs, many people were displaced.
In Saguling reservoir alone over 3000 families were diredy displaced from private land within
the flooded area and over 7000 families from outside the flooded area lost jobs. PLN adopted
floating net aquacutue (ffNCA) as one of the resettlement option for families affected by the
flooding. The FNCA program is proving to be saccessful with about 1600 families in Saguling
and 1300 families in Cirata currently using this technique. A smaller number of units are
operating in Jatiluhur. However, the reservoirs thermally stratify during the dry season and the
high organic loading cases anoxic conditions in the lower levels. With the onset of the wet
season the reservoirs de-stratify causing fish deaths. At present the fish deaths are at a tolerable
level, being seen by the fish farmers as an acceptable risk, but reservoir pollution conditions
could worsen and make the risk intolerable.
5.         The industrial pollution entering Saguling reservoir from the Bandung area contains
high levels of some heavy metals. This pollution is a threat to the aquaculture industry and also
to the large downstream population that relies on the Ciratum River for drnkig and irrigation
water. Aquatic weeds and floating garbage also cause problems and PLN expends much money
and effort in the regular removal of both the floating aquatic weeds and the garbage.

OBJECTIVES
6.         The objectives of this study are:
-    to investigate the envionena conditions of the catom   and reseroirs of the
Cirata and Sagling power developments;
-    to gain a beuer knowledge of the pollutant sources;
-    to undemtand how the various pollutants affect the reservoirs.
-    to identfy options to improve the envonmetal health of the existing P1LN
reservoirs on the Ciratun River.
-    to assist the Government of Indonesia and PLN to improve the environmental
management of the Ciratum River reservoirs.
SCOPE OF WORKS
Data Collection
7.         ExItin  Data. The consutants will collect, review and evaluate the existng
enviromental data reladng to the Ciraum River reservoirs. This includes physical, chemical and
biological water quality samples, sediment data, information on water weed and garbage
clearance, erosik or "critie-l" land areas, re-forestation areas, fish deaths, fish production,
hydrologic data, tustrial effluent levels, population statistics, land use, cdlmatic and any other
appropriate data. rhe evaluation shoudd include:
who collected the data, where it is held, how it is archived and its quality and/or
relevance;
-    an evaluation of sampling procedures and laboratory testing;
-    an analysis of trends in the environmental data;
-    a preliminary mass balance of the important pollutants and nutrients showing what
proportion of each major pollutant is contributed by the various tributaries or sub-
-    comparison of the data for the Ciratum Reservoirs with pre-impoundment data and
data for similar reservoirs within Indonesia which do not suffer from the same
problems;
-    an assement of the various physical, chemical and biological processes taking
place in the reservoirs, sediments and inflow streams.
8.         Additional Data Collection. While the Ciratum River is recognised as a the
primary source of pollutant there is concemn about pollutant and sediments discharging directly
into the reservoir from the inhabited areas bordering the reservoir. The consultant will collect



-92-                            ANNEX 5.6
and evaluate data on direct discharge of pollutants from the periphery of the reservoirs. This will
include data on the population and industries involved, sewerage discharges, agricultural
practices, disposal of floating wastes, weed disposal and sediment input from land use practices.
9.         Revised Sampig Program. Following the review and evaluation of the data
collected the consultant will recommend a revised sampling program considering the need for:
-    the samplifg of some water quality parameters from the water surface to the bed
of the reservoir to obtain profiles and define strafication;
-    alterations to the range of water quality parameters tested;
-    increasing the sampling frequency of some parameters particularly those that can
be carried out by PLN staff based on site;
-    installation of additional streamflow/water quality stations on input streams to
improve knowledge of the amount and distribution of pollution and sediment,
partiularly upstream of Saguling;
-    installation of equipment to continuously record some water quality parameters at
streamflow stations;
-    sampling of lake sediments;
-    further fish pathology work to link FNCA fish deaths to stratification and water
quality changes;
-    how and where the data should be archived and what on-going evaluation is
required;
10.        Catelment and lpservoir Management. Following the data collection, review
and evaluation phase the consultant will make recommendations concerning:
-    measures which could be taken to mitigate the effects of the direct discharge of
pollutant and sediment into the reservoirs so that PLN can make representations to
the appropriate authorities;
-    appropriate measures for the disposal of floating waste and floating weeds;
-    power station operations and reservoir management practices to improve water
quality in the reservoirs.(e.g. aeration or spacing of fish farms);
11.        Staffing, Traing and Organizaton. While the scope of work described above
is related only to the environmenta managaement of PLN reservoirs, the review of staffing,
organization and training should cover environmental monitoring of all operating power plants
(both hydro and thermal). The Consultant will review exiting organizational arrangements,
procedures and staff capabilities, and in consultation with PLN:

-    report on additional training of PLN staff, to enable them to effectively carry out
this work;
-    review existing procedures and mamals used for enviromiental monitoring and
assist with any upgrades required;
-    conduct seminars during the study and after the draft final report, to keep PLN
staff in touch with the findings of the study as they unfold.
12.          quipme Requments. The consultant will make recommendations on PLN
equipment requirements necessary to upgrade its monitoring programs.
Impemetionl
13.        Following acceptance of the recommendations by PLN the consultant will:
-    procure equipment using IBRD international shopping procedures;
-    manage the technical program for a two year period;
-    provide and calibrate a mathematical model to assess the biological assimilative
capacity of the reservoirs and to improve the understanding and prediction of
stratification and de-stratification of the reservoirs;

TRAING iN INSTARumNTATiON MONTORING AND DAM SATY INsPEcnONs
TEm  OF REFERINCE
Bacgound
1.         PLN has several dams which are categorized as large dms under the ICOLD
definition, including the 99 m high Saguling and 125 m high Cirata rockflll dams. For SaguWing
and Cirata dams PLN has been carrying out routine m tenance in accordance with procedre
manuals prepared by the designers, together with reguar monitoring of dam instr ion, and
head office review of monitoring reports. Also PLN's Engineeng Services Center (PPE) has
formed a group to cairy out dam safety inspections of all PLN's large dams. PLN has decided
to upgrade its dam safety inspection procedures by the establishment of a Dam Safety Panel of
international experts. This Panel would meet at one to two year intervals, at which time the PPE
group would present a report on their inspections and monitoring in the intervening period, for
the Panel's review. The Panel would inspect the larger dams and any others where PLN
monitoring had revealed problems. In between meetngs, the Panel could also be consulted,
collectively or individually, to advise PLN staff if and when the need arose.
2.         To enable PLN staff to fulfil their role in this program, PLN has decided to employ
consultants to train them in the areas of intumentaton monitoring and dam safety inspections.
Objectives
3.         The objective of the tining program is to upgrade the skills of PLN staff to the
stage where they are fully capable of carrying out instrumentation monitoring and dam safety
inspections, interpreting the resuts thereon and acing on the results. They should also be
trained in preparing reports, including compilation and interpretation of data, and reports suitable
for review by the Dam Safety Panel. PLN staff involved would include the Operations personnel
responsible for the routine monitoring and inspection, and PPE staff responsible for review,
interpretation and acting of results.
Scope of Work
Ilstrumentato for Dams
4.         The Consultant should conduct courses in the various aspects of instrumentation for
both concrete and embnkmn includig:
(a) DesgnM Aspects: The purpose of various types of instrumnentation, ype of
instrumts  which may be selected for a particular purpose; advantages and



-96-                           A EX 5.7
disadvantages of various types; typical nstrume ltationlyouts for embankment and
concrete dams;
(b)  Practical Aspects of           oo  Monitorig:  Frequency of readings
methodological considerations, etc;
(c)   Compiladoa and Reporting of Results: Particular attendon should be given to
computerized data base compilation, and the preparation of reports from the data
base to facilitate comparison and interpretation of results;
(d)  Intepetation of Instruentation Results: Nonnal behavior, umnu  behavior;
likely instrumentation response to typical problems; etc.
S.         The courses should be complemented by practical reference to Sagding and Cirata
instrumentation. For example, the reasoning (actual if known, or otherwise probable) behind
the instrumentation layout for Saguling and Cirata, and the types of defects that intu aion
might be expected to detect; drawing attention to any shortcomings in instumentaon monitoring
at the two dams; setting up a computerized data base and reporting system to be used for
compiation of all future results; and interpreting of results to date including identification and
explantion for anomalous readings.
Daw Safety Inspections:
6.         The Consultant should conduct courses in Dam Safety Inspections, including the
following aspects:
-    dam safety programs of various operating authorities worldwide;
-    designing inspction programs using as an example PLN dams without existing
inspection program;
-    practical aspects of dam safety inspections;
-    compilation of inspection data, and reporting of results.
7.         These courses should also be complemented by practical reference to maintenance
and inspection programs of Saguling and Cirata, but also by design of inspection programs and
carfying out of inspections at other PLN dams.
Overseas Training
8.        It is expected that the training would generally be conducted in Indonesia.
However, an overseas study tour is also envisaged, to visit operating authorities and review their
dam safety inspection programs. Preferably, this should cover about three authorities, who could
be regarded as leaders in the field, and who are representative of the range of approaches to this
subject.

TERms OF REFERENCE FOR CONSuLTING SERVICES
1.       Electricity demand in Indonesia has grown at a compound rate of over
15 percent per anmum since 1980/81, PLN's sales have grown from about 6.5 TWh in
1980/81 to 31.5 TWh in 1991192. The value of its assets (rate base) increased from
about Rp 700 biHlion to Rp 11.6 trillion, in the same period. The projection for further
growth up to the end of Repelita VI (1998/99) are as follows:

Rp equivalent at
US$1.0 = Rp 2,050 (trillion Rp)           33.6        21.1       54.7
2.        The sources for funding the investment program have traditionally been:
(a) PLN's internal generaton; (b) Government's contribution in terms of equity through
DIP and PMP; and (c) borowings mainly from official sources. For example, PLN's
investnents during Repelita IV (1983/84 - 1988/89) were funded as follows:
Source                   R Wpbillions              %
Intemal                    1,092                  13.6

GOI Equity                3,227                   40.0
3.       If a simla fancing strategy is continued, and assuming that PLN's internal
cash generaion is raised to an average of 30 percent of the investment requirements
through periodic tariff adjustments and efficiency improvements, the financing plan for
the period 1991/92 - 1998/99 would appear as follows:

GOI Equity                 10.4                   20.0
4.        An additional element in the financing of the power investment that is being
currently promoted by GOI is the private sector participation. Current estmates iml ate
that private investment to the tum of about US$5.0 billion (RpIO.3 billion) may be
atacted by asking private investors to consrct generating plants, mainly in Java, on
Build, Own and Operate (BOO) basis.
isues
5.        The main issues that need to be addressed are as follows:
(a) What steps are needed to raise the internal financing capacity of PLN?
How can the electricity prices be mainained at a level that permit PLN to
produce about 30 percent self-financing capability? What is the role of
semi-automatic formula based taiffl adjustment mechanism to ensure that
electricity prices are adjusted when factors such as fuel pnces, and inflation,
affect the input costs?
(b)  What is the level of Govermuent Equity that should be provided to PLN?
How will such level be determed? What mechansm needs to be put in
place to predict equity contribution over a five-year period so that
investment planing can take place? Should PLN be required to pay
dividend on equity and if so, at what rate?
(c)  What would be the principal sources of borrowings? Would official sources
be able to provide the projected funding requirements? If not, how will
commercial borrowing be intoduced in the sector? Should PLN's be
required to take the foreign exchange isk on the foreign borrowings?
(d) Is there a need to prepare local capital markets to participate in the power
investments through PLN floaing bonds? What are the requirements of the
capital markets to perceive PLN to be a creditworthy institon? What
steps will PLN need to take to iprove its financial management and
accounting system to meet the standard of the commercial lenders?
(e)  Should the Government contiue to guantee aU the borrowings by PLN?
Could PLN be prepared to access local and intemational capital markets?
If so, what steps wiUl be needed to make PLN a more commercially oriented
utility?

ftOJP  r SUPERVISON ARRANGEMEN
1.           PL.N's Superviion I-. PLN has appointed a project manager for
the construction of the hydroelectric plant, and a manager for each related contract. The project
manager will submit by facsimile a brief monthly progress report, supplemented by more
detailed quarterly reports on the physical progress of the project. Constructon will be
supervised by an international consulting engineering firm with local associates. Technical
assitance components, other than those for policy support studies to be carried out by GO0, will
be managed by PLN's Engineering Service Center (PPE) who will be supervising the work of
the consultants.
2.           GOr's Superviion Arnge. Technical assistance components for policy
support studies will be managed by the Directorate General of Electricity and Energy
Development (DGEED), Ministry of Mines and Energy, which will be superisming the work of
consultants.
3.           Bank SupervisIon In4uts. During the initial phase of project implemention,
Bank supervsion will involve close monitoring of the procument and technical assistance
activities. Preonm uon engineei  services for the Besai hydroelectric scheme will be
momtored as part of the preparaion of a future Bank lending operation that would include that
project as a component. Work on policy support studies to be carried out by 001 will be
followed up as part of the sector dialogue with GOI.
4.           The Bank staff resources to supervise the project would be about ten staff weeks
per year for the first two years of project implementation, and would require about three
supervision missions each year; thereafter Bank staff resource requirements would decline
gradually to about six staff weeks and two supervision missions per year. Most of the field
supervision activities would be carried out in conjunction with the supervision of other ongoing
power projects and the processing of future lending operations.

CIRATA HYDROELECTRIC PHASE II PROJECT
NOTEs AND ASSUMPTONS FOR TE FINANCIAL FORECArSt
1.        Inflation has been taken into account as follows:
(a)  for foreign costs (including indirect foreign costs, excluding fuels), 2.1 percent per
annum in 1991, 4.3 percent per annum in 1992, and 3.1 percent per annum in 1993
and each year thereafter; and
(b) for local costs (excluding indirect foreign costs and fuels) at 9.4 percent per annum
in 1991, 6 percent per annum in 1992, and 5.5 percent per annum in 1993 and each
year thereafter.
2.         Separation of accounts of PLN's operations In Java and outside Java is based
on individual accounts mainained by PLN for each of its regional units. These accounts are
separate except for overhead expenses, which, for the purposes of financial projections, have
been allocated proportionately on the basis of unit sales of energy.
3.        Eneg sales are based on the sales forecasts in Annexes 2.3 and 2.4.
4.         Revemues for FY92/93 are based on the estimated average revenue per unit sold
in that year. The tariff was increased by 13 percent in FY92/93, effective February 1, 1993.
5.         Fue/purchased power costs for FY92/93 are based on the estmated outcome for
that year, and for FY93/94 and beyond are derived from PLN's computer simulation of system
operation. The fuel costs are calculated on the basis of current domesdc fuel prices (established
in January 1993) charged to PLN: fuel oil - Rp 240/1 plus tranWortation charges of about
Rp 24/1 for Java and about Rp 34/1 for Outside Java; diesel - Rp 380/1 plus transportation
charges of about Rp 27/M for Java and about Rp 32/1 for Outside Java; coal - Rp 60/kg for Java
and Rp 53.8/kg for Outside Java; geothermal - Rp 49.28/kWh for plants at Kamojang, Dieng
and Outside Java, and US$0.047/kWh for plants at Salak and Drajat; and natural gas -
US$2.53/thousand standard cubic feet (MSCF) for Java and US$3.00/MSCF for Outside Java.
The fuel prices to PLN are escalated on the assumption that prices for fuel oil, diesel and coal
will change in line with intermational prices and the prices for natural gas and geothermal will
remain constant in dollar terms. Purchase of power from private investors who would constuct
generating plant in Indonesia on a "Build, Own and Operate" (BOO) basis, which is projected
to commence from 1996/97, is assumed to be at Rp 115/kWh (in 1991/92 prices).
6.         Operatig expenses, other than fuel and persomel expenses, have been forecast
taking into account the facilities expected to be in use each year, and subject to foreign and local
cost inflation, as appropriate. Personnel expenses are estimated to increase about 18 percent per
annm to provide for inflation, volume growth and staff training. Repair and maintenance



-114-                         ANNEX 6.2
expenses for PLN's Java and outside-Java operations are estimated at 2.3 percent and 2.8 percent
of their respective gross fixed assets in operation during the preceding fiscal year.
7.        Depreciation is based on the application of PLN's normal rates (straight-line
method) to assets revalued annually. For purposes of corporate icome tax, the current
Indonesian tax code permits the use of the accelerated method of depreciation of assets in
operation instead of the straight-line method.
8.        Financing. Terms of foreign borrowings are assumed to be 20 years includig 5
years' grace, at average interest rates of 13.5 percent per annam. Terms of local borrowings
are assumed to be 12 years including two years' grace, at interest rates of 22 percent per annum;
local bonds are assumed to be issued at similar interest rates with a maturity of five years.
9.        Capita expendres are based on PLN's investment program (Annexes 2.5 and
2.6), and exclude capital expenditures for generation projects proposed to be implemented by
private investors, and the costs of geothermal steam field development, which are assumed to
be incurred by other agencies. The 10 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on the foreign contracts
is assumed to be borne by Government, and on the local contracts it is assumed to by borne by
PLN.
10.       Govemment equity contributions are assumed to be equal to 24 percent of PLN's
capital expenditures in 1993/94, and to 15 percent of annual capital expenditures from 1994/95
onwards.
11.       Gross fixed assets, work in progress and consumers'   buons are
revalued annually, up to FY86/87 according to Government Regulation No. 45/1986, dated
October 2, 1986, and from FY87/88 onwards, according to weighted anmual escalation rates
(foreign and local). The rate base is the average of the revalued net fixed assets in operation,
less revalued consumers' contributions. The rate base does not include work in progress.
12.       Customer accounts recevables are assumed at about 37 days of energy revenues,
which is the current level.
13.       TransmIon and Distibutien (T&D) system losses are estimated to be about
14.5 percent for Java and 16.5 percent for outside Java in FY92/93, and are assumed to decline
gradually thereafter to about 11.5 percent and 14.5 percet, respectively in FY98/99.
14.       SubstItion of fid ofl in the existing oil-fired Units 3 and 4 at Gresik in Java by
natural gas is assumed to be completed during FY93/94.
15.       All projections are net of Corporate tax. Based on the current Indonesian tax code,
PLN does not expect to pay any corporate income tax during the projection period.
16.       By the Minister of Finance decree No. 1232/KMK.013/1989 dated November 11,
1989, PLN is required to contrbute to a fund for the Development of Cooperatves and Weak
Economic Businesses (DCWEB) an amount equal to 2.5 percent of its annual net income after
corporate tax. Such contibutions for DCWEB commenced from 1991/92.



-115-                          ANNEX 6.2
17.       In te   of Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990, PLN is requhred to contribute
to an Owerall Development Fod (DPS), 55 perent of its anual net income after contribution
for DCWEB (pan. 15) and corporate tax. Contnrbuons to DPS due for 1990/91 onwards are
assmed to be paid in five equa installmns commening two years after the year for which the
payment to DPS is due.

MERR CALCmLTION: BENEm  MTODOLOGY FOR
REsmEnmuA CONSUMERS
1.          Tbe methodology used to estimte economic benefits for residentil
consumer can be eWlained with the help of Figure 1, which shows a demand fuiction
for a household defined by two points. One end of the function is anchored by the
prie-quantity pair (Q1,P,), where Q1 denotes household consumption of electicity at
PLN's average price, PI, to this consumer class. To anchor the "upper end" of the
demand fnction, which represents consumer willingness to pay for higher valued uses
of electricity, the prie-quantity pair (Q0,P0) is esmated am   that kerosene would
be used for lighig absent availabiLity of electricity. Household survey data on
kerosene consumption and expenditure for lighting and other data were udlized to
establish the monthly kWh consumption (Qo) that would yield an equivalent amount of
lightg intensity (lumens) prior to the availability of electricity; as well as to convert
the unit financial price of kerosene to an equivalent financial cost per kWh of lighting
(Pk). Thus, prior to electification,   units of kerosene (in kWh equivalence) are
consmed at a financial price of Pk. Following elctrification, Q, units of electricity
are consumned at a price of PI.
2.          The net econmic benefit associated with released resourmes is estimated
as (P-PIC)QO, where Pk represents the economic price of kerosene per kWh of
equivalent lighting, PI, is the eonomic cost of electricity supply, and QD is defined
above.
3.          The inremental consumer surplus on the diverted market is represented
by the shaded area in Figure 1. The precise shape of the demad function between the
points (Q,,P,), and (QO,Pk) is not known and can be postulated to be linear or a
suitable non-linear functional form such as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES)
demand function. Either specification wiUl tend to underestmte the wilinns to pay
since neither accounts for the additional value of the higher quality of light obtained
from electricity. Nevertheless, benefits have been esdmated as 50 percent of the
sbaded area assuming a linear demand function. The resultant surplus amount turns
out to be approximately equal to an alternate estimate of the shaded area using a CES
demand function. The implied price elasticity at the point (Q1,P1) was found to be
-0.4. Available evidence in Indonesia suggests that the price elasticity of electricity
at the low levels of consumption is in the range of -0.2 to -0.45. This implies that
demand is more inelastic than assumed in the benefits calculation, or equivalently that
the wvillngnes to pay is likely to be higher than esdmated.
