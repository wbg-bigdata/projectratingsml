MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
THE CIRATA HYDROELECTRIC PHASE II PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and reconmendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia
for $104.0 million is submitted for approval, to help finance the Cirata Hydroelectric Phase I Project. The
proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate. The proceeds of the loan, except $2.3 million for technical assistance to C00, would be onlent
to the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) for 20 years including a grace period of five years. The onlending
rate would be equal to the Bank's standard variable rate on the loan, plus a variable fee equal to the average
of the amnual rate of chnge in the value of Rupiah during the previous three years with respect to the U.S.
dollar, plus one percent, which will transfer the cost of foreign exchange risk to PLN. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk. The project will be cofinanced by expo.t credits (about $149.2
mllion).
2.    Background. Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including oil, natural gas, coal,
hydropower and geothermal energy. To maintain the level of its oil/LNG export earnings, a major objective
of the Government's energy policy has been to diversify domestic energy consumption away from heavy
reliance on petroleum products towards alternative fuels for which there is a nonexportable suwplus (natural
gas and coal) or that are nonadeable (hydropower and geothermal). The power subsector is playing an
important role in this respect. It represents a sizeable market for alternative fuels, which offers promising
possibilities of realizing economies of scale (production and transportation infrastructure) in their
development.
3.    Indonesia's electric power subsector comprises: (i) PLN, the State Electricity Cotooration, with
9,200 MW of installed capacity, (ii) captive plants installed by private parties for their own use, with about
5,900 MW of capacity, (iii) thrte Govenmment-sponsored rural electric cooperatives, and (iv) a large number
of informal microenterprises providing electricity to clusters of customers in rural villages not served by PLN.
PLN's supply facilites have grown rapidly during the past decade. Its installed capacity has increased by
255 percent, to 9.2 GW; its sales have grown by 380 percent, to 31.5 TWh; the nunber of consumers has
grown 350 percent, to 12.4 million. Despite this rapid growth, the per capita electricity consumption in
Indonesia in 1990/91 was only about 270 kWh, compared to about 600 kWh per capita in the Philippines and
Thailand, and about 300-350 kWh in India and Pakdstan which have lower per capita income than Indonesia.
Only about 31 percent of all households in Indonesia are electrified. PLN's current targets for 1999/2000
are to increase installed capacity to about 24.6 GW, and electrified households to about 57 percent.
4.    Sedor Issues and Strt. The objectives that the Government has set for the power subsector are
to improve the welfare of the population and to support the growth of economic activity by meeting electricity
requiements in an efficient and reliable manner. The sector is also being used as a primary means to
substitute oil consumption in the domestic market by alternative fuels, such as natural gas, coal, hydro power
and geothermal. The strategy in the power subsector is being focussed on strengthening the technical,
commercial and financial capability of PLN to construct, operate and maintain efficiendy the growing
electricity network, and meeting the growing demand for electricity in a reliable and cost effective manner.
The priority issues being addressed in the power subsector include: (i) development of a stable long-term



financial framework for meeting the subsector's investment requirements, including improvement in PLN's
internal cash generation capacity; (ii) maintenance of efficient pricing for electricity and fuels; (iii) promotion
of efficiency/reliability in operation and service delivery, to support the growth of industrial and commercial
enterprises with competitive and economic prices; (iv) development of the financial and managerial autonomy
and accountability of PLN, and decentralization of authority within the organization through appropriate
institutional restructuring; (v) development of customer demand management programs, including purchase
of power from captive generators as well as end-use efficiency improvements, that are cost-effective and offer
significant potential for improving demand-supply balance in the power sector; (vi) promotion of private
sector participation in the deve!opment of the power subsector to achieve competition and additionality; and
(vii) reform of the institutional structure and regulatory framework in the subsector. These issues are being
addressed through policy dialogue and lending operations.
5.    Experience With Past Operations in the Sector. Since 1969, the Bank has financed a series of
power projects to assist PLN expand its generation, transmission and distribution facilities and rural
electrification activities in a least-cost manner by, inter alia, diversifying its sources of fuel and takdng
advantage of geothermal and hydroelectric resources. Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) and
Project Completion Reports have been issued for the first fourteen power projects in Indonesia. The lessons
drawn from these are consistent with international experience as sunmarized in OED's report of 1990,
entitled "Evaluation Results for 1988: Iss"ies in Worid Bank Lending Over Two Decades", that evaluated the
outcome of 180 Bank-financed projects from 1974 to 1988. The OED report recognized the importance of
adequate electricity tariffs for good financial performance and highlighted the following as other major factors
contributing to satisfactory performance: (a) continuing efforts for strengthening institutional capacity; (b)
taking steps for timely project implementation, including procurement and land acquisition; and (c) providing
greater financial and operational autonomy for the utility. Since 1989, the Bank-financed projects have
focussed on strengthening the financial position and efficiency of PLN. Currently, the focus has shifted
towards restructuring PLN's organization through decentralization, delegation and commercialization of its
various functions, changing the structural organization and regulation in the power sector, and increasing
private sector participation. Various measures have already been initiated to proceed with these activities.
Despite past progress, PLN is still facing challenges in managing its supply facilities, and needs to devote
greater efforts to become a customer satisfaction oriented utility.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The rationale for Bank involvement with the proposed project
arises not only from the financing requirements of Indonesia's large power program to meet its development
objectives but also from the need to make further progress in developing the sector's ability to keep pace with
the development task ahead in an efficient manner. In this regard, the project provides a vehicle for
advancing the ongoing dialogue and efforts aimed at (a) the institutional restructuring of PLN through a
process of decentralization, delegation and commercialization, and eventual corporatization of functions that
have predominantly commercial objectives, (b) enabling private investment in the electricity sector as well
as inducing greater efficiency through competitive pressures, by the implementation of an appropriate sector
organizational framework and supporting transparent regulations, and (c) introduction of a transparent
mechanism for periodic adjustments in electricity tariff to maintain PLN's profitability. In addition, the
project seeks and supports actions by the Government and PLN to address key issues related to the
rationalization and clearer articulation of long-term financing strategies for the power sector. These efforts
are consistent with the country policies and Bank Group assistance strategy outlined in Part I of the
Memorandum and Recommendation of the President (P-5933-IND, December 4, 1992) for the Third
Community Health and Nutrition Project in Indonesia.

7.    Project Objectivfs.  The objectives of the project are to:  (a) provide economical and
environmentally sound expansion of PLN's peaking generating capacity in Java and improve service
reliability; (b) update hydro inventories and determine pre-feasibility of promising hydroelectric schemes;
(c) strengthen PLN's institutional capacity in planning, investigation and operation of hydroelectric schemes
and in envirornental management of power projects; and (d) study options ior enhancing environmental
conditions in the area of PLN's existing reservoirs on the Citarum river.
8.    Project Description. The project includes:
(a)   implementation of Phase II of the Cirata hydroelectric development on the Citarum River in
West Java, consisting of installation, within the existing cavern of the powerhouse, of four
additional units each of 125 MW;
(b)   consulting services for the engineering and construction supervision; and
(c)   training and studies, including those for power sector institutional and regulatory framework.
The proposed Bank loan would help finance procurement of civil works and consulting services and training
costs. Retroactive financing of $5.0 million is proposed to finance expenditures incurred after December 31,
1992 for construction stage engineering services for Cirata Phase H and for pre-construction engineering
services for Besai hydroelectric scheme. The total financing requirement for the project is estimated at
$398.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $305.8 million (76.6%), including interest
during construction. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement, allocation of the loan proceeds and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Relevant maps are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11544-IND, dated April 8, 1993, is being distributed separately.
9.    ImplemetatIon. The project would be implemented by the State Electricity Corporation (PLN),
which has appointed a project manager for the construction of the hydroelectric plant. Construction will be
supervised by an interational consulting engineering firm with local associates. Technical assistance
components for policy support studies (institutional and regulatory framework, and financing strategy) wiil
be managed by the Directorate General of Electricity and Energy Development (DGEED), Ministry of Mint.
and Energy. Other technical assistance components will be managed by PLN's Engineering Service Center
(PPE).
10.   Eonmental Aspects. The project will be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure
compliance with the applicable enviroamental regulations and guidelines of the Bank as well as of the
Government of Indonesia. The existing Cirata dam, the related reservoir and an underground powerhouse
that contains 4 x 125 MW generating units, were all constructed under Phase I of the Cirata hydroelectric
development financed under the Thirenth Power Project (Loan 2300-IND). Since the project represents an
underground extension of an existing project, environmental impacts are not significant. Permanent works
above ground are limited to the extension of existing tailrace outlet structures and switch yard. Some surface
areas (about 10 ha in total) will be required for contractors' use and access. PLN already owns suitable land
for this purpose, and no resettlement of families/households is required. A total of about 2 ha of land in
several parcels, required for switchyard extension and location of transmission towers, has been acquired.
This is low productivity land for which compensation has been provided to 17 owner families at a rate of
Rp 2,000 per square meter. None of the affected 17 families needed to be relocated since the land acquired



-4-
from them did no constitute their place of residence or a major source of livelihood. With the amount of
compensation paid, several of such families have already purchased more productive land of comparable size.
The project was cleared for implementation by the Central Commission for Environment, Ministry of Mines
and Energy on January 26, 1993.
11.   SustaabUity. The project is designed to meet the expected peak demand for electricity in a least
cost manner and operate for over fifty years. The revenue from the sale of electricity would be adequate to
meet all the financial costs for operation, maintenance and aebt service, and also generate profits. PLN has
adequately trained staff and competent managemeat to operate the proposed facilities efficiently.
12.   Agreed Actions. The following agreements were reached during the negotiations of the proposed
loan:
With GOI
(i)   cofmancing for the turbine generating equipment, metal works, transformers and 500 kV
switchyard extension will be secured by March 31, 1994;
With PLN
(ii)   proposals and action plans for creating a database for service reliability and consumer waiting
lists, and improving service reliability and reducing consumer waiting lists in its operations,
will be submitted to the Bank by October 31, 1993; and thereafter, the action plans will be
implemented; and
(iii) the Cirata dam will continue to be maintained, and periodically inspected; and the dam will
be inspected by independent experts, as required.
13.   Agreements reached with respect to PLN's financial performance are the same as those under the
ongoing Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND), except for achievement of financial break-even
for PLN's outside-Java operations in FY1994/95, a shift of one year from the target year of FY1993/94 that
was agreed under Loan 3501-IND.
14.   Benefits. The project would help PLN meet increases in peak demand for electricity in Java and
improve service reliability. The project would also help strengthen PLN's financial position by enhancing
the dialogue on the introduction of a mechanism for the periodic adjustment of electricity tariffs, improve
PLN's institutional capabilities, and achieve greater efficiency in the powtr subsector by promoting reform
in the institutional and regulatory framework in the sector to empower public and private sector institutions
in the sector to perform to their full potential. The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for PLN's
investment program in Java for 1992/93-1997/98, which includes the proposed project, is 19 percent; it would
be 11 percent, if the consumer surplus were excluded from the benefits.
15.   RIk. The main risks of project implementation relate to potential cost and schedule overmns due
to geological and hydrological uncertaintes, and contractor and construction supervision inadequacies. The
geological risks are minor because of the knowledge gained in the construction of the Cirata Phase I
development, extensive investigations of new tunnel alignments, and the fact that the underground power
cavern is already complete. Hydrological uncertainties are low, since only small work is to be done in the
river downstream of the dam where flood risk is negligible. Prequalification to ensure appointment of a fully



- S -
qualified civil works contractor, use of experienced interational consultants in the construction supervision
process, and PLN's appointment of a project manager for the Cirata Phase II development would reduce
project management risks to a minimum. There is little r!'s that the proposed project would become
redundant if the projected level of electricity demand does not materialize, since the project is a part of the
core expansion program of PLN and is justified under all demand scenarios considered. Overall, there is a
risk that the planned large expansior program for the sector may not be carried out for lack of sufficient
financing and/or implementation cap-icity, which may result in supply shortages and consequent disruptions
in the national economy. This risk is addressed through Bank-supported measures aimed At enhancing sector
efficiency through changes in the institutional and regulatory framework of the sector, as well as in the
organizaioWal structure of PLN, which would enable the public and the private sectors (including
cooperatives) to apply their full potential towards meeting the technical, managerial and financial requirements
of the sector.
16.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
