                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to: (a) expand PLN's peaking
electricity generating capacity and improve service reliability; (b)
update hydroelectric inventories and strengthen PLN's capability in
planning investigation and operation of hydroelectric schemes and in
environmental management of power projects; (c) enhance the
environmental conditions in the area of the existing reservoirs on
the Citarum river; and (d) strengthen PLN's institutional and
financial capacity.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
PART A:
1.    Construction of two headrace tunnels, each about 690 meters
long and about 8.4 meters in diameter; two surge shafts, each about
80 meters long and about 18.6 meters in diameter; four steel lined
penstock tunnels, each about 200 meters long and about 5.2 meters in
diameter; and four tailrace tunnels, each about 138 meters long and
about 6.4 meters in diameter, with associated outlet structures.
2.    Installation, within the existing cavern of the powerhouse of
the Cirata Hydroelectric Plant, of four additional power generating
units each of 125 megawatt, including turbine, generators, governors
regulators, control equipment and associated facilities.

environmental management in relation to both hydroelectric and
thermal power projects; and (b) dam safety and instrumentation
monitoring.
