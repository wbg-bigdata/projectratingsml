MEMORANDUM AND RECOQMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO ST. LUCIA
FOR A WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$2.5 million equivalent and development credit of SDR 4.0 million (US$5.2
million equivalent) to St. Lucia is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would be repayable over 17 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms. with 35 years maturity. Both the proposed loan and
credit would help finance a water supply project. The project would be
cofinanced by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA grant:
US$19.3 million), the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB: US$7.3 million) and
OPEC Fund (US$2.0 million).
2.       Backtround.  Approximately 50X of St. Lucia's total population
(about 142,000 in 1987) is concentrated in the capital city of Castries
(40,000 persons) and the Northwest region of the island where increasing
levels of urbanisation (about 2.2Z per annum) and tourism (about 12X per
annum) have been evidenced in recent years. Even though as much as 90% of
the residential population has access to potable water, water demand in the
Castries-Northwest corridor nw exceeds the available supply. This
situation is attributed to an uncertain seasonal distributioui of rainfall,
lack of raw water storage and the absence of developable groundwater
resources. The present inadequacy and mnreliability of the water supply
(as well as sewerage) present a major constraint to tourism and residential
development and the further development of light industrial and
manufacturing sectors. The current development strategy of the Government
of St. Lucia (GOSL) entails a diversificatior. of export agriculture (in
view of uncertainties of a future preferential market for bananas) to other
productive sectors involving improvement and expansion of tourism and
promotion of light manuifacturing. This is reflected in the Government's
medium-term public sector investment program (PSIP) about two-thirds of
which provides for infrastructure support such as roads, water supply and
sewerage.  (St. Lucia:  Economic Memorandum, World Bank Report No.
7117-SLU, Dated March 15, 1988; Long-Term Economic Prospects of the OECS
countries, World Bank Report No. 8058-CRG, dated February 15, 1990).
3.       In the social sector, GOSL has been--and is--committed to meeting
the goals of the International Water Supply and Sanitation Decade in
rapidly improving the population's access to potable water and sanitation
which continues to have a significant impact on the health and well-being
of the poor. Total water demand for the island is projected to increase
from the current 5.2 million imp. gal. per day (MIGD) to 8.9 MIGD in 2010,
of which the needs for the Castries and Northwest region would represent
between 55 to 601 of the total. Water production levels in this region
(estimated at 3.4 MIGD but much lass during the dry season) have been



inadequate to meet dema'nd without frequent rationing, particularly during
the dry months colix. ling with the peak tourism period. In the sewerage
sector, only about 7% of the population is served by public sewerage, which
is installed mostly in Castries City. In general, the planning of
collection and treatment facilities has considerably lagged in most urban
areas of the island and, in particular, in the Castries-Northwest corridor,
where emerging pollution-related problems may threaten public health and
tourism. Most of the St. Lucian population use on-plot sanitation devices
(such as pit privies, bore-holes or septic tanks) which are of questionable
performance due to poor maintenance. The French Government is currently
assisting GOSL to address sewerage issues for the Castries-Northwest
corridor.
4.       Between 1980 and 1988, capital works expenditures in the water and
sewerage sectors respectively amounted to US$10.8 million and US$1.7
millior., financed in large part by external grants from the British
Development Division (BDD, U.K.), CIDA, and loans from CDB. The planning
figure for the five-year capital works program for 1989-94 is about US$7.3
million for water sector (excluding the Roseau dam water scheme under the
proposed project) and about US$7.6 million for sewerage investments; the
latter include a major sewage collection and treatment project for the
Northwest (Rodney Bay) area to be financed by the French Government
(1990-92). CDB is also currently assisting GOSL with the implementation of
near-term water supply improvements (Millet Intake Scheme) for the
Castries-Northwest area.
5.       The key sector agency responsible for managing the water and
sewerage operations on the island is the Water and Sewerage Authority
(WASA), which was constituted in 1984 as a statutory corporation under the
policy direction of the Ministry of Health. WASA receives assistance in
sector planning from the Central Planning Unit (CPU) of the Ministry of
Planning, Per&onnel, Establishment and Training (MPPET). Since its
inception, WASA has been largely dependent upon loans and grants from the
Government and external donors to finance capital expenditures. WASA is
relatively well-managed. However, several factors--among them,
principally, the increasing water demand, inadequate treatment and
transmission capacity and lack of raw wter storage--are taxing the
capacity of the agency. Additional issues include (i) inadequate levels of
water tariff and lack of an appropriate sewerage tariff structure; (ii)
high unaccounted-for water (UFW--33%) for the Castries-Northwest area
(presumably due to faulty meters and leakages); (iii) lack of experienced
middle-level professionals and (iv) needs for improvements in the areas of
commercial (billing) and financial operations (accounts receivable,
information systems).  An institutional review of WASA was undertaken ir
1988 to propose measures to foster its growth, taking into account
particularly the proposed increase in the levels of investment and asset
acquisition over the next decade (e.g, the proposed water supply project,
the Rodney Bay sewerage scheme, and Castries sewerage). An institutional
improvement action plan and a training program were formulated in early
1989 and will be implemented under the auspicies of the proposed water
supply project.
6.       Rationale for Bank and IDA Involvement.  The proposed operation
represents the Bank Group's first direct involvement in St. Lucia. The
project under consideration is in line with the Bank's view that



- 3 -
improvements to St. Lucia's basic infrastructure are a high priority to
enable increased investment in the productive sectors and encourage
tourism. The proposed project is an integral part of the medium-term
Public Sector Investment Program, reviewed by the Bank in 1987. The blend
of IDA credit and Bank loan to St. Lucia is proposed pursuant to the
November 1985 Board decision on terms of lending to sm=2l-island economies
in the Eastern Caribbean region graduating from IDA, which are considered
creditworthy for limited Bank lending. The Bank's itnvolvement in the
proposed project was instrumental in the preparation of an institutional
strengthening program and financial Improvements for the sector.
7.       Project Obiectives.  The key objectives of the proposed project
are to (a) ensure reliability and quality of long-term water supply, and
improve service levels in the Castries and Northwest area--particularly
during the drought season--by providing adequate raw water storage,
treatment and UFW control, to meet the demands of the domestic consumers,
tourism and the burgeoning commercial and Industrial sectors; (b)
strengthen the institutional capabilities of WASA in the areas of
management, operation and maintenance; and (c) improve the financial
performance of WASA through the introduction of sound tariff policies and
commercial measures.
8.       Project Description.  The proposed project (1990-95) consists of
the following components: (a) Roseau dam water supply scheme (892 of
Project Cost) involving (i) dam reservoir in the upper Roseau River Basin
(concrete-face rockfill dam; height - 135 ft; crest -Length - 650 ft;
reservoir area - 60 acres; capacity - 700 MIG); a dam site access road (1
mile), a raw water pump station (5.3 MIGD for initial phase), and
associated engizeering and supervision services (57%); (ii) raw water
transmission (7.0 miles), treatment and treated water transmission (2.3
miles); and associated engineering and supervision services (26%); and
(iII) environmental monitoring and mitigation programs arising from the dam
reservoir construction (62); (b) procurement of operation and maintenance
equipment including leak detection and repair (21); (c) technical
assistance and training component involving institutional strengthening
programs (42); and (d) project management and administration (5%).
9.       A detailed study was undertaken to evaluate the likely
environmental impacts of the dam Roseau scheme. The major issues addressed
are terrain, hydrology, flora, fauna, people and resource use. Key
mitigatory measures includes a schistosomiasis (a liver disease transmitted
by host snails in tropical reservoirs) monitoring and eradication program,
relocation of about 42 families from the watershed area to a nearby model
*         farm, reforestation of affected areas of the watershed, prohibition of
human access to the watershed and reservoir; provision of water and
sanitation facilities in the nearby communities, thereby obviating the need
to use the river; and wild life preservation. In light of the relatively
small size of the damlreservoir, no major problems are foreseen in
controlling the negative impacts. A net positive impact is anticipated as
a result of the proposed project.
10.      WASA will be the principal executing agency responsible for all
components, except the environmental programs which will be executed by
GOSL through its line ministries of planning, health, forestry and
agriculture, and community affairs. An inter-ministerial committee
consisting of above ministries--chaired by MPPET--has already been



established to coordinate environmental planning and implementation. This
committee, together with external advisors, to be financed by CIDA, would
constitute an onvironmental review panel for the project acceptable to the
Bank Group! The overall project will be managed by a special Project:
Management Unit (PEU) within WASA, which will be assisted by consultants in
the areas of engineering, supervision and 1:oject administration. CIDA
will be the lead project agency, in charge of coordination among the
various donors (the Bank, CDB and OPEC Fund) and liaison with the
Government. The execution of the Roseau dam (which is grant-financed by
CIDA) will be closely supervised by CIDA's field office in Barbados,
assisted by a dam review panel and technical monitors, also financed by
CIDA.  With the proposed strengthening of WASA and consultant assistance to
PHU, the project should be manageable despite its large size.
11.      The total cost of the project is estim.ted at US$39.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$30.9 million (791).
The total financing required is estimated at US$40.5 million equivalent,
including interest during construction. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are presented in Schedule A. GOSL will be the borrower and
cover the foreign exchange risk for all external funds (loans or grant)
which will be on-lent to WASA, under various terms and conditions. The
Bank Group loan and credit would be onlent at 82 interest for a term of 17
years including 4 years grace. While WASA will not make a direct
contribution to project financing, it will provide adequate complementary
water facilities (about USO3 million) in the project area financed from Its
internal resources. (Complementary sewerage facilities, satisfactory to
the Bank, will be financed by the French Government). Contracts have been
designed to facilitate parallel-financing by the various cofinanciers.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, together with the
disbursement schedule, are ahown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing in
an amount not exceeding US$0.2 million would be provided in respect of
project-related expenditures made after August 1, 1989. A timetable of key
project processing events is given in Schedule C. A project location map
is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8244-SLU dated March 6, 1990,
is also attached.
12.      Aareed Actions.  WASA has appointed a Project Director for the PMU
with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank. During the course of
loanlcredit processing, WASA obtained approval for a two-stage tariff
increase of 131 for 1990 and 9% for 1991, as recommended by the Bank Group.
As conditions of effectiveness, GOSL has agreed to complete all necessary
steps required for the disbursement of the cofinanciers' grants/loans and
execute a satisfactory on-lending agreement with WASA for the proposed Bank
loan and credit. GOSL has also agreed interalia that it would:
(a) provide all counterpart funds (US$4.2 million equivalent) through
timely budgetary allocations; (b) undertake an environmental and
resettlement plan, according to an agreed schedule, satisfactory to the
Bank group; and (c) review with the Bank group the project financing plan
soon after the opening of the dam construction bids, to ensure a
satisfactory financing of the dam and continue to conduct annually such
reviews with the Bank Group in the following years of construction before
new commitments are made under the loan/credit. Agreements were also
reached during negotiations that WASA would, interalia: (a) carry out an
institutional action plan (including training) within the agreed timeframe;
(b) put into effect a wnter-based (volumetric) sewerage tariff by the end
of 1991; (c) take measureks, including tariff adjustments, to ensure that



-5
operating revenues cover working expenses, debt-service and contribution to
capital expenditures; (d)introduce by June 30, 1991 an in-house
computerized accounting system; (e) reduce the outstanding accounts
receivables to 110 days by the end of 1990, 100 days by the end of 1992 and
90 days by the end of 1994; (f) maintain working ratios not exceeding 75%
through the end of 1992 and 70X thereafter; (g) not increase its staffing
ower its present level by more than 5% by 1992 and 10% by 1995; (h) ensure
that the dam will be periodically inspected in accordance with sound
engineering practice; and (i) submit to the Bank semi-annual reports on the
progress of project implementation in sufficient scope and detail
(including, for example, details regarding UFW reduction).
13.      Ben-'fits.  The Roseau dam water scheme represents the least-cost
solution for improving long-term water supply for the project area.
Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected from: (a)
improved water supply to about 502 of the population and attendant health
benefits (in low-income areas); (b) orderly housing development and
expansion of tourism and commerce; and (c) the use of surplus water for
irrigation (about 750 acres) during the initiel years of dam operation and
limited hydro-power for on-site applications. The technical assistance
programs would result in improved productivity of WASA personnel. The
est4mated internal rate of return (IRE' is 151. If the grant portion of
the project (CIDA-financed dam) were excl'sded from the analysis, the IRR
would be higher (211).
14.      Risks. Main project risks are (a) WASA's limited implementation
capacity relative to the large project size: this risk will be minimized by
establishment of the PMU with qualified staffing, engagement of consultants
in the areas of project management and supervision and the undertaking of
training programs for WASA'a technical personnel. The implementation of
the key dam component will be a responsibility of CIDA which will provide
intensive supervision through its field personnel in Barbados; (b) the
increased financial leverage of WASA: this could pose some l'iuidity
problems in case of major production or demand setbacks. This risk is
mitigated by the Government's ability to relax WASA's repayment terms on
CIDA's grant funds, further modest tariff increases and decline in the
relative share of debt obligations in future years; and (c) environmental
risks (such as schistosomiasis): GOSL and WASA are committed to agreed
environmental monitoring and mitigatory measures. GOSL has already
appointed a joint ministerial committee to coordinate the implementation of
the environmental components.
15.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and IDA and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.
