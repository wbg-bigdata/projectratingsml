IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ST. LUCIA
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Loan 3184 SLU/Credit 2120 SLU)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report for the Water Supply Project in St.
Lucia, for which both a Loan and Credit were approved on March 29, 1990, in the amount
of US$ 2.5 million equivalent for the loan portion, and US$5.2 million equivalent for the
credit portion. Due to fluctuations in SDR the final loan and credit amount totaled US$
8.13 million. Date of loan/credit effectiveness was January 15, 1991.
The loan and credit were closed on March 31, 1997. The Special Account was
recovered and the final disbursement for the loan took place on October 16, 1997, at
which time a balance of US$506.16 was canceled. The last disbursement for the credit
was on January 15, 1997. There was no cancellation for the credit. The loan was
extended once, from March 31, 1996 to March 31, 1997. Co-financing for the project
was provided by CIDA, CDB and the OPEC Fund.
The ICR was prepared by Elizabeth Rankin (Economist - Consultant) and Carlo
Rietveld of the Finance, Private Sector and Infrastructure Sector Management Unit, of the
Latin Caribbean Region. It was reviewed by the other co-financiers, CIDA and the CDB
(who also administered the OPEC loan), and intemally by Klas Ringskog (Water Cluster
Coordinator) and Maria Victoria Lister (Quality Assurance Support Unit). The Borrower
has not provided comments on the report. The co-financiers' comments have been
incorporated into the final report.
Preparation of this ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report (Report No.8244-
SLU dated March 8, 1990), the Loan and Credit Agreements, supervision reports, review
of the files of correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank
memoranda and discussions with both Bank staff involved in the supervision of the project
and the Borrower staff involved in project implementation and the CIDA End of Project
Report.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ST. LUCIA
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Loan 3184 SLU/Credit 2120 SLU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives. The project had two specific objectives:
(a)   the physical objective was to improve the reliability and long-term requirements for
potable water supply within the capital city of Castries and the northwest region of
St. Lucia. Completion of this objective was highly successful. Physical works
were well constructed and implemented in a timely manner during the period 1991
- 1996 even though there were some minor delays due to Tropical Storm Debbie
(1994).
(b)   the institutional objective was to strengthen the capabilities of the WASA
management, operation and maintenance, and to enhance resource mobilization.
Specific objectives were as follows: (i) augment water supply through the
increased raw water storage and expanding treatment and transmission; (ii)
improve growth of WASA into capable sector organization and establish policies
and procedures for controlling activities in the sector; (iii) strengthen capabilities
and performance of WASA in the financial, commercial, operational and
maintenance areas, and undertake required training programs; and (iv) establish an
appropriate tariff structure, particularly for sewerage services, and introduce sound
financial and commercial policies. Implementation of the above objectives is
mixed. The project did succeed to augment water supply (i), however none of the
other specific objectives were fully met. Although the Finance Department was
strengthened in it's accounting operations, and WASA's customer relations, billings
and collections capability as well as computing operations in the Commercial
Department were strengthened, failure to introduce any increases in tariffs has
negatively impacted WASA's capability to function.
Implementation Experience and Results
The St. Lucia Water Supply Project was implemented during the period 1991 to
1996 and comprised: (i) the Roseau Dam, financed by CIDA, OPEC and GOSL; (ii) the
access road to the dam site financed by the IBRD and GOSL; (iii) the power line to dam
site financed by the IBRD and GOSL; (iv) the Roseau pump station financed by the IBRD
and GOSL; (v) the Ciceron water treatment plant financed by the EBRD and GOSL; (vi)



the water transmission pipelines financed by CDB and GOSL; (vii) the telemetry system
financed by the IBRD and GOSL; and (viii) the local programs financed by the GOSL.
Engineering fees for design, administration of contracts and supervision of
construction were included in the IBRD, CDB, CIDA and OPEC funding. Improvements
to existing facilities, training and post commissioning services were funded both by CIDA
and the IBRD.
Completion of the Roseau Dam was delayed for about 6 months following the
tropical storm Debbie on September 10th, 1994. The partly constructed dam sustained
severe damage. The Roseau Pump Station was inundated with water, silt and debris, but
could be salvaged. A small portion of the Sarot to Ciceron pipeline was exposed just
below Sarot, otherwise no damage was sustained to the pipelines or to Ciceron Water
Treatment Plant.
The general site area at the dam was damaged by the river flood and by landslides.
However remedial works to the dam and pump station were covered by insurance and
completed in February 1995. The physical works of the project were completed
successfully, despite of hurricane impact.
Institutional development was less successful, especially with respect to
improvements in WASA's financial situation. The financial solvency of WASA has
deteriorated consistently, mainly because of WASA's inability to raise tariffs to adequately
cover operations and maintenance costs.
Sustainability
Sustainability of physical works is high. Although WASA's financial situation does
cause alarm, discussions are underway between the Bank, the CDB and the government to
move the agency to a more commercially based position. Any change in that direction will
improve WASA's capability to sustain not only the present project but other investments
as well.
Bank and Borrower Performance
Both the Bank, the co-financiers and the Borrower worked well together to deal
with issues arising concerning progress on implementation of physical works. An
excellent example concerns the problems resulting from the tropical storm of 1994 - which
were completed on schedule with only minor project cost over-runs. WASA's
performance during project execution was excellent, mainly because of a well staffed
Project Implementation Unit (PILI) which was funded by and managed by CIDA
consultants. The Bank also closely monitored WASA's financial situation and made
several proposals for correction - however the political climate thwarted successful
implementation.



iv
Project Outcome
Project physical works, environmental objectives and training were all
implemented in a satisfactory manner. Physical changes (management and operations) in
the Finance and Commercial Departments also had positive results. Overall financial and
management improvements, however, fell far short of expectations. Inability to increase
tariffs has been the prime reason for poor financial performance, and WASA's inability to
introduce experienced professional management staff at strategic levels has negatively
affected achieving of the main institutional objectives of the project.
Future Operation, Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
The Government of St. Lucia has requested that the Bank consider another project
in the Water Supply and Sewerage sector, mostly for sewerage investments in Castries.
The Bank is awaiting the Government's actions to address WASA's institutional
weaknesses, before taking any concrete follow up. The Bank is preparing a project in
sewerage.
Generally the findings are in keeping with those of similar sector projects in the
Caribbean. Physical works are usually completed without significant problems, but those
related to institution building, and specifically to improved financial performance are
difficult to achieve. Specific findings and lessons learned are as follows:
Physical Implementation - To successfully execute large projects in small economies it is
essential to use experienced foreign consultants. Limited local resources make it difficult
to adequately address implementation issues in a timely manner. The creation of a strong
project implementation unit and use of experienced external foreign experts ensure project
success.
Institutional Changes - It is difficult to judge at the time of project preparation whether
institutional changes mutually agreed upon during negotiation will indeed be implemented.
There was extensive and continuous dialogue between the GOSL and the Bank regarding
needed changes in management, as well as financial and commercial operations. However
during project implementation there was minimal success. Institutional change takes time
and needs to be considered in stages over a number of projects.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ST. LUCIA
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LN3184 SLU/CR2120 SLIJ)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
BACKGROUND
Economic Setting
1.    St. Lucia, a Caribbean island in the windward chain has a total land area of 238 sq.
miles and a population of 145,000. Sixty percent of this population is concentrated in the
capital of Castries and the adjoining northwest area, the most urbanized part of the island,
as well as Vieux Fort in the south. The current urban growth rate is 2.2% per annum in
the northwest coastal corridor where tourism is increasing at an average annual rate of
over 10%. St. Lucia has a reasonably diverse productive base which has helped to
produce a GDP annual growth rate of 2.5% - 4% during the 1990's. Tourism has become
one of the fastest growing segments accounting for 18% of GDP, followed by retail trade
(15%), government services (14%) and agriculture (10%).
2.    At appraisal the Government's strategy was to strengthen the three main economic
sectors (agriculture, tourism and manufacturing). In agriculture the government
restructured the sector through the creation of institutions to increase productivity, so as
to improve farm income and the standard of living. In tourism the focus was on adding
hotel capacity. In manufacturing, the aim was to diversify and promote this sector more
aggressively. To pursue this strategy the government implemented a Public Sector
Investment Program (PSIP) weighed heavily in favor of the infrastructure sector
(particularly roads, water supply and sewerage), so as to support private sector activities.
The Bank project was an integral part of the PSIP.
3.    St. Lucia is a volcanic, mountainous island. The coastal areas also provide
challenges for the construction of buildings and utilities. The steep slopes and rock
excavation necessitate specific construction techniques, while construction near shore
requires skill in dealing with high water tables. High levels of rainfall often makes
scheduling of major construction projects difficult.
THE SECTOR
4.    Over 90% of the population have access to potable water through individual
connections in urban areas, and bulk water supplies or standpipes in rural areas. Overall
water production is estimated at 7.2 million imperial gallons/day (M[GD) with



2
unaccounted for water estimated at 35% in 1998. Metering is common, with about 82%
of the island metered through individual or bulk metering.
5.    Public sewerage coverage is about 7% of the Castries urban area. There is no
sewage treatment and raw sewage is discharged into the Castries Harbor. Most of the
tourist hotels have their own over-loaded treatment plants.
6.    The water supply and sewerage sector is the responsibility of the Water and
Sewerage Authority (WASA), under the Ministry of Health (MOH). Sector Planning and
Aid coordination is the responsibility of the Central Planning Unit (CPU) of the Ministry
of Planning, Personnel, Establishment and Training (MPPET). WASA was created in
1984 to succeed the Central Water Authority, that had been established in 1964.
7.   Investments in the sector have been financed mainly by external donors including:
the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), the British Department for International
Development (DFID) of the U.K., the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), and the Caisse Francaise de Developpment (CFD).
BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE SECTOR
8.    The project was the Bank's first direct involvement in St. Lucia. The blend of IDA
credit and Bank loan to St. Lucia followed a November 1985 Board decision on terms of
lending to the Eastern Caribbean small island economies graduating from IDA, which
were considered creditworthy for limited Bank lending. Since the Board decision three
more loans and credits have been approved, two in the water sector and one in the
education sector. Together these projects have accounted for about US$20 million.
THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives/Description
9.    Objectives - The project had two specific objectives:
(a)   the physical objective was to improve the reliability of and address the long-term
requirements for potable water supply within the capital city of Castries and the
northwest region of St. Lucia. Completion of this objective was highly successful.
Physical works were well constructed and implemented in a timely manner during
the period 1991 - 1996 even though there were some minor delays due to tropical
storm Debbie (1994).
(b)   the institutional objective was to strengthen the capabilities of WASA
management, operation and maintenance, and to enhance resource mobilization
capabilities. Specific objectives were as follows: (i) augment water supply through
the provision of raw water storage and expand treatment and transmission
capabilities; (ii) foster growth of WASA as a capable sector organization and



3
establish policies and detailed procedures for controlling activities in the sector;
(iii) strengthen capabilities and performance of WASA in the financial, commercial,
operational and maintenance areas, and undertake training programs; and (iv)
establish an appropriate tariff structure, particularly for sewerage services, and
introduce sound financial policies and commercial measures. Implementation of
the above objectives is mixed. The project did succeed to augment water supply
(i), however none of the other specific objectives were fully met. Although
WASA's Finance Department was strengthened in its accounting operations and
the authority's customer relations, billings and collections capability as well as
computing operations in the Commercial Department were strengthened, failure to
introduce any increases in tariffs has negatively impacted WASA's overall
capability to manage its operations effectively.
10.   Project Description - The project was divided into four specific parts as follows:
Part A: The Roseau Dam water supply scheme which included: (i) the construction of a
dam and reservoir in the upper reaches of the Roseau River, and associated raw water
pumping; (ii) a water treatment plant at Ciceron; (iii) raw and treated water transmission;
(iv) a new dam access road and upgrading of the existing road; (v) consulting and
engineering services; and (vi) environmental monitoring and mitigation schemes including,
watershed management, reforestation, family relocation and schistosomiasis surveillance
and control.
Part B: Equipment purchase including computer hardware and software to improve
WASA's financial management, leak detection equipment, water meters, communication
and telemetry equipment, reservoir inspection vehicle and miscellaneous workshop tools.
Part C: Technical Assistance and training which included consulting services for: (i)
implementation of an improved financial management system; (ii) two studies - a fixed
asset re-evaluation study and a tariff study; (iii) engineering-related operational
maintenance improvements at WASA through the introduction of twinning with a water
utility; and (iv) assistance for WASA with future project preparation and engineering
review activities as required. Man-power training programs included professional training
courses, scholarships and familiarization tours.
Part D: Project management and administration including staffing of the Project
Management Unit (PMU) and consulting services to the unit.
B.   Achievement of Project Objectives
11.   The construction phase of the St. Lucia Water Supply Project was implemented
during the period 1991 to 1996. Engineering fees for design, administration of contracts
and supervision of construction were included in EBRD, CDB, CIDA and OPEC funding.
Improvements to existing facilities, training and post commissioning services were funded
by CIDA.



4
12.   Completion of the Roseau Program was delayed for about 6 months due to the
passage of tropical storm Debbie on September 10th, 1994, which was considered to be a
significant storm. The partly constructed dam sustained severe damage. The Roseau
Pump Station was inundated with water, silt and debris but was salvageable, and since all
of the electrical and instrumentation equipment and diesel generators were not yet installed
these were also saved from damage. A small portion of the Sarot to Ciceron pipeline was
exposed just below Sarot, otherwise no damage was sustained to the pipelines or to the
Ciceron Water Treatment Plant.
13.   The general site area at the dam was damaged by the river flood and by landslides.
However remedial works to the dam and pump station were covered by insurance and
completed in February 1995. In summary the physical objectives of the project were met,
even with the problems caused by "Debbie".
14.   As noted under para. 9. institutional objectives, were met only partially. The
specific objective to strengthen capabilities and performance in the financial and
commercial areas was not met, an appropriate tariff structure has not been introduced, nor
have sound financial policies and commercial measures. A full discussion of institutional
and financial achievements is found in para. 26.
15.   Project Implementation - Works financed under the project and co-financed by
the other funding agencies were completed in a timely manner within the projected
budgets. Cost over-runs were related to damage caused by tropical storm Debbie and
increases in environmental mitigation and resettlement.
16.   Technical Assistance and Training - The majority of the technical assistance was
carried out with the assistance of World Bank funding. Early training programs were
computer related and focused on managerial, clerical and technical staff, or addressed
training required for the operation and maintenance of sewerage treatment facilities.
17.   The specific programs included: training for WASA's distribution engineer and
surveyor, as well as computer applications; sewerage financial analysis; sewerage system
assistance; and management and operations improvements. These functions were
completed successfully. Other technical assistance was provided under CIDA funding to
provide training and commissioning services. The training component was carried out
well.
18.   In terms of overall institutional development and organizational aspects, the
results have been relatively unsuccessful in all regards, with the most prominent ones
concerning WASA's finances and the operations of the Finance Department. However, it
should be noted that some improvements were introduced successfully. In an effort to
strengthen WASA's financial, accounting and commercial operations the Finance
Department were strengthened in its accounting operations through the appointment of a
senior accountant. WASA's commercial activities, which includes customer relations,
billing and collections are now headed by a commercial manager, while to address the



5
problems of its computing operations, WASA appointed a computer systems manager.
These changes resulted in a more even workload, and streamlined computing activities.
19.   Studies - two specific studies were carried out as follows:
*     Fixed Assets Revaluation Study - this was completed in mid-1994.
*     Sewerage Tariff Study - cabinet approval for volumetric-based tariff was approved
on November 14, 1994. The water bill format was redesigned and instituted in
August 1995. The water tariff formula was approved in late March 1994 but never
introduced. The reasons for this are strictly political and are further discussed in
para. 26.
20.   Project Costs - The total cost of the project, net of taxes but including
contingencies was estimated to be about US$39.4 million with a foreign exchange
component of about US$3 1.0 million, or 79%. A physical contingency factor of 18% for
physical components (15% for dam construction, 18% for dam materials and 12-15% for
other physical elements) was included in the estimate. Price contingencies were assumed
to be 5% per annum for foreign costs and 6% for local costs. Project costs were prepared
by CIDA consultants, with the project costs split between the World Bank, CIDA,
CDB, OPEC and the Government of St. Lucia. The Bank portion of costs was composed
of two elements: a loan of US$2.5 million equivalent and an IDA credit of US$ 5.2 million
equivalent (which represented about 19% of the project costs). Due to SDR fluctuations
the final amount totaled US$ 8.13 million.
21.   A project cost over-run of 25% was financed by CIDA and the GOSL. There
were two main reasons for cost increases, the first relates to damage caused by tropical
storm Debbie and the second to increases in environmental mitigation and resettlement.
The detailed cost breakdown is as follows.
Part A: The Roseau Dam Water Supply Scheme - Appraisal cost estimate was US$35.4
million - or 87% of total base cost. Final cost was US$45.9 million or 91% of total cost.
This represents a 30% increase in project cost, which was due mainly to the damage
caused by Tropical Storm Debbie in 1994.
Part B: Equipment Purchase - Appraisal cost estimate was US$0.9 million - or 2% of
base cost. Final cost was US$1.42 million or 3% of cost. This represents a 50% increase
in cost, also due mainly to "Debbie".
Part C: Technical Assistance and Training - Appraisal cost estimate was US$1.3 million -
or 3% of base cost. Final cost was US$1.23 million or 2 % of total cost.
Part D: Project Management and Administration - Appraisal cost estimate was US$1.8
million - or 4% of base cost. Final cost was US$.94 million or 2% of cost.



6
22.   Financing Plan - As noted above the total estimated project costs was US$ 39.4
million with 4 financiers participating in the financing plan as follows: (i) World Bank as
indicated - loan of US$2.5 million equivalent and credit of US$5.2 million equivalent at an
8% interest rate for 17 years including 4 years, which accounted for 19% of the total
project cost; (ii) CIDA grant of US$ 19.3 million (48% of project costs); (iii) CDB's loan
totaling US$ 7.3 million was composed of funds from CDB's Ordinary Capital Resources
(OCR) and Special Funds resources (SFR), with the first at 9.3% interest for 20 years and
5 years grace, and the second at 2% interest for 40 years with 10 years grace (accounting
for 18% of project costs); (iv) OPEC funds of US$2.0 million at 5.5% interest for 17
years with 4 years grace (accounting for 5% of project costs; and (v) government
financing of US$ 4.2 million (10% of total costs).
23.   The CIDA Project Approval Memorandum was executed on August 29, 1988 and
its Memorandum of Understanding was signed on March 1, 1990. The CDB loan was
approved on October 23, 1989, and the OPEC loan on December 7, 1989. The IBRD
loan and credit were approved on March 29, 1990.
24.   Procurement All contracts under the project were designed on a parallel-
financing basis and followed the applicable guidelines of the individual financing agency.
WASA used the model bid documents of the Bank. The Bank financed components
followed Bank procurement guidelines. With the evaluation of ICB bids, local
manufacturers were accorded the usual margin of preference. The Bank prior-reviewed
tender documents, bid evaluation and award recommendation for all contracts valued at
US$100,000 or more for civil works and US$25,000 or more for materials and equipment.
To minimize possible adverse impacts on the environment during construction, the
specifications for certain civil works included appropriate clauses under which contractors
were required to avoid or minimize environmental damages.
25.   Disbursements - A six year disbursement period was used to reflect project needs
in the appraisal. The project was extended by one year at the end of which all
disbursements were completed. Disbursements lagged original projections during the
whole project period. During the first year only 7.5% of total disbursements were made,
against an estimated 41% in the appraisal. However the gap slowly closed thereafter.
26.   Financial Impact of Project - The financial performance of WASA in the years
immediately preceding the Bank loan was identified as "reasonable" in the Appraisal
report. Revenues stood at EC$11.4 million in 1988, representing almost a 25% increase
from 1985 despite the lack of any tariff increase, reflecting increased water production and
consumption. Net income was positive and the return on average net assets was 4%. The
balance sheet position at the end of 1988 was identified as satisfactory, current assets
were about twice current liabilities and equity substantially exceeded liability. Net income
before depreciation and interest was 4 to 6 times debt service requirements. However,
the appraisal also identified growing financial pressure on WASA. As a result a 13% tariff
increase was approved by the Public Utilities Commission effective January 1, 1990, with
a further increase of 9% approved to be effective January 9, 1991. Neither increase was



7
ever activated due to political hesitancy. The system itself was considered to be in poor
shape and as a result service was also poor. The government felt that the authority would
need to show significant improvement in it's delivery of service before any increase in
tariffs could be socially justified.
27.  During negotiations agreements were reached to:
prepare a general cash generation covenant to: (i) conduct an annual analysis of
WASA's estimated cash flows six months before the beginning of each fiscal
year.
undertake appropriate measures, including tariff increases to ensure revenues meet
operating expenses, debt service obligations and required contributions to
investment.
establish a mechanism by December 1991 allowing WASA to set tariffs to enable
adequate coverage to fund investments and attain a reasonable rate of return.
limit the increase in staff over current levels (estimated at 13/1000 connections) so
as not to exceed 5% by the end of 1992 and 10% by the end of 1995.
ensure that the working ratio not exceed 75% through 1992 and 70% thereafter.
reduce the level of accounts receivable to 90 days by the end of 1994.
reduce WASA's amount payable to the power company to 60 days by the
end of 1991.
introduce an in-house computerized accounting system in line with the
recommendations outlined in Wessex Water study of 1988.
28.   On a positive note, financing/management information systems were installed.
ABECAS software modules were installed for: general ledger/cost accounting; accounts
payable and receivable; payroll; supplies tracking; utility billing; equipment maintenance;
and personnel management. The transfer of consumer accounts from the government
computer was completed in 1993 and problems with the new system were substantially
resolved by January 1996.
29.   However, at present WASA's financial situation is grim. It quickly began to
decline during project implementation. There has been no tariff increase since 1991. The
initial reason for procrastination was that the government had opted to wait until it could
approve a new tariff review mechanism (scheduled for July 1994) to replace the role of the
Public Utilities Commission. However, preoccupation with the emergency rehabilitation
efforts in the aftermath of storm "Debbie" delayed the formation of the "Certificate
Committee", charged with the responsibility of reviewing tariff proposals. In addition,
since any new tariff legislation required certain specific government actions, the earliest a
new tariff could have been introduced under the new circumstances was February 1995.
However this date came and went. The result has led to a precarious financial position for
WASA. In 1994 revenue barely covered operating and maintenance expenses, and in the
years following the situation worsened. The main reason was WASA's inability to charge
tariffs which adequately reflected the cost of operation. This resulted in WASA's over-
reliance on bank overdrafts, government subsidies, government loan guarantees and an



8
excessive build up of accounts payable, all to finance ongoing operations. The build-up
resulted in a considerable debt service obligation by the end of 1994. To address the issue
WASA engaged, with ODA funding (UK), a team of experts from Thames Water Supply
Co (UK) to assess WASA's financial situation, to outline a strategy for restoring WASA's
financial viability and prepare an action program. The first report of "Thames" confirmed
that WASA had some "impressive technical skills and had been successful in expansion of
the infrastructure but was a financial failure (which has led to the provision of) poor levels
of service ... WASA ... was overstaffed and inefficient with poor cost effectiveness with
limited control of UFW." "Thames" proposed a plan for improved management of the
utility and financial recovery. The final report was received on March 29, 1996. The
recommendations were partially implemented. However recommended tariff increases,
discussed both during project preparation and in the Thames report, were never
implemented.
30.   Economic Re-Evaluation - The project was to expand the capacity of the water
supply system, satisfy the increased water demand in the northern and western parts of St.
Lucia, and ensure adequate water supply in the dry season and throughout to the year
2025. The project would allow for the continued growth of tourism, industry and
commerce, and increase the standard of living and improve health conditions for the
general population. It was expected that by the year 1995 tourism would surpass
agriculture as the major export earner and for this reason efficient and cost effective
methods of delivering water were considered to be a prime concern.
31.   The project was the least-cost solution option identified during feasibility. A
comparison was carried out between the cost of the proposed project, the cost of
imnporting water by ships from Dominica, and the cost of desalination of sea water. This
formed the basis for the economic evaluation of the project. No traditional cost-benefit
analysis was carried out and hence there is no baseline data available against which to
make with and without project assumptions for the purpose of preparing a traditional
project re-evaluation. For purposes of the economic comparison therefore, the
methodology used in the appraisal was employed. The total life-time NPV of estimated
costs at appraisal are indicated below as is the actual project cost. No new data was
available for the alternative solutions originally identified.
Executed Project    Water Imports      Desalination
SAR Cost (000s)       EC$ 85,790         EC$ 141,044  EC$ 214,274
Revised Cost (000s)    EC$103,364            N/A                 N/A
32.   Based on the above an economic re-evaluation was conducted. Using a 10%
opportunity cost of capital (same as the appraisal), and actual project costs, it was found
that the project remained the least cost option. The revised EIRR for the project in
relation to the water import option was 13%, and the desalination option was 22%.
33.   An examination of the existing tariff was also conducted during appraisal, where
comparisons with other small islands indicated that St. Lucia's water charges were



9
reasonable. At that time the tariff more than adequately covered the short-run marginal
cost (estimated at EC$2.3/1000 gallons). A re-examination indicated that the present
tariff barely covers the short-run marginal cost, which is now estimated to have risen to
EC$7.1 1/1000 gallons, under a tariff of EC$8.43/1000 gallons.
34.   The potential risks indicated during appraisal did not materialize. WASA did not
need to assume a high level of debt to finance the project, because almost half of the
financing came from CIDA grant funds. WASA's limited implementation ability to carry
out this large sized project was mitigated by the establishment of a highly efficient PMU
and the contracting of experienced foreign consultants. Finally, environmental issues were
addressed in a timely manner with full financing from the GOSL and significant support
from CIDA.
Unaccounted for Water (UFW)
35.   In 1989 the rate of lUFW was 33%. This was expected to decrease to 25% by the
year 1997 and beyond as a result of the introduction of a leak detection and control
program and additional metering. Contrary to projections, at the time of loan closing
UFW had increased to 35%.
36.   Environmental Impacts - The specific issues identified in the SAR were as
folows:
(a)  purchase of private lands: approximately 183 acres of privately owned land
in the area needed to be purchased. Land use included degraded forest
mixed with agricultural activities such as production of bananas, coconuts
and root crops, as well as tenant farmer squatter homes. It was decided to
purchase these lands outright to have full control of land use in the future -
with the intent of reforesting as crop areas cease to be cultivated. This was
accomplished.
(b)   relocation of residents in the Roseau reservoir catchment: a total of 42
dwellings with 159 persons were identified. These included small farmers
growing/reaping crops from their lots and the surrounding area.
Relocation was to be made to higher quality land with appropriate
compensation for disturbance through relocation and temporary loss of
earnings. This relocation called for the provision of buildings of at least
equivalent dwellings as a new community. MOP acquired a relocation site
in Belair and infrastructure was put in place to receive 44 houses, which
was completed. Agricultural lots within the relocation site were also made
available to the 14 relocated farmers, and provisions were made for
squatters. Relocated persons were assisted with low cost, long term
financing plans for house and land. They received crop compensation as
well as relocation allowances, based on the value of their original



10
properties. Farmers were permitted to continue to harvest crops in the
watershed up to the reservoir filing, at the point when all agricultural
activity ceased. A total of 42 families (160 persons) were relocated.
(c)   reforestation of parts of the Roseau reservoir catchment area: to prevent
rapid soil erosion and to reduce the incidence of landslides in the reservoir
area it was proposed to reforest these lands over a period of about four
years using existing Forestry Division nursery facilities. This was
accomplished.
(d)   water and sanitation facilities: provision was made to construct adequate
facilities to: (i) protect the reservoir from infestation of snails hosting the
schisto worm; and (ii) protect from schisto infection those residents
currently using the Roseau River for bathing and laundering purposes.
This was accomplished.
(e)   monitor Roseau River for host snails - accomplished through the CIDA
program which was implemented by the Ministry of Health in association
with a local NGO.
(f)   survey for schistosomisiasis in the resident population - accomplished
through the CIDA program, also implemented by the Ministry of Health in
association with a local NGO.
37.   Additional local programs were implemented to:
*     relocate residents and farmers living within the drainage catchment of the John
Compton Dam.
e     clear trees and bushes in the reservoir area and reforest the Roseau and Millet
watersheds.
*     carry out schistosomiasis testing, parrot and land surveys.
*     carry out land acquisition and crop compensation as well as land surveys where
necessary.
38.   Environmental impact studies were conducted and as a result various
environmental statements and mitigation measures were introduced. Regular visits were
carried out to ensure compliance with mitigation measures.
C.   Project Sustainability
39.   Physical works were well constructed, and from that perspective the project is
sustainable. WASA's financial situation does cause alarm, however, although discussions
are underway to move the agency to a more commercially based position. Any change in
the present institutional arrangement will be positive and enhance WASA's capability to
sustain not only the present project but all other investments more adequately.



11
D.   Bank Performance
40.   During the project implementation period there were a number of staff changes in
project responsibility. However these changes in no way affected progress. Both the
government and Bank worked together to deal with the problems arising from the tropical
storm of 1994 and as a result all physical works were completed on schedule near the
estimated project cost. The Bank also closely monitored the financial situation of WASA
and made several proposals for correction. Bank performance during project
identification, appraisal and supervision is considered to be satisfactory with preparation
assistance considered to have been highly satisfactory.
E.    Borrower Performance
41.   The GOSL was the borrower with WASA being the executing agency. It was
represented at three main levels: (a) senior levels of government were involved in project
scoping funding and agreements; (b) a Steering Committee was chaired by the Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Planning. The Steering Committee met twice annually and
was attended by resource persons from all of the ministries affected by the Program,
including funding agencies and consultants; and (c) individual ministries were represented
on the Inter-Ministerial Committee, including the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Planning was
the lead ministry with overall responsibility for local programs. WASA had a management
function throughout the implementation period, and the Project Management Unit (PMU),
which was responsible for day-to-day operations of the project, was assisted by consulting
engineers.
42.   WASA's performance during the project execution was excellent, mainly because
of a well staffed PIU, mostly supported by CIDA. However performance in terms of
financial and institutional improvements as identified in the Bank covenants is considered
to have been deficient.
F.    Performance of Other Funding Agencies
43.   The external funding agencies included CIDA, OPEC and the CDB. CIDA was
the lead donor. CIDA management operated from its regional office in Barbados. The
OPEC loan was administered by the CDB on behalf of OPEC. All of the above agencies
performed satisfactorily with CIDA performing highly satisfactorily.
G.   Assessment of Outcome
44.   Physical works, environmental objectives and the training component were all
implemented in a highly satisfactory manner. Certain aspects of the institutional building
program were met, although financial development of WASA fell far short of
expectations. Inability to increase tariffs has been the prime reason for poor financial
performance. The last increase was in 1991, and although increases were "promised" by



12
the government in 1994, 1995 and 1996 - none materialized. As a result, from a level of
financial strength WASA has deteriorated to an entity with financial solvency problems.
WASAs poor financial performance is negatively affecting its operating performance,
where cash flow problems due to the accumulation of high debt levels of accounts
receivables are leading to inadequate maintenance of facilities. The Bank performed in a
generally satisfactory manner. Supervision was good and issues concerning WASA's
financial situation were closely monitored with continuous discussions between the Bank
and the government. However, the government was not ready to make the required
financial changes in WASA, which has resulted in WASA's precarious financial position.
Given the differences in project results, between the physical and institutional components,
assessment of the project outcome has been divided into two parts, physical
implementation and institutional accomplishments. The physical components of the
project were implemented in a highly satisfactory manner while institutional improvements
must be evaluated as deficient.
H.   Future Operation
45.   The Government of St. Lucia has requested that the Bank consider another project
in the Water Supply and Sewerage sector mostly for sewerage investments in Castries.
The Bank is awaiting the Government's actions to address WASA's institutional
weaknesses, before taking any concrete follow up. The Bank is preparing a project in
sewerage.
L     Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
46.   The Bank's project approval meetings cited a number of issues of concern. These
included:
*     impact on construction labor. Given the large size of the project and possible
competing demands for construction labor, a covenant was included which would require
the government to allow, without restriction, the importation of unskilled labor, if
necessary. No problems arose in this regard.
*     possible cost over-run of the project. CIDA assured all of the financiers that they
would take responsibility should there be any cost over-runs. There was in fact a cost
over-run and CIDA, as well as the GOSL met all of the increased expenditures.
47.   Generally the findings are in keeping with those of similar sector projects in the
Caribbean. Physical works are usually completed without significant problems, but those
related to institution building, and specifically to improved financial performance are
difficult to achieve. Specific findings and lessons learned are as follows:
Physical Implementation - To successfully execute large projects in small economies it is
essential to use experienced foreign consultants. Limited local resources make it difficult
to adequately address implementation issues in a timely and cost effective manner. The



13
creation of a strong project implementation unit and use of experienced foreign experts
ensures project success.
Institutional Changes - It is difficult to judge at the time of project preparation whether
institutional changes mutually agreed upon during negotiation will indeed be implemented.
There was extensive and continuous dialogue between the GOSL and the Bank regarding
needed changes in management, as well as financial and commercial operations. However,
during project implementation there was minimal.success. Institutional change takes time
and needs to be considered in stages over a number of projects.

Further to yourAprf1 2?, 1998 fax, as requested, I have reviewed the Bank's
above captioned Draft Implementaton Completion Report and have the following
comments on it Of newessit, the review was undertaken while on mission in the
Caribbean and hence without access fo my files.
Taken alf round, the report provides a good record of what transpired during the
prolectperiod.  would, however, suggest that the following be considered in
completlng this reporting exerc3e.
1. The CIDA project completon report noted at the bottom of page (1) was more
likely Stanley's End of Project Report.
2. 1 suggest the second last paragraph on page (II) give recognition to the
Bank's contribution to technical assistarnce and training. This suggestion also
applies to paragraph I at the top of page 4.
3. The report makes several references to "Hurricane Debbie"J Debbie was a
tropical storm rather then a hurricane. The foregoing applies to page (iii) - I
focation, page 4 2 locations, page 5 - 3 locations.
4. The second paragraph In section 2.7 makes reference to funding approvals.
March 1, 1990 is the correct executYon date for the St Lucia/CIDA Project



31
MOU. YoU may, howevei also wish to make reference to CIDAs funding
approval document whih was known as a Picject Approval Memorandum
(PAM) Ot that time. It was executed on August 29, 1988.
For completeness, I also suggest that the OPEC Fundes loan approvaJ date
and the Bank's loan and credit approval dates also be noted in this section.
5. The first and fouith paragraphs in section 2. 10 meke reference to tariff
Increases which were to take efect Jenuary 1, 1990 and January 9, 1991. It
is not clear fom thfe ext if only the 1991 or both the 1990 and 1991 tariff
increases were not activated
6. The fourth bullet in paragraph two of section 2. 10 should be clarified
7. The last sentence in paragraph five of section 2.11 makes reference to
environmental Issues. If fte focus of the rsference is St Lucia's Local
Pmgrsm then its appropriafte On the other hand, if the intent is wider and
includes the complete project, then you may wish to make reference to
CIDA 's significant input into this aspec of the project
8. CIDA was involved in the development of the programs noted in paragraphs
(e) and (t in section 2 12 However, the foregoing two activites were
implemented by the Ministry of Health in association with a local NGO.
