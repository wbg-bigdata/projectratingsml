FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (CREDIT 480-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is project completion report (PCR) for the Fisheries Credit
Project, for which Credit 480-IND was approved in June 1974 for the sum of
US$6.5 million. The Credit was closed in December 1981 after full disburse-
ment.
This PCR was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office
following a country visit in August 1982 and reflects information made
available by the executing agencies Perum Perikanan Maluku and the Bank Rakyat
Indonesia. Other sources of information for the PCR were: Appraisal Report
No. 305-IND dated May 7, 1974; President's Report No. P-1438-IND dated May 21,
1984; the Credit and Project Agreements dated June 14, 1974. Supervision
reports, correspondence with the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda as
contained in relevant Bank files have also been consulted, as well as the
Project Performance Audit report on the Indonesia First Fisheries Project -
Credit 211-IND (OED Report No. 2806 dated January 9, 1980).
The PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments on January 25, 1983.
Comments received from Bank Rakyat, Bank Indonesia and the Directorate
General of Fisheries are attached to the PCR (Attachments 1, 2 and 3).
The valuable assistance provided by the Government of Indonesia
and Bank staff met during the preparation of this report is gratefully
acknowledged.

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (CREDIT 480-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
i.        The Fisheries Credit Project, approved by the Board in 1974, was
designed to use more intensively Indonesia's fisheries resources for
domestic consumption and foreign exchange earnings, increase employment and
income opportunities of subsistence fishermen and fish farmers, strengthen
fisheries estates' management and enhance economic development in the
project area. The project's objectives were achieved except for the poor
financial control on operations, and the limited number (3,000) of fish
farmers assisted (SAR 9,000).  Actual marine fish catches and aquaculture's
yields, although about 40% below the targets set in the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) are satisfactory and show rapidly increasing production trends.
Ten 30-GT fishing vessels and two 100-GT catcher carriers built for the use
of the Perum Perikanan Maluku (PPM), a state fisheries enterprise, and ten
30 GT vessels built for the use of fishermen's cooperatives, are fully
operational. Onshore facilities, including cold storage and boat repair
workshops, are being used by PPM and the Ambon fishermen community at large.
PPM now has a sound organization and technical management, and might serve
as a nucleus for a fisheries Nucleus Estate (NES) project. Procurement
operations were slow at the outset causing a two year delay in project
implementation. However, later on with RSI and GOI assistance procurement
improved remarkably.
ii.        Total project costs were US$16.9 million compared to the SAR-s
estimate of US$12.8 million. Financial results were reasonable. PPM
experienced net profits after depreciation and interest allowances only in
1981. However, a more adequate capital structure and more accurate
accounting would have improved its financial standing from project incep-
tion. Accounting and project reporting were poor during most of the
implementation period. The PPM financial rate of return (26%) is slightly
less than the SAR's (34%). The financial rate of return for aquaculture
(28%) is better than that estimated at appraisal (22%). The economic rate
of return for PPM is 29% (SAR 34%) and for aquaculture 30% (SAR 24%).
iii.       The main project successes were:  improvement in project design
compared to the first IDA-financed fisheries project (211-IND) and substan-
tial improvement in management. The principal weaknesses were the lack of
a proper accounting and reporting system and loose financial control over
cooperatives and PPM operations. Five main lessons were learned:



- iv -
(a) adequate management and training are key factors in
project success; management requirements and the use of
experienced consultants in managerial positions, if need
be, should he considered as priorities in future projects
(PCR paras. 1.05 and 5.05);
(b) project design is important and should be realistic as to
the implementation time schedule and the nature of the
components (e.g., trawlers and iceboxes should have been
omitted) to be included in the project (PCR paras. 1.04,
1.05 and 5.05);
(c) the capital structure (Debt/Equity) of project benefi-
ciaries should be adequate to prevent deterioration of
the financial standing of beneficiaries (PCR para. 3.04);
(d) credit recovery from cooperatives should take place at the
time of fish catch delivery or of fishpond marketing and
not once yearly, to improve project financial control (PCR
paras. 2.04, 3.04 and 5.05); and
(e) there is substantial potential for investment in marine
fisheries activities and intensive aquaculture given the
level of fisheries resources and the present income and
export elasticities of demand (PCR para. 3.02).



INDONESIA
FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (CREDIT 480-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. PROJECT DESIGN AND PREPARATION
1.01       A Bank mission visited the project area in August 1982 to assess
the project-s economic, financial and technical impact.  The Project Comple-
tion Report (PCR) reflects information made available by the executing
agencies, PPM and the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI).
1.02       The project design was essentially defined in GOI's original
request for a second IDA-financed fisheries project, which was reviewed and
discussed by an FAO/IBRD identification mission in August/September 1972.
1.03       In January 1973 FAD/IBRD visited Indonesia and prepared the
project along the lines of GOI's request.  The project was appraised by IDA
in June 1973. Negotiations took place in April 1974, and the credit was
approved by the Board in June 1974. The principal objectives of the project
were (a) to make further use of Indonesia's fisheries resources for domestic
consumption and the earning of foreign exchange, and (b) to increase
employment and income opportunities for subsistence fishermen. The SAR
consisted of three subprojects and a technical assistance component to
support project implementation. The subproject components were: (a) a
skipjack tuna development complex in Ambon involving: (i) the provision of
ten pole-and-line fishing boats of 30 GT each for the PPM; (ii) the provi-
sion of ten additional boats for fishermen's cooperatives whose production
output was to be sold to PPM; and (iii) the purchase for PPM of two 100 GT
carrier vessels and construction of onshore supporting facilities including
ice making, freezing and cold storage, jetties, workshop slipways and nets
to catch live bait; (b) milkfish and shrimp pond improvements over 15,000 ha
in Java and South Sulawesi, and the establishment of nine small ice plants
to preserve fish during the marketing phase; and (c) the acquisition of
twenty-five trawlers for cooperatives.  Technical assistance for the
execution of the skipjack subproject was to be provided by a group of
specialists in management, boat building, and mechanical, electrical and
civil engineering. Three pond-fisheries experts were to assist in milkfish
and shrimp aquaculture. Loans for fisheries cooperatives and for other
subborrowers were to be extended by BRI, and the Director General of
Fisheries (DGF) were to coordinate, supervise and guide project
implementation.
1.04       The design of the project differed from the previous IDA-financed
project (211-IND) in that it allotted about half of its funds to aquacul-
tural development. This was an impgrtant innovation. Aquaculture, which
produces only 107. of Indonesian fisheries output, is of paramount importance
to the economy of the coastal areas as it provides essential employment and



-2-
income to a large number of subsistence fish farmers. WX/ith regard to marine
fisheries, the project design incorporated some of the recommendations and
lessons learned from the earlier project. The Ambon cold storage system was
designed to minimize loading and unloading time, which resulted in
substantial cost savings and better preservation of fish. And, in contrast
to the previous project in which a wharf was located in shallow water
accessible only to skipjack fishing boats, the positioning of the wharf in
Ambon was in sufficiently deep water to allow large refrigerator ships to
come alongside.
1.05      Another important improvement in project design was the provision
of experienced consultants to strengthen PPM's management and organizational
structure. Two project components, ice plants and trawlers had to be
dropped during project implementation. Ice plants were not needed because
there were a sufficient number of private commercial ice-making facilities
operating in the market. The trawlers were dropped because GOI and IDA
agreed that the increasing number of private trawlers and purse seiners
fishing illegally within the three mile coastal strip reserved to small
fishing boats were jeopardizing the catches of subsistence fishermen. These
components should in fact have been excluded from project design at
appraisal. As in the case of Credit 211-IND,/l the project implementation
schedule was somewhat optimistic, and there was a two-year slippage.
II. PROJECT IMPLEI4ENTATION
2.01       Shore Facilities.  The contract for the construction of the Ambon
fisheries complex was awarded in early 1976, and construction was completed
within two years, on schedule. Contrary to what had happened under the
earlier project, construction and maintenance of onshore facilities
proceeded smoothly. At completion the conditions of these facilities were
good to excellent, and the operational equipment was working satisfactorily.
2.02       Fishing Vessels.  Soon after effectiveness, specifications and
draft tender documents for the wooden hulls, engines and equipment for
twenty 30-GT fishing boats were prepared with the assistance of consultants
hired under the project. RSI suggested some technical changes to introduce
more cost-effective equipment and to insure that the specifications would
open bidding to all potential suppliers. DGF agreed. Delivery of the ten
boats to PPM was scheduled for October 1977 while the remaining ten boats
for the cooperatives were scheduled for completion in April 1978. Delivery
of the first set of boats to PPM posed no problem. However, the criteria
of eligibility of primary fisheries cooperatives as beneficiaries of the
second set of ten boats became a controversial issue which delayed boat
deliveries by about a year.

(Credit 211-IND), OED Report No. 2806 dated January 9, 1980.

2.03       An additional problem developed because of a disagreement between
the Directorate General of Cooperatives (DGC) and PPM on construction cost
recovery. Although PPM had prefinanced the cooperatives to permit more
expeditious implementation of the subproject, DGC was unwilling to reimburse
PPM. The Director of External Funds of the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
eventually solved this problem by authorizing PPM-s reimbursement by the
state insurance company (LJKK). The questions regarding institutional
responsibilities considerably delayed boat deliveries and caused cost
overruns for both PPM and the cooperatives. These might have been avoided
by more careful investment planning at appraisal and closer supervision
during the early stages of implementation.
2.04       Fishpond Development.  Implementation of this component started in
September 1975 soon after signing of the subsidiary loan agreement between MOF
and BRI. By the end of 1978, slightly behind schedule, BRI had almost com-
pleted disbursements equivalent to about US$3.5 million in subloans to about
2,700 pond owners for the development of about 8,000 ha of ponds.  The number
of beneficiaries was far less than the SAR estimate (9,000), as the average
pond borrower had a larger (5 ha) pond and borrowed more capital than esti-
mated at appraisal. Despite quick project implementation, BRI's inexperience
with long-term fisheries lending resulted in a number of technical problems,
which resulted in a poor portfolio. This was paralleled by poor backup from
DGFs extension services.  Earlier inspection of BRI subloan appraisal metho-
dologies and the establishment of stricter project monitoring and auditing by
IDA supervision missions might have prevented portfolio deterioration.  As it
turned out, because of the deteriorating quality of its fisheries portfolio,
in May 1977 BRI under IDA advice suspended disbursements and reappraised all
fisheries subloans in accordance with guidelines provided by IDA.  The exer-
cise resulted in the cancellation of a number of bad loans and in a substan-
tial improvement in subsequent lending operations, supervision and disburse-
ment procedures. At the same time DGF took a number of steps to improve the
quality of its extension services, principally by establishing demonstration
fishponds and training ponds in the project area. At completion there were
some signs of improvement in loan recovery, especially in 5 out of the 12 BRI
branch offices implementing the project, where fishpond lending was a major
activity. However, as early errors had already severely jeopardized the
quality of the BRI portfolio, the level of arrears and defaults (44%) was
extremely high./l
2.05       Procurement.  Although PPM was always in compliance with Credit
Agreement covenants, there were excessive delays in contract awards, and
indecisions and errors as to the quality of equipment required and received.
ICB procurement of engines and equipment for the fishing boats and for con-
struction of the steel hulls of the two carrier vessels originally formed
part of a single contract.  However, it was subsequently decided that
technical changes were required to increase the boats- operating radius, and
GOI instructed PPM to retender separately.  This caused substantial

- 4 -
delays in deliveries. Delivery of the boats was further delayed due to late
shipment of machinery and lack of skilled engineers for insulation work and
installation of refrigeration equipment. The two 100 GT catcher carriers
were ooerational just after the credit closing date, too late to evaluate
their incremental impact on production. Further, all twenty 30 GT slkipjack
fishing boats acquired under the project were constructed at a state--owned
boat yard in Tanjung Pinang (Sumatra), using local wood which is not
suitable for Maluku water salinity. This often resulted in seaworms per-
forating the hulls and consequent repair work, which slowed down fishing
operations and increased operating costs.  ICB procurement followed Bank
guidelines. However, procurement operations were excessively slow. It took
an average of about 18 months from the preparation of tender documents to
the delivery of equipment to the project site. Hence, although the quality
of the material and workmanship of the boats was generally adequate, more
accurate procurement time schedules and provisions of equipment inspection
at source would have prevented excessive delays, repair costs, and cost
overruris.
2.06      Project Costs.  Total project costs were the equivalent of
US$16.9 million as against the appraisal estimate of US$12.8 million
(ANNEX II). The SAR, for example, set the construction cost of the fishing
complex and of the fishing vessels at the equivalent of US$2.9 million and
US$1.8 million, respectively, whereas actual project costs were the equi-
valent of US$5.9 million and US$4.6 million, respectively. Cost overruns
were in part due to changes in project design (10%) and the remainder to
project delays and higher equipment and material unit costs and much higher
consultant costs than expected.
2.07       IDA Disbursements.  Credit 480-IND was closed on December 31,
1981. Final disbursement took place in February 1982. Funds from Category
4 (unallocated) and from the balance of Category 2 (trawlers) were
transfurred to Categories I and 3 to finance part of the cost overruns for
vessels and consultants. Fig. 1 indicates that the rate of disburseTnent
paralleled the Bankwide average for fisheries projects and the average for
East Asia agricultural projects during the first year of project implementa-
tion; it accelerated and was better than average from year 2 to year 5 and
lagged thereafter.  The total disbursement period was in line with other
Bank fisheries projects.
III. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
3.01      PPM and cooperatives fish catches achieved under the project in
1981 were 40% below appraisal estimates. However, use of the two 100-GT
carrier vessels which recently started operations is expected to increase
production to levels close to the'SAR targets.
3.02      Details of the operational efficiency of the ten PPM boats are
given in ANNEX I. The average catch per fishing day per boat in season in
1981 was in the range 0.5 to 1.2 tons as against the appraisal estimate of



1.3 tons. The operational efficiency expressed by fishing days out of
total operating days (240 per boat in 1981) is between 51% and 65% (appraisal
estimate 68%). The main problem of the PPIM fishing operation in Ambon is
still the fluctuation and uncertainty of bait supply for skipjack fishing.
Interviews with independent private skipjack boat owners in Ambon indicate,
however, that skipjack fishing can be quite profitable if sufficient capital
investment is available, given the good quality of fishermen, captains and
engineers in the project area. Problems of fish marketing and lack of bait
supply can be overcome by better planning and management. Most of the
eight cooperatives financed under the project are profitable.  PPM purchases
their produce, as well as that from private vessels, and can operate its
onshore facilities at capacity.
3.03       Benefits from properly executed fishpond investment were evident
at completion. A selected sample of beneficiary fish farmers interviewed
indicated substantial production increases in both regular and demonstration
ponds under the project. In monoculture ponds, annual milkfish yields had
risen from 300 to 1,000 kg/ha/yr (SAR 1,400 kp/ha/yr). For tiger shrimp,
the increase has been even more pronounced from 50 to 300 kg/ha/yr (SAR 500
kg/ha/yr). These increases are due to higher fry stocking and survival
rates, both made possible by the provision of credit and extension advice.
The project has shown that when properly financed and managed, aquaculture
is profitable. It should become an integral part of good resource use and
of an efficient fisheries production system.
3.04       Financial Performance.  Investment and operational activities
under the project caused an increase in PPM-s assets from Rp 55 nillion in
1974 to Rp 5,823 million in 1981 (ANNEX III) or to Rp 2,329 million in
constant 1974 prices. This more than fortyfold asset increase in real terms
was not accompanied by an adequate capitalization of PPM. The average
debt-to-equity ratio in the last four years was excessively high (2.3:1),
indicating that PPM was subjected to an excessive financial burden which
resulted in accounting losses up to 1980. Given the difficulties in
generating high revenue in a period of major operational expansion, GOI
should have capitalized at least 50% of the funds it lent to PPM. PPM-s
financial statements indicate operating losses in 1978 through 1980 and a
marginal profit in 1981, the year when the project impact in terms of
revenue started to show. PPM accounting, however, needs adjustment.
Depreciation charges during this period were on average 40% higher than
justified by the value of assets. Further, interest accruals accompanied by
deposits of cashflow surpluses in BRI short-term accounts doubled the need
for leverage in PPM, excessively increasing financial costs. Profit per-
formance of most cooperatives is satisfactory. However, lack of GOI
financial control on their operations has made credit recovery extremely
difficult. Future projects' designs must request that credit recovery from
cooperatives take place at the time of fish catch deliveries not at year end.
The PPM financial rate of return shows less than expected profitability, 26%
to the 34% estimated at appraisal.



- 6 -
3.05       Financial performance of the aquacultural component at completion
was still poor, due to high loan arrears (44%) caused by poor lending in the
initial phase of the project. The financial rate of return of a 5 ha fish-
pond (28%) is better than the SAR estimate (24%). This was due to shrimp
export prices being better than the SAR-s estimated.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01       The project provided a technical adviser, a master fisherman and
a refrigeration engineer to assist PPM in organization and management.
Throughout project implementation, their performance was satisfactory.  They
assisted their counterparts, trained local employees and fishermen,
organized and established a functional working system, supervised the
construction of the fisheries complex, reviewed and made comments and
recommendlations for bid documents. However, the impact of their activity in
accelerating project implementation was minimal as none of them was put in
a managerial position.  The performance of PPM-s president, director and
managemenlt was generally satisfactory, although since most managers spent
excessive time in Jakarta where their families lived, control over opera-
tions was at times poor, and this delayed project implementation.  Much
still remains to be done to introduce functional management in PPM opera-
tions. For example, capital and short-term budgeting, sales forecasts,
standard cost accounting, and internal auditing need to be systematica:Lly
introduced as management tools to achieve a more realistic assessment of
sales revenue, profitability and cost-saving potential.
4.02       Accounting, Auditing and Reporting.  Record-keeping standards have
improved during project implementation, but they are still less than satis-
factory. PPM accounts are not regularly audited by an independent CPA firm,
and they lack adequate supporting documentation. Internal auditing does not
exist. Quarterly progress reports are often late and not satisfactory, and
financial statements are often incorrect and show little consistency. The
absence of a functional accounting system has resulted in increased
operational costs. This was the chief cause of reported accounting losses.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01       Costs and benefits for the recalculation of the economic rate of
return are expressed in constant 1981 rupiahs. International and domestic
price indtices were used to adjust prices. The official dollar exchange rate
was applied, Rp 415 per US dollar from 1973 through 1978, and Rp 625
thereafter. In order to conform as far as possible with the methodology
adopted at appraisal, labor was not shadow priced, although, due to high



- 7 -
unemployment in the project area, labor of roughly the same skill would be
abundantly available and the opportunity cost would probably not exceed 50%
of the actual wage rate.  Fertilizer prices, which are subsidized, were
brought in line with international prices.
5.02       The project evaluation period as in the SAR was 13 years for
PPM, and 16 years for aquaculture.  The five ha pond in South Sulawesi,
selected for re-evaluation, represents the average pond financed under the
project. The economic rate of return for PPM is 29% and for aquaculture
28%; the ERRs estimated at appraisal were 34% and 24%, respectively.  The
relatively high level of EER despite lower (40%) than SAR's estimated
production level is due to prices higher than estimated in SAR.
5.03       Foreign exchange earnings from incremental skipjack production were
about US$5 million per year (SAR US$5.7 million) and from incremental shrimp
production, about US$4 million per year. The project created about 500 new
jobs for fishermen and onshore labor and employees working directly for
PPM and about 250 jobs for fishermen working for cooperatives. It provided
employment indirectly to a larger number of fishermen selling their catches
to PPM, and contributed substantially to promote economic development in
Ambon where PPM has become the second largest enterprise.
5.04       IDA-s supervision helped substantially to improve technical
standards. Its request to BRI in 1977 to stop disbursements and to
reappraise all aquacultural subloans, for instance, helped reduce arrears
and improve the quality of portfolio. Supervision was also determinant in
expediting procurement and project implementation, particularly serving as a
bridge for contacts among government officials. IDA-s supervision missions
were not sufficiently forceful in bringing about an improvement in PPM's
accounting and financial management, and in facilitating project cost
recovery. However, it is doubtful whether project implementation and
institutional objectives could have been reached without IDA assistance.
5.05       The main lessons learned were that: (a) management and training
are key factors for project success - management requirements and the use of
experienced consultants in managerial positions, if need be, should be
considered as priorities in future projects; (b) project design should be
more realistic as regards components (e.g. trawlers and ice boxes should
have been omitted) and to the implementation schedule; (c) subloans should
be recovered from cooperatives or fishermen whenever fish catches are
delivered and not once yearly.
5.06      With regard to aquaculture the project indicated the need for
training a large number of 5RI loan officers and DGF extension officers
to follow up on fishpond subloans. There is also a clear need for a
research program to develop improved techniques for intensification of fish
production and improvement of pond maintenance.

PLOJEC? CO,QPLE'iTIOIN REPORT
TINDOMESIA FISHEPIES CREDT PE1ROJECT
IDA CREDIT NO0 43O O0ND
I. Tmpiementation of loan di&yerqemen.t,
A. Sub loan§ ori
Until the closing date of IDA Credit No. 48i0-ThTD, the BRI succeeded to --
disburse fishponds loans to 2,725 pond owners (about 30 % of the target),
for development of about 8,900 ha of ponds (-s 60 % of the target). The _
IDA Credit funds used by the BRI amounts to US $e 2.5 million (including
skipjack tuna and net sub-project for cooperatives amounting ITS $.365 -.
thousand).
The small amount of benefic^aries entitled to receive the above fishpo&d
loans was due to several circumstances i.e
1. The average fishponds package are larger   + 3 ha ) than 1.7 ha as per
appraisal.
2. The limited amount of funds available caused the BRI to limit the
number of beneficiaries that co-uld receive the loans. The fishpond --
loan  package was detenrined by the BRT and. DGF  i.e by deviding the--
amount of funds available with the target benefioiaries. The reality..
in the field snowed that even the increased loan package does not
cover the cost needed by the fare.er to build their ponds.
3. The number of customers who comply with banking requirements were
relatively small.
In our opinion, beside managerial' problems in disbursement of fishponds
loans there were also technical problems in the field like :
a. Fishpond loans could not cover t'he  necessary cost needed by the
farmers. This is why fishponds improvement by the farmers could not
meet the expected technical re(iuirements. Fishpond management is sti:Ll
traditional, causing the productivity of the fishponds low, with mor-
taMity rate of ary-  40--60 %.
b. Many fishponds were affected by flood in the wet season and drnaught -
in the dry seasondc Irrigation facilities on the fishponds area have-
to be improved.
B. Sub loans

B. Subi loans for skvirjack tu)na and net sub project.
ihe selection of fisheries cn-erXtives was dlone by the BRI as the executing
agent. The loan aprovaJ by RRT to the selected cooperatives had been issued
since June 1978. Actual]y at that t_ime tfhose cooperptives were already enti-
tled to receive their fishinE boats. Eut the delivery of the boats to the  -
cooperatives coujd on]v be realJ/ed in Nlovember 1978.
r               '¶'echnical problems were also found in the implementation of skipja.ck tuna  _
Joan disbursements  just  like
a. The hulls of the boats, the machinery and other eoyuipents of the boats -
were frequently damaged x;ith the resulct that the catching- days decrea.sed-
as the boats vwould frequently have to be repaired. This impaired the pro-
ductivity of the cooperatives and conversely increased the operating cost
to finance the repairs of the boats.
b. 'L'he limited bait, supnl v also limited the pro3uctivity. Mloreover the bait-
has to be procured in distant locations which also increased the operating
cost.
IT. Loan recovery.
A. Sub loans for fishponds development.
The repay-ment schedule for fishpond farmers was fixed at the end of each   -
harvest season. P'ormally harvests are twice a year, so the repayment schedu-
le has also been fixed as instalments to be made twice a year. UTsually it -
would be difficult to determine the exact time the farmer would harvest con-
sidering the seasons and profitability of sales prices. The farmer would then
eel] the fish harvested at random to collecting traders of whom there are -
many. The traders collec.ting at the fishpond site would resell to bigger   -
traders in the ne4arby cities / towns.
IJsually the demanrld. o, f'ish on the fishponds sites and nearby town is not -
too high, so that thie fish producedby the pond u,Jould firther be sold by the-
traders in  the capital of Jakarte Province.
As the time of hnarvest is rarely coinciding with the repymsvrrent schedule, the
coLlectinn-'h'r the BRI officials from the repective beneficiaries wolITO ,lso-
be difficult to .be carried oult e-actly after harvesting. Especially because-
of the bl,, number of beneficiaries whose locations are widely scattered.

The hligh figures in arrears on the fishnond loir, i   '   '
by several circumstances
1. The productivity of the fishponds is  still    atisfyog,
2. The rar' ting, especially the sales price is not profitable to the far-
mer which is due to the long, marketing chain.
3. The farmer's lack of understa-,nding on long term loan3s T'suallr the far-
mers do not realize the importance of paying instalments right after  -
every harvest season. Tne farmers negligence to ma'-e rayment of an in -
stalment over one period only would already result in an arrear and a -
bigger interest charrge payahle.
Most of the farmers spent the money from the harvest to f!llfi-ll their -
tther needs first.
4. In most cases bad weather is often  uised as reason for non payment of -
instalment's.
B. Sub loans for skiipiack tina and net su'b project.
The bad performance in the repaynent of skipjack' tun-e and net Ioans by the
fisheries cooper,.tfives l 'se due to :
1. Low level of fish catchLng productivity an(d the hig,h oreratin  cost.
This was caused by the limited avai'eb-flitv of bait suppoly, the distant
bait catching locations, an(d the liraited fish catch'ng Oays (fisshing  -
operation days) due to the frequent  damage of the hoats.
2. Weak organisation and management of the cooperHtives.
From the beginning it had been rliff:icult to   find and select fisheries
cooperatives in the project location area with a sound organi-z3ation and
management.

Att. Mr. Shiv. Kapur
Director - Operations Evaluation Department.
Dear Mr. Kapur,
Re : Project Conpletion Report on Indonesian Fisheries
Credit Project (Credit 480-IND).-
Thank you for your letter addressed to Mr. Sunyoto Darmoredjo, our
former Director for Planning dated January 25, 1983 regarding the above-
captioned matter.
Not much caoments we can make on your Report since it has been
disclosing all the facts.  However something we should explain to permit
clearer view of the background situation and better understanding on the
shortfalls possessed.
1. Our poor accounting and project reporting is understandable due to the
problem of obtaining qualified accounting and administrative staffs in
adequate quantity locally. However, we are trying to grade up the
existing staffs gradually to ccmplete their qualification in the near
future.
Similar reasons are due fcr the loss of financial control over coope-
ratives and PPM operations in your term, beside the weakness in the
system itself which improvement effort is now underway.

2. Effort toward betterment of PPM's capital structure has been proceeded
a long time ago by application for modification of debt-to-equity ratio
(30 : 70) which process is underway at the Department of Finance level.
But the process seems to need some more time to finalize.
3. Audit on PPM accounts by state auditors was undertaken each year since
this is a government requirement.  However, since the availability of
the auditors in northern part of Indonesia where PPM belongs to is
ixadequate, the audit so far could not be undettaken right away on
application.   Consequantly it used to be conducted 6 months to 1 year
late. Nevertheless the availability of the supporting documents is
adequate despite lack worked-out.
4, To put experienced consultants in managerial position as reccnmended is
considered for future projects.
Expecting your further advice on the problems might be arising in our
projects, we remain.
Yours sincerely,
r Enterprise    elopment
.M. T unan.
