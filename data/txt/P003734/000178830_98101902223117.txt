INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMFENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECCMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
1l         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$6.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a fisheries credit project.
About $3.8 million of the credit would be lent by the Government to Bank
Rakyat Indonesia at 4 percent per annum and would be used together with Bank
Rakyat's own funds for lending to project sub-borrowers at 12 percent per
annum. About $2.0 million of the credit would be lent directly by the
Govemment to the State Fisheries Enterprise, Maluku (PNM), at 12 percent
per annums to expand and improve its fishing operations.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         The latest economic report on Indonesia (The Indonesian Econom y:
Recent Developments and Prospects for 1974/75, November 26, 1973, R73-273)
described and analysed the substantial changes which had taken place in the
Indonesian economy in 1973. Since then there have been important further
developments, especially in oil prices. A Basic Economic Mission is
planned for September/October 1974 to reassess Indonesia's longer -berm
development prospects and policies.
3.         The Indonesian economy, which was dualistic and export"oriented
in the colonial period, was severely affected by the great depression in
the 'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for independence, in
the 'forties. After a relatively brief period of recovery in the early
'fifties, the economy stagnated again in the decade 1957-1967 largely as a
result of adverse economic policies. Thus, after a long period of economic
difficulties, in which the population nearly doubled, Indonesia has become
one of the poorest large countries in the world (1970 population about 115
million, per capita income about $80).
4.         After the Suharto (bvernment introduced an effective stabiliza-
tion program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation of
the mid-1960s, there has been a period of recovery and rehabilitation under
the First Five-Year Plan. Real annual economic growth was close to 7
percent in the period 1968-1972. Domestic savings and investments increased
considerably, thus providing the basis for continued economic expansion
after the rehabilitation phase. By 1972, investments, excluding those in
the oil sector, had grown to an estimated 17 percent of the GNP, of which
more thar. two-thirds were financed from domestic sources. In agriculture,
sustained efforts were made to increase food production, with emphasis on
rice. Although a drought in the second half of 1972 led to a setback in
food production and a steep increase in prices, production has recovered
since then. Efforts to expand food production continue to receive high
priority and in this connection the Government plans a large increase in
fertilizer imports in 1974, international supplies permitting. Expansion of
domestic fertilizer capacity is being actively pursued.



- 2 -
5.        Even before the world energy shortage came to a head in the
latter part of 1973, the money economy was booming, and real growth
was probably accelerating under the influence of steep increasies in
Indonesia's export prices, a significant physical expansion of produc-
tion in t:ie oil and forestry sectors, a rapid growth in direct foreign
investmerrn (initially in mining, but increasingly in manufacturing),
and a large inflow of short-term credit. The same factors, however,
also caused significant inflation, reaching a rate of 140% per annum in
the beginning of 1974. The Government has taken a number of measures
to combat the inflation, most recently in April 1974.
6.        The contribution of the oil sector to the economy, which was
already increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September
1973. The Indonesian oil price, which was still $3.73 per barrel in
that month, reached $11.70 per barrel on April 1, 1974. In addition,
Indonesia has renegotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies
to receive a larger share of the total oil proceeds. Thus, while the
net oil contributions to the balance of payments and the Government's
oil reventues were below $0.5 billion in 1972/732/ (less than 5% of the
GNP), they are expected to reach well over $3 billion in 1974/75, an
intrease of $20 per capita. Given also the external and domestic in-
flation, total exports as well as budgetary receipts will probably
exceed $5 billion in 1974/75; a rough quadrupling in two years'.
7.         The inflation is, however, also affecting the expenditure side
of the balance of payments and the budget. Average Indonesian import prices
are expected to increase by 80 percent between 1972 and 1974, with the
largest increases occurring in foodstuffs and agricultural inputs (rice,
wheat, sugar, fertilizer). To shield the domestic consumer against the
effect of high external prices, the Government is subsidizing l;hese imports
at an annual cost of nearly $1 billion. In addition, the Government has to
pay more for domestic goods and services (including Government salaries).
Thus, about one-half of the additional budgetary receipts will be eroded
by the different effects of inflation. Of the other half, a sJignificant
part will be spent on real increases in Government outlays, including
much-needed gradual salary increases, development expenditures,, routfine
material expenditures, and subsidies to regions. Nevertheless,, there will
probably remain a budgetary surplus of $0.5 - $1.0 billion in 1974-75.
The expected overall surplus on the balance of payments is somerwhat larger,
and foreign exchange reserves may increase from $0.9 billion on March 31,
1974 to about $2 billion (about five months of imports at the then expected
rate) a year later.
8.        These surpluses are not large in relation to Indonesia's needs
for additional current and capital expenditures in nearly every field,
as specified in the Second Five Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79). oloreover,
1/ Fiscal year starting April 1.



earlier problema of absorptive capacity are gradually being overoome.
Thus, even though some of the expenditures budgeted for 1974/75
(consumers' subsidies) should only be temporary, it will probably not
be long before the new resources are fully absorbed.
9.        The Second Five Year Plan also provides significant new
directions in emphasizing the social, regional and equity aspects of
development. It is recognized that, while the Government's initial
econonic stabilization and rehabilitation programs, as well as a
number of specific activities, have benefitted large segments of the
population, the benefits of investments in the modern sector - much
of it in or around Jakarta - have not been widely spread. Also, the
continued high level of agricultural prices after the 1972 crop failure
has ultimately benefitted the rural areas, but is severely reducing
the real income of the urban poor. The Governmentts policy to keep the
prices of basic commodities in check through subsidization of imports
is providing relief, but it is the intention to gradually work out and
implement a number of more basic socially oriented policies in the
fields of employment, education, housing, etc.
10.       In the short and medium run, Indonesia therefore faces the
problems of efficient utilization of additional resources, and of the
implementation of more socially-oriented policies. In this context,
there will be a need for continued international technical assistance
for project implementation and institution building. After the new
resources have been absorbed, Indonesia will also still need financial
assistance to finance further programs to alleviato its poverty. There
is therefore a strong case for continued international assistance to
Indonesia, even though the country may generate relatively modest
budgetary and balance of payments surpluses for a limited period. In
all probability, these surpluses will have been absorbed by the time
disbursements from new projects become significant.
11.       The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the
context of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGt), and the
rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris
Club Agreement with the Western countries and Japan, and parallel
arrangement8 with several Eastern Eurppean countries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low. Service payments on re-
scheduled and subsequently incurred public debt are estimated at $320
million in 1974, will reach a peak of $380 million In 1975, and are pro-
jected to decrease gradually thereafter. Comparing these amounts with
the projected export level of over $5 billion in 1974/75, and given the
fact that Indonesia's external terms of trade will probably remain
favorable, it appears that Indonesia now has the capacity to service
significant additional debt.
12.       The changes in Indonesian economic circumstances discussed
above had become apparent by the time of the IGGI pledging meeting in
May 1974. its a result, it was generally agreed that program aid was
no longer necessary on economic grounds, although some donors will



-14-
continue such aid, at least for some time, for reasons of convenience.
At the same time, the meeting endorsedl the view that a considerable
expansion in project aid was warranted to assist Indonesia in carrying
out a more ambitious development strategy. Although some members were
not in a position to make pledges it seems likely that total aid
comnitments (including IBRD loans5 in 1974/75 will exceed the aid re-
quest of $850 million.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
13.       For the reasons indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue
to need substantial external financial and technical assistance to re-
habilitate and improve infrastructure and expand production capabilities
in agriculture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. With the con-
tinued growth of the economy, the Government will also be able to devote
increasing attention to development of effective programs designed to
ensure that the benefits of development are distributed widely.
Agricultural programs to increase the productivity of smallholder
farmers, regional development in the outer islands, family planning and
other social programs will therefore have an important place in the!
development strategy during the period of the Second Plan.
14.       The work of both the headquarters and Resident Staff has been
oriented toward these development objectives. The basic economnic
mission, scheduled for early this fall, will concentrate on questicins
of employment and income distribution.
15.       All Bank Group lending so far has been on IDA terms.   As a
result of Indonesia's rapidly improving balance of payments and re-
source position, described in Part I of this report, Indonesia is now
able to borrow on less concessional terns. The Bank has therefore in-
formed the Government that all lending after FY7h will be provided on
Bank terms. In addition to the Indonesian projects being presented to
the Executive Directors at the same time as this project, one :-A
credit is expected to be presented to the Executive Mirectors during
the next month.
16.       The Bank Group has in the past financed local currency costs
under its projects in Indonesia. Such financing will continue to be
necessary if the Bank Group is to increase assistance to the agriculture
and social sectors, where projects frequently have a low foreign ex-
change component. In such cases, the Bank Group will therefore! con-
tinue to provide limited amounts of local cost financing.
17.       As of April 30, 1974, Indonesia has received 34 IDA credits
amounting to US$509.3 million. The Bank Group accounts for less than
4% of Indonesia's total outstanding public debt. By 1978 it is ex-
pected to account for less than 11% of total outstanding debt and less
than 5% of Indonesia's annual debt service obligations. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of DA credits and IFC investments as of
April 30, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-going IDA projects.



-5-
18.       In accordance with the priorities of Indonesia's Five-Year
Plans, over 35% of IDA lending to date has been for agriculture. The
Association has extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop
plantations in the Government estates sector. Other credits for agri-
culture include four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems
and one each for a fisheries project, a seeds multiplication program,
beef cattle development, smallholder rubber development, sugar industry
rehabilitation and smallholder tea development. Industry is of growing
importance to the Indonesian economr and the Association has assisted
in four projects in this sector. It organized a consortium of lenders
to finance a major expansion of the PUSRI Fertilizer plant, assistecl in
the reorganization and financing of the major state development bank
(BAPINDO), provided financial assistance for Indonesia's first industrial
estate project, and assisted in the establishment and financing of the
Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Other priority
sectors to which credits have been extended are power, transportation,
telecommunications, education and population.   In addition, four tech-
nical assistance credits have been made to assist the Government in
preparing projects and formulating appropriate development policies.
A fifth irrigation project is expected to be presented to the Executive
Directors soon and projects in rural works, telecommunications, water
supply and urban development are under preparation.
19.       The first DA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and about
half of all credits have been made since June 1971. The program has
increased rapidly from a relatively small base, and consequently the
undisbursed portion of IDA credits is relatively large. Virtually
every credit has been associated with extensive institutional reforms
involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, draft-
ing of new charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which
has taken much time. A number of projects have experienced delays,
particularly in the initial stages of implementation. However, project
execution has improved sharply during the last year as organizational
improvements have begun to take effect and Indonesian staff have become
more familiar with Bank Group procedures. Given the status of projects
at the beginning of calendar 1973, disbursements under Indonesian pro-
jects during 1973 were about the same as would have been expected on an
IDA-wide basis for a program of the same size and composition. There
are, nevertheless, still several projects, including the first agri-
cultural esItate project and the smallholder rubber project, which
continue to suffer from management weakness and to require continued
close attention from the Bank's Resident Staff.

PART III - FISHERIhS IN INDONESIA
20.        Following its objectives of broad based agriculture and rural
development, the Government accords priority to expansion of fisheries
production for local consumption and for export. Indonesia's total fisheries
production in 1972 was estimated at about 1.3 million tons, of whitch landings
from ocean waters accounted for some 66 percent, catches from inland waters
(rivers and lakes) about 23 percent and fish and shrimp grown in ponds the
remaining 11 percent.  Currently about a million fishermen, inclu(ling fish
pond operators, are engaged in fisheries production0   They represent, together
with their families, some 4 - 5 percent of the population. The Indonesian
fishing fleet comprises about 281,000 sail boats and 7,000 motoriZed vessels
manned by some 890,000 fishermen, mostly operating at a subsistence level.
21.        Annual per capita consumption of fish, estimated at abcut 10 kg,
is low (compared to about 30 kg for the Philippines and Malaysia, for
example). Fisheries exports are also low, about 32,000 tons in 1972 worth
US$26 million. About 80 percent of this value is accounted for by frozen
shrimp shipped to Japan.
22.        In contrast with these low production figures, IndDnesia's
untapped fisheries resources are considerable. FAO has estimated the poten-
tial annual marine fish catch in Indonesia at about 6 million tons, seven
times the estimated landings in 1971. Ski.pjack tuna resources in Indonesian
waters are estimated by the Government to be about 150,000 tons annually.
To make fuller use of its skipjack resource, the Government has decided to
operate three skipjack projects, at Aer Tembaga (North Sulawesi), Ambon
(Maluku), and Sorong (West Irian). The first (Aer Tembaga) is an ongoing IDA
financed project (Credit No. 211-IND). The proposed credit would finance the
second (Ambon), which would be operated by the State Fisheries Ehterprise,
Maluku (NMI), a government owned enterprise already engaged in skipjack
fishing. The Asian Development Bank is assisting in financing the third
project, at Sorong.
23.        Brackish water pond culture is mostly for milkfish but Shrimp
cultivation also takes place in milkfish ponds which are close enough to the
coast so that water salinity is adequate. Shrimp fry are generally3 not
introduced into the ponds by the pond operators but enter the ponds; with the
inflow of water from the sea. For most pond operators, the production of
shrimp is in effect a by-product of milkfish culture. There are about 184,000
ha of brackish water ponds in Indonesia, from which some 60,000 tons of shrimp,
crabs, milkfish and other species of fish are harvested annually. Most of
these ponds are located along the north coast of Java and South Sulawesi and
vary in size from less than 1 ha up to about 7 ha0 Most are operator-owned
and provide only a subsistence level income0  Ponds are constructed with
simple dikes in swamp areas and there is little control over salinity levels
and water depths. Fertilizers, including organic manure, are rarely used.
There is virtually no control of snails and worms which compete with the
milkfish for food.  Fhrthermore, fry stocking management to make effective use



-7-
of the avaiLable feed is generally absent. As a result, production is low,
averaging about 330 kg per ha annually, with milkfish accounting for less
than half the output.  Crabs, shrimp, mullet, tilapia and other species
of fish, usually brought into the ponds by the inflow of water and not
intentionally introduced, account for the remaining output. Most ponds
produce only a single harvest. The disproportionately small share of milk-
fish is indlcative of the low level of technology applied.
24.        Some pond operators have begun to adopt better pond fishery
practices. Improved control of salinity and water depth in ponds has been
achieved through simple works, such as the raising of secondary dikes and
ditches, deepening of pond bottoms and canals, and additional sluice gates.
With some degree of water regulation and use of small amounts of fertilizers
(about 100 - 150 kg per ha) and in some instances pesticides, these operators
are harvesting annually 500-600 kg of milkfish and 100-150 kg of shrimp per
ha with two harvests, or about 4 times more than the average for all ponds.
Near the coast, where ponds have higher salinity levels, progressive pond
operators are giving increased emphasis to shrimp production and improved
ponds have been producing annually about 300 kg of milkfish and 250-350 kg
of shrimp per ha.
25.        Most fishing in the Java Sea is done within a few miles of the
coast. Sail boats make daily fishing trips, relying on changing tides and
wind, They do not have access to the substantial fisheries resources which
lie more than 5-10 miles from the shore. As a result, the five-mile zone
along the north coast of Java is overfished while the Java Sea beyond the
reach of sail boats includes rich fishing grounds. These grounds are
especially suitable for trawling because of their relatively flat bottom anid
shallow waters. Private entrepreneurs have begun to invest in trawlers to
exploit these fishing grounds. Although catches off the coast of Java are
reported to be good, the little exploited waters off South Kalimantan offer
potentially larger catches, including a higher percentage of shrimp.
26,        In view of the substantial potential for improvement of fisheries
production, the Government has sought bilateral and multilateral assistance
to formulato and finance fisheries projects, including facilities to improve
fish marketing. The Government provides various incentives, mainly exemp-
tions and reductions in taxes and import duties, to encourage private parti-
cipation in fisheries development. Where private investment is not forth-
coming, the Government through its Directorate General of Fisheries within
the Ministr., of Agriculture (DGF), sets up its own State Fisheries Diterprises
to carry out, projects.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
27.        The proposed project was prepared by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program in close consultation with the Government. It was appraised in
May-June 1973 and negotiations were held in Washington from April 8 to
16, 1974. 1'he Government's delegation was headed by Admiral NizaLm Zachman,
Director General of Fisheries.  The Appraisal Report, dated May 7, 1974
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
28.        U[nder Credit No. 211-IND, approved by the Executive Directors on
July 7, 1970, the Association financed a first skipjack tuna fisheries
project at Aer Tembaga, North Sulawesi. The part of the proposed project
directed to skipjack tuna (Parts A and B of Schedule 2 of the Development
Credit Agreement) define a project at Ambon, Maluku very similar in scope
and purpose to that financed under Credit No. 211-IND. That project suffered
from a number of start-up problems, including management difficulties and un-
satisfactory technical assistance. Over the last two years, the Government
has taken action to correct these problems. Contracts for the main shore
facilities have been awarded, management and engineering consultants have
been engaged, and project management and progress are now satisfactory.
The Project
29.        The project is designed to accelerate the Government's program to
increase production from its fisheries resources for both domesti.c consump-
tion and export, while providing increased employment opportuniti.es and
incomes for fishermen and their families. The project would be carried out
over a five year investment period in part by the State Fisheries Ehterprise,
Maluku (PNM), and in part through a lending program to be undertsken by the
Bank Rackyat Indonesia (BRI) with the assistance of the Directorate General of
Fisheries (DGF). The project has the following parts:
A.     _PN
(i) Purchase and utilization by PNM, for skipjack tuna
fishing in the vicinity of Ambon, of about ten 30-
gross ton pole-and-line vessels and two 100 gross
ton carrier vessels to supply the fishing vessels
with ice, fuel and supplies and transport the skip-
jack catches to PNMTs main base on Ambon;
(ii) Construction and equipping by PNM of an icemaking,
freezer and storage facility to preserve the quality
of the skipjack tuna catch, construction of necessary
jetties and repair facilities to facilitate opera-
cGion and maintenance of the fishing fleet, and
purchase and utilization of nets for catching live
bait fish for skipjack fishing;



-9-
B.      Skipjack Tuna Sub-borrowers
(i) Financial assistance through sub-loans from BRI to
Fisheries Cooperatives and private entrepreneurs
for the purchase and utilization of about ten 30-
gross ton pole-and-line fishing boats for skipjack
tuna fishing near Ambon; and
(ii) Financial assistance through sub-loans from BRI to
Fisheries Cooperatives and fishermen at Ambon
engaged in bait fishing for the purchase and
utilization of nets.
C.      Fish Pond Sub-borrowers
(i) Financial assistance through sub-loans from BRI to
pond operators to increase production from about
15,000 hectares of existing smallholder milkfish
and shrimp ponds in South Sulawesi and along the
northern coast of Java by introducing improvements
to pond construction and management, increasing the
use of fertilizers and pesticides and providing
initial stocking of ponds with fish fry and shrimp
larvae;
(ii) Establishment by DGF of a total of about forty-five,
one to five hectare ponds to demonstrate pond
improvements;
(iii) Financial assistance to Fisheries Cooperatives and
private entrepreneurs through sub-loans from BRI for
the construction and equipping of about nine small
ice plants to preserve the quality of fish and
shrim;p obtained under this part of the project.
D.      Trawler Sub-borrowers
(i) Fftnancial assistance to Fisheries Cooperatives
and private entrepreneurs through sub-loans from
BTIE for the purchase and utilization of about
twenty-five 30 gross ton trawlers for use in
catching fish and shrimp in the Java Sea.
Organization
30.        The DGF would coordinate, supervise and guide project implementa-
tion in addition to employing project experts (paragraph 31 ), and providing
demonstration ponds and extension services. PNMI, as a state-owned enterprise,
is responsible to the Director-General of Fisheries and is competently
managed. The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), one of five state-owned banks, has
considerable experience in short-term lending in the agricultural sectorr,



- 10 -
including fi;heries. While it is competent to make financial appraisals for
sub-borrower,s, it lacks technical expertise and would therefore rely on the
expertise of DGF and the project experts in carrying out the technical
appraisal of sub-loans. Since BRI's appraisal of project sub-loazns would
involve closE' cooperation with the teehnical staff of DGF and PNM, BRI
will employ a locally recruited fisheries officer on its staff to assist in
project implermentation.
Teehnical Assistance
31.        The credit would assist the Government in financing the services of
up to seven technical experts needed for effective implementation of the
project. Three suitably qualified and experienced pond fishery experts would
be recruited to assist DGF to implement the pond improvement component of the
project. In addition, a management specialist, an electrical/mechanical
engineer, a civil engineer or engineering firm, and a naval architect/master
boat builder would be employed by DGF. They would be seconded to PNM for
planning, designing, preparing tender documents and evaluating bids, and
supervising the construction, installation and operation of equipuent for the
vessels and shore facilities at Ambon. The Govenmient would make appropriate
arranpgments so that PNM, as the primary beneficiary of the services of these
four experts, would have an obligation to repay the Government for their
services.
Costs and Financing
32.        Total project costs are estimated at US$12.8 million equivalent of
which about US$3.8 million (30%) is the estimated foreign exchange component.

33.        The proposed IDA credit of US$6.5 million equivalent would finance
about 50 percent of total project cost, including about US$2.7 mi:LLion of
local currency cost. Sub-borrowers would contribute US$1.9 million eqlivalent
from their own resources toward subproject investment costs, incluzding con-
tributions in kind. BRI would finance about US$3.2 million equivalent of
sub-loans from its own resources and DGF would finance from budgeltary sources
about $,L4 million of project costs,



- 11 -
34.        Under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to IDA, the
Governrment would lend about $2.0 million of the proceeds of the credit to
PNM at 12 percent per annum for a maximum of 12 years including three year
grace   The Government would also provide PNM with working capital if
necessary. '-'M would purchase and market the skipjack catch of cooperatives
and private 'ishermen and would make arrangements with BRI to facilitate
repayment of the sub-loans out of the proceeds of such sales. The Government
would relend about $3.8 million of the credit to BRI under a subsidiary loan
agreement satisfactory to the Association at 4 percent per annum, the minimum
rate at which Bank Indonesia makes funds available to the state Banks. BRI
would make sub-loans from its own funds and the subsidiary loan, to pond
operators, fishermen and cooperatives at the official minimum rate of 12
percent per annum. BRI's effective interest spread on sub-loans will depend
on the cost of its own funds used for the project but is expected to be
adequate to cover administration costs and the risk of bad debts. BRI would
repay its subsidiary loan in accordance with the aggregate repayments of
project sub-loans. Sub-loans would be up to 85 percent (95 percent in the
case of nets) of the investment undertaken with repayment periods appropriate
to the investment made, subject to a maximum period of 12 years including
three years grace.
Disbursements
35.        The proceeds of the proposed II)A credit would finance 100 percent
of the foreign exchange cost of consultants' services, or 100 percent of
local costs restricted to salaries only, 50 percent of total expenditures on
civil works, equipment, materials and vessels for that part of the project
undertaken by PNM, and 58 percent of amounts disbursed on sub-loans made by
BRI.
36.        Disbursement requests would be supported by full documentation,
except for expenditures related to sub-loans which would be disbursed against
statements of expenditures. The supporting documents would be retainedl by
BRI and be available for review by project supervision missions.
Procurement
37.        Sub-borrowers for vessels would mainly be operators who already own
several fishing boats. Additional vessels must be equipped in a manner
compatible with the owner's fleets so as to minimize operation and maintenance
costs. There2ore, the hulls and the engines and other equipment would be
procured separately.
38.        There are a number of local shipyards capable of making the wooden
hulls (US$L.4 million equivalent) for the skipjack boats, carrier vessels and
trawlerso Contracts for fishing vessel hulls would, therefore, be awarded
after local competitive bidding among prequalified local shipyards, in
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. Foreig imanufacturers of vessel
engines, fishing gear and other equipment (US$2.5 million equivalent) are
already well represented in Indonesia and provide adequate service faci:Lities
and apare parts,   The Government would advertise internationally its intention
to procure this equipment at least three months before quotations for the
equipment were invited, thereby allowing suppliers not yet established or
represented in Indonesia an opportunity to establish themselves and prequalify.
Shore facilities at Ambon for the ice-making, freezer, and cold storage complex,

and installed under a single contract to be awarded after internationial
competitive bidding in accordance with tlhe Guidelines.  The nine small ice
plants (total value about US$0,6 million equivalent) would also bie procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Guidelines0
Improvement of the small, scattered fish ponds (US$4.4 million equivalent)
would be done over five years largely by manual labor, part of which would
be provided by the pond operators themselves. This work would, therefore,
not be suitable for bidding procedures and would be arranged as necessary
by the pond operators and extension service staff. Similarly, bait fish
nets would, because of their low cost (total about US$0.1 million equivalent),
be procured through prudent shopping by the sub-borrowers.
Benefits and Justification
39.        The proposed project would make an important contribut4on to the
Government's effort to develop fisheries production for domestic consimption
and export. At full development, the project would increase fishery produc-
tion by about 18,000 tons per annumn. A significant proportion would be
exported, including some 6,500 tons of skipjack tuna and most of the shrimp,
valued at an estimated US$5.7 million at current prices. The prcject would:
a) benefit about 9,000 fish pond operators and many
fishermen (most of whom are engaged in smalll,
mainly subsistence operations), either as members
of participating fisheries cooperatives or indi-
vidual entrepreneurs, and their employees and
dependents;
b) provide annually at full development about
1,000 permanent jobs on project vessels, at
Ambon shore facilities and in the small ice-
plants. Nets would provide part-time employ-
ment for about 1,100 bait fishermen, and the
fish pond component would generate annually
about 3 million man days of additional work for
operation of the improved ponds, mostly by
family labor presently underemployed; and
c) employ about 10,000 man years of labor for
project construction activities over the 5-year
development period. Through its provision of
the demonstration ponds and technical expertise,
the project would have a favorable demonstration
effect on pond improvements outside the project
and would also provide experience valuable to
future fisheries operations, including the
fisheries credit activities of BRI. The project
ice plants would likewise promote the use of ice
in the marketing of fish.

40.        The financial rates of return on individual sub-borrowers
investment would range from 20 percent to 38 percent, and incremental incomes
and financial returns would be sufficiently high to make the proposed
investments attractive; the economic rates of return on the sub-projects are
estimated to range from 22 percent to 42 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTjJflvSTS AND AUTHORITY
41.        The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and
the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and Bank
Rakyat Indonesia, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
42.        Features of interest in this project,concerning employment by BRI
of a fisheries officer, PNM purchasing the skipjack catch of private fishermen
and cooperatives and arranging with BRI to repay sub-loans out of the proceeds
of such purchases, and the procurement arrangements for vessel hulls, engines
and equipmentsare referred to in paragraphs 30, 34 and 38 of this Repc,rt and
are reflected in Section 3.05 of the Project Agreement, and Sections 4.06
and 4.08, Parts A and C of Schedule 3 to the Development Credit Agreement.
43.        I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
44.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 1'7  Irrigation Rehabilitation; US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1960; Closing Date: December 31, T975
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irrigation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumatra).
All the equipment supplied under the credit is being well utilized and
disbursements are 98% of appraisal timetable. Final completion of the
project is expected to be delayed by about two years in order to complete
much additional needed drainage work, the financing of which was not pro-
vided for under the &redit. These additional costs will be met by the
Government. The revised economic rate of return on the project, which
was calculated at 50% at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25%. The
closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154 Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project is now progressing satisfactorily.   The closing
date has been postponed by one year to December 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective six months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management, advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was found
to be genetically unsuited and, an unforeseen sharp fall in rubber prices
seriously restricted the availability of self-generated funds. With recent
improvements in management and much higher international prices for rubber
the financial situation of the PNP V is expected to improve.
Now that field and factory standards have been raised to a good
technical level the management has been advised to concentrate on cost
control in order to prepare for the time when produce prices are less
attractive than they are today. The combined efforts of the management,
consultants and IDA supervision missions are beginning to yield good
results.
Cr. No. 165  Electricity Distribution3 US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 19Y75
This project is progressing satisfactorily.   The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regardilag
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to

Cr. No. 193 PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion; US$35 Milion Credit OS
June 15, 1970 (as amended May 1973); Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The project has progressed satisfactorily after a new time
schedule was agreed to allow for time required to meet all conditionS of
effectiveness and the procurement requirements of all co-lenders. The
general contractor now is expected to complete the plant by early July 1974
about one-and-one-half months ahead of the revised schedule. The conistruc-
tion and installation of a natural gas gathering system and a 6', mileb trans-
mission line has also been delayed but the plant is now receivirng gas for
testing and the gathering system is expected to be completed two months
ahead of startup.
Cost for the fertilizer plant has increased by about 17% due
to currency revaluations and changes made as detailed design progressed
and the true composition of the gas became known. The gas system has
been enlarged to meet the increased need of the fertilizer complex and
to supply a greatly increased usage by Pertamina's refineries and by
power plants.
Latest cost estimates show an increase of about 130% against a
system capacity increase of 104%. Current estimates indicate a foreign
exchange cost over-run of nearly $30 million compared to the appraisal
report estimates. AID, OECF and IDA are contributing $4 million, $3.7
million and $5 million respectively to help finance the foreign exchange
cost over-run. The Government will cover the balance required to com-
plete the project.
Despite the capital cost increases the project has become more
remunerative. Given the substantially lower capital cost compared to
estimates for similar projects presently under consideration, and the
presently expected long-range international prices for Urea, the economic
rate of return, calculated at 14% at the time of appraisal, should now
be in excess of 30%.
Cr. No. 194 Agricultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project was for the rehabilitation of two Government-owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective eight months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was
found to be genetically unsuitable, and an unforeseen sharp fall in
rubber prices seriously restricted the availability of self-generated
funds. However, during 1973 a record 3,200 ha of oil palm were
planted on INP VI and the program will be virtually on target. The 1973
rubber progiam was reduced following the advice of the last Supervision
Mission as PNP IV was over-extended; if the high standards of replanting
now being achieved can be maintained, it should be possible to increase
the size of future programs again.



ANNEX II
5 of 10 pages
Mnagement has improved in the field and factory and reasonable
standards are being maintained. More emphasis is required on cost control
and managemrent has agreed to take the necessary action. Solid progress is
being echieved and PNP VI's financial situation has been greatly helped by
the present higher producer prices. PNP IV has also made marked progress
during 197.3 and is in a satisfactory financial position.
Cr. No. 195 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; Us$i8.5 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1974
The project includes rehabilitation and drainage works over
186,000 ha. After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of
tender documents and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is
now proceeding somewhat better. Problems of quality and progress still
exist, but, the consultants are tackling these vigorously, and this
situation is improving. Estimated costs remain within the overall
appraisal estimate, but the project will be one year behind appraisal
schedule.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications; US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; Closing Date:  June 30, 1974
After a slow start, due to procurement difficulties, orders for
all equipment except the tropospheric scatter system have now been placed.
The management consultants have completed their work but have been retained
to implement the recommendations being (liscussed between the Government
and the Association to work out appropriate measures. The Government is
requesting reallocation of the proceeds of the credit and postponement
of the closing date to complete disbursements.
Cr. No. 211  Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After a slow start this project is now progressing satisfactorily.
Project management satisfactory to the Association has now been appointed;
contracts with engineering and management consultants have been concluded
and the consultants have begun work and the contract for the shore facilities
has been awarded.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II; US$4.0 Million Credit of
September 15, 1970; Closing Date:  December_31 197)
This project is progressing satisfactorily, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date by one year to complete disburse-
ments for on-going studies.

Cr. No. 219 Education; US$4h6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
'The project is about 12 months behind schedule due to delay in
the appoirrbment of the architect but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Four out of five contracts for civil works have been approved by the
Government and the Association, as also have equipment lists. The leader
of the team of overseas specialists has arrived and is assisting the train-
ing of the first group of technical teachers for the centers. While dis-
bursements were initially slower than expected, it is likely that construc-
tion of the five centers will be completed in less time than originally
estimated and the final implementation would thus be on schedule.
Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$14.5 Million Credit of
November 6, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction remains about two years
behind schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents,
which have caused this delay, have been overcome and, while no further
delays are expected, it is unlikely that the time lost could be regained.
There has been some increase in overall project costs, and a re-view is
being carried out to determine the effect of the dollar devalua tion on
civil works and equipment contracts yet to be awarded. Disbursements are
improving to about 52% of the level estimated at appraisal. Sensitivity
tests run at the time of appraisal showed that a two year delay and 15%
cost overrun would reduce the economic rate of return from 25% to 21%.
Cr. No. 246 Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of May 14, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial delays
in organization, management and effective procurement. These problems are
being overcome but, because of procurement delays, inflation, currency re-
valuation and design changes in the seed processing plant, a 20'S cost in-
crease for the original project proposal became likely. However, recent
studies indicate that the market size for rice seed may be only about half
the original production target. Therefore, the latest Supervision Mission
has recomnended reduction of the seed production target from 22,000 tons
to 12,000 tons per annum in 1977, by which time the need for further
development of the seed industry would have been reviewed. The possibility
of such a reduction in project output was foreseen at the time of appraisal
and provided for in the Credit Agreement. Therefore, two subsidiary seed
processing centers will not be constructed and the funds now remlaining in
the credit will be adequate to complete the project. The expected economic
benefits of the project remain substantial with a rate of return of 59%,
not including the research and seed certification components whose benefits
are not easily quantifiable.

Closing Date: June 30, 1976
rhis credit is for the rehabilitation for two groups of
Government-owned tea estates in West Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and re-
lationships between management and consultants are good. Recently revised
cost estimates for factory rehabilitation and expansion are substantially
above appraisal estimates and project consultants have been asked to review
them.
Cr. No. 260  Highways II; US$35 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This project is in Sumatra and consists of construction with
supervisioii of about 200 km. of highway, detailed engineering of further
highway sections and a regional development study. The project is about
six months behind schedule, but the construction contracts have all been
awarded and no further delays are expected.
Cr. No. 275 Technical Assistance III; US$4 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on this project is satisfactory, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date to complete disbursements for on-
going studies.
Cr. No. 288 Second Education; US$12.5 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Project irplementation has been slow due to delays in concluding
a contract with consdltant architects and in recruiting technical assistance.
However, the architectural contract has now been signed and the project unit
has decided to recruit technical assistance through a FAO Fund-in-Trust
arrangement.  Project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 289 Irrigation Rehabilitation IV; US$12.5 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabilita-
tion of the irrigation system and the re-establishment of 0 & M in five
non-contiguous areas totalling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sampean. It
also provides for the enployment of consultants to assist in the execution
of Pekalen-3ampean and for feasibility studies of further irrigation re-
habilitation projects. Civil works and equipment purchase for the main
project, Pekalen-Sampean, are just beginning and are on schedule.
Consultants for the various studies are at work with their counterparts.
Groundwater investigations will be delayed due to procurement difficulties.
The rehabilitation and storage feasibility studies are on schedule.
Disbursements are on schedule.

Cr. No. 300 Population; US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1572;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1978
Progress under the project is currently being hampered by
organizational weakness and delays in obtaining necessary local currency
funds. The procurement of vehicles has also been delayed due to
Government ban on importing fully built-up cars. These matters are
currently being discussed with the Government.
Cr. No. 310 Develo ment Finance; US$10 Million Credit of
June_ 7,972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976

Cr. No. 318 Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation; US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Closing Date:  September 30, 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory but the weak financial
post.2ion of PELNI, the Government-owned shipping conpany and main sub-
borrower, has caused concern. An audit of PELNI has been completed and
in consultation with the Association and BAPINDO, the Government is
taking appropriate action to strengthan PELNI's financial position.
Cr. No. 319 Agricultural Estates IV; US$11 Million Credit of

This credit is for the rehabilitation and development of 8,600
ha rubber and 9,400 ha oil palms, including factories, on a group of
Government-owned estates in South Sumatra. After a delay of several
months to allow additional time to appoint inspection services and
executive assistants, this credit became effective on February 1, 1973.
The project has recovered from these initial delays and in now progressing
very satisfactorily. Agricultural standards are improving rapidly and
procurement planning is well advanced.

has been monitoring the project closely and Government is considering
actions to overcome present problems and accelerate project implementation.
Cr. No. 387 Education III; US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1, 1973; Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1973. Manu-
script preparation, testing and book production is well advanced. The
development of programs for book distribution and teacher training depend
largely on the timely recruitment of technical assistance. The Government
approached UNESCO for this technical assistance under a contract reimburs-

Cr. No. 405 Sugar Project; US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Closing Date:  June 30, 1979
The effectiveness of this credit was delayed because it took
longer than expected for the Government to implement legal and institu-
tion changes to amalgamate existing PNPs into larger PT estate groups
and to establish a joint sugar projects unit to provide overall coordina-
tion. These changes have now been implemented and the credit was de-
clared effective in April 1974. However, the Government engaged the
necessary consultants'services prior to credit effectiveness and work
is proceeding on schedule.
