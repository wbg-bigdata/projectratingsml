F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project is to assess the feasibility of introducing reforms in land
administration, within an emerging government structure, by enabling the formulation of
policy, legal, and institutional changes to achieve efficient procedures for the issuance of
land titles and registration of property transactions, and transparent processes for the
management and disposal of public land.

3.     Assessment of Development Objectives, Design, and of Quality at Entry


3.1.   Original Objectives


1.       The "Land Administration Program" (Program) is a long term commitment by the
Palestinian Authority (PA) to achieve the goal of enhancing economic growth by developing an
efficient and trusted system of land registration and cadastre that would increase the number of
formal land transactions and collateralized lending, enhance local revenues from land and
property related fees and taxes, create efficient property markets, and establishing a transparent
system for public land management.

2.       The path to delivering on this commitment is fraught with challenges: political, security,
economic, social, and institutional. The territorial space of West Bank and Gaza over which the
Palestinian Authority has control is not contiguous, and the fragmentation of the territory is
exacerbated by a regime of movement and access restrictions imposed by the Israeli government.
According to the Oslo Accords, the West Bank is divided into Areas A (17 percent), B (24
percent) and C (59 percent). In Area A the PA has full civil and security control, in Area B the
PA has civil control and security is controlled jointly by the PA and Israel, and in Area C Israel
has full civil and military control. The Palestinian economy continues to contract under the
pressure of economic restrictions and political instability, and public and private investment
exhibit a declining trend.

3.       At the time of project preparation, land administration and registration within the PA
controlled areas was slow and lacking in resources. While close to 90 percent of land in Gaza was
registered, only about 28 percent of the land in the West Bank was registered. In addition to the
many challenges for implementing the PA's Land Administration Program, was the fragmented
legal framework for land administration and management in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG).
This framework was complex due to the historical legacies of Palestinian, Ottoman, Jordanian
and Israeli laws, many heavily influenced by British and Egyptian laws ­ these had not yet been
consolidated cohesively to support an efficient program of land administration. Mechanisms for
the management of public lands were inefficient and opaque, institutional arrangements for land
management were ineffective, and the rate of land related disputes was high.

4.       In 2002 the PA merged the functions of administration, surveying, registration, and state
land management, and consolidated them under one institution, the Palestinian Land Authority
(PLA), reporting to the Council of Ministers. As a young institution, lacking resources, technical
capacity and a governance structure to deliver on this expanded mandate, progress on surveying
and registration of land, was slow, and many properties remained outside the formal registration
system. The Ministry of Planning, although responsible for land use planning and policy making,
had also not delivered on its mandate. It had not developed standards or procedures for policy
making.

5.       On January 26, 2005, the Bank approved a Grant of US$3.0 million to support a Learning
and Innovation Loan (LIL) for the Land Administration Project (LAP). This LIL marked the first
phase of the Bank's support for the PA's Land Administration Program. Against an Appraisal
estimate of US$6.0 million, US$4.476 was made available for the LAP: US$3.00 million as a
grant from the World Bank and US$ 1.476 million from the Government of Finland as co-
financing for the project. Additionally the Government of Finland also provided EUR 1.17
million (US$1.3 million) as parallel finance.


                                                  1

6.       The goals of the LAP were aligned with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
approved by the Bank Board on December 2, 2003, which aimed to achieve a balance between
emergency assistance on the one hand, and preparing Palestinian institutions for the eventual
assumption of sovereign responsibilities associated with future Palestinian statehood.

7.       The development objective of the LAP as written in the PAD was:

"to assess the feasibility of introducing reforms in land administration, within an emerging
government structure, by enabling the formulation of policy, legal, and institutional changes to
achieve efficient procedures for the issuance of land titles and registration of property
transactions, and transparent processes for the management and disposal of public land."

3.2    Revised Objectives:

8.       The PDO in the Trust Fund Agreement was:

"the objective of the project is to assess the feasibility of introducing reforms in land
administration by enabling the Palestinian Authority to formulate policy, legal and institutional
measures required to put in place: (a) suitable procedures for the issuance of land titles and
registration of property transactions; and (b) transparent processes for the management and
disposal of public land."

9.       The PDO appears revised in the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRRs) as
follows:

"the objective of this project is to assess/learn the extent of commitment and readiness of the PA
to reforming land administration by introducing policy, legal and institutional changes to achieve
efficient procedures for the issuance of land titles and registration of property transactions, and
transparent processes for the management and disposal of public land1".

10.      Assessment of development objectives: The PDO as stated in the PAD or TF Agreement,
although not consistent in language, set a clear bar of assessing feasibility of reforms as the prime
objective of the project. This required first and foremost, gaining knowledge on what changes are
needed, and then knowledge of what it would take to implement that change. So the project
basically sought answers to three questions below. Answers to the first two questions below were
to enable an assessment of the feasibility of developing an appropriate framework for surveying
and registration work, which when applied at scale, would lead to an increase in property
transactions. The answer to the third question below would inform on what it would take to
develop and then implement a public land management strategy.

Question 1: Is it possible to develop a cohesive policy framework, efficient laws and
institutions through participatory processes? And can corresponding regulations be
established for a sequenced step by step implementation?

Question 2: Will improvements in surveying and registration services lead to an
increase in registration and property related transactions?


1        This PDO is consistent with the PDO presented in the PAD at the time of the Decision Meeting (November
18, 2004)

                                                        2

Question 3: Is it possible to develop a data base of public land, and implement the use of
transparent procedures for the management, use, and disposal of public land?

11.      The project's design erred in making the assumption that feasibility would be assessed
only if the changes needed were implemented. As a consequence of this assumption, it raised the
bar of success from "learning" about what was needed, to a much higher bar of implementation of
the changes needed within the project's life. It therefore linked the achievement of this higher bar
of success to the PA's ability to carry out the reforms that were articulated during the course of
the project, within the project's life.

12.      The difficulty and complexity of achieving change through legislation is a huge challenge
even in countries that are politically stable; the expectation that legislatively led change could be
brought about within the three years of the project's life in an environment that prevails in WBG,
was hugely unrealistic. The changes that needed to be made were indeed identified during the
course of the project. Also identified was what it would take, in terms of resources and time, to
implement these changes.

3.3      Original Components

13.      A large number of studies and activities were thematically packaged under the following
four components:

14.      Component 1: Land Policy Formulation and Development of Regulatory Framework
(US$1.3 million): This component would support consensus building, through consultations and
public hearings, for the formulation of a national land policy documents and an action plan for
implementation, and the revision of the regulatory framework governing land administration.
Priority land policy areas under study include: (i) land registration study to identify the registry's
current degree of accuracy and the factors limiting its use; (ii) the functioning of land markets to
identify land market distortions and policy options; (iii) land disputes and resolution mechanisms;
(iv) management and disposal of public land to identify reforms in priorities, standards and
processes of public land management; (v) property valuation; and (vi) the legal and institutional
framework for land administration to identify areas of legal and jurisdictional ambiguity and/or
overlap, and recommend policy options and improvements to the legal framework.

15.      Component 2: Piloting of Systematic Land Registration and Modern Land Office
(US$1.9 million): This included: (i) piloting land surveying, systematic titling and registration in
areas A and B under PA jurisdiction in and around Ramallah, the West Bank, using several pilot
locations selected respectively in urban/residential, peri-urban and rural areas; and covering in
total 10,000 dunums (1,000 ha); (ii) pilot establishment of modern land offices in two locations in
Ramallah, the West Bank and Gaza with the goal of establishing clear, monitorable service
standards through re-engineering office functions, staff training, and introduction of technologies
to improve efficiency and transparency.

16.      Component 3: Piloting of Public Land Inventory and Management Strategy (US$0. 7
million): This component would support the establishment of an inventory of public land in areas
A and B in two municipalities, one in the West Bank and the other in Gaza, and the development
of a public land management strategy and instruments. The public land inventory would primarily
focus on State land, but also on municipal land holdings where feasible. This component would
complement the on-going work financed by the International Development Research Center of
Canada (IDRC) and undertaken by the Ministry of Planning's Geographic Center and Technical

                                                   3

Support Directorate involving the digitization of Jordanian cadastral maps (until 1967) and
development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of State land, along with
procurement of some computer equipment and training.

17.       Component 4: Institutional Development (US$l.7 million): This component would
support: (i) institutional development to the PLA to be able to undertake its mandate efficiently
and effectively; (ii) strengthening education programs in land administration/management and
surveying; (iii) strengthening private sector capacity in surveying; (iv) public awareness and
community participation campaigns; and (v) project management support for both the MOP and
the PLA, including performance monitoring and evaluation and distillation of lessons learned

18.       Finally unallocated funds to the amount of US$0.4 million would support: (i) any
additional technical assistance that may arise through the project; and (ii) any increase in the cost
of the project components.

3.4     Revised Components

19.       The project's components were not revised, although the scope of the planned activities
under Components 2, 3, and 4, did change, as did the funds available for the project ­ from a
PAD estimate of US$6.0 million to an actual availability of US$4.476 million:

No activities were undertaken in Gaza due to a change in the security and political situation
following the election of Hamas in March 2006.

Under Component 2, systematic surveying in pilot areas was completed, covering a larger area
than originally planned in the West Bank, as a result of the additional resources for LAP made
available by the Government of Finland. Under Component 3, the piloting of a public land
inventory in the West Bank was not completed due to the lack of availability of aerial
photographs at a suitable scale due to security restrictions by the Government of Israel.

Under Component 4, due to the withdrawal of USAID's support, the institutional building
activities, for example the delivery of courses on ground surveying and the capacity building of
the private surveyors had to be scaled back2. The project's closing date was extended from
December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 to enable the finalization of the analytic work and the
drafting of new laws, completion of the additional surveying, and completion of the re-
engineering of the PLA's offices in Ramallah.

3.5     Quality at Entry
20.       Quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory by this ICRR.

21.       While the choice of a LIL as an instrument for the project was appropriate for the
context, key design features were unsatisfactory.

22.       A LIL was an appropriate instrument to choose for the LAP for the following reasons:

    ·     Substantial knowledge gaps needed to be filled before specific reforms for specific
          outcomes that would be needed could be identified.

2         USAID had also planned to finance in parallel other pilot land settlement activities in mutually agreed areas
as well as the modernization of the PLA's offices (Supervision Mission Aide Memoire, June 20-25, 2005).


                                                          4

    ·    There was a need to better understand what instrument would be feasible to achieve the
         desired outcome.
    ·    Experimentation with systematic surveying was essential to assess capacity constraints,
         both on the private sector and the public sector side, before a model for scaling up could
         be developed.
    ·    It was important to pilot in different kinds of locations before scaling-up, so the sites for
         piloting were carefully selected to generate learning about surveying in urban, semi-
         urban, and rural areas and parcel sizes in different locations.
    ·    There was a need to understand why the formal registration system was underutilized so
         that the PA could address the impediments in the future.
    ·    It was also important to clarify before scaling-up, the institutional roles and
         responsibilities, the specific requirements to prepare the institutions to deliver on their
         mandated responsibilities, and estimates of the resources and time that would be needed
         to implement the next phase of support for the PA's Program.

23.      However, quality of entry with respect to the design of the LIL is rated moderately
unsatisfactory, for the reasons discussed below.

24.      The project's objectives were not very clearly formulated, which led to tenuous links
between the objectives, outputs and performance indicators. As the project was a LIL that was
aiming to assess feasibility, the tenuous links established in the PAD could be partly due to
inexperience with M&E design, but importantly also due to selecting indicators from other land
administration projects that may have been sector investment loans (SILs). This lack of logical
links between "objectives to outcomes" and between "components to outputs" is evident in the
Annex 1a of the PAD, where outcome indicators are assigned not just to the PDO, but also to
each component. The confusion created by this lack of logic on the M&E framework, becomes
evident during implementation, as the number of PDOs reported upon in the ISRRs change (in
content and number), often being intermingled with intermediate outcome indicators. A third
factor could be the inherent complexity of developing "learning" indicators, or indicators that
measured "learning".

25.      The lack of logic in the selection of indicators can be traced to the underlying
assumptions that were unrealistic. For example, the assumption that surveying would lead to the
issuance of titles within the project's life caused the project to include a numeric indicator for the
issuance of titles. The original project objectives emphasized "titling" rather than "registration",
even though properties had to first be surveyed, then registered (i.e. recorded in the PLA's land
registry), after which property owners would seek to receive their titles upon demand. Learning
about the first two steps, surveying and registration, was needed before titles could be issued,
particularly in a context where this was to be initiated after forty years. As a result of the way the
objectives were formulated, the project selected performance indicators that were logically linked
to "titles". The project thus tracked an indicator on which data could be gathered
comprehensively only five years after completion of surveying and registration in keeping with
the prevailing Palestinian law that gives people five years to pick up titles to their property. The
project's life was initially three years, and then extended to four years.

26.      An indicator that tracked registration would probably have been more appropriate and
encouraging for the PLA. Additionally in the context of WBG, where the first task is to reduce
the level of informality by bringing property owners into the PLA's land registry, an output
indicator that tracked surveying and registration, and another separate indicator that tracked titles
issued, may have been more appropriate.


                                                   5

27.        The original design life of the project was too short relative to the number of activities
that had to be implemented, particularly because the technical design of some activities became
possible only after analytic work supported by the project was completed. For example, it was the
completion of several concurrent studies in May 2007 that highlighted the additional factors that
affect the issuing of titles3. Had this knowledge been available at appraisal, it could have
influenced the dialogue with the client, the design of the project, the sequencing of procurement,
and ultimately a realistic assessment of both the time needed for the project, and the choice of
performance indicators. Similarly, the project established a percentage target for the number of
parcels that would have titles issued in the pilot areas at Appraisal, without technical knowledge
that could only be gained with implementation. For example, the target was established without
knowing the average density of parcels in the pilot areas. The density of parcels has implications
for both the costs of surveying, the time this would take, and ensuring that the design of the
activity is linked to the availability of skilled human resources for implementation within the
design life of the project.

28.        The project's design did not adequately recognize the capacity constraints in the
implementing agencies. While the design benefited from the design of other land administration
projects, it was not adequately adapted to the prevailing context. It set up expectations that were
not realistic in the context of both the prevailing political and security situation in WBG, as well
as the weak capacity of newly created implementing agencies.

29.        The design also failed to ensure that an adequately qualified and staffed implementation
unit, which had been trained in at least procurement and financial management, was in place by
Appraisal. Experience demonstrates that in the absence of a team of staff dedicated to project
preparation and implementation, implementation suffers. This should have been a condition for
Appraisal, in addition to expressions of the PA's commitment and policy commitment.

30.        Despite these design shortcomings, which may easily have caused tension during
implementation as a consequence of an unrealistic performance bar set by the project's design,
the process of this ICRR demonstrates that it is in fact, the learning from the ambitious number of
concurrent activities packaged under this LIL, that provides both the rationale as well as the
parameters for selectivity in the next phase of support. It is clear that the next phase must focus
on accelerating surveying and registration within procedures customized to rapidly expand
coverage of surveying and registration, within a time frame a priori, established by the PA to
achieve its long term goal. It is this decision by the PA that will determine the choices that will
be made for scaling-up support for systematic surveying and registration.




3          The additional factors that affect registration include the requirement that the property owner produce proof
of payment of property taxes in the form of a "tax clearance" from the Ministry of Finance's tax department, including
any accumulated property taxes by the previous owner and provide proof of this payment through a "debt free"
certificate from the municipality; a registration fee of 1 percent of the property value; as well as education taxes, utility
bills etc.

                                                               6

4.      Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

4.1     Outcome/achievement of Objectives

31.      Even though the original objectives of the project could have been stated with greater
clarity, the achievements of the LAP need to be assessed against: (i) its contribution towards
identifying the requirements for WBG's long term program for a secure and efficient strategy for
completion of surveying and registration of privately held land in the WBG4, and (ii) for
underscoring the enormous challenges for public land management which need to be realistically
addressed to enable first and foremost, an inventory of land in the future.

32.      Outcome: The outcome of the LIL is rated satisfactory because of its catalytic role in
initiating concurrent and significant advances in policy development, surveying and registration,
dispute resolution, land management and capacity development, which now enable prioritization
of interventions. The LIL provided an opportunity for substantial learning, advanced consensus
building, and pioneered several activities that have not been undertaken before.

33.      Implementation of the project has:

(i) G enerated policies that have established a clear and strategic direction for the efficient,
     transparent and effective management of WBG's scarce land resources.
(ii) Enabled the conceptualization of the scale of the task ahead, and generated critical data,
     knowledge, informed on capacity building needs, which together can now enable the
     development of a realistic operational strategy that optimizes resources for systematic
     surveying and registration of all urban, rural, and semi-urban areas in Areas A and B of
     WBG, e.g. knowledge of parcel sizes has enabled some basis for the estimation of the total
     number of parcels there might be ­ which in turn has a bearing on estimating the costs of the
     Program, and therefore the strategy for the Program; and
(iii)Generated debate for the first time, as well as demand from diverse stakeholders, for
     improved governance in systematic surveying and registration and public land management.

34.      An important unintended outcome of the project was the legitimacy it has provided to
women's voices on their legal rights. For example, almost 40 percent of the land in one area is
owned by women ­ ownership by women in the additional areas will be known once the
evaluation currently being undertaken by the Government of Finland is completed. The project
empowered these women with ownership, gaving them greater social influence, and raised public
awareness about women's rights. The project also institutionalized the practice of the inclusion of
at least one woman as member of the land settlement committee and village council.

         On (i) policy contributions:

35.      A National Land Policy Framework was developed through consensus building amongst
diverse stakeholders, followed by draft new laws that will address a complex set of land
management and administration issues in WBG upon their passage.

         On (ii) strategy for resources for surveying and registration



4        The project envisaged a subsequent large-scale program at Appraisal.

                                                         7

36.      As a result of the very preliminary findings from the pilot activities, it is now estimated
that there are about 1.4 million parcels or about 3.2 million dunums5 of land in WBG to be
surveyed and registered ­ the pilots have become the only basis for such an estimate in the West
Bank. Completing this task within a realistic time frame and in an affordable way, will require
substantial innovation; knowledge transfer; resources; re-orientation and operational
reorganization of the Palestinian Land Authority; as well as enhanced capacity of both the public
and private sector to deliver desirable results.

37.      The costs of such a program, excluding administrative costs, could vary between US$240
million to US$600 million, possibly even as low as US$110 million, depending on the level of
innovation that is integrated into the program, as well as the packaging of procurement. With the
existing level of innovation integrated into the PLA's operational plans, it could take the PLA
over 80 years to complete a national program costing about US$280 million over this period6.

38.      The project has demonstrated the power and efficiency of partnerships with
municipalities and the private sector to enable concurrent progress of surveying in multiple
locations. Without embracing this innovation, it will not be possible to complete surveying and
registration of all properties in Areas A and B within a realistic, affordable, and acceptable time
frame in WBG.

         On (iii) demand for improved governance

39.      The project unleashed open discussion amongst diverse stakeholders on land registration
issues for the first time, with candid debate on the strategic and political importance of land and
the need for its conservation and proper management for future generations. The stakeholder
relationships catalyzed through participatory processes by the project are sustained, as
demonstrated by the successful workshop aimed to tease out lessons from LAP 1 where
stakeholders unanimously expressed demand for (i) measurable progress indicators from
activities executed by the PLA; (ii) increased efficiency in the PLA's operations; and (iii) broad
public access to the PLA's plans for systematic surveying and registration, which discloses
prioritized areas, criteria for establishing priorities, and a time table for its activities in these
areas.

40.      Achievement of Objectives: The project was able to assess the feasibility of introducing
reforms for (i) efficient procedures for the issuance of land titles, and registration of property
transactions. The project was not able to assess the feasibility of introducing (ii) transparent
processes for the management and disposal of public land.

41.      On (i): above, it is feasible to introduce reforms in the immediate term that can lead to
efficient procedures that create incentives for registration. More efficient procedures for
surveying and registration can be introduced as soon as a critical decision is taken by the PA on
the overall time frame within which it would like to see the PLA complete this task. Reforms for
moving toward the issuance of titling are also feasible, although over the medium term.
Accelerating surveying and registration is of highest priority in order to secure tenure for the
Palestinian population. This would broaden the number of municipalities that can benefit from
increased revenues as a result of registration, and demonstrate tangible action to the people on the

ground. This foundation once established, can be embellished by reforms to the rules that govern
the issuance of titling over the medium term.

42.      Both the knowledge and the experience from the implementation of activities under
Components 1 and 2 highlight that the promulgation of new rules, regulations, and instructions by
the PLA to supersede current practices for surveying, registration, will enhance the efficiency of
surveying and registration. Enhanced efficiency will encourage more owners to come forth, and it
will be possible for the land registry to include a critical mass of properties. Once this happens it
would inspire greater confidence in the public, drawing more properties into the registry over
time.

43.      To progress beyond a registration system towards a more efficient and affordable path for
property titles, additional steps will be needed to create incentives for owners of registered
properties to come forward to get titles and keep their titles updated. The institution of such
incentives will require the PA to make tradeoffs, particularly with respect to costs of getting a
title. From the better understanding of land markets, land management, and property taxation
issues that derive from the various studies supported by Component 1, the PA is in a stronger
position to assess these tradeoffs, which was not possible before the LAP.

44.      In terms of introducing reforms through legislative action, draft laws that cover a broad
spectrum of reforms were developed. There is consensus amongst professional associations,
communities, NGOs, civil society organizations as well as PA agencies, on the overall strategic
direction of these new land laws. The passage of these laws by the Palestinian Legislative Council
has not taken place as the Council has not been in session since June 2007 ­ they have however,
been approved by the Cabinet and are being reviewed by the "Higher National Committee for the
Legislative Plan". These draft laws contain provisions for the management of public land, and
these provisions are expected to be a specific area of review by the Legislative Committee, which
was reviewing these laws at close of project.

45.      It is expected that the passage of these laws will:

     ·   Consolidate the West Bank and Gaza7 legislation on systematic and sporadic registration
         and clarify certain provisions related to registration of transactions.
     ·   Simplify and standardize tenures and clarify transferability of land under certain tenures.
     ·   Reduce overlaps between the roles of land registry and public notaries.
     ·   Limit and ultimately phase out the use of irrevocable powers of attorney.
     ·   Allow and establish rules for foreign ownership.
     ·   Provide a legal framework for a public land inventory, for recording and management of
         public land.
     ·   Set clear and transparent procedures for acquisition of public land to ensure fair
         compensation.
     ·   Phase out rent control regimes.
     ·   Enable the integration into a single system the records of private, public and waqf land.
     ·   Limit the use of land registration for tax purposes (which will significantly contribute to
         establishing a critical mass in the land registry).


7        Gaza applies the Egyptian land law, while the West Bank applies the Jordanian land law.




                                                        9

     ·   Enable flexibility in survey standards.
     ·   Allow for adequate provision of time and resources, for systematic surveying
         adjudication and land registration.
     ·   Offer options for dispute resolution.
     ·   Enable the development of clear definitions of "public purpose and compensation".
     ·   Provide an adequate legal framework for the establishment of the PLA missing since its
         establishment in 2002.

46.      Last but not least, the passage of these laws will enhance security of titles by providing
options to incorporate a guarantee system to support reliability and conclusiveness.

47.      The adoption of participatory processes for the formulation of policies that have
established a clear and strategic direction has helped kick start debate on land sector reform in
WBG. Once the laws based on this overall policy direction are passed and come into effect, there
is expected to be greater popular demand for their enforcement, contributing to improved
governance.

48.      The project successfully tested innovations for surveying, developed a written manual for
procedures for settlement, and implemented a computerized land registration system in Ramallah
as a first step towards establishing a comprehensive land information system. It also generated
critical knowledge to inform on steps that will be needed to create incentives for owners of
registered properties to come forward to get titles and keep their titles updated. As a consequence
of the project, there is an increased demand for systematic surveying from municipalities.
Additional resources were allocated by the Palestinian Land Authority during the project's life for
scaling-up surveying in Bethlehem. Hebron municipality signed a memorandum of understanding
with the PLA for surveying in its jurisdiction, using the municipality's resources.

49.      On (ii): it was not possible to assess the feasibility of introducing transparent processes
for the management and disposal of public land, because the piloting of the public land inventory
did not take place.

50.      Both the selection of municipalities as well as determination of the scale of the area
where inventory would be piloted was to be determined during implementation, in consultation
with the LPTF. Detailed costs for this therefore, could only be developed during implementation,
as the scale of public land to be included would be a determining factor for costs8. A decision to
procure aerial photographs for Ramallah Municipality was taken in March 2007, but procuring
aerial photography at the appropriate scale was first delayed, and then ultimately not possible
because of restrictions imposed by the Government of Israel on flights over the West Bank.

4.2    Outputs by Components

52.        Six complex studies were completed as planned and integrated into one report (the
National Land Policy Framework), and draft laws were drafted. The six studies were: (i) a land
registration study to identify the registry's current degree of accuracy and the factors limiting its
use; (ii) a land market study to identify land market distortions and policy options; (iii) a study to
identify resolution mechanisms for land disputes; (iv) a study of the management and disposal
practices of public land to identify reform priorities, develop standards and processes of public
land management; (v) a property valuation study; and (vi) a study of the legal and institutional
framework for land administration to identify areas of legal and jurisdictional ambiguity and/or
overlap, and recommend policy options and improvements to the legal framework.

53.        The new draft laws that cover a broad spectrum of reforms were: (i) Land Rights law; (ii)
Land Registration Law; (iii) Eminent Domain Law; and (iv) Institutional Framework for the
Palestinian Land Authority.

Component 2:                    Piloting of Systematic Land Registration and Modern Land Office
                                PAD US$1.9 million, 31.6% of Total Original Project Estimate of
                                US$6.0 million; Actual Disbursed US$1,232,163 or 64.8% of the PAD
                                estimate for Component 2.

54.        This component is rated satisfactory.

55.        38 percent more area than the initial target area of 10,000 dunums was systematically
surveyed (this includes the area surveyed by the additional funds from the Government of
Finland, supervised by Finmap9). A detailed manual for cadastral surveying, adjudication and
registration as well as all the necessary forms were produced. However, these are yet to be
revised based on the procedures used during the pilots, as the rationale for these new procedures
was to test their feasibility to become mainstreamed as regulations before scaling-up10. The
component enabled the development of very preliminary indicators of both unit costs of
surveying (not including administrative costs), as well as average parcel sizes in urban, semi-
urban and rural areas (see table below), creating some basis for estimating these for the future, in
a context where there was no basis.

56. R       e-engineering of the PLA's offices in Ramallah was completed in December 2008,
enabling all the departments of the PLA to be located in one building, which improved work-flow
in the PLA. A Computerized Land Registration system was implemented, capable of generating
and printing a complete land registration record. All registration records in five villages were
scanned and entered in the system, and are now searchable. More than 600 registered properties
had been captured by the system by the time the project closed. Computerized data management
systems have also been established. A number of forms are available electronically, including
digital maps and scanned copy of documents that establish the proof of ownership of property. A
settlement committee was established in the PLA, was trained in Jordan in 2006, and received on-
the-job training as well14. This committee has since trained other PLA staff. The pilots enabled
on-the-job training for 20 staff of the PLA and private sector surveyors.

57.        Although these figures in the table above derive from a very small sample, it is surprising
that the average parcel size for the urban areas is larger than for the peri-urban area. An
evaluation of the pilots is underway by the Government of Finland, and may shed more light on
the anomalies evident from the data above, including exactly how much of the land surveyed is
indeed registered. Nevertheless, this data is the only guide for developing estimates for an
accelerated program for systematic surveying in the future. Implementation of the settlement
activities demonstrated that future programs that support scaling up of systematic surveying
adjudication and registration, must be preceded by a program to establish an adequately sized
pool of qualified, well trained, and full-time land settlement judges so that disputes can be
resolved in a timely way. In the first lot of contracts for which information is available, there
were a total of 348 disputes, of which 269 were resolved.

58.        Important knowledge gained from the pilots demonstrated to the PLA the efficiency gains
for surveying work in WBG, when the PLA involved the private sector in surveying. This (i)
enhanced the PLA's role from the "doer" to the "supervisor"; (ii) sparked the growth of private

11         This ICRR revised and analyzed the costs based on contracts awarded to three surveying companies. More
reliable figures based on field data collection and analysis are expected to be available from the evaluation underway,
being supported by the Government of Finland.
12         These figures represent the unit costs per parcel from two separate contracts, the first awarded by the PLA,
and the second financed through additional financing provided by the Government of Finland.
13         Contracting surveying to the private sector proved to be efficient. Procurement packaging alo appears to
have made a substantial difference to unit costs. The contract awarded by the PLA in 2007 for about 2000 dunums
presents an indicative unit cost of $135 per dunum. A contract awarded almost a year later for twice the area by the
additional funds provided by the Government of Finland, presents unit costs of about $59 per dunum.
14         A study tour organized for the PLA Chairman, senior technical staff, MoP policy development officer, Birzeit
University Law Institute staff, team leader of the LAP implementation unit, and a private sector representative to be
supported by the Government of Finland, was cancelled by the client.

                                                             12

firms for surveying; and (iii) released the PLA's resources to focus on the more strategic and
complex work of adjudication and registration.

Component 3:               Piloting of Public Land Inventory and Management Strategy
                           (PAD US$0. 7 million, 11.6% of Total Original Project Estimate of
                           US$6.0 million, Actual Disbursed US$56,847 or 8.1 % of the PAD
                           estimate of Component 3.

59.      This component is rated unsatisfactory as it could not be implemented due to factors
outside the control of the implementing agencies as well as the PA.

60.      The piloting of an inventory of public land in the two selected municipalities was not
implemented. A decision on the selection of the municipality as well as the area or scope that
would be covered for the pilot public land inventory was made during implementation as planned.
At that time, the funds budgeted for this component at Appraisal proved to be inadequate,
particularly for the acquisition of aerial photographs (the technology choice on which the design
of this component depended). It was also discovered that aerial photographs needed could not be
acquired due to Israeli restrictions on flights over WBG.

Component 4:               Institutional Development
                           PAD US$l.7 million, 28.3 % of Total Original Project Estimate of
                           US$6.0 million; Actual disbursement US$1,126,318 or 66.2% of the
                           PAD estimate of Component 4.

61.      This component is rated moderately satisfactory, because its implementation required
ownership of its subcomponents by different agencies, financing from different donors, and there
was little clarity on who championed institutional development.

62.      Nevertheless, an institutional analysis of the PLA was completed in November 2005.
This included a comprehensive strategic plan for reorganization, as well as a strategic human
resource development plan for the PLA. An action plan with resource requirements was prepared
to guide future interventions. However, there appears to have been resistance to change in the
PLA, and it is unclear what impact, if any, there has been on the leadership and staff of the PLA.

63.      Despite the withdrawal of USAID's commitment to support an education program for
surveyors in 2006, the project completed within the available resources, an education needs
assessment for strengthening an educational program in land administration and surveying in
WBG. This assessment identified suitable regional and international institutes15 for delivering
graduate and undergraduate programs in surveying, property valuation, land registration and
tenure management, as well as land planning, and records management. The study also identified
strategic partnerships and twinning arrangements, as a result of which a twinning program
between the Technical University of Munich and Birzeit University was initiated resulting in the
development of a Master's degree program in Land Management and Administration, the first of
its kind in the country.

64.      USAID had also committed US$0.9 million for a training program for surveyors,
establishment of an association of surveyors, and hardware and software support for
strengthening the capacity of the PLA. Nevertheless, with the available resources, a new


15       The assessment of programs delivered by international institutions included 9 universities in Australia,
Canada, and the United Kingdom.

                                                       13

licensing program for private surveyors, including a manual for licensing, was developed. As a
result of this licensing program, there are about three times as many licensed surveyors as before
the project, i.e. about 200 licensed surveyors in the West Bank.

65.      A public awareness and community participation campaign, which included radio spots,
fliers, brochures, posters and banners was designed and successfully executed in the pilot sites.

4.3     Efficiency

(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g. unit rate norms, least cost
and comparisons and financial rate of return)

66.      No economic or financial assessment of the project was done at appraisal, making it
difficult to evaluate the incremental benefits at the end of the project. Although the pilot areas
were small, preliminary data from an analysis of the pilots suggests that the new approaches
tested by the project, namely (i) the contracting surveying to the private sector, and (ii) the
appropriate procurement packaging of surveying contracts, have led to efficiency gains in terms
of unit costs of surveying. Anecdotal reports in the supervision aide memoires alluded to the
doubling and often tripling of the price of land after registration.

67.      Additionally, the computerization of land registration has contributed to improvements in
the availability and quality of data on land in the pilot areas.

4.4     Institutional Development Impact:

68.      The institutional development impact of this LIL is rated moderately satisfactory. The
impacts of institutional development for a project of this nature and within the context of land
issues in WBG need to be assessed by way of the impact on the broader group of stakeholders
that are affected by land administration and land management issues in WBG. The impact on this
group, as a result of the project, cannot be denied, and is rated satisfactory from that perspective.
However, the impact on one of the two implementing agencies is less clear, which leads to
downgrading the overall rating moderately satisfactory. There were also a substantial number of
changes in the leadership of the implementation agencies during the project's life. The rationale
for a moderately satisfactory rating for institutional development is discussed below.

69.      The project's outputs and processes have generated knowledge; catalyzed open debate on
land issues for the first time with a broad stakeholder group that could, with some support,
become formalized and institutionalized; and the eventual passage of laws will generate greater
popular demand for their enforcement. In other words, the underpinning for good governance in
the land sector now exists, although it may require additional catalytic support to sustain and
strengthen it.

70.      The PA itself has demonstrated strong commitment for reform of land management and
administration both before and during the project. Scarce PA budgets were allocated to introduce
systematic surveying and adjudication in Bethlehem and Hebron. There was a sustained pace of
progress with the policy making processes throughout the project's life, with the involvement of a
broad range of stakeholders, although the PLA remained less enthusiastic than others to embrace
change and innovation, despite the challenges that lie for the PLA to deliver results with urgency.

71.      Despite this limited enthusiasm on the part of the PLA, the project has distilled both
internal reorganization, as well as capacity building needs for the PLA. Until this project there
had been no analytic work to either inform internal re-organization needed with the consolidation

                                                  14

of functions in the PLA in 2002, nor any assessment of staffing needs for this young institution.
Given the PA's commitment to scaling-up surveying and registration and the political impetus to
expedite the work, the PA now has a clear road map for the transformation of the PLA if it has to
deliver on its expanded mandate, within a pre-determined time frame that should be established a
priori to enable technical preparation of the next phase.

5.     Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1    Factors outside the control of government:

72.      The outcome of the project was not affected. Outcomes were satisfactory despite the
inherent complexities of land sector reform in most countries, and the specific challenges due to
the political and security situation in WBG. This situation deteriorated even further with the
election of Hamas in March 2006, after which the interaction of donor staff and their consultants
with some authorities, became more challenging.

73.      Implementation of the project was affected. The political and security conditions that
arose during implementation, namely the election of Hamas in Gaza, made it impossible to
implement any activity in Gaza. The withdrawal of donor commitment to specific activities
resulted in their reduced scope in keeping with available financial resources. The piloting of a
public land inventory for which aerial photographs were to be acquired, was not implemented due
to Israel's restrictions on flying over the West Bank. However, with respect to the piloting of the
public land inventory, had this benefited from rigorous technical preparation and appraisal, the
challenges for its implementation would have been clear from the start, and a more informed and
realistic decision could have been taken.

74.      The fact that the PLC has not been in session since June 2007, has delayed passage of the
draft laws, and the future of these laws remains uncertain.

5.2    Factors generally subject to government control:

75.      Three factors that were within the control of the PA and affected implementation were:
(i) not taking a policy decision to decide on the fee structure associated with the issuing of titles;
(ii) delays in appointing appropriate staff in implementation units; and (iii) inability to bring
about effective inter-agency coordination so that the PA's institutions took collective
responsibility for the project.

76.      Fee structure associated with the issuing of titles: Misuse of the property rights system by
previous Palestinian occupants has led to mistrust and the promotion of secrecy amongst property
owners regarding property transactions. Despite many improvements made by the PA in its
formal registration system, formal registration services in the West Bank have remained largely
underutilized. This is partly because of the onerous requirements related to land registration that
the PA has established, and partly because of insufficient trust in any government system as
WBG has never enjoyed an independent sovereign government. The project was unable to learn
about the potential impacts of a good incentive system on demand for registration, because the
PA was reluctant to "pilot" a new set of rules for the pilot areas that it may be unable to apply to
the rest of the country due to equity considerations and risk of potential revenue losses.

77.      Appointment of appropriate staff in implementation units: Recruitment of appropriately
qualified technical staff for key positions in project implementing agencies is a factor that is
usually under a government's control. In the case of WBG, the lack of the PA's attention to

                                                  15

staffing issues in the project management units, led to an almost continuous shortfall in staffing of
the project management teams in the implementing agencies, and ultimately contributed to
implementation delays. Both the project management unit teams in MoP and PLA remained
insufficiently staffed for the entire duration of the project. In fact until the last year of
implementation, the PLA offices in Ramallah lacked a Team Leader. A Team leader came on
board only nine months before the project closed. The Team Coordinator in the Gaza office of the
PLA provided back-up support which, in the absence of face-to-face interactions with Bank teams
and the PLA team in Ramallah, proved to be incredibly challenging.

78.      Inability to bring about inter-agency coordination: In the absence of the PA creating
incentives for inter-agency collaborative team-work, so that the two implementation agencies
would have assumed greater collective responsibility for progress on LAP 1 activities,
implementation suffered, and funds remained unutilized at the time the project closed.

5.3     Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

79.      Relationships between the two implementing agencies, the Ministry of Planning and the
Palestinian Land Authority deteriorated significantly towards the latter years of the project. As a
consequence, the implementing agencies did not come together to request an extension of the
project's closing date to enable the utilization of the unspent project funds.

5.4     Costs and financing:
80.      Of the total of US$4.7 million for the LIL, a total of US$3.0 million was made available
by the World Bank, and US$1.476 million by the Government of Finland as co-financing for the
LIL. Of this total US$4.476 million, US$3.58 million or 80 percent of the total grant was spent.
From the IDA portion of the grant, 77.7 percent was disbursed, and from the Government of
Finland's co-financing contribution, 84.6 percent was disbursed. Undisbursed balances of US$
668,415 and US$226,347.85 from the World Bank and the Finland Grant respectively, were
cancelled on April 30, 2009.

81.      The Government of Finland also provided EUR 1.17million (US$1.3 million) in parallel
finance, including EUR 800,000 to complete systematic surveying of the pilot area planned at
Appraisal, which was not administered by the project.

6.      Sustainability

6.1     Rational for Sustainability rating

82.      The project's sustainability is rated likely.

83.      Institutionally: Sustainability of the PLA, as with any land authority in any country, will
depend on how quickly and efficiently, it is able to develop a critical mass of registered properties
in its land registry, which in turn would lead to trust in its systems with more owners coming to
register transactions. On the one hand, this will require the PA to assess tradeoffs it may need to
make to create incentives for people to register their property. On the other hand, this will require
the PLA to embrace innovation, craft partnerships, and optimize inputs so that it is able to expand
the number of properties in its registry as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Systematic
surveying, as opposed to sporadic surveying, is an activity that is usually a one-off activity
supported by donors in developing countries, which offers the opportunity for a land authority to
develop the critical mass of properties in its registry.


                                                   16

84.      The PLA is an institution that is still in its infancy with a limited number of professional
staff. There is substantial support from stakeholders to see the PLA grow into a strong and able
organization, and with the right leadership, resources, and donor support.

85.      Physically: Sustainability of the re-engineered offices and of the computerized land
registration system will depend on the financial resources that are made available to the PLA, and
the capacity of staff to deliver the services needed to build the registry, and keep it updated.
During the ICRR Mission, the Bank was informed that the PLA had received US$6.0million from
the PA for its operations for one year, and that the PLA had recruited IT staff to provide in-house
support for the land registry.

86.      Financially: In 2005, the gross income for the PLA was US$5.4million. Its operating
costs reached US$2.65million, of which 86 percent or US$2.24million was spent on staff salaries.
While the PLA is not operating with deficits, its revenue, i.e. the resources to expand its program,
were low, only US$2.75million.The PLA will be unable to finance a program for systematic
surveying and registration without sustained donor support over the next ten to fifteen years. This
time frame presumes adequate reforms, either through the passage of laws, or through the
promulgation of a Presidential Decree, or through the issuance of new regulations and
instructions within the existing law, to enable the integration of substantial innovation,
realignment of human resources, and the integration of technology to make the program
affordable.

6.2    Transition arrangement to regular operations:

87.      It is uncertain how the PLA will transition from the pilot to a regular operation. A follow-
on operation supported by IDA and the Government of Finland is planned. In the absence of
donor support, if the PLA mainstreams into its work at a bare minimum the small innovations
piloted under this LIL, the ICRR estimates that the cost of completing the task of systematic
surveying and registration of areas A and B in the West Bank financed through budget transfers
from the PA, could be as high as US$280million and take a very long time.

7.     Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank

7.1    Lending

Preparation

88.      The Bank's performance during preparation is rated moderately unsatisfactory and the
rationale for this rating is discussed below.

89.      The project's objective was consistent with the Bank's strategy to maintain a medium
term development agenda. The Bank provided leadership in coordinating donor support for
institutions involved in the land sector.

90.      However, project preparation time between PCN review on June 22, 2004 and Appraisal
between November 20-30, 2004, was far too short - less than six months. An alleged break-in at
the PLA offices and the theft of some land records in the first week of March in 2004, appears to




                                                    17

have led not only to expediency in preparing this project, but also to an expansion in its scope16.
As a consequence of the short preparation period, many decisions that would have affected the
project's design and should have been taken during preparation were postponed to be taken
during implementation. This affected the preferred sequencing of activities to complete the
project within its initial life.

91.       The advice given to the team during project preparation on the PDO and selection of
indicators was confusing and contradictory. The task team was not given clear advice on
indicators that could have tracked learning outcomes or processes, rather than measurable
performance indicators as the team was advised to do..17 During preparation, the team was
advised that there was little justification for the inclusion of a pilot for the management and
transparent use and disposal of state land18 in the absence of knowledge about the size and
importance of state land and the issues associated with its management and use. This advice was
not heeded. Critical technical advice to the team that systematic surveying and registration would
be feasible only if the minimum required human resource capacity would be in place to support it,
was also not heeded - the project proceeded with the inclusion of a pilot for systematic surveying
and registration.

92.       The inconsistency in the PDO between the Decision stage PAD, Appraisal stage PAD,
PDO as stated in the Trust Fund Agreement, and the changed PDO as presented in the ISRRs did
not get attention. But perhaps the most striking weakness in this project's preparation and
implementation was the skill mix of the Bank's task teams19 ­ there was no cadastre specialist or
surveyor on the team throughout preparation.

7.2     Supervision

93.       The Bank's performance during supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The project
was supervised twice a year. The task team's presence in the Country Office, and the location of
the TTL in the region, enabled timely follow-up throughout implementation. Sustained
implementation support was provided to the client's weakly staffed project management units on
procurement and financial management issues, and included guidance on drafting TORs, work
plans, procurement plans etc. The team sustained a dialogue with the client, and constantly kept
the Country Director and the Country Management Unit, and the sector unit informed and sought
guidance, although this was largely on operational and not technical issues.

94.       But there were constant changes in the composition of supervision mission teams, and
supervision missions did not benefit either from continuity in staffing needed for a project of this
nature, or from strong technical expertise in surveying and cadastre, which was a fundamental
area of focus in the project. Consequently, Aide Memoires and ISRRs rarely informed on the
specific content of the studies that were done, and it is unclear whether specific technical


16        An alleged break-in at the PLA offices and the theft of some land records in the first week of March in 2004,
appears to have led not only to expediency in preparing this project, but also to an expansion in its scope from a focus
on land registration issues to supporting the PLA in safeguarding and strengthening management of land records within
an examination of the policy framework with the aim of unifying laws and regulations governing land administration, a
land market study, an assessment of the three primary land regimes/markets, land registration and administration
systems, as well as modalities for strengthening the PLA in terms of strategy formulation (Internal Memo March 17,
2004).

19        A check of the educational professional expertise of members of the donor teams reveals that there was never
a cadastre and surveying specialist.

information was distilled from these various outputs, and if so, whether this was integrated into
the team's dialogue with the client. Given the weak capacity at the client end, and the complexity
of issues involved in such a project, supervision teams should have included stronger technical
skills in surveying and registration.

95.      The Bank lost the opportunity to revisit the PDO and performance indicators at the time
of the mid-term review (June 2006), despite this being an explicit mission objective; instead, a
decision to revisit the PDO and performance indicator was postponed to the next supervision
mission (November 2006), at which time this was neither a mission objective, nor was this done.

7.3    Overall Bank performance

96.      The Bank's overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory for the reasons given
above.

Borrower



7.4    Preparation

97.      The Borrower's performance during preparation is not rated as there is little to assess this
by. The Bank's cycle of project preparation started in February 2004, under a different project of
which land titling was a component20. Apart from a sector policy note for the LAP PAD, there is
no other evidence that would enable an assessment of the Borrower's performance during
preparation over this period.

7.5    Government Implementation Performance

98.      The Borrower's performance during implementation is rated moderately satisfactory.

99.      The PA maintained its commitment during most of the project life, despite the fact that
over the implementation period, the government changed four times. The political will and
commitment to reform the land sector was reconfirmed by all the four administrations. For
example, the 10th government which came to power in March 2006 demonstrated its commitment
by: (i) not dissolving the LPTF; (ii) launching the systematic land registration process after it had
stalled for 40 years; and (iii) requesting the PLC that it delays its consideration of the draft Land
Law which had been before it for some time, in order to benefit from the deliberations and studies
planned under the project.

100.     The LPTF, established formally on September 4, 2004, was chaired by the Minister of
Planning, and comprised of senior officials from the Ministries of Finance (MOF), Justice (MOJ),
Public Works (MOPWH), Local Government (MOLG), the PLA, and representatives from the
private sector, and remained consistently committed to the project, despite changes to its
composition five times over the implementation period. The LPTF was given "brief notes" on
particular key points of land policy, which seemed to have enabled the LPTF to move more
quickly to adopt the various recommendations made by the international advisors regarding the
policy and regulatory framework. The LPTF in turn provided initial feedback on policy directions
prior to submission to the Council of Ministers recommended them to the Cabinet for action.

101.     The PA administration officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on a
continual basis, and cooperated fully with the task team. At the MOF, appropriate levels of
review and approval were usually in place; financial accountability and follow-up was observed,
and expenditures were duly authorized before they were incurred; and documentation was
maintained properly for periodic review.

102.     However, having assumed the responsibility of implementing a project with two of its
agencies, the Borrower was unable to ensure full utilization of the grant made available for the
LAP. Low disbursements were brought to the attention of the Borrower in the Aide Memoire of
the April 1-10, 2008 supervision mission, when the undisbursed balance stood at 36% with the
project due to close in 8 months. Ultimately, of the total US$6.0 million made available to the
Borrower, only US$3.475 or 58 percent of the total grant was spent.

7.6    Implementing Agency


103. There were two implementing agencies with collective responsibility for
implementation. Together their performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

104.     Project Management Teams of both implementing agencies issued regular quarterly and
annual financial reports, which were received by the Bank on a timely manner. Annual Audit
reports were received by the Bank on time and auditors'opinions were always unqualified.
Auditors' Management Letter did not include material weakness in internal control system nor
reported any material misstatement in the Project Financial Statements for both agencies. An
effective internal control system was maintained to ensure that project expenditures were properly
authorized, supporting documents were maintained, accounts were reconciled periodically and
project assets, including cash, were safeguarded.

105.     Procurement of all works, goods and technical services under the project followed the
Procurement Guidelines "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits". The implementing
agencies submitted all required quarterly and annual reports more or less in a timely manner.
These reports were informative. The status of performance indicators were incorporated in all
progress reports and served as valuable input to Bank supervision mission reports.

106.     However, project implementation units were not established in time, and consequently
the implementation of all activities was delayed. Implementing agencies were unable to attract
and retain appropriately qualified and experienced staff in their project implementation units in a
timely way.

107.     The leadership of the MoP, despite three changes over the project's life, remained
committed to the project throughout the project implementation period. The Chairman of the PLA
changed three times over the project's life, although commitment to the project was greatly
diminished during the last year of implementation, when there was a marked deterioration in the
PLA's willingness to implement the project. A Team leader for the PLA project unit was
recruited only in the last year. Most of the PLA's activities under the project were initiated very
late in the project's life. With technical assistance, the completion of some of the activities did
occur, although the delay in their execution limited the potential for impact on the operational
efficiency of the PLA. The PLA was unable to critically assess the impact of regulations that
constrain the PLA's efficiency and performance, and take concrete steps to improve their
operations with the PA's resources.


                                                   20

108.      It is possible that the PLA's lack of commitment to the project was linked to the
perceived lack of legitimacy of the reforms that were being proposed by the new draft laws in the
absence of approval by the parliament - this notwithstanding that the promulgation of laws by
Presidential Decree is provided for in Article 43 of the basic law, and can be amended or rejected
by the PLC. Because legislation by Presidential Decree can be more sensitive in some areas than
others, Presidential Decrees may not be perceived to have a uniform level of legitimacy in all
areas where they are issued. Given the sensitivity of land issues in WBG, the Bank's
perseverance to have these draft laws approved quickly may not have been a good judgment call.

7.7     Overall Borrower Performance

109.      In light of the Borrower's and implementing agencies' performance discussed above, the
overall Borrower's performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

8.      Monitoring and Evaluation

110.      M&E Design. As stated earlier in Section 3.5, the lack of clarity in the project's
objectives led to tenuous links between the objectives, outputs and performance indicators for the
LIL at the design stage. So "outcome" indicators were assigned at design stage not just to the
project, but even to components, for which indicators should have informed only on outputs. In
any case, this confusion created room for inconsistent treatment and interpretation by the project
management teams, Bank task teams, and policy makers.

111.      M&E Implementation: Notwithstanding the shortcoming in the design of the M&E
framework, during implementation there was substantial reporting by both the client teams in
their progress reports. Client performance on reporting improved as implementation advanced,
both due to consistent requests by the Bank supervision team to improve reporting, as well as due
to their commitment to this project. ISRRs consistently reported on the key performance
indicators, even though as implementation advanced, the number of PDOs on which ISRRs
reported changed ­ this is attributable to the lack of clarity at the design stage (see table below).

112.      M&E Utilization: Progress towards achieving the targets established by the performance
indicators was an important agenda item for supervision missions, and influenced for example,
the reallocation of funds to ensure the indicator for the policy formulation was met.

9.      Lessons Learned

113.      Implementation of the PA's Land Administration Program will require a designated
key member of the PA's Executive Branch to whom involved ministries, line agencies and
donors can come to iron out impediments to progress. Given the importance of land in WBG,
there must be sustained support for the land sector at the highest levels of the PA. Despite the
commitment of the PA to the reforms in the land sector, and the commitment of the donors to
support this important priority, substantial project resources were not spent. A key lesson from
this is that without collective responsibility for implementation of WBG's Land Administration
Program amongst key agencies, and incentives to instill and sustain that sense of collective
responsibility, the PA will be unable to create adequate demand for registration, will be unable to
establish a critical mass in a land registry while there is donor support, and loose an important
opportunity.

114.      In a complex environment like the land sector in WBG, flexibility is needed in the
design of the follow-on operation to ensure the application of practical solutions. As a result of
the current project, it is now possible to develop a comprehensive operational strategy for scaling
up systematic surveying and registration along four possible scenarios: (i) a scenario where the
passage of new draft laws is considered a pre-requisite for scaling-up; (ii) a scenario where there
is a presidential decree for specific changes within the existing law; (iii) a third scenario wherein
the PLA promulgates instructions and guidelines to enhance the efficiency of surveying and
registration within the limitations of its mandate; and (iv) a fourth scenario where there is no
change. For each of these scenarios, it is now possible to estimate the time and cost of completing
surveying and registration of Area A and B in the West Bank. However, given the prevailing
political uncertainty in WBG and the continued need for substantial capacity development in the
PLA, it's not clear under which scenario future support to the Program will proceed. Even after a
decision is made, substantial time and technical assistance will be needed to develop new
instructions and guidelines for systematic surveying, and build the capacity of the PLA, during
which period it would be redundant to support field work in accordance with old procedures.
These would be a pre-requisite for the design of a SIL. Under all scenarios however, it is very
clear that remaining engaged is critical to advance the agenda forward, particularly since this is so
important for the Palestinians.

115.      Systematic (mass) surveying is a more efficient and cost-effective use of scarce
resources than sporadic (on-demand) surveying and is an opportunity to establish a critical
mass in the land registry that is essential for sustainability. In WBG, as per existing law, a
systematic adjudication is likely to result in more properties being registered than would be the




                                                         22

case with sporadic registration21. However, systematic surveying in the absence of a revision to
the fee structure for registration, is not going to lead to a critical mass of entries in the land
registry. In order to guarantee a sustainable land registry, not only must systematic surveying be
scaled-up, but it must be done with a revised fee structure for registration, in the absence of
which, expended resources on systematic surveying (high for the public sector) will not lead to
the desired outcome of reduced informality22.

116.       Municipalities can be critical partners for expediting the process of systematic
surveying because they have the incentive to expand the property tax base as well as deeper
knowledge and closer relations with their community. The Ministry of Finance23 collects
property taxes on behalf of the local governments, and then remits 90 percent of the collection to
the local governments, keeping 10 percent of the collection as administrative charges for tax
collection.24 As property taxes are a major source of internally generated revenue for
municipalities, the incentives for them to have all the properties within their jurisdictions brought
into the formal registration system25 are high. Partnering with the municipalities to expedite
reduction in the high level of informality is the most expedient way for the PLA to create the
critical mass in its land registry ­ without which its future sustainability will be unlikely. A
partnership with municipalities would enable concurrent systematic surveying across the country,
and at the same time be the most efficient because of the use of private surveyors by
municipalities. Under such an option, the PLA would have to ensure the integrity of the
information received by the land registry field offices

117.       Land records management can be improved in partnership with the data base that
exists with the municipalities and the Ministry of Finance, to better detect and prevent fake,
double, overlapping and spurious registration records. The next phase of support to the land
sector would do well to include support for data transfer/exchange between municipalities,
Ministry of Finance to be linked to the land registry in the PLA. Land ownership information
should be available in the public domain, and should be capable of providing efficient and
effective access to all users. The PLA should include in its public awareness campaign,
procedures and policies relating to land, including guidelines for processing claims, in an effort to
build trust in their system ­ this will be critical to establishing a critical mass of properties in the
land registry so that future financial sustainability can be better ensured.

118.       Building stronger trusting teams across donors and the Bank is important. To
institutionalize team behavior, Administration Agreements for Trust Funds (in the case of co-
financing of projects) or a Memorandum of Understanding (in the case of parallel financing of
projects) or some other appropriate documents, may include: clear articulation of mutually
acceptable roles and responsibilities amongst donors; guidelines for collaboration amongst them


21         The demand for sporadic registration in WBG is low. In 2004, across all the 8 regional PLA offices, only 188
properties were registered. The trend from the Ramallah offices suggests that significantly fewer properties were
registered in previous years. Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jericho and Nablus were the only offices to register 20 or more
properties in one year.
22         The pilot experience has demonstrated that in the absence of a downward revision of the current fee structure
for registration, future investments in systematic surveying are not going to lead to the expected benefits of an
expanded land registry.
23         The Ministry of Finance maintains the only comprehensive record of land for the country for property
taxation purposes.
24         Land Registration Study, May 2007.
25         With an estimated 28 to 30 percent of the properties registered, the level of informality in the property market
was expected to be about 70 percent. However, the Land Market Study completed in July 2007, estimates that the level
of informality is about 85 percent, i.e. 85 percent of the properties are not part of the PLA's land registry.


                                                             23

and their consultants; modalities for information sharing; commitment to plan joint missions, or
agreements to "delegate" their role for those missions that a donor is unable to participate in; and
so on. Progress reports prepared by the client, as well as procurement and financial management
reports prepared by Bank staff, must be shared equally amongst all donors; by the same token,
any progress reports or evaluations prepared by donor staff or their consultants must be shared
with the Bank. All efforts need to be made to build trusting teams and common shared view of
the project as well as the operating environment within which the project is to be implemented.
There is also a need for donor staff to appreciate that the procurement guidelines that apply to all
Bank-supported projects (obliging Bank task teams to ensure their application), are developed on
the basis on international best practice, and are approved by the shareholders of the World Bank.
Often inadequate appreciation of this fact creates tension between donor and Bank teams, as
donor staff perceives procurement policies as "Bank procurement".

Recommendations for the next project
119.      The next phase of support should focus only on activities that are within the control of
the PLA. Given the importance of rapidly expanding systematic surveying and registration (even
in the absence of the actual issue of tiles) in the context of the land sector in WBG, it is important
to sequence activities in terms of priority and realism. Multiple complex components requiring
substantial legislative changes in order to affect behavior, should be avoided in the low capacity
and politically complex environment of WBG. Additional activities that are essential for
enhancing the capacity of various entities to support the Palestinian Land Administration
Program, but are not within the direct mandate of the PLA, for example, support to educational
institutions, capacity building of the private sector, sustaining forums for debate, consensus
building, knowledge sharing, etc. should be supported concurrently, but not under the same
project in order to keep projects simple.

120.      The PA must be willing and able to commit funds to the PLA for each of the years of
the next project. This letter of intent should be a pre-condition for Appraisal. The PA must also
provide donors with a Letter of Intent to create and maintain a comprehensive list of state land
assets and an immovable property register.

121.      The PLA on the other hand, must commit to use funds allotted by the PA in
accordance with using the same methodology that it would apply to donor funds, for scaling up
systematic surveying and registration. This is essential to avoid one of the pitfalls encountered
under the first project, when the PLA's attention got diverted to activities it supported with
internal funds, to the neglect of the pilot activities funded by donors26. It is also important for the
PLA to imbibe, integrate, and mainstream the innovations that led to efficiency gains in the pilot
projects.

122.      Scaling-up systematic surveying and registration will be feasible only if the minimum
required human resource capacity is in place. To support the PLA in implementing its expanded
mandate, the next project should focus on building the capacity of the PLA, and enhance
surveying capacity in the country (private engineers and surveyors, municipalities). Support for
the next phase must be designed to ensure that there is adequate capacity in both the public and
private sectors before or at the start of the next phase ­ capacity building measures must be



26The ISRR of 09/25/2008 records that the PLA shifted its focus from the LAP's pilot areas for systematic land
registration (about US$2million) to the PA's financed small pilot in Bethlehem (US$60,000). This divide between the
same activity financed from different sources was detrimental to satisfactory completion of the pilots.


                                                         24

implemented and in place, before the start of surveying activities, as the design of this program
will depend on the capacity. The role of the private sector will continue to grow if WBG expands
its program for systematic surveying, as the volume of survey work will increase. Not expected to
decline, is the trend to limit the size of the civil service.

123.     Partnerships with municipalities and willingness on the part of the PLA to embrace
technology should be essential elements of the next phase of support. In accordance with the
design parameters being applied by the PLA, the time and costs to complete systematic surveying
of 3.2 million dunums will be 80 years and cost about US$280 million.

124.     The next project should focus on systematic surveying and registration only after
regulations and instructions are in place, and there is adequate capacity in the PLA to monitor
and evaluate the surveying activities. Getting the regulations and instructions developed before
investments are committed to systematic surveying and land registration will require, as in the
case of many similar projects, cooperation between multiple stakeholders on the legal and
institutional levels. There may be a need to split support in the land sector into two projects to
avoid more than one implementing agency, as highlighted in 119.

125.     A fully staffed qualified project management team must be established in the PLA
before Appraisal. This is essential to ensure that staff is adequately trained in the multiple aspects
of project management, procurement, financial management, and reporting, and that the next
project does not suffer from the kinds of delays and inefficiencies that plagued the LIL, ultimately
leading to underutilization of the funds made available.

126.     The Bank must ensure that that the preparation of the next project benefits from
professional with training and experience in surveying and cadastre, and that project
preparation is sound, including a sound assessment of the client's readiness for implementation.

Annex 1. Key Performance Indicators

127.     The performance indicators below are from the Project Appraisal Document Report No.
30406-GZ dated January 26, 2005. It is recognized that these indicators are considered to be
inadequate to capture the learning outcomes from this LIL. Also as highlighted earlier, there were
inconsistencies between the PDO indicators in the PAD, and the PDO indicators in the ISRRs.
For example, the PAD had four outcome indicators. The first ISSR in 2005 reported on one PDO
indicator, the second ISSR in 2005 reported on 2 PDO indicators, and all the nine subsequent
ISRRs reported on five PDOs.

128.     For the sake of consistency, this ICRR reports on the key performance indicators in the
PAD. These are a smaller subset of the included a Project Monitoring Plan, which was monitored
and reported on. Baseline data on some indicators was to be collected during implementation.
However, several indicators assumed progress far beyond that would have been possible within
the project's life, because some actions, particularly those requiring reorganization and
institutional strengthening and capacity building would require additional resources and
considerable amount of time; other indicators would require follow-on work to develop
procedures, which would then be applied, in order to lead to efficiency gains.

129.     For the purpose of this Annex, this ICRR has attempted to map, as best as possible,
indicators reported on during implementation, to those outlined in the Results Matrix of the PAD.
This reporting is drawn from not just ISRRs, but importantly from progress reports submitted by
the client as well.

Annex 8: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

In keeping with the participatory and consultative processes that have created a platform for
discourse on issues that affect land management and administration in WBG, an ICRR Workshop
was held on Feb. 15, '09. The participants represented a diverse stakeholder group: Ministries of
Finance, Planning, Local Government, Justice, Public Works and Housing, the Palestinian
Investment Fund, the PLA, Academic Institutions, Municipalities, and private sector
representatives from the surveying and legal professions.

Overview of the ICRR Workshop

Land Management and Administration is a priority for the Palestinian Authority and people.
The vision for the PA is to retrieve Palestinian rights to their scarce land resource, the strategic
and political importance of land, and the need for the conservation and proper management of
land. In order to achieve this goal, it is of critical importance to overcome institutional problems
that prevent effective partnerships which are essential for: (i) optimizing inputs, (ii) developing
integrated processes for surveying and registration with many stakeholders, and (iii) facilitating
public-private partnership for the transfer of knowledge.

The rational for Land Policy Reforms. Representatives in the workshop highlighted the catalytic
role of LAP 1 in initiating concurrent advances in policy development, surveying and registration,
dispute resolution, land administration and management and capacity development. They
emphasized the fact that the LIL provided an opportunity for substantial learning, consensus
building, inter and intra PA institutional cooperation, and pioneered several activities never
undertaken before.

How it can be achieved? What will the PLA deliver by 2014? How will we measure what we
deliver? In this workshop session, the participants tried to answer to various challenging
questions. The scale of man power inputs needed for surveying and registration of 200,000
dunums over the next four years was spelled out28. Under the current Land and Water Dispute
Settlement Law29, the PLA would need 90 surveying teams, with 5 PLA employees deployed
with each team. A total of 968 public sector jobs would thus need to be created, which would
include 270 surveyors, in addition to legal and registration professionals. Consequently, to
achieve the above goal, it is important to create an efficient and effective legal and regulatory
system and carry out institutional and capacity building activities to enable the PLA to deliver on
its mandate. In addition, based on the LIL experience, development of both the judicial sector
specifically that related to land settlement and adjudication of claims and private surveying sector
was considered as critical to carry out large scale settlement process through to its satisfactory
results.

Suggested next steps by participants
(i)        Review the current law for surveying and registration to increase efficiency and
performance; but more importantly, to review at a minimum, the regulations procedures that can
be changed within the existing laws, so that surveyors and engineers, both from the private sector
and in municipalities, could effectively partner with the PLA in undertaking concurrent surveying



28         The PLA is planning to complete surveying and registration of 200,000 dounums over the next four years,
i.e. to be completed by 2013, as articulated in the Action Plan submitted to IDA on May 10, 2009.

                                                           43

work in many parts of the country at the same expediting implementation and enhancing
efficiency.
(ii)     Introduce transparency in the methodology for surveying and registration, and undertake
effective communication campaigns on these procedures to build trust in the land reform process,
but also, importantly, to enable and sustain a healthy discourse in civil society on land related
issues.
(iii)    Include for surveying and registration, areas that are classified as Area C, as fraudulent
transfer of lands in these areas is significant;
(iv)     Proactively publicize documents with written procedures and criteria for settlement and
registration, so that the public is well informed.


Recommendations for participation, consultation, and communication
(v)      The participatory and consultative processes initiated by LAP 1 have sowed the seeds for
networking across agencies, and must be sustained going forward, as the LIL had made clear that
sharing knowledge, ideas, and resources leads to innovation. With a first time debate on the
PRDP's emphasis on reform, a key lesson from the processes supported by the LIL is that
consultative processes on the reform program need to be both deepened and broadened to include
more PA, public, educational, and private agencies.

Recommendations for Performance of the project / agencies
(vi)     The project was not perceived as being a failure by any of the stakeholders. As a LIL,
delays in the completion of expected outputs only enhance the learning for the future, and the
project cannot be categorized as a failure due to the delays. The project has generated critical and
immensely useful studies that are a valuable resource today for the management of WBG's scarce
land resources; studies that enable for the first time, a better understanding of understand land
markets, land management, and property taxation etc. in WBG.
(vii)    The project was also perceived to have been instrumental in generating (i) a real demand
for measurable progress indicators from PLA executed activities; (ii) creating a popular demand
for greater efficiency of the agency's operations; and (iii) enabling "voice" of an appeal to the
PLA to identify the prioritized areas for land settlement as well as the criteria for establishing
priorities (the PLA reported that the priority areas are decided at the Cabinet level).

Recommendations for innovations to enhance efficiency of surveying and registration within
the existing Land Law
(viii) An important suggestion that had the backing of practically all stakeholders was to create
a partnership for scaling up surveying activities which would result in concurrent surveying in
many locations at no extra cost to the PLA, while at the same time enabling the PLA to exercise
quality control. Under the current Law the PLA has the power to make this procedural change,
which, if done, would enable the PLA to "partner" with municipality surveyors, thereby creating
a larger pool of "PLA surveyors" without loosing control over the quality of their work. This
would also have the advantage of raising awareness of surveying and registration efforts in many
municipalities, as many "teams" would start work concurrently (either in their own or in near by
municipalities that may lack surveyors).
(ix)     Another suggestion was for the PLA to use its authority within the existing Law, to adopt
a procedure which would enable the use of private sector surveying capacity, which resides not
only amongst surveyors, but engineers as well. As highlighted by some participants, this would
be an option more expensive than partnering with the municipalities.
(x)      Another innovative suggestion was to use aerial photography and other
appropriate technologies.
