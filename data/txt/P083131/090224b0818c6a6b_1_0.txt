                         remarkable achievements including, among others: tariff design that ensures sector financial sustainability, KPLC restructuring, Kenya Energy Generating Company’s (KenGen) Initial

                         Public Offer, establishment of the Geothermal Development Company (GDC), promulgation of regulatory instruments, feasibility studies for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and
                         Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure, and wind power development. These institutional and policy achievements have been accompanied by investments in new power
                         generation and in electricity distribution that have improved the quality of electricity service to customers. The cumulative number of households connected to electricity reached
                         526,000 by June 2012 against a target of 420,000. The third geothermal generating unit of 35 megawatts (MW) at Olkaria II was completed in time in May 2010. It generated 280

                         Some progress has been made on the pending issues from the previous mission: (i) Gazetting of secondary legislation is nearing completion. Of the twelve regulations (secondary
                         legislation) that remain to be gazetted, (ten for petroleum and two for electricity regulations), all of the regulations on petroleum sector were approved by the Energy Regulatory
                         Commission (ERC) Technical Committee and were submitted through the Ministry of Energy (MoE) to the Attorney General's office for approval; the two regulations in the electricity
                         sector were approved by the Technical Committee and will be published by ERC for public consultation. Gazetting the regulations is expected by March 2013. (ii) Project restructuring
                         was done on May 2, 2012 to reallocate credit proceeds among the categories of eligible expenditures and to harmonize the project's financial covenants with those of Kenya
                         Electricity Expansion Project (KEEP).

                         However, overall disbursement rate for the two credits (CR.3958 and Cr.4572) combined still remains low at 69 percent as of November 19, 2012 with only less than a year remaining
                         before the project Closing Date of September 30, 2013. The distribution component represents the largest undisbursed categories. Moreover, after taking into consideration the actual
                         disbursement and disbursement forecast for each contract, approximately US$14 million cost saving for the distribution component is expected, the large ones of which are in
                         Category 1-B (Works, Supply, and Installation for the distribution component, approximately US$10 million), and Category 2-B (Goods for the distribution component, approximately
                         US$4 million). The mission noted in principle that the savings would be utilized for the following scale up procurements and activities, which will support enhancement of the Project
                         Development Objectives (PDOs) and will be completed before the Closing Date of September 30, 2013: (a) scale up of the Mombasa underground cable; (b) procurement of spare
                         parts under existing contracts, especially Contract VI Lots 1 and 2; (c) procurement of distribution equipment, such as distribution transformers, conductors and cables, overhead line
                         hardware and wooden poles; and (d) procurement of switchgear. This will necessitate restructuring (Level 2) for reallocation of funds across expenditure categories. To expedite the
                         process, the mission agreed that KPLC should submit Bidding Documents for these goods for IDA's no objection, which was given in December 2012, in order that they can be
                         delivered by July 2013.
