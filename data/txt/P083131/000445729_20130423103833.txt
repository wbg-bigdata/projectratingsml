A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper (RP) seeks the approval of Country Director (CD) for
Kenya to carry out a Level Two restructuring of the Energy Sector Recovery Project
(ESRP, “the Project?) in accordance with OP/BP 13.25. The proposed restructuring seeks
to reallocate credit proceeds among the categories of eligible expenditures as stipulated in
the Financing Agreement of the Project concluded between the International
Development Association (IDA) and the Republic of Kenya on May 8, 2009 as amended
by Letter of Amendment from IDA to the Republic of Kenya dated May 3, 2012.


B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      Overall implementation progress of the Project towards meeting its project
development objectives is satisfactory. The studies and investments under the Project
have contributed to some remarkable achievements including, among others: tariff design
that ensures sector financial sustainability, KPLC restructuring, KenGen IPO,
establishment of Geothermal Development Company (GDC), promulgation of regulatory
instruments, feasibility studies for LPG and LNG infrastructure, and wind power
development. These institutional and policy achievements have been accompanied by
investments in new power generation and in electricity distribution that have improved
the quality of electricity service to customers. The cumulative number of households
connected to electricity reached 526,000 by June 2012 against a target of 420,000. The
third geothermal generating unit of 35 megawatts (MW) at Olkaria II was completed in
time in May 2010, which generated 280 GWh in FY2012 against a target of 276 GWh.

3.     However, overall disbursement rate for the two credits (CR.3958 and Cr.4572)
combined still remains low at 69 percent as of March 2013 with only six months
remaining before the project Closing Date of September 30, 2013. The distribution
component represents the largest undisbursed categories with close to US$ 49 million
remaining to be disbursed. The Bank team emphasized that to justify a new project to support
modernization of the national grid and improve the reliability, it is crucial that the project be
completed in time with full attainment of the project objectives and utilization of resources
provided.

4.      After taking into consideration the expected disbursement, there will be
expected savings of US$10.7 million. The expected savings comprise of US$6 million under
Category 1-B (Works, Supply, and Installation for the Distribution Component), US$3.8
million under Category 2-B (Goods for the Distribution Component), US$0.2 million under
Category 3-A (Management Services Contract), and US$0.7 million under Category 4-E
(Training for KPLC). These savings were generated mainly due to competitive tendering that


                                                3
resulted in contracts costing less than the estimated values as well as foreign exchange rate
fluctuations.

5.       In the meantime, the national grid system has recently become less reliable.
Although the target for reduction in KPLC system losses was met through FY2010 with
losses declining from 18.8 percent in FY2004 to 16.0 percent in FY2010, the losses increased
to 16.2 percent in FY2011 against a target of 15.7 percent and further to 17.3 percent against
a target of 15.2 percent. According to KPLC’s analysis, the increase in losses in FY2012 was
largely due to (a) an increase in losses on the transmission system as a result of larger than
anticipated increase in power transfers from the Coast to Nairobi following the
commissioning of the 115MW Kipevu III MSD Plant in March 2011; (b) accelerated
connection of new customers that resulted in increased losses at the low voltage level; and (c)
extension of long, medium and low voltage lines for rural electrification.

6.       The implementation support mission of the Project in November 2012
discussed these issues and identified possible measures that can be undertaken as
part of the Project. Already, there is the Power Systems Study that is supported under the
Project as well as IFC’s advisory services to prepare an investment program for KPLC’s loss
reduction activities. To complement these on-going initiatives, the proposed measures under
the Project include reinforcing the distribution network through purchase of distribution
equipment, which will be important for expediting disbursement, utilizing uncommitted
funds, as well as to enhancing the system reliability. The Bank team agreed during the
implementation support mission that the savings would be utilized for the following
activities, which will be completed before the project’s Closing Date of September 30, 2013:
(a) scale up of the Mombasa underground cable; (b) procurement of spare parts under
existing contracts, especially Contract VI Lots 1 and 2; (c) procurement of distribution
equipment, such as distribution transformers, conductors and cables, overhead line hardware
and wooden poles; and (d) procurement of switchgear.

7.      To accommodate the additional activities, it is necessary to reallocate funds
across expenditure categories. This will necessitate restructuring (Level 2) for
reallocation of funds across expenditure categories, including amendment of the ESRP
Financing Agreement. For this reason, the Borrower has requested the Bank to restructure
the Project.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

8.      To effectively utilize the cost savings generated and to improve reliability of
the national grid, KPLC plans to implement activities that are high-priority and
fully consistent with the original PDOs of the Project. One of the PDOs is to increase
access to electricity in urban and peri-urban areas while improving the efficiency, reliability,
and quality of service to consumers. The additional activities envisaged and discussed
during the implementation support mission in November 2012 will contribute to
enhanced reliability of the electricity distribution network.

9.     To utilize the cost savings expeditiously before the Closing Date of September
30, 2013, it is proposed that the savings should be reallocated to Category 1-B
(Goods for the Distribution Component) to allow KPLC to purchase the equipment

                                                4
necessary to strengthen the distribution system. Of the expected cost savings totaling
US$10.7 million, which are generated in Categories 1-B (Works, Supply, and Installation
for the Distribution Component, US$6 million), 2-B (Goods for the Distribution Component,
US$3.8 million), 3-A (Management Services Contract, US$0.2 million), and 4-E (Training
for KPLC, US$0.7 million), US$6.9 million will be reallocated from Categories 1-B, 3-A and
4-E to Category 2-B.

10.     The proposed activities have been fully appraised by the Bank staff and are
technically and economically justified. The Bank team reviewed the proposals by
KPLC during after the implementation support mission in November 2012 and found
them consistent with the PDOs. The additional investment in distribution equipment, such
as poles conductors, distribution transformers, and switchgears would reinforce the on-going
Power Systems Study that is supported under the Project to strengthen network weaknesses
and to complement IFC’s advisory service to prepare an investment program for KPLC’s loss
reduction activities. They are therefore important for enhancing and sustaining key
achievements of the Project.

11.    Financing these activities does not violate the country financing parameters
on cost sharing. The country financing parameters for Kenya, effective since December
21, 2007, allow Bank financing of up to 100 percent of the costs of individual projects,
recurrent costs, local costs, and taxes and duties. The proposed activities are consistent
with on-going activities, and they are fully in compliance with these financing
parameters.

12.     It is therefore proposed that the credit proceeds are reallocated as
summarized in Table 1 below to accommodate the additional activities, which are
high priority for the country and are necessary to enhance the achievement and
sustainability of the PDOs. In conjunction with the proposed reallocation to
accommodate additional activities, further adjustments will be made to take into account
overdraws in categories 3-D, 3-F and 4-E in the original credit (3958-KE). The combined
proceeds of the Kenya Energy Sector Recovery Project (3958-KE) and the Additional
Financing (4572-KE) (P083131) would be reallocated as follows:
