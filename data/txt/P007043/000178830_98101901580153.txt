APPRAISAL OF COMISION DE VALORES - CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL AND
ECUATORIANA DE DESARROLLO S.A. (COMPANIA FINANCIERA)
SUMMARY
i.        The Ecuadorian Government has asked the Bank for a loan to help
finance industrial investment. The proceeds of the loan would be used
by Comision de Valores - Corporacion Financiera Nacional (CFN), a govern-
ment-owned development bank, and by Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo, S.A. (Com-
pania Financiera), called COFIEC, a privately-owned development finance
company, to finance the investment needs of their clients.
ii.       Growth in the Ecuadorian economy has been sizeable only since
1950. During the 1960's, growth in GDP averaged 4.8% per year in real
terms. Although agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy (one-
third of GDP and two-thirds of employment), the share of manufacturing
has risen from 15.4% in 1960-62 to 16.9% in 1967-69.
iii.      As a result of a deteriorating fiscal situation, Ecuador expe-
rienced a balance of payments crisis in mid-1970. In August, 1970 the
sucre was devalued by 28% and the Government adopted a comprehensive
monetary and fiscal program designed to restore financial equilibrium,
while permitting some expansion of credit to the private sector to main-
tain economic growth.
iv.       About four-fifths of the credit granted domestically for indus-
trial investments is supplied by commercial banks in the form of renewable
short-term loans; less than one-fifth is covered by term financing. CFN
and, to a lesser extent, COFIEC are virtually the sole providers of term
financing for industry in Ecuador.
v.        CFN was established in 1948 as a Fund within the Central Bank
to create and stimulate an open market for government bonds. In 1953, it
was authorized to trade in mortgage bonds issued by commercial banks for
agricultural and industrial financing purposes. And in 1964, it was
transformed into a development bank, authorized to provide term financing
directly to industry.
vi.       Reflecting its background, CFN's operations include trading in
government and private securities, loans to the Government and industrial
financing. Thus far, CFN has concentrated in building up its loan port-
folio. Its investment in the more risky industrial promotions and equities,
though increasing, has been small. CFN's development as an industrial fi-
nance company has been impressive; from 1964 to June 1970, while the pro-
portion of holdings of public sector bonds and loans to the Government
decreased from 98% to 37% of the total portfolio, financing of private
industrial enterprises (loans, equity investments and holdings of mortgage
bonds and cedulas) rose from 2% to 63%. This trend is expected to continue.



- ii -
vii.      CFN's capital structure is strong.  Its main financial resource
is its net worth which accounts for two-thirds of the total; paid-in capital
is S/ 482 million and total liabilities, SI 839 million. Its entire, tax-
free, net earnings are to be retained until surplus equals the authorized
capital of S/ 500 million. Besides its rapidly increasing net worth, re-
sources include a discount facility with the Central Bank, loans from the
Agency for International Development (AID), the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), and credit lines from
European financial institutions. Moreover, CFN is the financial inter-
mediary for the Bank loan for fisheries development (555-EC).
viii.     CFN is a well-managed and well-organized development bank.  Though
wholly-owned by the Government, most of its Directors have been members of
the business community. Despite changing Governments, there has been con-
tinuity in management; its present Chief Executive has headed the Company
(or its forerunner) for twelve consecutive years. CFN has built up a com-
petent technical department, and the importance it places on project eval-
uation gives reasonable grounds to believe that its investment decisions
are based on sound technical and financial criteria.
ix.       CFN's portfolio appears sound.  Arrears are low, companies in
difficulties are few and security is ample. Despite low leverage, CFN has
attained a fair level of financial return: 6.5% on average net worth.
x.        Although CFN's near-term liquidity is ample, its security opera-
tions, which include its guarantee of repurchase at par upon presentation,
could potentially infringe upon its liquidity. In addition, CFN has been
carrying the exchange risk on its borrowings from abroad. Arrangements
to safeguard CFN from these contingent risks were agreed to during nego-
tiations.
xi.       COFIEC is well known to the Bank Group.  Early in 1969, IFC's
Board of Directors approved an investment of S/ 5.5 million in its share
capital (IFC/R69-7 of February 13, 1969), which was made in April of that
year. Thus, IFC became COFIEC's second largest shareholder, with a 9.0%
share. IFC is represented in COFIEC's Board of Directors. COFIEC has
also participated as financial intermediary on a Bank loan and an IDA
credit for livestock development purposes, and will participate in a sec-
ond IDA livestock credit approved by IDA's Executive Directors on November
24, 1970.
xii.      COFIEC's Board of Directors is composed of prominent and influen-
tial businessmen and its management is competent. Despite some weaknesses
in appraisal and follow-up procedures, the risk of poor investment deci-
sions is low in view of the Board's and management's close knowledge of the
main clients. COFIEC needs to improve its competence to appraise and
follow-up long-term investments.
xiii.     COFIEC's financial resources include a loan from AID and lines
of credit from the US Export-Import Bank and foreign commercial banks.
With the AID loan fully committed, COFIEC depends mainly on a second Export-
Import Bank loan for its term loans to industry.



- iii -
xiv.       In less than four and a half years of operations, COFIEC has
built up a fair portfolio of loans and equity investments. And, in spite
of high administrative costs, COFIEC has achieved a reasonable level of
profitability, which it expects to maintain in the future. Reserves,
however, are still low and need further build-up.
xv.        CFN's and COFIEC's operations have been complementary rather
than competitive. Thus far, aside from its security operations, CFN has
concentrated in term lending, principally for fixed assets. And COFIEC,
reflecting the relatively short-term nature of its resource mix, has
engaged in shorter term financing, largely for working capital purposes.
The proposed Bank loan would provide for a certain degree of competition,
but this would not be harmful to either the companies, or to the economy.
xvi.       Prospects for increasing the volume of operations are good.
Underlying this expectation are the relatively short supply of term finan-
cing in Ecuador and the Companies' record of increasing commitments. More-
over, Ecuador could usefully diversify its economy and opportunities exist
for industrial investment, mainly in the processing of raw materials, tex-
tiles, livestock, fisheries and tourism. The trend towards sub-regional
economic integration (Andean Group) should provide grounds for further ex-
pansion and diversification.
xvii.      CFN's and COFIEC's financial position and prospects were again
reviewed after the devaluation of the sucre, which took place on August 16,
1970. The devaluation did not affect the creditworthiness of either com-
pany.
xviii.    CFN and COFIEC are suitable and creditworthy borrowers.  A Bank
loan of US$8 million would help cover CFN's and COFIEC's foreign exchange
requirements to finance the cost of imported goods and services of indus-
trial projects for about two years beginning in 1971. The loan would be
made to the Government of Ecuador and the Central Bank would act as finan-
cial agent. The proceeds of the loan would be made available in sucres
to CFN and COFIEC on terms allowing a minimum spread of 3% p.a. The loan
would be pre-allocated in amounts of US$4 million to each company. The
Bank's prior approval would be required for all projects calling for
US$100,000 or more of the loan; and the aggregate "free limit" would be
US$1.3 million for each company. Other terms of the loan would be similar
to those normally applied to Bank lending for development finance companies,
including provision for full commitment charge and a flexible amortization
schedule.






APPRAISAL OF COMISION DE VALORES - CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL AND
ECUATORIANA DE DESARROLLO S.A. (CONPANIA FINANCIERA)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ecuador has asked the Bank for a loan to help
finance productive private enterprise. The proceeds of the loan would be
made availabe to two development finance companies: the government-owned
Comision de Valores - Corporacion Financiera Nacional (CFN) and the pri-
vately-owned Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo, S.A. (Compania Financiera), called
COFIEC. This report recommends that the Bank should extend a loan of
US$8 million to the Republic of Ecuador, to be shared in equal amounts
by CFN and COFIEC. The Central Bank of Ecuador would act as financial
agent on behalf of the Government.
1.02      Both CFN and COFIEC are known to the Bank Group:  CFN is the
only financial intermediary under the Bank loan to the Republic of Ecuador
(555-EC) for the development of fisheries. COFIEC is one of the partici-
pants in a Bank loan (501-EC) and an IDA credit (173-EC) to the Republic of
Ecuador for livestock development; IFC has been its second largest shareholder
since March 1969 and is represented in its Board of Directors.
II. THE SETTING
The Economic Environment
2.01      A full analysis of the economic situation appears in  'Current
Economic Position and Prospects of Ecuador" (WH-201a), dated August 21,
1970.
2.02      With an average rate of population growth of 3.4% p.a. and a per
capita GDP of about US$250, Ecuador remains one of the poorer countries of
Latin America. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy; it employs
over two thirds of the labor force and contributes about one third of the
national product. Three agricultural commodities - bananas, cocoa and
coffee - account for about four fifths of exports.
2.03      Growth in GDP has been sizeable only since 1950, and during the
1960s has averaged about 4.9% per year in real terms. While agricultural
output expanded in the 1960s by 2.5% per year in real terms, growth in the
smaller, but dynamic manufacturing sector was more rapid: 6.5% per year,
although it fell off to 4.4% in 1968 and 3.2% in 1969. The share of manu-
facturing in GDP (at factor cost) rose from 15.4% in 1960-62 to 16.92 in
1967-69. Traditional mass consumer industries - food, beverages, tobacco,
textiles and clothing - decreased their share in industrial output from
71% in 1957 to 55% by 1966. Detailed information on a comparable basis for
later years is not available. There is reason to believe that this trend
is continuing; it indicates that, as in other developing countries, industrial
growth in Ecuador has gradually moved towards relatively more complex types
of manufacturing. -



2.04      Economic growth in Ecuador has taken place within an environment
of relative monetary stability and despite political instability. Including
the most recent devaluation (August 16, 1970), the sucre has depreciated
at a rate equivalent to 3.7% annually in the 1960s, and to 2.4% over the last
24 years. The country has had five different government administrations
in the last decade.
2.05      The economic report on Ecuador (prepared before the devaluation)
pointed to the deteriorating financial and balance of payments situation
and prospects, which threatened the country's monetary stability. The
basic reason for the difficulties has been the deterioration of the fis-
cal situation which began in 1968, continued in 1969, and brought Ecuador
to a balance of payments crisis in mid-1970. It then became evident that
a comprehensive monetary and fiscal program was needed to regain finan-
cial equilibrium. In August of 1970 such a program was adopted. It con-
sisted of the following measures:
(a) devaluation from S/18 to S/25 per US dollar and an
exchange system reform, including replacement of the
dual rate system with a single official rate at the
new parity of S/25 per US dollar;
(b) reduction or elimination of import sur-charges and
gradual elimination of advance import deposit require-
ments;
(c) establishment of new ad-valorem taxes on traditional
exports, ranging from 5% to 15%; and
(d) introduction of export subsidies ranging from 2% to 7%
on minor agricultural and industrial exports.
2.06      On the basis of this program, the IMF approved a one-year stand-
by credit of US$22 million on September 11, 1970. Under the stand-by pro-
gram, government recourse to banking system credit will be restricted in
order to stimulate a recuperation of foreign exchange reserves while permit-
ting an expansion of credit to the private sector, consistent with the needs
of a growing economy.
Industrial Policy
2.07      Ecuador nas built up and maintains a tradition of private enter-
prise. In general, government industrial policies have been directed to-
wards economic diversification and the promotion of export-oriented activi-
ties. The growth and diversification of industry have been encouraged by
relative economic stability and by comparative freedom from excessive govern-
ment regulation of private business. Industry has also benefited from favor-
able industrial promotion legislation (although recent fiscal difficulties
nave led the Government to restrict these benefits somewhat). These factors
were reflected during the 1960s in a substantial increase in industrial in-
vestment, both domestic and foreign.



- 3 -
2.08      Ecuadorian industry which has to contend with the problem of a
small domestic market appears to enjoy a fairly high level of protection.
Average tariff protection varies from about 45% to 75%, depending on
whether the goods are considered essential or non-essential. However, the
Government is aware of the possibility of uneconomic investments which
this policy might create and accordingly, under its stimulation, the Develop-
ment Center (CENDES), an autonomous agency, has recently initiated a study
of the protection applied to industry in Ecuador. The aim of the study is
to develop a model for calculating the effect of various types of govern-
mental measures on the rate of effective protection, which is expected will
constitute the basis for a reconsideration of the system. Nevertheless,
as import substitution is likely to continue, there remains a danger that
uneconomic projects may be carried out. Consequently, in their review of
investment projects, CFN and COFIEC should take into account their economic
merit.
Industrial Financing
2.09      Up to the establishment in 1969 of stock exchanges in Quito and
Guayaquil, there had been no organized securities market. Heretofore,
trading had been confined to a limited number of securities (mainly govern-
ment and mortgage bonds and shares of a few, well-established enterprises);
and, although a large portion of the securities traded has been guaranteed
with respect to principal and interest by the issuing commercial banks and
in price by CFN (para. 3.24), the volume of trading had been relatively
small. Based on this experience, and since price guarantees have been dis-
continued by CFN for all private securities, the volume of trading in the
newly-established stock market is likely to continue limited. Therefore,
the domestic securities market is not expected to be an important source
of funds for industry for a number of years.
2.10      Ecuadorian banking statistics classify loans granted as commer-
cial, industrial, agricultural and other; figures for credits outstanding
are not available. From 1962 to 1969 (see graph on following page), total
credit to the private sector increased at the rate of 14% annually. Credit
to the industrial sector, with an annual rate of increase of 19%, grew
slightly faster than agricultural credit which increased at a rate of 18%
annually. Within the industrial sector, credits granted by CFN and COFIEC
in 1968 represented 21% of the total. CFN's and COFIEC's share of indus-
trial credit in 1969 declined to 15%, reflecting temporary scarcity of re-
sources in both institutions.
2.11      The bulk of industrial credit is in the form of short-term loans
which may be renewed. Since S/ 63 million of total credits extended by CFN
and COFIEC in 1969 (SI 106 million in 1968) was made on terms of 12 months or
less, and considering that virtually all the credits granted by the commercial
banks were also short-term, the proportion of medium- and long-term credits
to total credits to industry was only 12% (16% in 1968). This low proportion
indicates that there is considerable room for term financing of industry in
Ecuador.

2.12      Maximum nominal interest rates are fixed by the Monetary Board.
From 1948 through 1969, interest on industrial credit was limited to 10%.
At the time of the appraisal in 1969 and during negotiations, the Bank
pointed out that this rate was low compared with interest rates prevailing
in world capital markets; that the low rate was a deterrent to lending to
Ecuador since it did not permit a margin sufficient to allow financial
intermediaries to cover relending costs and also make provisions for the ex-
change risk; and that such low rate could lead to an uneconomic allocation
of resources in Ecuador. In January 1970, the interest rate limit was in-
creased to 12%. This nominal rate applies to both, short- and long-term
lending. This rate still appears somewhat low for long-term loans. How-
ever, adjustment in the level of interest rates is usually a gradual pro-
cess and it could not be expected that an increase greater than 2% would
be made at one time. The actual cost to industry of financing through short-
term loans is considerably higher than the nominal rate since applicable
fees and taxes have to be paid each time a loan is renewed; taking into con-
sideration commissions of 1-2%, tax levies of 1.7% per transaction, and dis-
count of the tax levies plus interest for the entire term of the loan, the
resulting effective cost of renewable short-term borrowing is in the region
of 18-19%.
Prospects for Industry
2.13      Over the short-term (1970-71), manufacturing output will probably
increase at the rate of growth of 1968-69, or at about 4% per year. How-
ever, prospects for industrial production, both for the home and export
markets, have been improved by the devaluation, and the level of growth
foreseen still allows for substantial industrial investment. Availability
of domestic banking system credit to finance this investment will depend
on the degree to which the Central Government's deficit is kept under con-
trol, and its recourse to banking system credit is avoided. Ecuadorian
monetary authorities plan to limit private sector credit expansion to 12%
for the 12-month period ending September 1971. However, the elimination
of advance import deposit requirements will provide substantial added liquid-
ity to the private sector.
2.14      Longer term, although several obstacles to industrialization must
yet be overcome - such as those imposed by the small size of the domestic
market, the limited capital market and the relative scarcity of trained labor
and managerial skills - there is sufficient room for expansion of industry
as indicated by an increasing demand for term financing by existing and new
Ecuadorian enterprises. Moreover, the level of growth achieved thus far and
the trend towards sub-regional economic integration (Andean Group), should
provide grounds for further economic expansion and diversification.

III. COMlISION DE VALORES - CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL
3.01      CFN originated in 1948 with the establishment of the Fondo de
Regulacion de Valores as part of the Central Bank to create an open
market for, and trade in, government bonds. In 1953, this body was made
an autonomous agency, the Comision N4acional de Valores, and its functions
were broadened to include market operations in mortgage bonds issued by
commercial banks to finance industrial operations. In August 1964, CFN
emerged in its present form as a result of a further transformation, which
enabled it to provide term financing directly to industry.
3.02      Although CFN's evolution was largely inspired by its own
management, for the last step, its reorganization as a development fin-
ance company in 1964, the Company received the assistance of AID which
provided advice and made available long-term funds for term lending to
industry, and of the Nacional Financiera S.A. of Mexico which provided
technical and organizational guidance.
Ownership and Legal Status
3.03      CFN is wholly-owned by the Government of Ecuador.  Its opera-
tions are governed by its organic law, Decree Law No. 1726 of August 11,
1964, and subsequent amendments. Like other financial institutions opera-
ting in Ecuador, CFN is subject to the country's Banking Law and its
activities are supervised by the Superintendency of Banks. CFN is exempt
from all types of taxes.
Purpose and Powers
3.04      In accordance with its organic law, CFN may:  borrow in domestic
and foreign markets, the latter with the guarantee of the Government; buy
and sell government securities; grant medium- and long-term loans for
fixed assets without limitation to type of industry; grant short-term loans
for working capital, provided CFN is a shareholder in the recipient com-
pany; invest in the share capital of "qualified" enterprises, i.e., those
expressly classified by CFN's Board of Directors to be of basic importance
to the national economy 1/; invest in mortgage and agricultural bonds;
underwrite issues of "qualified" private enterprises; issue bonds; guarantee
industrial issues; and borrow from the Central Bank against the pledge of
securities.
1/   New and existing enterprises, whether private, public or mixed, are
eligible to be "qualified", provided: (a) their fundamental purpose
is the exploitation of natural resources of basic importance to the
national economy; (b) they create, or save, foreign exchange; (c) the
Planning Board has given a favorable opinion regarding their priority
and benefit to the country's economic development; (d) there is a prior,
positive evaluation of CFN's Technical Department regarding the techni-
cal, economic and financial feasibility of the project; and (e) they
receive favorable votes from at least five of CFN's six Directors.



-7-
Board, Management and Staff
3.05      CFN operates under a six-member Board of Directors (Annex 1).
The Board determines the Company's policies and approves all transactions
involving amounts over S/ 1 million.  CFN's organic law provides that
Board members be appointed or elected as follows: one member by the
President of Ecuador; one member jointly by the Minister of Finance and
the Minister of Industry and Commerce; one member each by the Chamber
of Industries of the "Sierra" and of the "Costa" regions; one member by
the Chamber of Agriculture; and, ex-officio, the General Manager of the
Central Bank or his appointee. At present, the two government appointees
are members of the private business community and the Chairman of the
Board, who is elected by the Board from among its members, is the member cho-
sen jointly by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Industry and Com-
merce. The Board appoints the General Manager. It meets once a month.
3.06      An Executive Committee of the Board is composed of the Chairman
of the Board, another Board member and the General Manager. It approves
transactions ranging in value from S/ 200,000 to S/ 1 million. Invest-
ments of S/ 200,000 or less are approved by the General Manager.
3.07      The Company's General Mianager, llr. Luis Ayora, a distinguished
lawyer, has headed the institution since 1957 and was previously General
Manager of Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF). He provides competent
leadership. Mr. Ayora has the assistance of a Deputy General Manager,
HIr. Eduardo Andrade, an economist who is directly in charge of promotions
and special studies. The General M4anager is also assisted by a Financial
Adviser, itr. Raul Padron, who was retained by CFN after his serving as
administrator of a loan to CFN from AID. Two staff departments, Legal
and Public Relations, also report directly to the General Manager.
3.08      CFN is also well organized.  Responsibility and authority are
clearly defined. Functionally, CFN is divided into three departments
which handle the technical, financial and administrative aspects of the
Company's operations (Annex 2).
3.09      CFN has built up a professional staff of good technical quality,
which numbers 37 and includes financial and market analysts, engineers,
lawyers and accountants. Most of the senior staff has had previous
experience and some came from CENDES, where they had acquired skills in
project evaluation. New staff is recruited as the volume of operations
calls for it and special emphasis is given to training, both on the job
and abroad.
Appraisal and Follow-up
3.10      Project appraisals are carried out by Project Evaluation Depart-
ment which has a professional staff of two economists, one engineer and 17
analysts. For special market studies, usually those associated with large
projects, CFN frequently utilizes the services of outside consultants.



-8-
3.11      Appraisal reports are generally satisfactory.  They usually
cover the basic and critical aspects necessary to assess the economic,
financial and technical viability of projects. They include specific
requirements which the borrower must fulfill before disbursements are
made. A weakness observed in the appraisals is a tendency to under-
estimate fixed and working capital costs which has resulted in frequent
cost overruns. The main reason for this is that the engineers generally
lack sufficient experience, and consequently do not make realistic contin-
gency allowances. This was called to the attention of CFN at the time of
the first appraisal mission. Some improvement in this field was noted at
the time of reappraisal.
3.12      The Project Supervision Department which was not established until
1968, operates under the direction of an economist. It has a professional
staff of four economists and one engineer. Its work consists of controlling
disbursement schedules, visiting projects (mainly those under construction
or those experiencing difficulties) and analyzing financial information re-
ceived from clients. Although loan contracts provide for quarterly financial
and operational reporting by borrowers, the flow and quality of such infor-
mation is deficient with the result that, in most cases, specific knowledge
of the status of projects is confined to information extracted from annual
financial statements. This stems principally from the inadequacy or lack
of internal control systems in a large number of companies, the scarcity of
good accountants and the general reluctance of sponsors to release informa-
tion. Notwithstanding, CFN has been advised to increase its efforts to ob-
tain prompt, more frequent and adequate information from its borrowers; under
the circumstances, however, improvement in the standard of follow-up work is
likely to be slow.
Resources
3.13      The following table shows the resources utilized by CFN as of
June 30, 1970 compared with those as of June 30, 1968 (in SI million):
June 30, 1968           June 30, 1970

3.14      The most important financial resource of CFN is its net worth
which accounts for almost two thirds of the total. Authorized share
capital is set by law at S/ 500 million. In accordance with its organic
law, paid-in capital is to be increased from time to time by net profits
until it equals the authorized capital. Thereafter, annual net profits are
to be allocated to a special reserve until it reaches an amount equal to
the authorized share capital. As a result of this capitalization process,
CFN's paid-in capital has increased from S/ 393.2 million at December 31,
1964 to S| 481.7 million as of June 30, 1970. In addition, on this last
date CFN had surplus and reserves amounting to S/ 76.8 million.
3.15      CFN obtains short-term loans from the Central Bank against
deposit of government securities from its portfolio. These loans amount
to 70% of the nominal value of the collateral pledged and are made at
an interest cost of from 3% to 6% annually. Thus far, there has been no
limit for these operations which, in effect, constitute a liquidity
resource for CFN.
3.16      In 1962, the Government of Ecuador obtained from AID a loan
of US$5.0 million to finance industry. The term of the loan was 20 years,
with 4-1/2 years of grace and a cost of 0.75% annually. The former
Comision de Valores was made the recipient and user of the funds. To
avoid the problem of maintenance of value (exchange risk), a two-step
procedure provided that the Government of Ecuador would repay the loan
to AID in dollars and would collect from Comision de Valores principal
and interest on the loan in sucres, against a fee of 5% annually. The loan
agreement provided also that the terms and grace period would be
doubled if the loan was transferred to the Company. In 1967, CFN assumed
the loan in dollars at 0.75% interest annually and the term was extended
to 40 years, including 9-1/2 years of grace. This loan has been fully com-
mitted and as of June 30, 1970, the equivalent of SI 86.9 million had been
disbursed and was outstanding.
3.17      In June 1967, IDB extended a US$5.0 million loan to CFN.  Half
of the loan was granted from the Fund for Special Operations, carrying
interest at 4% p.a. and half from Ordinary Capital at 6.5% p.a. This
loan has also been fully committed. As of June 30, 1970, IDB had dis-
bursed funds for the equivalent of SI 80.4 million. The loan is denomi-
nated in dollars and CFN relends these funds in sucres, taking on the
exchange risk. The term is 15 years, including three years of grace.
3.18      In April 1970, IDB granted CFN a second loan of US$7.5 million.
The proceeds of this loan are available for industry, fisheries and
tourism development, including pre-investment studies. US$3.0 million
was granted from the Fund for Special Operations, carrying interest at
3.25% p.a. plus an annual service commission of 0.5%, and US$4.5 million
from Ordinary Capital at 8% p.a. plus an annual service commission of
0.75%. US$5.7 million of the loan is denominated in US dollars, US$1.0
million equivalent in Deutsche mark and US$0.8 million equivalent in
Italian lire. CFN relends these funds in sucres, taking on the exchange
risk. The term is 15 years, including three years of grace. Up to
June 30, 1970, CFN had not initiated disbursements under this loan.

3.19      CFN is the only financial intermediary under the Bank loan
to the Government of Ecuador for the development of fisheries (555-EC).
Under this loan, US$3.7 million are available to CFN for financing
the construction and equipping of purse seiners.  On June 30, 1970, this
loan had just entered the disbursement stage and only US$6,500 were outstand-
ing.  CFN has also obtained lines of credit from Swiss and French bank con-
sortia for the equivalent of US$2.3 million and US$2.0 million, respectively.
These loans are tied to procurement from these countries. The exchange risk
on these funds is also borne by CFN. Interest rates vary from 6.0% to 7.5%
p.a. depending on the terms of the sub-loans. Only a small portion of the
Swiss bank loan (the equivalent of S/ 5.8 million) has been committed to
date. CFN has also obtained from the Swiss Government a credit line of
US$250,000 for financing pre-investment studies. The cost is 4% p.a.
Policy Guidelines
3.20      CFN's operations have been governed by a number of policy and
operational guidelines formulated from time to time by its Board of
Directors. The main features of these guidelines are: CFN can finance
up to 70% of the cost of new projects and up to 100% of expansion projects.
(In practice, however, CFN's loans have been in the neighborhood of 40%
of total project cost.) Maximum terms for lending are 12 years for
fixed assets and five years for working capital. The maximum amount
that can normally be lent to a single borrower is S/ 20 million. Guaran-
tees on behalf of industrial borrowers can only be issued by CFN to cover
suppliers' and other foreign credits, and must be made against real
estate mortgages (the commercial value of which must be at least 150% of
the guarantee), liens on equipment (125%) or pledge of marketable
securities (125%). CFN must maintain a 10% minimum liquidity reserve
on the value of securities sold with its obligation to repurchase at
par (para. 3.24); funds from this reserve may be invested in highly
liquid securities. And, because of the senior nature under Ecuadorian
law of debt obligations to the Social Security Fund, CFN will not make
loans to enterprises which are in arrears in their payments to this Fund.
3.21      Guidelines did not exist, however, for some important aspects
of CFN's operations. For example, there were no policies regarding
foreign exchange risk coverage and diversification of the equity portfolio
(maximum exposure in equity investments and in a single enterprise). In
addition, there was no limitation on total indebtedness by CFN. Since
CFN is still young as a development bank, it was considered desirable,
as a condition to Bank financing, to agree on a comprehensive statement
of policy which would eliminate these shortcomings. Such a statement
of policy was discussed during negotiations and the Bank's suggestions
were incorporated in its text (Annex 3), prior to adoption by CFN's
Board in October 1970.
3.22      As a successor to the Comision Nacional de Valores, CFN con-
tinues to engage in bond market operations, mainly for Government secur-
ities. However, CFN 's principal function is to provide term financing



- 11 -
to industry. Although under its charter CFN can finance public sector
projects, it has done little in this field in the past compared to its
other activities. It has, in fact, financed only a few infrastructure
projects. CFN expects to continue making only a few public sector invest-
ments and to limit these to infrastructure projects.
Operations
3.23      CFN's operations include loans to the Government, trading in
government and private securities, loans to industry, equity investments,
underwriting and guarantees (Annex 4). CFN's government financing is
in the form of direct loans to the Central Government and of purchases
of Central and Municipal Government bonds, the latter issued to finance
basic infrastructure projects. While these operations continue to be
an important part of the Company's activities, their total value has
decreased substantially, both in absolute amount and in relation to the
total loan and investment portfolio. As of December 31, 1964, holdings
of public bonds and loans to Government amounted to S/ 535.7 million,
or 98% of its total loan and investment portfolio; five-and-a-half years
later, on June 30, 1970, they amounted to S/ 311.4 million, or 37% of
the total. This downward trend is expected to continue since all loan
repayments from industrial borrowers (net of loan amortization by CFN)
can be used only for industrial lending (para. 3.26). The bulk of direct
loans to the Government are due within one year and bear interest varying
from 3.5% to 7.0% p.a. Public sector bonds are acquired by CFN at size-
able discounts; as of June 30, 1970, these discounts amounted to S/ 25.4
million on an aggregate face value amount of SI 239.6 million, or an
average rate of discount of 10.6%. They carry an interest rate of
8-9%.
3.24      Aside from government bonds, CFN's security operations have
included the purchase and sale of mortgage bonds (cedulas). The latter
have been issued by commercial banks and private enterprises to finance
industrial and agricultural projects. Bonds sold by CFN to the public
bear its guarantee of repurchase any time at par. On June 30, 1970,
there were securities with such guarantee in the hands of the public
amounting to S/ 317.1 million, of which S/ 267.2 million were Central
and Mlunicipal Government bonds, and S/ 49.9 million, mortgage bonds.
CFN does not have to pay for these securities, when repurchasing, an
amount more than it invested in them. It has discontinued the price
guarantee for mortgage bonds.
3.25      Although CFN's experience indicates that, even in moments of
political unrest, the volume of repurchases of bonds has not been
critical, this practice could infringe upon CFN's liquidity in the
event of a collapse in the bond market. However, considering that the
repurchase obligation is largely confined to government securities,
that the value of the securities represents a decreasing proportion of
the Company's assets (para. 3.23) and that CFN may discount them with
the Central Bank (for which purpose so far there has been no limit),
this aspect of CFN's near term liquidity need not be of critical concern.



- 12 -
Nevertheless, CFii recognizes this problem and, as a result of discussion
on this subject during negotiations, has included in its declaration of
policies a statement that it will conduct its operations in such a
manner as to assure the maintenance of adequate liquidity. In addition,
to isolate industrial financing from the effects of market operations,
CFN agreed not to use resources from the Fund for Industrial Invest-
ments (see para. 3.26) for purposes other than industrial lending; the
use by CFN of these resources in market or other operations would con-
stitute an event of default under the loan agreement. By implication, if
a liquidity crisis did arise from its security operations and default
under the Loan were to be avoided, the Government would have to step
in, and it is unlikely that the Government would allow CFN to be in
default for this reason. Moreover, CFN has agreed to limit its indebted-
ness, including its contingent repurchase obligations, to four times
its own equity (para. 3.42).
3.26      In 1967, on the recommendation of the Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank, CFN set up a Fund for Industrial Investments to separate
industrial financing operations from other activities. The Fund does
not appear as a separate item in the balance sheet and it is, therefore,
a notional account rather than a fund in the real sense. According
to CFN Board Regulation No. 16 of May 11, 1967, the resources of this
Fund are the entire industrial loan repayments, foreign borrowings
for industrial financing, and periodical allocations from CFN's own funds.
The purpose of these latter allocations is to ensure sufficient funds
to meet the domestic currency requirements of projects; and their amount
is determined annually by CFN's Board, not exceeding 30% of the total
value of the projects to be financed each year. While the Fund intro-
duces a degree of inflexibility in CFN's use of its resources, it seems
also to assure a growing evolution of CFN's activity in the direction
of industrial lending.
3.27      CFN's industrial lending operations have grown rapidly, as
shown in the following tabulation (in S/ million):
1963   1964   1965   1966   1967   1968   1969   1970
(6 mos.)

Commitments      n.a.   6.0   56.9  106.6   89.3  145.7  136.0   84.8
From 1963 to June 30, 1970 (Annex 5), CFN approved 319 loans with an aggre-
gate amount of S/ 860.1 million. Another 158 loan applications amounting to
S/ 386.0 million were reviewed and rejected. Since January 1970, inter-
est is set at the legal maximum of 12% p.a., with a commitment fee of
1a p.a. All loans made prior to that date were made at the then maximum
legal limit of 10% p.a. Most of the loans (70% by value) have been
granted for periods between five and ten years; the larger portion was
for financing fixed assets (82%) and the balance (18%) for working
capital. CFN's loans are well diversified, with the largest proportion



- 13 -
for food processing (28.5%) and textile enterprises (13.2%). Regarding
geograpihical distribution, the provinces of Guayas (Guayaquil area) and
Pichincha (Quito area) account for 75% of the total, reflecting the
prevailing concentration of industry in those areas. Most of the loans
(51' by number and 89% by value) were for amounts over S/ 1.5 million and
the average size of the loan was S/ 2.8 million. Grace periods vary
with the nature of the project and of the assets financed, and range
between six months and three years.
3.28      CFN considers equity investments in viable projects when
private capital cannot be successfully raised. In accordance with its
Declaration of Policies and Procedures, it intends to sell its partici-
pations gradually to private investors as market conditions permit it.
As of June 30, 1970, CFN's equity protfolio was small. It consisted of
shares in six companies, for a total of S/ 31.9 million, or 6.1% of
the industrial loan and investment portfolio (3.8% of total portfolio),
as follows:

31,852
Ecuatoriana de Atun and Hotel Colon Internacional were promoted by
CFN. Ecuatoriana de Atun, incorporated in the second half of 1968,
engages in tuna fishing and canning; it recently started operations
and its prospects are considered good. Hotel Colon Internacional
opened early in 1968; it receives technical assistance and is admini-
stered by Hotel Associates, S.A. (a company formed by Braniff Inter-
national, Western Hotels Corp., ADELA and DELTEC); it has had successful
operations and is presently being expanded. Desarrollo Agropecuario
S.A. resulted from the reorganization of a family agricultural enter-
prise which was experiencing financial difficulties; CFN's investment
was an important part in the reorganization, which had been initiated
by COFIEC, Banco Nacional de Fomento and other important creditors.
Prospects are yet uncertain but developments in this company are being
followed closely by CFN and COFIEC, which are represented on its Board
and have appointed new management.
3.30      CFN has participated successfully in only one underwriting
(Fabrica Textil Internacional bonds, totalling SI 38 million, of which



- 14 -
it now holds S/ 2.3 million). It has also provided guarantees on
b)ehalf of three borrowers for import financing, which as of June 30,
1970 totalled S/ 7.4 million.
3.31      At present, CFN is studying 15 possible industrial promotions,
some of which are being carried out in collaboration with CENDES. These
projects, which include a cement plant, a small shipyard, tourism ventures
and various plants for processing agricultural raw materials, would call
for an estimated total investment of about S/ 400 million over the next
five years.
3.32      CFN's organic law provides for a special fund to finance "small
industry", to which resources of S/ 40 million have been assigned out
of capital (SI 20 million until October 1970). This, too, is a notional
account rather than an identifiable item in the balance sheet. The fund
is used to discount loans or to purchase bonds made or issued by commer-
cial banks or private development finance companies in financing fixed
and working capital requirements of artisans, in amounts not exceeding
SI 200,000 per client. The risk is borne by the original lender. As of
June 30, 1970, the amount outstanding of transactions out of this fund
was S/ 14.3 million.
3.33      CFN's loan portfolio appears generally sound; the amount of
principal in arrears is low, companies in difficulties are few and secu-
rity is ample. As of June 30, 1970, arrears of principal in respect
of industrial loans, amounted to SI 26.0 million. Most of these arrears
were of a temporary nature; only S/ 6.0 million corresponded to defaults
outstanding for six or more months; and collections through August 15,
1970 of SI 16.5 million, reduced the arrears to S/ 9.5 million, which
represents 2% of the industrial loan portfolio. The total principal
outstanding from 13 borrowers in arrears amounted to S/ 37.7 million,
or 9.2% of the outstanding loan portfolio. CFN is watching closely
four projects which are in difficulties and in which it has a total
exposure of S/ 5.5 million, or 1.4% of the total portfolio.
Financial Position and Results
3.34      Balance Sheets.  In addition to internal auditing, CFN's
accounts are subject to periodic review by the Superintendency of Banks
and are audited once a year by Price Waterhouse & Co. Until December
31, 1966, the Company operated on a calendar year basis. In 1967, it
changed to a fiscal year ending June 30. A new accounting system designed
by Price Waterhouse & Co. was installed in mid-1969.
3.35      During five-and-a-half years of operations, CFN's total
assets increased from S/ 590.2 million on December 31, 1964 to S/ 881.1
million on June 30, 1970 (Annex 6), representing a rate of growth of
8,, p.a. (3% in fiscal year 1970 and 7% in fiscal year 1969). The
larger portion of this growth (59%) was financed with long-term borrow-
ings from abroad, which increased by SI 172.9 million over the period.



- 15 -
Retained earnings amounting to SI 168.5 million over the same period
accounted for 48% of the growth. Although the level of indebtedness
has risen steadily, CFN's total liabilities, including guarantees and
its bond repurchase obligations, barely exceed its equity; as of June
30, 1970, the total debt/equity relationship was only 1.1:1. Short-term
liquidity is ample, reflecting the substantial amount of long-term resources
at CFN's disposal and management's prudent handling of the Company's finan-
cial affairs.
3.36      Accumulated retained earnings from 1964 to June 30, 1970
amount to S/ 168.5 million. tiore than half of these earnings, SI
88.5 million, has been capitalized. Of the remaining S/ 80.0 million,
SI 76.8 million were in a general reserve for contingencies and S/ 3.2
million had been set aside in a provision for possible losses. After
allowing for unrealized exchange losses of S/ 72.3 million (see Para.
3.36 below) surplus and reserves are reduced to SI 7.7 million, repre-
senting 1.5% of the outstanding loan and equity investment portfolio.
While this is a very low level of protection, and reserves should be
built up, it should be noted that in the case of CFN, the relative level
of reserves is rather artificial; all net earnings are retained and the
one shareholder - the Government - may decide whether those earnings
remain as surplus or are transformed into share capital. More relevant
than the reserve coverage, therefore, is (a) CFN's total equity and
(b) its earning power, which currently results in yearly earnings
representing about 7% of the loan and equity investment portfolio.
3.37      Earnings.  Despite low leverage, in fiscal year 1970 CFN
showed net earnings on average capital invested of 4.3%. The net return
on average total assets was 4.1% and on net worth, 6.5% (Annex 7). Net
earnings on average capital at 4.3% can be characterized as only margi-
nal. Since the Company has not classified its receipts and expenses in
its accounts in a manner in which the net earnings from each type of
operation can be ascertained, it is not possible to state conclusively
which operations are less profitable than others. However, the indus-
trial loan portfolio, which currently earns a gross return of somewhat
more than 10% (somewhat more than 12% for loans granted since March
1970), most probably does net a satisfactory return. Notwithstanding,
in view of the relatively low profitability of the corporation as a whole,
CFN's Board has declared in the policy statement agreed to during negoti-
ations that CFN will charge fees for its capital and services and will
otherwise conduct its operations in such a way that it will earn a
satisfactory return on the capital it employs.
3.38      Foreign Exchange Risk.  In analysing CFN's financial position,
special consideration must be given to the foreign exchange risk which
the Company has assumed on its borrowings from abroad. Because CFN has
operated in an environment of relative exchange stability, has enjoyed
concessionary rates of interest and has had sizeable, tax-exempt earnings
which it is allowed to retain, it has felt prepared to shoulder the
exchange risk.  However, as a result of the devaluation of the sucre in



- 16 -
August 1970 from 18 to 25 per US dollar, CFN suffered an unrealized
exchange loss on its outstanding borrowings from abroad of SI 72.3
million. The provision for exchange losses which has to be established
(and which is not reflected in the financial statements as of June 30,
1970, shown in this report) represents less than half (46%) the retained
earnings from 1964 to June 30, 1970 of S/ 168.5 million, of which SI
91.7 million had been capitalized, and SI 76.8 million remained as
accumulated surplus and reserves. Actual exchange losses, of course,
do not occur until the foreign exchange obligations are repaid and
this will take many years; the final maturity of the AID loan is in the
year 2002.
3.39      During negotiations (which took place in April 1970, that is,
before the devaluation of the sucre), the question was discussed as
to whether the exchange risk was one which CFN could prudently carry and
whether, therefore, its future creditors could prudently accept. On one
side was the fact that the risk would stand for many years and that it
could not be quantified. On the other hand, CFN's capital base was
strong and it had the capacity to build up reserves rapidly, so that a
substantial amount of funds could be put aside as provision against
exchange losses. Moreover, CFN was a government-owned company, which would
not likely be allowed by the Government to fail to meet its obligations.
Nevertheless, in order to strengthen CFN's creditworthiness it was agreed:
(a) that CFN would declare its intention to conduct its operations in such a
manner as to assure the maintenance of the value of its capital; (b) that
CFN shall take the necessary steps to protect itself against the foreign
exchange risk (which, under present circumstances, means the building up of
reserves); and (c) that the loan would be in default if the Government did
not compensate CFN for financial losses that might arise by reason of CFN's
borrowing operations outside Ecuador.
Prospects
3.40      CFN's forecast of operations for the calendar year period
1971-75 (Annex 8) assumes an average increase in total loan and equity
investment approvals of 12% p.a. (16% in 1968/69). Loan approvals in
1970 are estimated to amount to S| 238 million and are forecast to in-
crease gradually from SI 236 million in 1971 to SI 424 million in 1975.
Forecast approvals seem in line with past performance (SI 178 million in
1969) and, in view of projects already under study which total S/ 143.6
million, appear attainable. Forecast loan commitments and disbursements
bear a reasonable relationship to approvals and take into account the
existing backlogs. Equity investments are projected at S/ 20.0 million
p.a. throughout the forecast period. This is a substantially higher
level than in the recent past (an average of SI 12.0 million in 1969-70)
and reflects CFN's increasingly promotional attitude. Loans to Govern-
ment and holdings of government securities are forecast to continue to
decrease gradually. Overall, the projections appear reasonable.
3.41      To support forecast operations, CFN assumes a steady increase
in foreign borrowings (Annexes 9 and 10), mainly from IDB, KfW and the



- 17 -
Bank. Local currency funds are expected to come from loan collections
(net of repayments), internal generation and bond flotations. CFN anti-
cipates that it will be able to place its own bonds in an amount of
SI 30.0 million annually beginning in 1972. However, since the bonds
would have to compete with price-guaranteed government securities, the
anticipated level of bond placements may be difficult to achieve.
3.42      If suitable financial resources are available and the fore-
cast disbursements materialize, annual interest income (including
bond discounts) would more than treble over the forecast period; from
S/ 46.0 million in fiscal year 1970 to S/ 150.0 million in 1975 (Annex
11). Administrative and general expenses are forecast to increase by
81% during the period, while total assets increase by 100%. This will
result in a decrease in their relationship to total assets from the
present level of 2.1% to 1.7%, still a somewhat high level; however,
this reflects largely the fact that CFN will be building up its follow-
up capability. Niet earnings on average total assets would rise from
4.1% in fiscal year 1970 to 4.9% in 1973 and 5.3% in 1975. Despite
continued low leverage, return on average net worth would rise from 6.5%
in fiscal year 1970 to 10.8% in 1973 and 11.5% in 1975. These levels
of earnings should be attainable. Since CFN is allowed to retain its
net earnings (para. 3.14), surplus and reserves should increase sub-
stantially after the build-up of the authorized capital (S/ 500.0
million) has been completed; surplus and reserves should rise gradually
from S/ 80.0 million on June 30, 1970 to S/ 333.0 million in 1975, which
would be available for additional provision to cover the exchange risk.
This level of protection appears adequate.
3.43      CFN's term debt to equity ratio is expected to rise from
0.3:1 in 1970 to 0.6:1 in 1971, 0.9:1 in 1972 and 1.0:1 in 1975, while
total debt to equity ratio would rise from 1.1:1 in 1970, to 1.6:1 in
1971 and remain at that level through 1975. This consistently low
indebtedness results from a strong initial equity base and from CFN's
ability to retain all of its substantial net earnings. Since CFN's
repurchase guarantee on security operations are the equivalent of a
current liability and as these operations have been sizeable (represent-
ing about two-thirds of net worth), it was considered advisable to
include them in total debt for purposes of the debt/equity limitation.
During negotiations this limit was set at 4:1, which allows CFN a wide
margin for additional borrowing while maintaining its capital structure
within a prudent limit.
3.44      CFN's financial projections indicate an ample debt service
coverage of 3.0 in 1971 declining to 2.9 in 1972, increasing to 3.6 in 1975
and continuing at satisfactory levels for the life of the proposed loan.
This ample coverage reflects largely the long terms and grace periods of CFN's
main borrowings (from AID and IDB), which greatly exceed its relending terms.

Conclusion
3.45      CFN is a well-managed and well-organized development bank
with a satisfactory record in industrial finance for a period of over
five years. As a provider of term financing for investment in industry,
it is playing an important and increasing role in stimulating economic
development in Ecuador.
3.46      Although wholly-owned by the Government, the majority of CFN's
Directors are members of the business community; and, despite changing
governments, there has been continuity in management; CFN's present
General Manager has headed the Company (or its forerunner) without inter-
ruption since 1957. The emphasis it places on project evaluation, for
which it has built up a competent technical department, constitutes reason-
able assurance that CFN's investment decisions have been based largely on
sound technical and financial criteria.
3.47      CFN's performance has been satisfactory.  During its first
years of operation, the Company concentrated on building up its loan
portfolio. Involvement in the more risky promotions and equity invest-
ments, though increasing, has been small. At this time, there is no
reason to doubt the general soundness of its portfolio. Its capital
structure is sound, with a large equity base and high liquidity. CFN
is a suitable recipient for Bank funds.
IV. ECUATORIANA DE DESARROLLO S.A. (COMPANIA FINANCIERA)
4.01      COFIEC was incorporated under the provisions of the Finance
Companies Act of 1965. It received authorization to operate in January
1966 and began operations in Quito in March of that year. Shortly there-
after, it opened an office in Guayaquil to serve the "Costa" region.
COFIEC was appraised in mid-1968 in connection with an IFC equity invest-
ment of US$251,371 (IFC/R69-7 of February 13, 1969), which was made in
March 1969. It was also appraised in mid-1969 and in September 1970 for
the purpose of the proposed Bank loan.
Share Capital and Ownership
4.02      COFIEC's authorized capital is S/ 72 million as a result of the
decision the shareholders took in .March 1968 to double the authorized share
capital. The purpose of the increase was to secure additional funds and
to provide the equity base required to increase borrowings. In 1968, the
first S/ 9 million was paid in and a program adopted for the remaining
S/ 27 million in three tranches: S/ 11 million in 1969, SI 9 million in
1970 and S/ 7 million in 1971. In 1969, paid-in capital increased by S/
12.1 million of whiiclh S/5.5 million (44%) came from IFC. On June 30, 1970,
paid-in capital stood at S/ 60.9 million and a further increase of S/ 6 mil-
lion is in the process of subscription, which is expected to be completed
by the end of 1970. The record of capital increases is thus somewhat ahead
of the program.

4.03      ADELA is COFIEC'a largest shareholder with a 12.2% participation.
IFC is second, with 9.0% (Annex 12). Private Ecuadorian companies and in-
dividuals (166 in number), own 39.0% of the shares.  The Ecuadorian Gov-
ernment through CFN holds 8.5%; and 52.5% belong to 18 foreign, or foreign
controlled shareholders, including ADELA and IFC. COFIEC's management
takes pride in the fact that, despite the traditional rivalry between the
two major industrial centers of Quito and Guayaquil, the company has suc-
ceeded in mustering as shareholders some of the most important enterprises
in both cities, more or less in equal proportions.
Purpose and Powers
4.04      COFIEC's purpose is to assist in the creation, expansion and mod-
ernization of private and mixed, productive enterprises in Ecuador. COFIEC
may (a) promote, reorganize, lend to and invest in industrial enterprises;
(b) purchase, sell and underwrite all types of securities; (c) open letters
of credit and provide acceptances and guarantees; (d) borrow and issue bonds;
(e) extend technical assistance to enterprises; and (f) promote the partici-
pation of foreign capital in such enterprises along with private domestic
funds. Under Ecuadorian law, finance companies such as COFIEC may not
receive deposits.
Board, Hanagement and Staff
4.05      COFIEC's Board of Directors (Annex 13) includes, in addition to
representatives of the foreign shareholders and IFC, a selection of ex-
perienced executives of major banking, insurance and industrial concerns
in Ecuador. The Board usually meets about once a month. It has delegated
authority to an Executive Committee to approve loans and investments of
up to S/ 3 million each. The Board follows closely COFIEC's operations;
its contribution to the Company's investment decisions is substantial
because of the Directors' personal knowledge of the business community.
4.06      Dr. Jose Antonio Correa, a distinguished lawyer and diplomat, has
been COFIEC's President since its inception. He is elected by the share-
holders for a three-year term and may be re-elected. Mr. Cesar Duran Ballen,
the Executive Vice President, is responsible for the overall administration
of the Company and is de facto manager of the Guayaquil office. At present,
Mr. Duran Ballen is also Chairman of the Monetary Board and Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the Central Bank. COFIEC's management team is com-
petent. The emergence of COFIEC into a financial institution of standing
in the relatively short time it has been operating is a measure of the
efforts of its President and Executive Vice President.
4.07      COFIEC's senior staff is well-qualified and works within clearly
defined areas of responsibility. Staff now numbers 55, including 16 pro-
fessionals, evenly distributed between the offices in Quito and Guayaquil
(Annex 14). Professional staff includes engineers, economists and analysts
for industrial, agricultural and livestock operations, as well as accoun-
tants. For legal advice, COFIEC uses the services of outside lawyers.



- 20 -
Appraisal and Follow-up
4.08      With the exception of agricultural (livestock) projects, COFIEC
has not yet given attention to adopting a satisfactory methodology in ap-
praisal of long-term investments. While COFIEC's appraisal of livestock
development projects is handled competently by two analysts with extensive
experience in agricultural and livestock financing, appraisal reports for
industrial loans are thin and tend to focus on the collateral offered.
This is partly because industrial lending operations thus far have been
mostly in the short-term field, and partly because the company has relied
heavily on the Board's and management's intimate knowledge of the business
community, and on their close association with the company's main clients.
Regular follow-up procedures for industrial loans do not yet exist. COFIEC's
knowledge of the status of projects is largely confined to that provided in
financial statements which are received about once a year. In general,
only when a project is in difficulty or there is a request for rescheduling,
does COFIEC's personnel pay visits to obtain up-to-date information.
4.09      COFIEC needs to improve its appraisal and follow-up procedures of
industrial projects, particularly in view of the anticipated increase in
term financing of fixed assets. To accomplish this, its technical depart-
ment will have to be strengthened. Management realizes the shortcomings
and, for this purpose, has recently merged the financial departments in
Quito and Guayaquil into their respective technical departments. COFIEC
intends to strengthen its staff when the Bank loan is assured; its staff
development will need careful watching.
Resources
4.10      In addition to its net worth, COFIEC's long-term financial re-
sources consists of a US$3 million loan from AID, granted in 1966 at 2-1/2%
p.a. interest and a term of 20 years, including five years' grace; a US$1.5
million credit line from the Export-Import Bank, granted in 1968 at 6% p.a.
interest and a term of 7 years, including two years' grace; and a second
US$3 million credit line from the Export-Import Bank, granted in April 1970,
at 6% p.a. interest and a term of 6-1/2 years, including 1-1/2 years of
grace. Moreover COFIEC participates as a financial intermediary in an
IBRD loan of US$4 million and in IDA credits totalling US$11.5 million ex-
tended to the Government of Ecuador for livestock development, including
the credit approved by IDA's Executive Directors on November 24, 1970. On
June 30, 1970, the AID loan, the first Export-Import Bank loan and the IBRD
livestock loan had been fully committed. On that date, therefore, COFIEC
depended on the second Export-Import Bank loan and on a small balance of
the IDA livestock loan for further long-term financing of its clients.
4.11      In short-term resources, COFIEC has had a rediscount line with
the Central Bank, the amount of which is adjusted from time to time in
proportion with paid-in capital; however, this facility has been suspended
since the second half of 1969 as part of the Central Bank's general credit
restriction program. In addition, COFIEC has revolving credit lines from
twenty foreign commercial banks totalling US$19.5 million, which may be



- 21 -
used to grant short-term loans or extend guarantees. On June 30, 1970,
70% of these resources were used; interest on these credit lines ranged
from 10.25% to 11.75% p.a.
4.12      The following table summarizes the financial resources used by
COFIEC on June 30, 1970, compared to those as of December 31, 1968 (in
S/ million):
December 31, 1968            June 30, 1970
Amount           %         Amount    _

AID loan                     62.8           28.3          64.3         13.7
Eximbank                       -              -           23.6         5.0

Total long-term resources         119.4         53.8         166.5         35.4
Short-term loans             75.6           34.0          12.9          2.7

Total current resources          102.7          46.2         302.9         64.6
Total resources                   222.1        100.0         469.4        100.0
Noteworthy during the period is COFIEC's increased use of short-term re-
sources, which went up from 46.2% to 64.6% of the total. The reason for
this was the lack of long-term resources: COFIEC could not obtain long-
term loans from abroad because it could not, and did not wish, to get a
Government guarantee. Guarantees and acceptances extended by COFIEC have
been included as a financial resource in the above table even though techni-
cally they are contingent liabilities and, as such, are carried in COFIEC's
books outside its balance sheet. The reason for their inclusion is that
they are in fact a substitute for short-term loans from foreign commercial
banks (see para. 4.21).
Policies
4.13      COFIEC's operations are governed by the Banking Law, the Finance
Companies Act, its Statutes and by a comprehensive Statement of Policies
and Procedures. This statement (Annex 15) was agreed upon between COFIEC
and IFC prior to IFC's investment. It contains all the provisions gener-
ally usual to development finance companies associated with the Bank
Group. Policy guidelines are generally adhered to. However, although the
Statement of Policies provides that COFIEC will not carry the exchange risk
on external borrowings, it is in effect carrying it (see paras. 4.25-29).



- 22 -
Operations
4.14      Business has grown rapidly.  On June 30, 1970, COFIEC had ap-
proved financing applications totalling SI 1,186 million (Annex 16). During
the last two-and-a-half years (January 1968/June 1970), total approvals in-
creased at an annual rate of 75%. Although the bulk of COFIEC's financing
has been in the form of loans, their proportion relative to total financing
approved has declined dramatically: from 85% in 1968 to 32% in 1969 and to
10% in 1970. This resulted from a deliberate shift in the form of financing,
from loans to guarantees. Guarantees outstanding at year end 1968 amounted
to S/ 4.2 million compared with SI 280.2 million on June 30, 1970. The
reasons for this shift are given in para. 4.21 below.
4.15      Loans.  Reflecting a lack of long-term resources, COFIEC's loans
have been predominantly short-term; 50.7% of total loan commitments (by
value) have been for up to one year and 60.6% for up to two years (Annex
17). During the first half of 1970, however, while the first Eximbank
loan was being committed, there was a shift towards longer term loans:
during this period, loan commitments for over two years were 48.7% of the
total, compared with 37.8% in 1969 and 38.7% from inception through 1969.
About two-thirds of the loans (by value) have been for amounts between
SI 1.0 and SI 3.0 million. Most loans have been made to manufacturing enter-
prises (66.7%) and a reasonable degree of diversification within this sector
has been achieved. Indicating a conservative approach, the bulk of loans
(88.4%) has been for the expansion and modernization of existing plants
and only 11.6% for new projects. In the first half of 1970, however, 31.4%
of loan commitments (by value) were for new projects. Of the total amount
committed, 52% has been used for the acquisition of fixed assets and 48%
for working capital. M4ost of the amount lent has been committed to enter-
prises in the Guayaquil (56.4%) and the Quito (32.5%) areas, reflecting the
concentration of manufacturing around these cities.
4.16      Guarantees.  Guarantees are provided mostly in foreign exchange,
and are used mainly for short-term import/export financing. They are se-
cured adequately by collateral, usually in the form of real estate mortgages
worth at least 150% of the amount guaranteed.
4.17      Syndications.  Since 1968 COFIEC has also been active in syndica-
tions. It has organized and participated in five of these financing oper-
ations totalling US$3.6 million. Its own participation in them amounted to
US$550,000; the balance came from abroad. The projects financed in this
manner were a vegetable oil refinery, two banana plantations and two highway
construction projects.
4.18      Interest, fees and commissions.  Loans made with the proceeds of
the first Export-Import Bank loan have been made at an interest rate of
9% p.a. and those to be granted with the proceeds of the second Export-
Import Bank loan will be made at 10%. All other loans are granted at 12%
p.a. since January 1970, when the legal maximum was raised from 10% to 12%
p.a. Interest is collected in advance for the entire period for short-term



- 23 -
loans; for other loans, every six months, on the outstanding balance. In
addition to interest, COFIEC charges commissions and fees as follows:
Letters of credit:   commission - 4% p.a.
opening fee - 1-2% flat
Acceptances:          commission - 4% p.a.
Guarantees:           commission - 4% p.a.
Loans:                commission - 1-2% flat
These charges are in line with those levied by other financial institutions
in Ecuador.
4.19      Equity Investments.  COFIEC's equity portfolio, although beginning
to increase rapidly, is still small (Annex 18).  On June 30, 1970, it con-
sisted of common shares in twelve enterprises, totalling S/ 15.1 million,
representing 8.1% of the total loan and equity investment portfolio and
22.7% of net worth. COFIEC has been mildly promotional. Its equity port-
folio is well diversified between new enterprises and established companies;
it is also well diversified among various types of industries. COFIEC has
lost 9% of its equity investment as a result of capital write-downs in two
enterprises in 1970. The dividend return on its portfolio has been small:
it amounted to only 1.9% in 1969 and to an estimated 1.6% in 1970 of the
cost of the portfolio. The return is low despite the fact that over half of
COFIEC's portfolio is in the shares of established companies; these compan-
ies, although profitable, have been retaining a large proportion of their
earnings.
4.20      Quality of Portfolio.  On June 30, 1970, total arrears (loans and
guarantees) amounted to S/ 38.6 million from 80 clients; the total principal
outstanding from clients in arrears was S/ 152.2 million, or 33.8% of the
loan and guarantee portfolio. However, the bulk of these arrears was tem-
porary; they resulted largely from the moratorium on foreign exchange trans-
actions which began in June, prior to devaluation. Eliminating the princi-
pal outstanding from clients in temporary difficulty, the rest amounted to
S/ 41.7 million, or 9.2% of the total portfolio. Only seven of the borrow-
ers in arrears were experiencing serious financial difficulty and four more
had a deteriorating financial situation; the amount at risk with these bor-
rowers was S/ 18.8 million, or 4.2% of the portfolio. This indicates the
fair quality of the loan and guarantee portfolio. Moreover, 98% of the
value of this portfolio is secured by mortgages, chattel pledges, bank,
personal and other guarantees. On the other hand, 57% of the equity port-
folio by value is in well established and profitable companies, 17% is in
new companies with attractive prospects, and 26% in companies experiencing
difficulty and with uncertain prospects. Overall, the portfolio of ques-
tionable value, including S/ 3.9 million for equity investments, is estimated
at S/ 22.7 million, equivalent to 4.8% of the total investment portfolio.

Financial Position and Results
4.21      COFIEC has had an impressive financial record; its return on aver-
age equity has increased steadily until it reached 16.1% in 1969 (Annexes 19
and 20). COFIEC's performance is particularly striking when considering the
changing and increasingly difficult financial environment with which it has
been faced. In 1969, in addition to a lack of long-term resources, condi-
tions in the international monetary markets and within Ecuador itself made
it increasingly difficult for COFIEC to provide the kind of financing expect-
ed of a development finance company. The cost of short-term foreign bank
credit to COFIEC increased beyond its maximum permissible relending rate.
Moreover, the inflationary situation and deteriorating balance of payments of
Ecuador led the Central Bank, as part of a general credit restriction pro-
gram, to suspend COFIEC's rediscount line. In the face of these difficul-
ties, COFIEC acted with resourcefulness and flexibility. It resorted to
financing in the form of guarantees in foreign exchange, on which it earned
a 4% commission. In doing so, COFIEC tapped financial resources which it
could not use directly and greatly expanded its operations. Through this
mechanism, COFIEC also avoided the foreign exchange risk associated with
direct indebtedness in foreign exchange, which a domestic financial inter-
mediary cannot, in effect, pass on in Ecuador. Moreover, the compensating
balances COFIEC was required to keep with foreign banks in order to carry
on the guarantee business had the advantage of further protecting it against
the foreign exchange risk.
4.22      In June 1970, prior to the devaluation of the sucre, all foreign
exchange funds held within Ecuador had to be turned over to the Central
Bank in exchange for local currency at S/ 21.54 per US dollar, and all for-
eign exchange funds held abroad by Ecuadorians had to be repatriated and
turned over to the Central Bank in exchange for local currency at SI 23.00
per US dollar. At that time, COFIEC had approximately US$1.0 million in
such funds, the greater part of which were held abroad. Since these funds
were stated in COFIEC's accounts at S/ 22.00 per US dollar (accounting rate),
COFIEC realized an actual net gain of S/ 340,000. At the time of devaluation
(August 16, 1970), COFIEC had foreign exchange assets in excess of foreign
exchange liabilities of US$286,000, which were both also stated in its ac-
counts at S/ 22.00 per US dollar. The restatement of the accounts at the
new exchange rate resulted in an unrealized net exchange gain of S/ 786,000.
The net gain will be realized gradually as COFIEC's borrowers repay their
loans and as COFIEC amortizes its own borrowing from abroad. Regarding the
effect of devaluation on COFIEC's receivables, borrowers should have no
difficulties in repaying their loans at the new exchange rate. Since COFIEC's
foreign exchange loans were being disbursed and repaid at the going free
market rate (about S/ 22 per US dollar), the impact of the devaluation on
its borrowers was not the full 38.9% increase in the cost of buying foreign
exchange (from S/ 18 to S/ 25 per US dollar) but only about 14% (from S/ 22
to S/ 25 per US dollar. Moreover, as the free rate was a fluctuating one,
Ecuadorian borrowers in foreign exchange are used to changes in the sucre
equivalents of their foreign exchange liabilities.



- 25 -
4.23      COFIEC's term debt to equity ratio has remained at 1.5 to 1 since
1968, which is well within the 4 to 1 limit provided for in its Policy
Statement. However, since COFIEC has engaged heavily in short-term opera-
tions, its total indebtedness, including its contingent liabilities, needs
to be considered. Its total debt to equity ratio increased from 4.6 to
1 at the end of 1968 to 6.1 at the end of 1969 and to 7.4 on June 30, 1970.
During negotiations, COFIEC concurred in the view that it had reached the
limit of prudent overall indebtedness for a development finance company at
its stage of development. Accordingly, COFIEC agreed to adjust its opera-
tions to remain within a 6 to 1 total debt to equity limit, which implies a
reduction of S/71 million in its portfolio. This will not be difficult for
COFIEC to accomplish since there is to be a further capital increase of SI
5.1 million in 1971, which, together with growth in retained earnings and
intended future increases in share capital, gives it further room for expan-
sion of business.
4.24      COFIEC's administrative and general expenses have been unusually
high in relative terms; they have ranged from 4.0% to 4.4% of average
total assets. If guarantees are included (and there is reason for doing
so in COFIEC), the ratio declines to 3.5% in 1968 and 3.0% in 1969, which
is still a high level. However, COFIEC has maintained a minimum staffing
and does not pay excessive salaries. To bring the proportion of administra-
tive expenses to a more reasonable level, COFIEC, therefore, needs to ex-
pand its business further (para. 4.38).
4.25      Reserves.  Under Ecuadorian law COFIEC must set aside 10% of net
profits in a legal reserve until it reaches 50% of paid-in share capital.
Moreover, the AID loan contract provides that a bad debt reserve must be
set up in yearly appropriations of not less than 2% of the total of COFIEC's
equity and loan investments of over one year which have been financed with
AID funds. On June 30, 1970, reserves and surplus amounted to about S/ 9.7
million. Of this amount, S/ 3.9 million was in a special reserve to cover
losses on loans and equity investments.
4.26      According to the Basic Monetary Law, COFIEC bears a contingent
risk on its loans made in Ecuador with the proceeds of borrowings repayable
in foreign exchange. Under the law, an Ecuadorian debtor may repay a for-
eign exchange loan to an Ecuadorian creditor in sucres at the legal parity
in effect at the time the loan was granted. (If the creditor is from
abroad, however, the loan is repayable in foreign exchange). Hence, COFIEC
is contingently exposed to foreign exchange losses on loans made by it with
the proceeds of the AID loan. Loans made with Eximbank funds have been
effected through an intermediary abroad and are, therefore, not subject to
the foreign exchange risk.
4.27      COFIEC bears two foreign exchange risks:  firstly, the present
risk (resulting from the August 1970 devaluation) of losing SI 7 per US
dollar on foreign exchange loans which borrowers could repay at S/ 18 per
IJS dollar, as against the present parity of S/ 25 per US dollar; and sec-
ondly, a future risk associated with any future devaluations of the sucre.



- 26 -
of course, the extent of any future risk cannot be quantified. COFIEC's
total exposure under the present risk is S/ 21 million (equivalent to
S/ 7 per US dollar on US$3 million of the AID loan).
4.28      COFIEC recognizes its foreign exchange risk, and agreed during
negotiations to maintain a provision for this purpose. For the known risk
resulting from the 1970 devaluation, the provision will be calculated by
multiplying the risk factor of S/ 7 per dollar by the debt service payments
for each ensuing year. The provision for the future risk will be calculated
by assuming a notional depreciation of the sucre at 10% a year, which will
be cumulative. During the period covered by COFIEC's business forecast
(1971-1975) the provisions proposed, in comparison with the surplus, will
be as follows (in S/ million):
1971     1972      1973      1974      1975
For present risk                 1.8       1.8      1.7       1.7       1.7
For future risk                  0.7       0.7      0.8       0.8       0.9
Total                       2.5      2.5       2.5       2.5       2.6
Surplus 1/                      12.0      16.9     22.5      28.4      34.8
4.29      According to a regulation recently adopted by the Monetary Board
(No. 555 of August 28, 1970) Ecuadorian financial intermediaries would no
longer have a foreign exchange risk when making loans within Ecuador denomi-
nated in foreign exchange, since the borrowers would have to repay in foreign
exchange, or in sucres at the parity in effect at the time of repayment. To
remove any possible conflict with the basic monetary law, the Government is
considering the enactment of the regulation into law, in suitable form.
4.30      Total surplus and reserves amounted to S/ 9.7 million on June 30,
1970. Leaving out the S/ 2.5 million needed to cover the exchange risk,
the remaining surplus and reserves of S/ 7.2 million represent 1.4% of the
total investment portfolio. If only the term loan and equity investment
portfolios are taken into account, the proportion covered is 8.1%. On the
other hand, these reserves and surplus cover only about one third of the
portfolio of questionable value of S/ 22.7 million (para. 4.20), indicating
that a further build-up of surplus is necessary. Such a build-up is pro-
jected by COFIEC, enabling its surplus and reserves to reach a reasonable
level by 1973, on the assumption that the proportion of the portfolio which
is of questionable value remains the same.

While the greater portion of these dividends was paid in stock, which limit-
ed the cash payout to 9.5% of total earnings since inception, their early
issuance (beginning in its second year of operations) has prevented COFIEC
from building up its reserves to a more satisfactory level. As mentioned
in the previous paragraph, however, COFIEC's reserves will reach a satisfac-
tory level in 1973; this is after assuming that COFIEC pays a 10% cash div-
idend annually beginning in 1971. Its dividend policy has been influenced
by the consideration that, in order to increase periodically its paid-in
capital (para. 4.39), COFIEC needs to establish a dividend record acceptable
to the market. This is understandable; however, the building up of protec-
tive reserves to an appropriate level relative to the size and status of its
portfolio is important, and hence its dividend policy needs careful watch-
ing.
4.32      Audit.  In addition to the verification of accounts performed by
the Legal Auditor (Comisario) and by the Internal Auditor, both of whom
are directly responsible to the Shareholders' Meeting, COFIEC's accounts
are subject to periodic review by the Superintendency of banks and the
company's financial statements are audited once a year by independent pub-
lic accountants, Deloitte, Plender, Haskings & Sells. The auditors' reports
do not satisfy the Bank's normal requirements for audit reports of devel-
opment finance companies. They are prepared in the so-called "short form",
are extremely brief, do not contain any details on COFIEC's equity invest-
ment, have no information on security pledged for COFIEC's financing, and
are not comparable on a year to year basis. Despite the deficiencies in
the auditor's reports, analysis of the company's operations and financial
statements by the Bank missions have shown the financial statements to be
satisfactory. The draft loan documents obligate COFIEC to have annual audits
made of its accounts in scope and detail satisfactory to the Bank.

Prospects
4.33       COFIEC's projected operations for the five year period 1971-75
(Annex 21) appear reasonable and attainable. They assume a rate of growth
in loan and guarantee approvals of 5% annually from the 1969 level. This
compares with actual annual growth of 46% from 1967 to 1969 and 63% in
1968-69.
4.34       Reflecting new long-term resources which COFIEC expects to have
available, the structure of its portfolio would change considerably (Annexes
22 and 23). While short-term financing decreases from about four-fifths
of the investment portfolio in 1969 to about one-third in 1975, medium- and
long-term financing increases from about one-fifth to somewhat less than
two-thirds, as shown below:
1969          1972          1975
Short-term  loans                      35%            18%           28%
Guarantees                             44%            23%            1%
Total short-term                  79%           41%           29%
Medium- and long-term loans            19%            50%           64%
Equity investments                      2%             9%            7%
Total                            100%          100%          100%
Equity investments through 1972 are forecast at an annual level of about
S/ 13 million, reflecting more of a promotional approach than up to 1970;
actual equity investments were SI 3.4 million in 1968 and SI 2.3 million
in 1969. The increase appears to be realistic, judging from the amount
of these investments made during the first iialf of 1970, which amounted to
S/ 6.5 million, or almost half of the investment projected for the whole
year. No equity investments are projected after 1972 since COFIEC considers
it prudent to keep the level of its equity investments at half its own net
worth, which is reached in that year.
4.35       COFIEC's projected balance sheet assumes a rapid increase in long-
term borrowing (from S/ 90.3 million in 1969 to S/ 331.5 million in 1972
and S/ 554.2 million in 1975), which COFIEC hopes to obtain through the
Bank/IDA in industrial and livestock loans, as well as from the Eximbank
(Annex 22).
4.36       Bond placements, a new resource for COFIEC 1/, are assumed at
SI 18 million in 1970, rising graudally to SI 36 million in 1975. The
1/   COFIEC has already obtained authorization from the Superintendency
of Banks for issuing the bonds.



- 29 -
bonds will have a maturity of five years and a coupon of 12%. Borrowers
will be given the bonds in lieu of cash. The securities would then be
sold in the market (mainly to insurance companies). Borrowers will pay
COFIEC a 2% interest-type commission. The bonds are expected to sell at
about par. Income from the bonds is taxed at a flat 8%; hence, bonds sold
at par will yield 11.4% compared with a current yield of 10.8% for govern-
ment bonds. Although COFIEC's bonds should be competitive with government
bonds, COFIEC's expectations regarding volume of placement, however, may
be somewhat optimistic. In 1971, credit is expected to be tight (para.
2.13). In addition, COFIEC has to establish a reputation and demand for
its bonds in a thin market.
4.37      COFIEC's projections show that the profit it has built up in
the past will be maintained throughout the forecast period. After-tax
earnings are expected to double from 1969 to 1975 (Annex 24) which would
permit COFIEC to build up its protective reserves to reasonable levels.
Excluding the provision for exchange risk, surplus and reserves are
projected to rise from 1.7% of the total portfolio (including contingent
liabilities) in 1969 to 7.0% in 1975, or from 8.3% of term loan and
equity investment portfolio in 1969 to 10.0% in 1975. The dividend pay-out
ratio is the decline from 65% (including stock dividends) in 1969 to 44%
(all in cash) in 1975.
4.38      The increased level of business projected would also permit
COFIEC to reduce the proportion of administrative expenses to average
total assets from 4.0% in 1969 to 3.5% in 1975. This high proportion for
administrative expenses is based on COFIEC's projections which assume that
salaries, fees and fringe benefits will increase by 157% from 1969 to 1975
while total business will increase by 74%. This assumption appears un-
realistic. Moreover, the projected administrative expenses include a
large increase in depreciation charges since COFIEC contemplates the con-
struction of a new building. However, since COFIEC will occupy only 20%
of the space and rent out the rest, only 20% of the depreciation charges
projected should be applied to COFIEC administrative expenses for calculat-
ing the ratio. Under more realistic assumptions (taking only 20% of the
depreciation charges and assuming that salaries, fees and fringe benefits
will increase at the same rate as the level of business) the ratio of
administrative expenses to average total assets would decline from 4.0%
in 1969 to 2.6% in 1975; and, including guarantees in total assets (para.
4.24), from 3.0% in 1969 to 2.5% in 1975. While the ratio is still some-
what high, it reflects the fact that COFIEC is still in an initial period
in which it needs to build up staff to improve its appraisal and follow-up
procedures.
4.39      COFIEC's projections show that the total debt to equity ratio
(including contingent liabilities) will not exceed the 6 to 1 ratio agreed
to during negotiations (para. 4.23).  However, its long term debt to
equity ratio would, in 1973, 1974 and 1975, exceed the 4 to 1 limit
specified by its policy statement and in the draft loan documents.  To



- 30 -
stay within the long term indebtedness limitation, COFIEC would have to
increase its paid-in capital by S/ 9.0 million in 1973, SI 11.7 million
in 1974 and S/ 9.6 million in 1975, equivalent to a yearly increase of
about 12%. COFIEC's management is aware of the need for further capital
increases to support expanding operations, and does not consider that
such increases would be difficult to achieve in view of the moderate
amounts and of COFIEC's record of capital increases in the past.
4.40      COFIEC's financial projections indicate a total debt-service
coverage above 2.2 times throughout the forecast period. This coverage
is satisfactory; it remains satisfactory for the life of the proposed loan.
Conclusions
4.41      In four-and-a-half years of operations, COFIEC has emerged as
an accepted member of the financial community in Ecuador. Its shareholders
include the most important commercial institutions in Ecuador, as well as
foreign commercial banks, ADELA and IFC. Its Board of Directors is com-
posed of prominent and influential businessmen and its management is com-
petent and well-known to the Bank Group.
4.42      Despite weaknesses in appraisal and follow-up procedures, the
risk of poor investment decisions is low in view of the Board's and manage-
mnent's intimate knowledge of, and close association with the Company's
principal clients. However, in the light of the expected rapid increase
of business, appraisal and follow-up need to be put on a more organized
basis.
4.43      COFIEC has built up a portfolio of loans and equity investment
of fair quality and, in spite of high administrative costs, has achieved
a reasonable level of profitability. Its reserves are not high, and it
needs to give priority to building them up to higher levels.
4.44      Prospects for growing operations are good.  The proposed Bank
loan would enable COFIEC to convert itself more rapidly into a source of
term finance than it could do otherwise.
4.45      On balance, COFIEC is a sound company and a suitable recipient
for Bank funds.
V. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CFN AND COFIEC
5.01      Relations between CFN and COFIEC have been close and apparently
cordial. CFN subscribed the largest single portion of COFIEC's share
capital at the latter's inception. CFN's General Manager has been an
active member of COFIEC's Board of Directors from the start. Frequent



- 31 -
consultation and coordination between management and staffs takes place
on matters of common interest, such as the interest rate ceiling and
commissions applicable to industrial lending in Ecuador, large promotions,
borrowers in difficulty and general credit information on clients.
5.02      Although CFN and COFIEC are the only important sources of term
financing for industry in Ecuador, their operations have been more com-
plementary than competitive; they have, in fact, joined forces in finan-
cing a few projects. Thus far, aside from equity financing, in which
both companies still have small portfolios, CFN has engaged exclusively
in medium and long-term lending in sucres principally for fixed assets.
the other hand, COFIEC, given the relatively short-term nature of its
resource mix, has had to engage to a substantial degree in short-term
financing, and thus, to a large extent, in lending for working capital
purposes.
5.03      The proposed Bank loan would bring COFIEC increasingly into
term lending operations, which COFIEC desires. It would thus provide
for a degree of competition between the companies, but there is no reason
to believe that this would be harmful to either company, or to Ecuador.
VI. PROPOSED BANK LOAN
6.01      The Companies' 5-year forecasts of operations contemplate size-
able increases in their volumes of business, particularly in term lending.
This expectation appears reasonable and attainable, both in terms of levels
and growth rates. Underlying the Companies' expectations are the facts
that term financing for industry has been, and continues to be, in rela-
tively short supply in Ecuador and that opportunities exist for industrial
investment, mainly in the processing of agricultural raw materials, tex-
tiles, timber, livestock, fish products and tourism. Moreover, Ecuador
needs to diversify its economy and not all the capital required in this
process can be obtained from domestic savings. The Companies' forecasts,
therefore, presuppose substantial increases in external support to meet
their anticipated industrial financing commitments.
6.02      According to the Companies' forecasts, the projected fund avail-
ability and commitments for term financing to industry at the end of 1970
and over the period 1971-72 would be as shown in the table on the following
page.

The table shows that if the projected demand materializes, both CFN and
COFIEC would have cumulative shortfalls to meet commitments in 1971-72.
CFN's shortfall would be of the order of S/ 132 million(US$5.3 million
equivalent); COFIEC's, S/ 81 million (US$3.3 million equivalent); and the
combined shortfall, SI 213 million (US$8.6 million equivalent).
6.03      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be available to
finance the cost of goods and services required by productive private en-
terprises for carrying out specific investments projects. According to
the analysis of 319 loans approved by CFN since inception 1/, 64% of the
total (by value) was used for the acquisition of machinery and equipment
(Annex 5, page 2, breakdown by end use). On the assumption that an equal
proportion of CFN's and COFIEC's projected industrial medium and long-
term commitments will be needed for the same purpose, CFN's and COFIEC's
shortfalls for this type of financing would be as follows (in S/ mil-
lion):

S/ 108 million (US$4.4 million equivalent); COFIEC's, SI 83 million
(US$3.4 million equivalent); and the combined shortfall, S/ 191 million
(US$7.8 million equivalent).

- 34 -
6.04      In assessing the shortfalls of CFN and COFIEC the following
additional factors need to be considered. Among the projected resources
of both companies are sizeable bond flotations (totalling S/ 94 million).
These flotations may not materialize to the extent expected because the
bonds will have to compete in a thin market with price-guaranteed Govern-
ment bonds. Should this be the case, the shortfalls will be correspond-
ingly greater. On the other hand, it is necessary to discount the short-
falls for possible overlap between the operations forecasted by CFN and
COFIEC. On balance, it appears that US$8 million is a fair estimate of
the aggregate shortfall until about the end of 1972. A schedule of esti-
mated disbursements under the proposed loan is given in Annex 25.
6.05      The proposed Bank loan will be granted to the Government of
Ecuador. As in the case of the Bank/IDA livestock development loans, the
Government would assume the foreign exchange risk and would make the funds
available to CFN and COFIEC in sucres. CFN and COFIEC will receive the
funds from the Central Bank of Ecuador at 8-1/4% p.a. (representing the
7-1/4% Bank rate and a 1%" commission for the Central Bank). As they re-
lend at 12% p.a. CFN and COFIEC will have a spread of 3-3/4%, compared
with the minimum spread of 3% specified in the loan documents.
6.06      Since the use of the Bank loan on a first-come-first-served
basis might entail a somewhat acute competition between CFN and COFIEC,
prior allocation was considered advisable. This assures to each a por-
tion of the loan, which each can commit to projects after deliberate
study and careful selection among the best of them. It was agreed during
negotiations that the loan will be pre-allocated in amounts of US$4 mil-
lion to each comapny. As COFIEC's gap in resources is somewhat smaller
than CFN's, COFIEC may take some months longer than CFN to commit the
funds. "Free limits" of US$100,000 and "aggregate free limits" of US$1.3
million for each company were also agreed to during negotiations. This
means that projects totalling at least slightly over two-thirds of the loan
will be subject to prior review by the Bank. The loan documents provide
that the conditions of effectiveness and the events of default can, if neces-
sary, be applied separately to the two companies.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Development of the industrial sector is needed as an important
element of Ecuador's overall economic development and diversification.
Increased term financing is required to stimulate such development; and
foreign credits are needed to meet the gap between the capital required
for this purpose and domestic savings available.
7.02      In view of the important and increasing contribution they are
making to the development of private productive enterprise in Ecuador,
their competent managements, their satisfactory operational standards
and their generally sound portfolios, CFN and COFIEC may be considered
creditworthy borrowers and suitable recipients for Bank funds.



- 35 -
7.03      A loan of US$8 million is recommended.  The loan will be suf-
ficient to cover CFN's and COFIEC's shortfalls in meeting the financing
requirements for the import component of the cost of private productive
projects, over a period of about two years. The terms of the loan should
be those normally applied to lending to development finance companies,
including the standard commitment charge and a flexible amortization
schedule. In addition, as agreed during negotiations, the Bank's prior
approval will be required for all projects submitted by CFN and COFIEC
calling for US$100,000 or more of the loan; and the aggregate free limit
for projects not requiring prior approval will be US$1.3 million for each
company.

ANNEX 3
Page 1
COPIISION DE VALORES - CORPORACION FINaNCIERA NACIONAL
Declaration of Policies and Procedures
The Board of Directors of the Comision de Valores - Corporaci6n
Financiera Nacional (the Corporation), by virtue of the powers conferred
upon it by its enabling legislation, establishes the following policies
and procedures which will guide the financial activities and investments
of the Cornoration.
I.     Objectives
1) The fundamental objective of the Corporation will be to assist
in the economic development of the country by providing finan-
cial assistance to productive enterprises of the private sector
and by supporting economic infrastructure projects of the
public sector. In addition, the Corporation will stimulate
the development of the capital market as an instrument for
channelling private savings into productive activities.
II.    Investment Policies
2) The Corporation will base its investment decisions on sound
economic and financial criteria and will finance only
technically viable enterprises with good prospect of economic
and financial return.
3) Although its operations will be oriented principally to the
financing of the manufacturing sector, the company may also
finance fisheries, tourism and agro-industrial projects.
In no case will the company finance commercial activities or
real estate operations.
4)  The Corporation will finance the establishment or expansion
of enterprises when these are, or can reasonably be expected
to be, adequately organized and managed.
5) In selecting projects, the Corporation will take into account
the general economic development plans and policies of the
country. Consequently, priority will be given to projects
which have some of the following features: use of national
raw materials; significant use of manpower; saving of
foreign exchange through import substitution; production of
goods to meet national or foreign demand; participation of
a significant number of shareholders; possibilities for
training personnel in technical and management matters; or
the possibility of development of related industries.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
In harmony with the foregoing, the Corporation will avoid
financing enterprises which depend on excessive governmental
protection for their profitability, resulting in a negative
economic benefit for the country and consequently leading
to an uneconomic utilization of mtional resources.
6) When a project conforms to the technical, economic and
financial criteria for an investment by the Corporation and
is of particular importance for the economic development of
the country, but does not arouse sufficient interest in the
private sector, the Corporation may undertake it, even if
it involves 100% financing by the Corporation. However, the
aim of the Corporation, as in the case of normal investments,
will be to sell its participation when the project has reached
an adequate development and when circumstances permit it to
do so on satisfactory terms.
7)  In the case of projects which require large investments, the
Corporation will seek financial cooperation from other entities,
whether national, international or foreign.
III. Type of Financing
8) The Corporation will provide the following types of financing:
(a) medium and long-term loans;
(b) investment in share capital by direct participation,
purchase options, underwritings, etc.;
(c) guarantees and avals related to the purchase of
machinery and/or equipment;
(d) rediscounting of loans granted by private banks, the
National Development Bank and private financial
corporations to small industries in amounts up to
S/ 200,000; and
(e)  other financial operations which are in accordance with
the objectives and policies of the Corporation.
9)  The Corporation's loans will be principally for the purchase or
construction of fixed assets. Notwithstanding, the Corporation
may also finance technical assistance and permanent working
capital and, exceptionally, seasonal working capital.
10) With its special resources for this purpose, the Corporation
shall finance pre-investment studies of projects of the public
or private sectors, or of those which can be carried out by
the Corporation itself.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
IV.    Diversification of Investments
11) With the purpose of maintaining a reasonable level of risk,
the Corporation will diversify its investments.
12) The Corporationa normally will not grant to the same enterprise
loans for an amount greater than S/ 20 million. For exceptional
projects, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, the
Corporation may grant loans for larger amounts; but in no
case will the total financing to one enterprise, in whatever
form, including loans, participation in share capital, guarantees
or avals, or a combination thereof, exceed an amount equivalent
to 15% of the Corporation's paid-in capital and free reserves.
On the other hand, the Corporation will not provide firancial
assistance for amounts smaller than S/ 200,000 except in the
case of the rediscounts mentioned in sub-paragraph (d) of
Section 8, or in the case of pre-investment studies.
13) The Corporation will limit its investment in the share capital
of a single enterprise to an amount equivalent to 10% of the
Corporation's paid-in capital and its free reserves. The
Corporation will also limit the total amount of its investments
in the share capital of enterprises to the amount of its own
paid-in capital and free reserves.
V.     Turnover of Investments
14) As the projects in which the Corporation holds shares reach an
adequate state of development, and with the double purpose of
freeing resources for new financing and of stimulating widespread
ownership of securities, the Corporation will sell its share-
holdings, when it can do so on satisfactory terms. In the
sale of its investments, the Corporation will not only take
into account its own interests but also those of the other
shareholders and of the enterprises themselves.
VI.    Relations with Enterprises Financed
15) The Corporation does not intend to acquire control of the enter-
prises it finances. Consequently, the Corporation normally
will not take up more than 25% of the share capital of the
enterprise financed, except in the case of projects undertaken
by the Corporation in accordance with the stipulations of
point 6 of this Declaration, or as a result of an underwriting
undertaken with the expectation that the shares remaining for
its account will not exceed the said limit. Notwithstanding,
in cases of jeopardy, the Corporation may take whatever measures
it deems necessary to protect its interests.
16) In accordance with usual banking practice, the Corporation will
require its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate



ANNEX 3
Page 4
security in its favor; to keep accounting records which reflect
their financial situation in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles; and to supply the Corporation with
whatever information it may reasonable require to establish the
status of their operations and financial situation. The
Corporation will take the right to inspect the enterprises it
finances as well as their accounting records.
17) All information furnished to the Corporation by applicants or
clients will be treated by it as strictly confidential.
VII.   Financial Practices
18) The Corporation will conduct its operations in such a manner
as to assure the maintenance of the value of its capital and
of adequate liquidity. The Corporation will charge interest,
fees and commissions for its financing and services in such
a way that they yield an adequate return on the capital employed.
19) The Corporation will maintain reserves in accordance with
sound financial practice. These reserves will be sufficient
to cover the risk of loss associated with the size of its
portfolio and the status of the projects financed.
20) The Corporation will maintain a reasonable level of administra-
tive expenses, consistant with the scope and volume of its
operations.
21) The Corporation considers that the total of its liabilities,
including guarantees and avals, in whatever form should maintain
an adequate relationship with its own capital and free reserves.
Consequently, the ratio of liabilities to capital and reserves
will not exceed 4:l.
VIII. Procedures
22)  The Corporation shall maintain the following funds, each with
separate accounting and independent resources:
(a) Fund for Industrial Investments;
(b) Fund for Small Industry; and
(c) Fund for Pre-investment.
23) In accordance with its investment policies and to protect its
resources, the Corporation, prior to any financing, shall
evaluate projects in relation to the market, technical and
financial feasibility and the economic benefit for the
country.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
24)  The Cornoration will not limit itself to evaluating projects
which are presented for its consideration. The Corporation,
by itself or with the help of consultants when circumstances
require it, will identify, study and promote industrial, agro-
industrial, fishery and tourism projects of significant
benefit for the economy of the country.
25) Procedurally, with respect to matters involving its Directors,
officials and employees, the Corporation will abide by the
stipulations of Article 50 of its Enabling Law.
26) The Corporation will maintain accounting and statistical
records which accurately reflect its operations and financial
status in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and practices. The Corporation will employ the
services of a firm of independent auditors of recognized
technical and professional competence, who will examine
annually the accounts of the Corporation and give an opinion
on the financial statements of the institution.
27) The Corporation will maintain a balanced technical and manage-
ment organization, with high level personnel which will enable
it to carry out market, technical, economic and financial
evaluations of the projects it finances, as well as to follow
up its investments.
28) As part of its follow-up operations, the Corporation, when it
deems it necessary and when personnel availability permits it,
will provide technical assistance to borrowing enterprises
through the preparation of problem identification and guidance
reports, so that these enterprises may contract the specialized
technical assistance that may be necessary.
