CONAKRY PORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The proposed project would be the Bank Group's first port project in
Guinea. The Bank Group has previously assisted the port sector indirectly
through an Engineering Loan (SI-GUI) and two loans (577-GUI and 766-GUI) for
the Boke Bauxite Project which included construction of a new port at Kamsar,
and related rail transport and new town infrastructure.
1.02     The proposed project would meet the most urgent investment needs of
the Port of Conakry. It would eliminate constraints that would cause the Port
to be a bottleneck to economic development of the country through:  (a) reha-
bilitation and replacement of existing port infrastructure and equipment; and
(b) establishment of an autonomous and well-functioning port authority for the
Port of Conakry. The Association had viewed the latter measure as a sine qua
non of possible IDA financing for the project. The Government responded
favorably and took the necessary steps in a timely manner (para 3.08). The
Project is expected to improve productivity as well as financial and manage-
ment performance of the Port, and reduce substantially ocean freight costs on
the country's agricultural exports and general cargo imports. More generally,
it would facilitate increased production and economic development of the
country by providing sufficient, low-cost port capacity for the country's
foreign trade. It would be financed in parallel with funding to be provided
by the AfDB and the Federal Republic of Germany (KfW and GTZ).
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General
2.01     Guinea encompasses an area of some 246,000 km2 and has a population
of about 5.7 million growing at a high 2.9% a year. It is potentially one of
the richest countries of West Africa with vast mining and hydro-electric power
resources, and with soils and a climate favoring the development of a wide
range of agricultural products. Mineral deposits include bauxite, of which
Guinea has about 29% of the world's known reserves (6.5 billion tons), high
grade iron ore (1.5 billion tons) as well as gold and diamonds. There are
also good geological prospects for uranium and offshore oil.
.
2.02     Despite its potential, Guinea's GNP per capita in 1980 was only
US$290 equivalent; it grew at 0.6% a year between 1970 and 1980, while GDP
grew at 3.6% a year over the same period. Faced with a sharp decline in
agricultural production over the last two decades since gaining independence



- 2 -
in 1958, the Government has now placed high priority on the regeneration of
the rural sector. At the same time, the Government is emphasizing transport
sector development which had been adversely affected by overall economic
stagnation.
B.  Infrastructure
2.03     At Independence, Guinea was well-endowed with an extensive road and
rail network and with a port facility at Conakry. In the years immediately
following, major additions were made to rail and port infrastructure, mainly
to carry the rapidly developing bauxite and alumina traffic. Three enclave
rail lines and dedicated port facilities at Kamsar and ore handling berths at
Conakry were built mainly in the 1960s. (Map IBRD 16680).
2.04     At present the Guinean transport infrastructure comprises:
-   14,000 km of primary and secondary roads, of which 1,200 km are
paved;
-   the public rail line from Conakry to Kankan (662 km);
-   the three enclave rail lines - Conakry-Fria (alumina), Conakry-
Kindia (bauxite) and Sanagredi-Kamsar bauxite);
-   deep water port facilities at Kamsar and Conakry; and
-   the main international airport at Conakry, with secondary air-
ports at Kankan and Faranah which have paved runways and at seven
other regional centers which have laterite surfaced runways.
Despite this wealth of transport infrastructure, poor management, inadequate
maintenance and insufficient capital funding have caused extensive deterio-
ration of all but a small proportion of the facilities and infrastructure.
2.05     The Guinean road system carries the bulk of the internal commodity
traffic outside the enclave mining sector. Traffic volumes on the main roads
leading out of Conakry average 2000 vpd, the bulk of which are goods transport
vehicles.  The sorry state of the pubLic rail line and the unreliability of
its services have contributed to its decline as a major transport mode, and
little, if any, competition exists be-twen road and rail. The air transport
network developed by the national airline, Air Guinee, carries about 120,000
passengers a year and plays a relatively important role in passenger trans-
port. The Port of Conakry serves as -the country's main maritime gateway, with
Kamsar only handling bauxite exports from the Boke mines. A small secondary
port at Benty has declined in importance as a banana port and now handles
insignificant domestic coastal traffic.



-
C. Management, Planning and Coordination
2.06     Sector management, planning and coordination have been weak and with
a lack of resources for maintenance have contributed largely to the deteriora-
tion of transport infrastructure. Extensive rehabilitation and maintenance of
the primary and secondary road network was begun under the IDA-financed First
Highway Project and has continued under the Second Project (see para 2.08).
Despite the progress achieved, substantial improvements are still needed and
form the backbone of the Government's investment strategy for the roads sub-
sector. The road transport industry is hampered by lack of foreign exchange
but nevertheless manages to carry the traffic. As infrastructure maintenance
is improved further, Guinea's road system should have little difficulty coping
with the transport demand in the main agricultural centers of the country.
2.07     Transport planning and coordination are at very rudimentary stages.
Overall responsibility lies with the Ministry of Transport, but lack of com-
petent personnel, non-existent data and inadequate funds in the past have
resulted in little planning. Following the planning activities under the
Second Highway Project, the Government has requested assistance in this area,
and a transport planning component will be considered under the proposed Third
Highway Project. Development of a national transport plan is particularly
timely as extensive investments are now being proposed to rehabilitate the
public rail line and upgrade services. Given the low traffic volumes, the
economic wisdom of such major capital spending is questionable and coordi-
nation with other modal choices therefore vital. Development of air transport
as a viable alternative for long distance passenger transport also deserves
study.
D. Bank Assistance in the Transport Sector
2.08     The Bank Group has been the principal source of external financing
for transport development. Since 1966, it has made three loans and three
credits. The former financed the mining town site and related port and rail
infrastructure for the export of bauxite from the mining development at
Boke. The latter have funded the First and still ongoing Second Highway
projects. The two highway projects financed extensive road rehabilitation and
maintenance programs and supported the basic sector strategy in this regard.
The First Highway Project was completed satisfactorily in 1980. The second
had experienced some difficulties due to poor project management and excessive
Government interference. However, these difficulties have been ironed out and
the project is expected to be completed in mid-1983. A Third Highway Project
involving further road maintenance and some reconstruction is now under
discussion.

III. THE PORT OF CONAKRY
A. Port Facilities & Operations
3.01     The Port of Conakry is located on the northern coast of Tombo Island
where the average tidal range is 3.3m. It is protected against swells by the
Island of Kassa and two rubble mound island breakwaters (Map IBRD 16681). In
spite of the self-flushing function of the breakwaters and north groyne, cur-
rents in the northerly direction cause some silt to deposit in the Port.
Entry to the Port is from the south, through a 8.5m deep dredged channel 5 km
long. The channel is provided with marker buoys; however, due to poor
maintenance of buoys and beacons, night-time navigation is restricted.
Vessels of up to 40,000 dwt currently use the Port.
3.02     The Port of Conakry (Map IBRI) 16682R) has two bulk-handling facil-
ities for exports, one for FRIGUIA (alumina) and the other for OBEKA
(bauxite). Located between these facilities are four general cargo berths,
and facilities for fruit handling, small coastal vessels, fishing vessels and
work boats. Bulk petroleum products are handled next to the bauxite berth.
The total surface area occupied by the Port is about 38 ha, of which about
3.6 ha is covered storage area comprising the main transit sheds behind the
general cargo berths. A clinker unloading and storage facility is under
construction. During appraisal of the project, the proposed layout of this
facility was examined and some modifications agreed between the Government and
the Association, so that its construction would not hinder rational function-
ing of the Port.
3.03     A large part of the port infrastructure has deteriorated.  Some
facilities present potential hazards and need to be partially demolished.
Others are in poor condition and inhibit efficient operations. General cargo
aprons have settled in places due to gaps in the underwater quay wall blocks.
3.04     Cargo handling equipment is of relatively recent vintage, but inade-
quate maintenance, compounded by rundown workshops and generally poor
operating conditions have substantially shortened its useful life. Floating
craft are in poor condition. Harbor tugs are operating well beyond their
useful lives and risk of total breakdown is high. Beaconage and buoyage of
the entrance channel are also inadequately maintained.
3.05     Hitherto, responsibilities for port operations were shared among four
organizations. The Office Maritime wELs responsible for beaconage and buoyage,
harbor master services, maintenance of infrastructure and dredging. The
Entreprise Nationale de Transit et de Transport (ENTRAT) was responsible for
stevedoring and general cargo transit operations. The Societe Navale Guineene
(SNG) was responsible for tugboat operations, while a fourth entity, the
Administration Gen6rale handled general administrative functions.  This
fragmentation of operational responsibility, coupled with deteriorating
facilities and equipment, has resulted in high berth occupancy for general
cargo (80%), long ship turnaround times (seven days on average), low
productivity (less than 200/tons/day of general cargo unloaded), high



pilferage and poor security.  Freight rates to Conakry are -_-seéquently much
higher than to neighboring West African ports and some conference lines have
practically abandoned servicing Conakry due to the high costs of ship waiting
and cargo losses involved.
B. Traffic - Past and Present
3.06     Port traffic data and foreign trade statistics are less detailed than
would be desirable and sometimes inconsistent and not comparable. The compo-
site picture that emerges from analysis is that total traffic did not change
much during 1975-1980 and hovered around 3.0 million tons, of which about 10%
was general cargo. Substantial year-to-year fluctuations and declining
bauxite exports were recorded (see Table 3.1 below). Containerization is low
but increasing rapidly. Information on vessels calling at the Port in 1981
indicates that total cargo tonnage declined about 13% due to a fall in dry
bulk exports. However, general cargo tonnage increased about 9%.

vessels, the remainder being carried by bulk vessels (see para 5.02). This
figure is lower than that indicated by the Port's commodity statistics.
3.07     The total number of vessels calling at the Port in 1981 was about
382, of which 204 were general cargo vessels and 160 bulk carriers or
tankers. The general cargo vessels averaged 3,500 grt and carried an average
load of 1,400 tons. Bulk carriers averaged 14,000 grt and carried 16,000 ton
loads.



C. Port Organization
3.08     Faced with deteriorating facilities and operations, the Government
sought IDA and German technical assistance in '981 to prepare project feasi-
billty anad engineering studies and a master plan for port development. With
GT7Z and Kf-W financing, a consultant (Lackner & Partners) was selected.  As a
-esult of these studi'es,  it was proposed that port activities be organized
and the Port Authoritv be created with unique and sole responsibility in place
of the existing fragmentation. Draft Port Statutes were reviewed during
appraisal and commented in extenso by the Association and KfW.  With the
Association's encouragement, the new Port Authority of Conakry (Port Autonome
de Conakry - PAC) was formally created by Decree No. 050/PRG/82 of June 22,
1982. Its organizational structure (Chart 1) and statutes meet satisfactorily
the objectives of financial and operational autonomy.
3.09     As a public enterprise under applicable Guinean legislation, PAC is
governed by a twelve-man Board (Conseil du Port), which was set up by a decree
of August 23, 1982.  It consists of' the Minister of' Transport as Chairman,
Minister of Finance as Vice-Chairman, the Ministers of International Coopera-
tion and Commerce, a representative of the Planning Ministries, the general
managers of the Merchant Marine, SNG and ENTRAT (which would both conserve
functions not transferred to PAC -- nanely, shipping agency and transit and
transport), the Secretary General of the labor syndicate, the general managers
of OBEKA and FRIGUIA (i.e., the main port users) and the general manager of
PAC.
3.10     PAC effectively started functioning on September 1, 1982.  The
general manager and department heads and the accountant were nominated by
decree on August 21, 1982. Their qualifications and experience are accept-
able.  During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would at all
times maintain suitably qualified and experienced managers in key operating
positions and would consult the Association Drior to making any changes.  To
assist PAC management in its early years and to help train the management
cadre, technical advisers would be employed in key positions (paras. 4.02 and
4.04). Terms of reference for these advisers were prepared during appraisal
and agreed with the Government. (See Project File: Report of Prof. Mangels,
Port Operations Consultant.)
D.  Staffing and Training
3. 1     The various Dort entities had a total staf'f of about 1,550, of which
theoretically about 1,350 would be transferred to PAC.  However, this number
is excessive given present traffic volumes. PAC management has accepted a
consultant proposal under which PAC would only take on its permanent payroll
about half the currently employed stevedores and longshoremen, allowing for
about 10 permanent gangs between two shifts (i.e., about 300 workers).  The
remaining dock workers (about 400) would be given dock-labor cards which would
entitle them on a first-cocme, first-served basis for any of the supplementary
labor needs and a guaranteed minimum number of work days provided certain



- 7 -
criteria (attendance, diligence, experience, etc.,) were met. Consultants
have assisted PAC in defining selection criteria to ensure reductions of at
least 10% in other areas of the organization. PAC management has set a target
staffing level of around 1,100. Staff training needs would be addressed by
the training adviser under the proposed project. Programs would be developed
at various staff levels and would be carried out by the technical advisers to
department managers as well as by other ad hoc short-term experts financed
under the proposed project (para 4.04).
E. Accounting, Budgeting, Auditing and Insurance
3.12     The level of accounting information maintained by the prior organiza-
tions ranges from rudimentary to non-existent. A modern accounting system
based on generally accepted accounting principles and current practice in
other West African and European ports needs to be set up. In view of the
urgency of setting up a simple, yet effective system, a consultant has been
hired under GTZ financing. In order to ensure adequate accounting and finan-
cial reporting for the project, it was agreed during negotiations that appro-
priate accounting and control systems would be introduced in the Port not
later than December 31, 1983. If additional short-term consultant assistance
is needed to reinforce PAC's accounting department and complement the GTZ-
financed consultant, it should be provided under IDA funds.
3.13     The Guinean accounting system for state enterprises involves payment
by the enterprises of all their cash flow to the Treasury at the end of each
year. As this system would be counterproductive to achieving the Port's
financial autonomy and ensuring financial discipline, PAC statutes stipulate
inter alia that the Port will not pay depreciation allowances to the State.
This principle was confirmed at negotiations (see also para. 6.10).
3.14     Annual budgets will be prepared by PAC and sent to its Board for
approval at least three months before the end of the previous fiscal year. As
a condition of the proposed Credit, during the project implementation period
PAC will send the draft budget for comment by the Association.
3.15     As a condition of the proposed Credit, PAC will also be required to
carry out annual financial audits by independent auditors acceptable to the
Association. Under PAC Statutes, an internal auditing and control group would
also be set up at the General Manager's level.
3.16     Insurance coverage in Guinea, according to Guinea's insurance legis-
lation, is handled through Societe Nationale d'Assurance et de Reassurences
(SNAR), the state insurance agency which has the monopoly of insurance in
Guinea. This agency makes arrangements for insurance in foreign exchanges.
During negotiations PAC confirmed that it would pay SNAR the insurance pre-
miums in foreign exchange and that SNAR would reinsure PAC's fixed assets
against 100% of losses with one of their foreign collaborators. Claims would
be paid in foreign exchange.

F.  Tariffs
3.17     PAC's tariffs need substantial restructuring.  Although only very
rough estimates of costs by profit and cost centers can be obtained at
present, this meagre information indicates that a large part if not all of
PAC's services are underpriced. The predecessor maritime agency did not make
allowance for depreciation of fixed assets, and inadequate maintenance prac-
tices led to substantial underrecording of the true costs of running the
Port. Consequently, port tariffs bore little relation to costs.
3.18     A first step in tariff revision has been taken, with a complete re-
valuation of all existing fixed assets as of June 30, 1982. The second step
in reviewing PAC's tariff structure is now being undertaken by the consultants
and a report and recommendations are expected by mid-1983, so that the new
structure of port tariffs could be put into effect January 1, 1984. In the
meanwhile, an increase in PAC tariffs effective no later than July 1, 1983 is
needed to ensure an increase in PAC operating revenues of 6% for 1983, so that
the present (and albeit unsatisfactory) tariff structure can at least partly
keep pace with inflation since the last increase enacted in late 1980.  This
stop-gap increase will need to be complemented by a general revision in the
PAC tariff structure effective January 1, 1984 so that a further increase of
30% in PAC's 1984 operating revenues is obtained (see paras. 6.06 and 6.07).
During negotiations, following a July 1, 1983 tariff increase, PAC agreed to
approve and publiJ'  the 1984 general tariff revision and increase, acceptable
to IDA, before December 15, 1983. Also the Government confirmed to the
Association PAC's statutory authority to set tariffs at levels satisfactory to
the Association and PAC confirmed its intention to apply its tariff schedule
across the board, without the current practice of de facto exemptions and
exceptional treatment.
3.19     A major issue in the PAC's tariff structure concerns the so-called
"container surcharge" of about US$750 levied on each and every container
handled at the Port.  This surcharge, payable only in foreign currency, was
ostensibly imposed to permit purchase of container handling equipment. It has
only been partially applied. The port consultants have voiced strong reserva-
tions about the wisdom of such an excessive tariff on containers at a time
when ports are offering generous incentives for containerization. The port
management endorses the Consultant's recommendation. Consequently, this
container surcharge will be removed at the same time as a new tariff structure
is put into effect in 1984.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Concept
4.01     The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  to improve substantially productivity and financial and management
performance of the Port;



- 9 -
(b) to reduce cargo losses through pilferage and poor handling; and
(c) to thereby reduce ocean freight costs for Guinea's imports and
exports.
4.02     To achieve these objectives, the project concept aims at:
(a) rehabilitation of existing and construction of new infrastructure;
(b) renewal of cargo-handling equipment and floating craft;
(c) establishment of an independent port authority with financial and
managerial autonomy; and
(d) training and technical assistance for project execution and
achievement of the productivity targets.
4.03     The proposed project comprises the medium-term investment plan for
the Port. The Consultants, who prepared the feasibility and engineering
studies (para 3.08), have developed a long-term Master Plan which will be
complemented by soils investigations and the preliminary design of a closure
structure (Map IBRD 16681) carried out under the proposed project. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that PAC will consult the Association
prior to undertaking or authorizing significant deviations from the Master
Plan. The proposed project concept ensures that future development of the
Port could not be compromised nor alternatives foreclosed by the proposed
rehabilitation program.
B. Project Description
4.04     The principal components of the proposed project are:
(a) Civil Works
(i)   rehabilitation of general cargo transit sheds, repair of general
cargo quays, aprons and underwater surfaces, repair of existing
workshops, drainage system, rail sidings and roads, buoys and
beacons, and repair and construction of a container storage area,
construction of a rail siding and other minor buildings, demoli-
tion of some structurally unsafe buildings and erection of fenc-
ing;
(ii)   construction of housing for expatriate technical assistance
staff; and
(iii)   construction of a new administration building.

(b) Equipment
(i)   procurement of cargo-handcling equipment including forklifts,
cranes and trailers;
(ii)   purchase of machines, tools and vehicles including trucks,
tractor trailers, cars;
(iii)   repair of existing equipment;
(iv)   procurement of two harbor tugs, a pilot boat and a mooring boat;
and
(v)   procurement of micro-computers and associated software.
(c) Technical Assistance and Consulting Services
(i)   provision of long-term experts (3-4 years) to assist the General
Manager, Technical Director, Port Captain, the heads of material
handling, maintenance of equipment and infrastructure, and the
Financial Director (a total of 225 man-months);
(ii)   provision of short-term experts (6-9 months) to assist in
developing accounting, financial and data processing systems,
tariff and rate setting, and inventory control (a total of 39
man-months); and
(iii)   provision of consultant services for project supervision,
evaluation of warehousing needs outside the Port, study of
closure structure and other miscellaneous tasks (a total of 165
man-months).
C. Cost Estimates
4.05     The total estimated cost of the project is about US$38.0 million
equivalent (excluding interest during construction), with a foreign exchange
component of about US$35.7 million equivalent. Cost estimates do not include
taxes and duties, from which the project would be exempt, but include
refinancing of the PPF advance. Details are to be found in Table 1
(appended), and are summarized in Table 4.1:

4.06     Cost estimates for civil works are based on final engineering designs.
For civil works, floating craft, cargo-handling equipment and vehicles, costs
were obtained from the preliminary bid evaluations. Technical assistance of
264 man-months is costed at US$12,000 per man-month, which is reasonable in
light of current living conditions and costs in Guinea. Consultant services
for project supervision and various studies are estimated at 165 man-months at
US$12,800 per man-month including per diem, transportation and other reimburs-
able items. All costs are based on January 1983 prices and include price
escalation and physical contingencies over the project period. Given the
nature of rehabilitation works and difficulty in predicting the extent of
deterioration until part of the existing structures or equipment is dis-
mantled, a 20% physical contingency was assumed for these works. For new con-
struction and equipment, physical contigencies were assumed at 10%. Price
contigencies have been calculated for local costs at 10% and foreign costs at
8% for 1982, 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985, and 6% for 1986-1988
annually.
4.07     The Conakry Port Project was the first port project tendered inter-
nationally in Guinea in recent years. It was therefore difficult to determine
the bidding pattern of international contractors. For this reason tenders
were received in January, prior to negotiations, and project costs were
adjusted accordingly.
D. Project Financing
4.08     The financing plan for the project is summarized in Table 4.2.

The proposed IDA Credit, GTZ Grant, KfW Grant and AfDB Loan would covei the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the proposed project. PAC's internal cash
generation would cover local costs, interest during construction and provide
for necessary increases in working capital to ensure satisfactory port opera-
tions.  The Government would contribute 75 million sylis (US$3.3 million)
towards PAC's initial working capital which would be a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed Credit. The proposed IDA Credit of US$13.0 million
equivalent (SDR 12.1 million equivalent) would finance about 30% of the total
project costs (or about 34% of the capital investments); it would be onlent by
the Government to PAC at an interest rate of 13% over 20 years including a
four-year grace period. PAC would bear the exchange risk. The AfDB Loan is
expected to be made at 11.5% interest over 20 years including four years'
grace. The KfW Grant to the Government would be onlent to PAC interest free
during the construction phase and at 8% interest with repayments over 16 years
after project completion. The GTZ Grant would be passed on as a capital grant
to PAC. These onlending and working capital funding arrangements would be
incorporated into a Financing Agreement between the Government and PAC.
Execution of the Financing Agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
Agreement was obtained that, should PAC's internal cash generation be insuffi-
cient in any year to cover the estimated local costs of the proposed project,
the Government would take or authorize PAC to take such measures as are deemed
satisfactory by the Association to cover any subsequent funding gap.
E. Project Implementation
4.09     PAC will be responsible for project execution with the assistance of
qualified engineering consultants employed on terms and conditions judged
acceptable to the Association. Project implementation is expected to take
about five years and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1987 (Chart 2).
Quarterly progress reports would be submitted to the Association, the format
and contents of which would be agreed during supervision of the project. PAC
would also prepare a project completion report and provide such information as
may be reasonably requested by the Association for the post project perform-
ance audit.
4.10     Some of the equipment to be procured would be leased by PAC to ENTRAT
for use in the latter's transit, city warehousing and storage operations.
However, it should be a condition of the Project Agreement with PAC that
except for this equipment, no other equipment would leave the port compound.
Development of adequate port warehousing capacity is necessary to ensure that
port transit sheds are not used for long-term storage. To this end, at nego-
tiations, agreement was obtained that the Government and PAC would carry out a
study of warehousing capacity in the city (outside the Port) in order to
rationalize warehousing operations; the recommendations of the study should be
discussed with the Association no later than June 30, 1984, and the needed
actions implemented on an agreed timetable thereafter. Provision for con-
sultant services to carry out such a study is made in the project. In



- 14 -
addition, in order to ensure satisfactory lease arrangements for cargo-handl-
ing equipment purchased by PAC, PAC signed a contract with ENTRAT defining the
terms and conditions of such equipment leases.
4.11      Repairs to buoyage and beaconage would be financed under the pro-
ject. To ensure adequate maintenance of buoys and beacons, which would con-
tinue to be the responsibility of the Office Maritime, PAC has signed a
contract with the Office Maritime by which it would provide the maintenance
services reimbursable by PAC.
4.12      The Government has provided suitably serviced land for the construc-
tion of housing for the technical assistance experts. During negotiations it
was confirmed that the new administration building and the ambulance would be
reserved exclusively for use by PAC.
4.13      In order to ensure greater security in the port area and to substan-
tially reduce pilferage arising through unauthorized entry, the Government and
PAC should prepare and present not later than June 30, 1984, a plan of action
for review/comment by the Association, and implement the plan on an agreed
time schedule thereafter.
F. Procurement and Disbursement
4.14      The financing package is based on parallel financing by IDA and the
other co-lenders. Agreement was reached at appraisal that, in view of the
difficulties of obtaining firm cost estimates until after bid analysis, all
procurement for the main civil works and equipment contracts would follow the
Association's Guidelines under international competitive bidding. Contractors
for civil works were prequalified. Procurement of floating craft was on the
basis of performance specifications. Procurement of a computer system will be
on the terms of international competitive bidding under a single responsi-
bility contract including hardware, software and training. Draft bid docu-
ments for civil works and equipment were reviewed jointly by the co-financiers
and Government and PAC representatives in October 1982. Bids for both civil
works and equipment were received January 10, 1983, and have been analyzed by
the Consultants. Items which are already identified as suitable for financing
by a particular co-lender (for example the long-term technical assistance
program) would not be subject to the Association's Guidelines. Nevertheless,
the Association would be consulted where items such as technical assistance
concern the overall execution of the project. Works would be supervised by
the same consultants who prepared the project.
4.15      The forecast disbursement schedule was prepared after review of
various disbursement profiles and adjusted for the conditions of the proposed
project. However, in the absence of recent experience in the execution of
port projects in Guinea, a rather cautious start of disbursements is fore-
cast. This schedule correlates to a fairly smooth execution of the project
where most of the contracts would have already been signed right after Board
Presentation or declaration of effectiveness of the Credit. Moreover, the
tentative composition of the financing package applicable to the co-financiers
(as shown in Table 4.3) was proposed to them for consideration.

G. Operational Targets
4.18     PAC should start a two-shift operation not later than October 31,
1984, in line with the effective delivery of new cargo-handling equipment
under the project. Targets for productivity in the Conakry Port have been
reviewed with the Government during the appraisal of the project. The
targets, based on the average performance of other West African ports, and
assuming a two-shift operation starting late 1984, are as follows:

Local funds - 2 months' wages/salaries
Foreign funds - 2 months' supplier payments
- Receivables: not to exceed two months' revenues
- Inventories: not to exceed 12 months' spare
parts needs for the coming year nor fall below 9
months' needs.
- Accounts Payable: not to exceed two
months'supplier accounts and other current
payables.
H. Environmental Impact
4.20     Most of the civil works consist of rehabilitation of existing struc-
tures and are not expected to interfere in any way with the ecology of the
area.
V.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Methodology
5.01     The particularly poor operating conditions and exceptionally slow
vessel turnaround have resulted in significant freight rate differentials and
port surcharges imposed by major conferences and non-conference lines serving
Conakry. Discussions with shipping officials indicate that such charges would
be eliminated if conditions at Conakry were substantially improved and were to
become comparable to those of neighboring ports. This information was used in
the economic evaluation for the proposed project, as a direct measure of
potential benefits, in preference to the traditional methodology employed in
other port projects of indirectly estimating economic benefits by simulating
reductions in ship service and waiting times.
B. Traffic Analysis and Projections
5.02     As discussed in para. 3.06, general cargo traffic at Conakry fluc-
tuated during 1975-1979 and did not display any clear long-term trend. It
increased sharply in 1980 against 1979 traffic and increased more moderately
in 1981. The general cargo traffic for 1981 has been estimated at about
320,000 tons (of which only 5,000 tons were exports). This estimate includes



- 18 -
281,000 tons carried by general cargo and reefer vessels (against 257,000 tons
in 1980), about 17,000 tons of assumed general cargo imports on mineral
carriers and about 22,000 tons of assumed general cargo by alumina carriers
and discharged at general cargo berths. As equipment and infrastructure
components of the project are geared to the handling of general cargo,
specialized bulk traffic is not considered in this evaluation.
5.03     Projecting Guinea's economic development and traffic at the Port of
Conakry is extremely difficult. If the country's economic performance im-
proves, the Port of Conakry could see very rapid traffic growth from the mid-
1980s. However, it is difficult to predict success in the changes now begun
by the Government in revitalizing the rural sector and encouraging export-
oriented projects. In light of these uncertainties, fairly conservative
traffic growth assumptions were used. These assumptions lead to no virtual
change in the net import cargo tonnage between 1981 and 1988, as the modest
increases in miscellaneous general cargo would be offset by a decline in
cement imports as a result of the new cement factory currently under construc-
tion, as well as a stagnation in food imports. Between 1988 and 1995, overall
general cargo imports could be expected to grow by about 3% a year. For
general cargo exports, comprising mainly agricultural products, it was assumed
that they would recover their early 1970s' level of about 35,000 tons by 1987
and the early 1960s' level of 80,000 tons by 1995.  As additional port invest-
ments would probably be required by about 1995 -- earlier if traffic growth
should be more rapid than assumed -- traffic growth beyond 1995 has not been
taken into account.  The resulting general cargo traffic forecasts are
summarized in Table 5.1 and detailed in the Project File.

5.04     These forecasts imply an average annual growth rate of 1.0% p.a., for
general cargo between 1981 and 1987 and 4.1% p.a., between 1987 and 1995.  No
specific allowance was made for increased imports which might result if any of
the major new projects under consideration are implemented, e.g., Konkoure or
Mifergui-Nimba, nor for increased food imports which could result during the
1980s if domestic rice production does not increase. Substantially faster
traffic growth could occur during the late 1980s and early 1990s if some of
these major projects are implemented or if major policy reforms are carried
out to revitalize the agricultural sector. A lower traffic growth rate for
agricultural exports could occur if no policy changes are implemented.
However, agricultural exports account for only about 10-15% of the total
forecasted general cargo traffic for 1990.

C. Project Benefits
General
5.05     As the proposed project elements are complementary, it is not con-
sidered useful to try to attribute specific benefits to specific project
elements. Consequently, the economic evaluation has treated the proposed
project as a unit. One exception concerns the proposed new tugs which will
basically replace existing tugs that have reached the end of their economic
life (para. 5.11).
5.06     The quantified benefits from the proposed project include:
(a) reduced freight costs arising from improved port conditions and
productivity;
(b) reduced general cargo damage and loss arising from improved cargo
handling and security; and
(c) reduced financial holding costs to goods as a result of reduced ship
service and waiting times.
Benefits which have not been quantified include potential savings to bulk
exports and imports from improved port operations in general and improved
transit and city warehousing operations from equipment to be purchased under
the project and leased to ENTRAT for its continuing transit and transport
operations (see also para. 4.10).
Freight Cost Savings
5.07     On the basis of freight rate information from a major non-conference
line 1/ serving the important trade with Europe, and from a major conference
serving trade between the United States and West Africa, the average freight
rate for a selection of commodities to Conakry has been estimated to be about
US$30 per weight ton higher than for Freetown or Monrovia, the closest main
port. No account was taken of likely increases in this differential if port
conditions at Conakry were to decline further. As the achievement of freight
and other cost savings for Guinea may take some time, it has been assumed that
only 50% would be obtained in 1986, 70% in 1987, 90% in 1988, and 100% in 1989
and thereafter.
Reduced General Cargo Damage and Losses
5.08     The amount of damage to cargo in the Port of Conakry is exceptionally
high. Pilferage losses are also high. The consultants have estimated present
1/ Non-conference rates were used for the Europe trade as few conference
vessels call regularly at Conakry. Conference rates are higher than non-
conference rates, and had they been used, even higher freight rate
differentials would have resulted.



- 20 -
cargo damage and loss at the Port at 10% for general cargo and have assumed
that various measures included in the project would reduce the rate to about
8%, which would still be higher than the average in other West African ports,
but appears reasonable. For this economic evaluation, the average value of
general cargo has been estimated at US$600 per ton and it has been assumed that,
as a result of the project, general cargo damage and loss to imports would be
reduced to 9.5% in 1986, 9.0 in 1987., 8.5 in 1988 and reach 8.0% in 1989.
Financial Holding Cost Savings
5.09     A further benefit of the proposed project would accrue in the form of
lower inventory holding costs to importers as a result of more rapid cargo
turnaround and transit. The savings in financial holding costs have been
estimated using the following factors: (a) a cost of capital of 12% p.a.;
(b) an average general cargo value of $600 per ton; and (c) an average time
savings from the project of four days. No account has been taken of the fact
that average time losses would increase if port operations continue to
deteriorate. It is assumed th&  75% of the savings would be obtained in 1986
and 100% in 1987 and thereafter.
D. Economic Return and Sensitivity Analysis
5.10     The economic rate of return (ERR) of the proposed project was
calculated on the basis of the following main assumptions:
(a)  projected general cargo traffic;
(b) the quantified benefits described in para. 5.06, Section C above and
summarized below;
(c)  estimated capital costs (including physical contingencies) and
incremental maintenance/operating costs as well as allowance for
equipment replacement as summarized below;
(d) an economic life of 20 years; and
(e) no shadow pricing as most benefits and costs are in foreign exchange.

5,11    For the economic evaluation of the proposed project, capital and
operating costs of the two new tugs have been excluded from project costs as
the two existing tugs have already reached the end of their economic life and
should be replaced as soon as possible. Due to the water currents, wind
conditions, the limited size of the turning basin and the type and size of the
vessels, the Port could not function without two tugs. From an economic point
of view, the acquisition of the required two tugs would therefore have an
infinite rate of return.
5.12    On the basis of the assumptions mentioned in paras. 5.10 and 5.11,
the proposed project would yield a rate of return of 36% and a FYB of 16% in
1986, taking into account the assumed gradual accrual of the benefits to
Guinea and a 12% cost of capital. If the full capital cost of the two tugs
were added without counting any benefits from this investment, the ERR would
still be 30%. The sensitivity of the rate of return to more pessimistic
assumptions on key variables was tested. The main results are summarized in
Table 5.3 and are highly satisfactory. The high rates of return for the
project reflect the existing poor conditions in the Port and the basic
rehabilitative nature of the project.

VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Recent Financial Performance
6.01     The Port of Conakry's recent financial performance is only partially
recorded. The consultant's feasibility study attempted to put together a coherent
picture of the operating results of the various entities that held the fragmented
responsibilities now being centralized in the PAC. Two of the four institutions
functioned as public services with little or no financial autonomy. Their
accounts are essentially those of a public agency, with no depreciation allowances
recorded and no fixed asset accounting practiced. The Administration Generale did
not even have a source of direct revenues but merely existed on the basis of
allocations of revenue derived from the other port-related organizations. The
Office Maritime had revenue sources in the form of the pilotage, berthage and
harbor dues, but did not practice any depreciation allowances nor indeed prepare
any generally accepted financial statements. The ENTRAT as an autonomous entity
had the most up-to-date financial records and made allowance for depreciation of
its fixed assets. Finally, the SNG, another public enterprise, also followed the
Guinean accounting plan with its limitations.
6.02     The consolidated income accounts for the four institutions are
summarized in Table 6.1.:

- 23 -
The net income recorded for the three years has been modified by a notional
depreciation allowance for port infrastructure to show the extent to which
port revenues are said to cover total operating costs. Nearly 60% of the
operating revenues were generated by stevedoring and on-shore handling and
storage.  Depreciation recorded in the ENTRAT and SNG books doubled over the
four-year period, mainly as a result of new equipment purchases.
6.03     No consolidated balance sheets are available for the past years.  As
a result, an opening balance sheet has had to be created following review by
qualified auditors of the assets being transferred and of the evaluation of
such assets on PAC's newly opened books.  This balance sheet is summarized in
Table 6.2.

B. Financial Objective
6.04     PAC's long-term financial objective is to become an autonomous, com-
mercially-oriented public enterprise. Under its statutes, PAC's operating
revenues should cover all operating expenses, including adequate maintenance
expenditures and interest charges on debt, and yield a satisfactory return on
net fixed assets employed. At the same time, its cash flow from operations
should ensure satisfactory debt service coverage to allow for required working
capital increases in line with operational needs, make a contribution of at
least 40% towards its future investment and reinvestment needs, and finally,
compensate the Government's equity capital in the enterprise. The 40% contri-
bution target was selected by PAC and its Consultants to ensure that future
needs for renewal and investment funds will not result in inordinately high
debt service on external borrowings.
6.05     However, under the present condition of the Port of Conakry, it would
be difficult to achieve the above objective except in a fairly progressive
manner as it would require tariff increases of more than 60% in real terms.
Such tariff increases would need to be carried out concurrently with a tariff
restructuring program and would be logically tied to the gradual improvement
of port operations, the completion of the repairs and rehabilitation works and
procurement of project equipment. As the project would only be completed by
1987, it would only be possible to achieve the long-term financial objectives
of PAC from that year onward. However, in the intervening period (through
1986) in order to ensure that PAC is able to cover its cash working expenses,
pay the financial charges during construction, contribute to the local cost
component of the project and provide for minimum increases in working capital
to maintain ongoing operations, it should achieve at least a break-even



- 24 -
operating income position. In order to achieve this objective, tariff
increases are needed each year from 1983 through 1986. From 1987, tariff
increases are needed to attain the longer-term financial objectives as set
forth in the PAC Statutes. PAC's projected financial performance in light of
these objectives is described in the following paragraphs.
C. Forecast Financial Performance
Income Accounts
6.06             The financial forecast for the 1982-1992 period (with estimates for
the second half of 1982) has been developed in current prices (with an average
rate of inflation of about 8% for expenditures in local and foreign curren-
cies) on the basis of the above financial objectives, the project investment
plan, traffic forecast and the financing plan, and incorporating the forecast
fixed asset and depreciation schedule developed on the revalued asset base
from the opening balance sheet as of July 1, 1982. Major assumptions and con-
siderations used in the forecast are detailed in the Project File, which also
shows the financial forecasting model that was used. The forecast income
account is summarized in Table 6.3.

6.07     The forecast income account shows an improvement of PAC finances with
with positive operating income starting in 1984. Interest during construction
is capitalized in the 1982-1986 period and amortized subsequently over 10
years. Although operating income is negative in 1983, cash flow is positive
and adequate to cover the minimal cash needs in that year. The rate of return
on revalued net fixed assets in use reaches 6.0% in 1987, reflecting the cash
coverage target in that and subsequent years. Tariff increases needed during
the project implementation period will be modulated over the various port
services so that each service and profit center at least covers its marginal
cost and makes a positive contribution to the fixed costs. Tariff increases
are indicated already for: (a) tug operations; (b) berthage and ship stay;
and (c) warehousing and storage. Tariffs for (c) are at present only
sporadically applied, if at all, resulting in little or no incentive for
consignees to leave port storage areas in the shortest time possible. In
order to ensure that the asset base for tariff setting is appropriately
maintained, PAC has agreed to carry out physical revaluations of its fixed
assets at least once every five years and index fixed assets and depreciation
allowances in the intervening years. Agreement has been reached that the
Government would authorize PAC to:
(a) make an initial tariff increase to be effective July 1, 1983, so as
to ensure that PAC's 1983 operating revenues increase by 6%;
(b) effect a major revision of PAC tariff structure and a tariff increase
in 1984, and an annual tariff increase in each succeeding year to be
effective January 1 of each year, so that until 1987, PAC's net ope-
rating revenue is positive and its cash flow covers all cash working
expenses, debt service, and the estimated local cost component of the
proposed project, and ensures that PAC's cash and working capital
remain at the minimum levels agreed with the Association; from 1987,
maintain positive net operating revenue and ensure that PAC's cash
flow from operations covers in addition to cash working expenses, the
annual debt service, increases in working capital and provides at
least 40% towards its future investment costs.

6.09          Over the project implementation period PAC's net cash flow would
cover the PAC contribution to the proposed project (i.e., finance the local
cost component and interest during construction), and would ensure adequate
coverage of PAC's working capital needs (see Table 4.2, para. 4.08). Minimum
working capital requirements, in line with the targets shown in para. 4.19,
were agreed at negotiations. They would ensure that PAC had on hand suffi-
cient liquidity and non-cash working capital to carry on its operations
efficiently. Beyond the project period, PAC cash generation will be substan-
tially higher. PAC's future investment needs are at best sketchily known at
present. However, in order to ensure sound investment planning, it was agreed
at negotiations that any PAC investment expenditures over US$1.0 million
equivalent in the aggregate per year during the project period should be sub-
ject to the Association's agreement. Furthermore, it was agreed that:
(a) PAC would not incur additional debt over what is already in the financing
plan, unless the maximum debt service arising from such additional debt was
covered at least 1.5 times by its cash flow from operations; and (b) PAC would
not pay cash dividends to the Government until it has achieved a positive net
income after taxes, and unless after payment of such dividends, its cash and
liquidity position remains at least double its current liabilities including
the current portion of long-term debt. These covenants would ensure that PAC



-27-
would not suffer from overly burdensome debt service and would have at all
times sufficient cash reserves to permit equipment replacement and emergency
repair.
6.10     The detailed cash flow forecast (in the Project File) shows that
PAC's needs for foreign currency sources (to finance equipment renewals, spare
parts and insurance premiums) are higher than its potential revenues in
foreign exchange (mainly from tariffs on liners). This issue should be
redressed by the changes in tariff structure proposed for 1984. However,
PAC's overall cash position would remain satisfactory. Debt service coverage
remains satisfactory. To ensure the availability of foreign exchange and to
maintain PAC's liquidity, it was agreed during negotiations that:
(a)  the Government would permit PAC to use its syli balances to obtain
foreign exchange to cover any projected shortfall in foreign currency
resources not obtained from PAC's revenues in foreign currency;
(b)  the Government will permit PAC to maintain its external account with
one subaccount to ensure payment of insurance premiums and a second,
of at least US$0.5 million, to ensure payments to foreign suppliers
and to service external debt;
(c)  the Government will not require PAC to invest idle funds in illiquid
securities or in any other manner immobilize such funds for periods
longer than 90 days; and
(d)  PAC would obtain adequate insurance coverage for any substantial
losses of equipment and floating craft that it may suffer (para.
3.16).
6.11     PAC's forecast balance sheet is summarized in Table 6.5 and detailed
in the Project File.

6.12     PAC's gross fixed assets wqould increase substantially from 1,926
million sylis at the end of 1982 to 3,791 million sylis at the end of 1992,
due to asset revaluations and the proposed inve,stments. Net fixed assets in
use, however, would increase from 637 million sylis to 1,110 million sylis
mainly due to the high level of accumulated depreciation at the start of PAC's
operations. The debt-to-equity ratio will reach a high of 39:61 in 1986 and
remain lower after that. PAC's current ratio remains satisfactory even after
payment of dividends in 1987 and beyond.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.13     A sensitivity analysis has been carried out on PAC's capacity to meet
its financial obligations under adverse conditions. The results are
summarized in Table 6.6.

PAC's debt service coverage ratio is highly sensitive to both the timing
(Case 1) and level (Case 2) of forecast tariff increases.  In addition, PAC
would not be able to generate sufficient cash to cover the estimated local
costs of the project in 1984-1986 (and beyond, if tariff increases are lower
than forecast). It is for this reason that, PAC agreed to, a tariff increase
to produce an increase in PAC's 1983 operating revenues of 6% and will enact
before December 15, 1983 a major revision in port tariff structure and a
tariff increase to produce an increase of 30% in PAC's 1984 operating revenues.
During the project implementation period, further tariff increases each year
are equally critical (para 6.07). "'he enactment of these increases should be
closely monitored during project supervision and appropriate action taken if
such increases are tardy. The proposed Financing Agreement between the



-29-
Government and PAC would also obligate the Government to seek or cause PAC to
seek satisfactory alternatives should cash generation be insufficient to cover
the project financing needs (see para. 4.08).
6.14     The potential risk of actual traffic levels being lower than those
used both in the economic analyses and financial projections (see para. 5.04)
was not considered significant as these projections have been made very
conservatively. Nevertheless, a sensitivity test for stagnant traffic levels
was carried out (Case 3).
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Agreements reached during negotiations are incorporated in the legal
document. The proposed project is suitable for a Credit to the Government of
Guinea in an amount equivalent to US$13.0 million on standard IDA terms.
