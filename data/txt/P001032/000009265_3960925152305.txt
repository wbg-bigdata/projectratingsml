PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Conakry Port
Project in Guinea, for which Credit 1382-GUI in the amount of US$13 million
was approved on June 14, 1983. The credit was closed on December 31, 1988,
six months behind schedule. As of May 30, 1989 an amount of US$80,000
remained undisbursed.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Occidental and Central Africa Department, Africa Regional Office, and is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and
internal Bank memoranda.
The PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
(Attachments 1 and 2).

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
CONARRY PORT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1382-GUI)
PRO;ECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.       The main objectives of the project aret
(a)   to increase the autonomy,  officiency and productivity of PAC by
improving its financial and managerial functions and by training its
personnel; and                                                    .
(b)    to reduce cargo losses caused by pilferage and poor handling and
thereby reduce ocean freight costs for Guinea's imports and exports.
2.       To achieve these objectives, the project concept aimed at:
(a)    establishment of an independent port authority with financial and
managerial autonomy;
(b)    rehabilitation  of  existing  facilities  and  constructions  of  new
infrastructure;
(c)   renewal of cargo handling equipment and floating craft; and
(d)    training of staff, provision of technical assistance to management
and for project execution, and achievement of productivity targets.
Implementation Experience and Result
3.       The project was a notable success.   The Port Authority of Conakry
(PAC) has evolved into a creditable port manager (para 4.01).
4.       Performance of consultants, the contractor and suppliers was very
good. The project was completed well within the time schedule and close to
the cost estimate (paras 3.08-3.12).
5.       As regards operations, traffic has grown much much more rapidly than
originally anticipated at appraisal. The port handled 590,000 tons of general
merchandise cargo in 1987, well over the volume originally anticipated for
1995 (para 4.02).
6.       Operating indicators show that efficiency of the port substantially
improved over the four-year period of project execution (para 4.03).



7.        The reevaluated rate of return is 38X.  This is considerably higher
than the 301 forecast at appraisal and is attributed to higher traffic
(para 6.01).
8.        Port tariffs have generally been adequate.  Progress toward financial
autonomy for PAC has been less than satisfactory with regard to control by the
Government of PAC's operational expenditures and bank accounts.   However,
corrective measures were agreed upon during negotiations of the follow-on
Transport Sector Project (paras 5.03-5.04).
Sustainabilitv
9.       Given the success of this project in combination with the
measures to be implemented under the follow-on project (see previous para)
the project is likely to be sustainable.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.      The lessons to be learned from the project may be simple, but they
are worth repesting.   They are that excellent results can be obtained in
resurrecting a badly rundown, mismanaged Government-owned entity in a poor
country, provided that: (a) sound feasibility studies and good quality
detailed  engineering  and  supervision  are  carried  out:  (b)  a  competent
contractor is engaged to carry out the work; (c) the Government and its
executing agency are cooperative; and (d) all co-lenders closely coordinate
their efforts and thoroughly monitor progress. A further lesson is that a
well conceived project has a better chance of success than a poorly-defined
one.

CONAKRY PORT PROJECT. MREDIT 1382-GUI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The above project was the Bank Group's first port project in Guinea.
The Bank Group has previously assisted the port sector indirectly through an
Engineering Loan (Sl-GUI), and two Loans (577-GUI and 766-GUI) for the Boke
Bauxite Project which included consttuction of a new port at Kamear and related
rail and new town infrastructure.
1.02      Guinea has two deep-water portss Kamsar and Conakry. Kamsar has been
operating satisfactorily since its construction in 1975 under the Boke Bauxite
Project. It has a total capacity of 9.2 million tpy; currently, it handles about
8 million tons of bauxite exports annually as well as a small amount of imports
for the account of the mine. Conakry is the main commercial port. It handled
all general cargo imports (215,000 tons in 1983), fuel and clinker imports, as
well us bau-ite and alumina exports (3,000,000 and 500,000 tpy, respectively).
1.03      The Port of Conakry had two bulk-handling facilities for exports, one
for FRIGUIA (alumina) and the other for OBK (bauxite). Located between these
facilities were four general cargo berths and facilities for fruit handling,
small coastal vessels, fishing vessels and work boats.  Bulk petroleum products
were handled next to the bauxite berth. The total surface area occupied by the
Port is about 38 ha, of which about 3.6 ha was covered storage area comprising
the main transit sheds behind the general cargo berths. A clinker unloading and
storage facility was under construction.
1.04      A large part of the port infrastructure had deterior..ed.   Some
facilities presented potential hazard and needed to be partially demolished.
Others were in poor condition and inhibited efficient operations. Genera. cargo
aprons had settled in places due to gaps in the underwater quay wall blocks.
1.05      Cargo handling equipment was  of relatively recent vintage,  but
inadequate maintenance, compounded by rundown workshops and generally poor
operating conditions had substantially shortened its useful life. Floating craft
were in poor condition. Harbor tugs were operating well beyond their useful
lives and risk of total breakdown was high.   Beaconage and buoyage of the
entrance channel were also inadequately maintained.
1.06      The information for this report was obtained from the Staff Appraisal
and President's Reports for the Conakry Port. Project (Reports Number 4160-GUI
of May 17, 1983 and 3578-GUI of May 18, 1983, respectively), the Appraisal and
President's Reports for the Transport Sector Project, Bank supervision reports,
Bank files, interviews with Bank staff formerly associated with the project, and
the draft Project Completion Report prepared by PAC in May 1988.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFI1,ATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identif'.cation and Preparation
2.01      At the request of the Guinean Government that the Bank assist in port
improvement, an identification mission visited Conakry in early December 1979.
The findings and recommuedations of the mission are outlined in the first Project
Brief dated December 1979.   Key issites highlighted in the Brief included:
(a) lack of statistics, inefficient organization and poor management of port
operations; (b) severe shortage of equipment, spare parts and skilled tech-
nicians; (c) poor maintenance and urgent need for complete rehabilitation of port
facilities; and (d) need for institution building by creating a financially
independent port authority to replace four existing organizations with partly
overlapping responsibilities.
2.02      The Government had also solicited similar assistance from the Federal
Republic of Germany and, as a first step, it was agreed that kfW would finance
economic, financial and technical studies to be carried out by consultants
acceptable to the Bank under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. The
consultants' studies were to cover traffic, port capacity, operational costs,
port asset evaluation,  investment and costs,  proposed infrastructure  and
superstructure rehabilitation, project benefit evaluation, tariffs and the port's
financial position as well as the preparation of a master plan to be implemented
in stages as needed. A contract for the study was signed between KfW and a
German consulting firm acceptable to the Bank.
2.03      After reviewing the feasibility study which was received in early 1981,
a pre-appraisal mission visited Conakry in April 1981.  The mission agreed with
the consultants' proposal of a short-term port rehabilitation that includedt
(a) a  rehabilitation  of existing port  infrastructure  for general  cargo;
(b) reha'.lxtation and partial replacement of port equipment; and (c) training
and technical assistance.  The mission estimated that such a prcject would cost
about US$18 H equivalent, of which RfW and GTZ were willing to provide about
US$10 H and IDA US$7.0 M.  The Bank informed the Government that IDA and other
co-financiers considered the creation of an auton iious port authority managed
by a board composed of representatives of the Government and the port users to
be essential. The mission's findings and recommendations were discussed with
KfW and GTZ on June 18, 1981. Agreements were eventually reached that: (a) KtW
would allocate DM 13 M towards financing the project; (b) GTZ would contribute
about US$2.8 M equivalent for consultants' services and technical assistance;
(c) IDA would allocate US$10.0 M equivalent;  and (d) the Government would
contribute up to US$2.0 M equivalent. The estimated project cost was US$22 H
equivalent.
Appraisal
2.04      Appraisal was originally scheduled for November 1981, but because of
staff constraints, the Bank informed the Government that departure of the
appraisal mission had to be postponed to a later date. Finally, appraisal took
place in February 1982 by a joint missien composed of representatives of IDA;
KfW and GTZ. During appraisal, the -. oject cost estimate, including contingen-
cies, rose to about US$38 M equivalent which was about US$16 M equivalent more
than the pre-appraisal estimate. The Bank mission proposed that the Government
ask the Bank to provide funds from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to



finance:   (a) physical inventory and financial evaluation of assets to be
transferred to the new authority; (b) repairs of temporary houbing for technical
assistance experts; (c) underwater investigation of the general cargo berths;
(d) study of existing warehousing capacity and conditi-mn thereof in the city-
and (e) preparation of tender documents for floating crafts. A PPF of US$600,000
equivalent was approved on April 15, 1982.
2.05      The Issues Paper dated March 11  1982 explained the reasons for the
above mentioned increase in the cost estimate. These included: (a) inclusion
of houses for the technical assistance experts since the housing situation in
Conakry was extremely difficult; (b) the need to repair and strengthen the
pavement in the container stacking area; (c) the need to purchase two new tug
boats to ensure proper port operations since the existing tugs were in a very
poor condition; (d) the need to acquire a simple data processing system to assist
the new port authority in establishing its information base independently from
the Ministry of Planning; and (e) additional soil investigation on land and in
the port water area. The Issues Paper called for the co-financiers to increase
their contribution as follows: ITA to US$12.5 H equivalent, KfW to DM 16.1 mill-
ion equivalent, GTZ to US$3.8 M equivalent and the GovernmentlPAC to US$3.0 M
equivalent, thus leaving a financing gap of about US$11.7 M.
2.06      The maiia issues raised in the Issues Paper were those related to the
agreements to be reached prior to credit negotiations. These included the need
for the Government to promulgate a decree creating an autonomous Port Authority
of Conakry (PAC) and defining its statutes, setting out its financial structure
and fiscal regime, transferring of assets to PAC, and appointing a Director
General and Department Directors; (b) to make sufficient land available for the
construction of the housing for the technical assistance experts; Cc) receive
bids for all civil works and equipment in order to alleviate the uncertainty
about the cost estimate; and (d) examine, under the PPF financing, the
warehousing and transit operations a.d preparing an action plan thereon
satisfactory to IDA; and (e) to have PAC and its stevedoring company (ENTRhT)
sign a lease agreement the terms and conditions if which would be satisfactory
to IDA. In addition, the Issues Paper outlined other issues to be agreed upoa
during negotiations including those related to security in the port, on-lending
terms, performance targets to be achieved, introducing a two-shift system and
review of port tariffs.
2.07      The Decision Meeting was held on March 18, 1982 and issued a Decision
Memorandum on April 30, 1982. The meeting agreed to the appraisal mission's
recommendations and conditions for negotiations as given in the Issues Paper.
As regards the financing gap referred to in para 2.05, the meeting estimated the
gap at US$15 M equivalent and reported that: (a) co-financing of such gap was
being sought; (b) AfDB had expressed interest; (c) Germany had been asked to
consider increasing its commitment; and (d) IDA would consider increasing its
allocation to fill part of the financing gap. Later, AfDB confirmed on May 22,
1982 to a Bank mission to Abidjan that it would participate in the project and
expressed its willingness in principle to cover the financing gap up to US$15 M
equivalent.
2.08      During the period between project identification and appraisal, the
Bank informed the Government on several occasions that the most pressing issue
was the creation of an autonomous port authority. After some delay, the decree
was signed on June 22, 1982 and PAC's Director General and its Department
Directors were appointed by decree dated August 21, 1982. The other pressing



- 4 -
issue was the financing of technical assistance to the new management. This
issue was partly resolved when GTZ received an official request from the
Government to this effect and consequently allocated DM 6.0 million for this
purpose. It remained for GTZ tc expedite selecting the experts so that they
could start their work in Conakry on January 1, 1983.
2.09      A post-appraisal mission visited Conakry in December 1982 mainly to
review the finances of the project and discuss actions to be taken to advance
processing of the project especially those required to meet conditions for
negotiations (para 2.06). The mission also visited Abidjan to discuss with AfDB
the main recommendations of the Appraisal Report. Subsequently, an AfDB mission
visited Conakry starting January 20, 1983 to appraise the project.
2.10      Pre-negotiations took place  in Conakry in early March 1983 and
negotiations in Washington from April 18 to 20, 1983.  The only substantive
change made to the legal documents was that the required January 1, 1984 tariff
revision, to lead to a 30Z revenue increase, should be published before
December 15, 1983 rather than prior to credit effectiveness. Meanwhile the AfDB
informed Guinea on April 26, 1983 that it was unable to invite the Government
for negotiating the AfDB loan in Abidjan because Guinea was in default on its
debt to that bank.  The problem of the arrears was settled in due time and
negotiations between the AfDB and Guinea took place on June 6, 1983. However,
because of this delay, the validity of bids for civil works had to be extended
from July 10, 1983 to September 15, 1983.
2.11      The credit was approved on June 7, 1983 for SDR 12.1 million equivalent
(US$13 M equivalent).   It was signed on July 14, 1983 but did not become
effective until December 14, 1983 because of:  (a) delays on the part of the
Government in submitting the legal opinion; (b) delays in the AfDB Loan Agreement
and KfW and GTZ Grant Agreements becoming effective; (c) delays in executing the
Financial Agreemen.. Srelending) between the Government and PAC; and (d) delays
in Government fulfilling effectiveness conditions under the AfDB loan.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
2.12      The project forms part of a long-term master plan for the development
of the port of Conakry. The master plan which is being implemented in stages
as needed, was prepared by the consultants who prepared the feasibility study
and detailed engineering under the project. The main objectives of the project
were:
(a)  to increase the autonomy,  efficiency and productivity of PAC by
improving its financial and managerial functions and by training its
personnel; and
(b)  to reduce cargo losses caused by pilferage and poor handling and
thereby reduce ocean freight costs for Guinea's imports and exports.
2.13      To achiev.  these objectives, the project concept aimed at:
(a)  establishment of an independent port authority with financial and
managerial autonomy;
(b)  rehabilitation  of existing  facilities  and constructions  of new
infrastructure;



- 5 -
(c)  renewal of cargo handling equipment and floating craft; and
(d)  training of staff, provision of technical assistance to management and
for project execution, and achievement of productivity targets.
2.14      The principal components of the project weres
(a)  Civil Works
Mi)     rehabilitation of general cargo transit sheds; repair of
general cargo quays, existing workshops, drainage system,
rail sidings, roads, buoys and beacons; construction of a
container stacking area; demolition of some structurally
unsafe buildings and erection of customs fence;
(ii)     construction of a new administration building; and
(iii)     construction of housing for expatriate technical assistance
experts.
(b) Eauivment
Mi)     procurement of cargo handling equipment including forklifts
and cranes;
(ii)     purchase of machines, tools,  cars,  trucks and tractor
trailers;
(iii)     repair of existing cargo handling and workshop equipment;
(iv)     procurement of two harbor tugs, a pilot boat and a mooring
boat; and
(v)     procurement of micro-computers and associated software.
(c) Technical Assistance and Consulting Services
(i)     provision of long-term experts (3-4 years) to assist the
General Manager, the Technical and Financial Directors, the
Port Captain and the heads of cargo handling and maintenance,
and to train PAC's staff (a total of 225 man-months);
(ii)     provision of short-term experts (6-9 months) to assist in
developing accounting, financial and data processing systems,
tariff and rate setting, and inventory control (a total of
39 man-months); and
(iii)     provision of consultant services for project supervision,
evaluation of warehousing needs outside the port, study of
closure structure and other miscellaneous tasks (a total of
165 man-months).
2.15      Project cost was estimated during appraisal at US$38 M equivalent of
which US$35.3 M equivalent was in foreign currency. The foreign currency cost



- 6 -
was financed by IDA, AfDB, R£W and GTZ.   Agreement was reached among the
co-financiers that:
(a) IDA would finance construction of the administration building and
customs fence, procurement of the floating equipment, removal of sunken
harbor craft, and supervision of construction;
(b)  the AfDB would finance rehabilitation of port and workshop infrastruc-
ture, procurement of some cargo handling equipment, paving of roads
and open storage areas and miscellaneous works;
(c) RfW would finance project preparation, construction of housing for
experts; rehabilitation of port infrastructure, repair of transit sheds
and water system as well as procurement of forklifts, cars, trucks,
workshop equipment and maintenance equipment; and
td) GTZ would finance technical assistance.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Implementation
3.01      PAC was responsible for project execution, with the assistance of
engineering consultants financed by IDA under the project. Project execution
got off to a good start; mobilization was carried out on schedule and contrac-
tor's equipment was suitable and adequate for the works.   The project was
expected to take about four years and thus was scheduled to be completed by the
end of 1987.
3.02      Project execution encountered some problems that were resolved without
undue difficulties. Such problems are usually encountered in all port projects
of this type and size. The main problems encountered weret
(a) The contractor was responsible, under the project, for dredging in
front of the general cargo and mineral berths to arrive at the original
design depth using a clam-shell grab operated by a mobile crane moving
on the quay's apron. This has been done except for the FRIGUIA berth
which had an occupancy rate of 90X. In spite of several interventions
by Bank supervision missions, the FRIGUIA Company was unablelunwilling
to free the berth used by it for exporting alumina. The contractor's
equipment, as well as those rented by him, stayed idle for lengthy
periods thus forcing PAC to release the contractor from his obligation
under this item.   this report did not establish the corresponding
cost incurred.
(b) The contractor was responsible for repairing or paving most of the
areas used for open storage.  However, because of the increase in
general cargo imports, especially containerized cargo, the open storage
areas were virtually full most of the time and coordination between
paving and storing, including unloading and reloading, was difficult.
The contractor was understanding and the final product was excellent.
3.03      Given the nature of rehabilitation works and difficulty in predicting
the extent of deterioration until part of the then existing structures or



equipment was dismantled, a 20Z physical contingency was assumed for these works
at the time of project appraisal. This proved to be a wise decision. Three
amendments to the contract for civil works were introduced during project
implementation to amend, add or delete some of the works as necessary. These
amendments were agreed upon by PAC, IDA, KfW and the AfDB. The contract with
the supervision consultants was elso amended five times in order to take care
of the amendments to the contractor's contract and to allow for additional
studies and responsibilities given to the supervision consultants, including
preparation and supervision of maintenance dredging contract. The contract with
the consulting engineers was for the period November 8, 1983 to April 30, 1987;
however, it had to be extended to October 1987 to allow for the supervision of
maintenance dredging contract.
3.04      While not part of the project, arrangements for routine dredging
deserve mention. SOMIDRAT, a parastatal company, had a monopoly on dredging the
port of Conakry since 1975. Consequently, PAC had to entrust that company with
continuously needed maintenance dredging.  However, SOMIDRAT had neither the
equipment nor the capability to carry out the work.   In fact, dredging was
suspended before the start of the project and never resumed until, after undue
delays, the Government agreed to end SOMIDRAT's monopoly in mid 1986. After
prequalification of dredging companies on July 31, 1986, bids were called fox
on October 1, 1986, and a US$3.3 M equivalent contract for maintenance dredging
was awarded to a Dutch company. Work started on April 18, 1987 and was completed
on schedule on October 3, 1987 and was pr'mfinanced by SAL A-l1-GUI. However,
the contractor was unable to remove a sunken boat on the north side slope of the
mineral berth (OBK berth) or a concrete block 37 m from the quay of the FRIGUIA
berth; neither one of the jobs was in the contractor's terms of reference.
Reporting
3.05      As regards project execution, the supervision consultants prepared
adequate quarterly reports that were sent bv PAC to IDA regularly without undue
delays.    The  consultants prepared also  a comprehensive  final  report in
March 1987.   However,  as regards other aspects of the project  (traffic,
operations, technical assistance, etc.,) no periodical reports were prepared by
PAC. Data on the above were collected, analyzed and discussed in the field by
the supervision missions. On average, the data provided by PAC to the missions
was adequate, and since supervision missions visited Conakry every four months
on average, IDA was able to follow up the important events regularly. Financial
reporting, which was weak during the first years of implementation, gradually
improved during preparation of the follow-on Transport Sector Project.
Procurement
3.06      KfW informed IDA on August 21, 1981 that it proposed employing the
consultants who carried out the feasibility study, to prepare final engineering
and tender documents; IDA agreed on August 28, 1981. The consultant's contract
was signed on March 6, 1982. Prequalified bidders were invited to bid and bids
for civil works and for equipment were opened on January 10, 1983. The Guinean
Committee for bid evaluation took 100 days to prepare a draft report on its
recommendations and the final report reached the Bank on March 19, 1983. On
May 23, 1983, the Bank sent a telex to the Government that IDA h&d no objection
to negotiating a contract with the contractor submitting t'e lowest evaluated
bid.   The period between project initial identification and contract award
(3.5 years) including feasibility study, preparation of tender documents,



-8-
prequalification of bidders, call for bids, evaluation of bids, etc., seems
reasonable for a project of this type and magnitude, althou3h it took six months
between bid evaluation and contract award (March 12 to September 14, 1983).
Later, the same consulting firm was retained to supervise project execution.
3.07      The financing package was based on parallel financing by IDA and the
other co-lenders. Agreement was reached at appraisal that all procurement for
the main civil works and equipment contracts would follow the Association's
Guidelines under international competitive bidding. Procurement of floating
craft would be on the basis of performance specifications. As regards civil
works, 21 contractors submitted prequalification documents.  Out of 12 firms
accepted, seven submitted bids on January 10, 1983. Usually, a larger number
of contractors submit bids for port projects; however, this may have been due
to most of the work being rehabilitation rather than new works.   The bid
evaluation committee, assisted by the engineering consultants, recommende4
accepting the second lowest bid (GS 335.66 million) because the lowest bid
(GS 316.176 millio4; was not responsive to the bidding documents, and the
reservations therein were unacceptable. The co-financiers agreed i'.o the above
recommendations and the contract was awarded on that basis. As regards equipment
purchase, equipment was divided into eight lots and bidders were allowed to bid
for one or more lots.
Costs
3.08      Cost estimates for civil works were based on final engineering designs
and, together with floating craft and cargo handling equipment, were obtained
from the preliminary evaluation of bids that were received during appraisal.
The above cost estimate, including price contingency, proved to be accurate since
the final project cost, including an estimated cost for long- and short-term
technical assistance, was US$40.00 M equivalent as compared to the appraisal
estimate of US$38.00 M equivalent.
3.09      At the time of appraisal, the Guinean currency unit was the *Sylim (GS)
and US$1.0 was equivalent to GS 23.0. Fixed rates of exchange were used for all
contracts under the project during the whole life of the contracts. These were
the official rates of exchange on December 10, 1982, which was one month before
the submission of bids.   Nevertheless, as part of the monetary reform of
January 1986, the Government decided to replace the Syli by the new currency,
the 'Guinean Franc" (GF).  Since the GF rate of exchange remained GF 1.0 -
GS 1.0 for PAC's contracts, this measure did not influence the amount paid to
contractors or equipment suppliers.
Financial Sources
3.10      In additi n to the IDA credit of US$13.0 M equivalent, the project was
financed by an AfDB loan of US$14.0 H equivalent, a KfW credit of US$6.3 H
equivalent, and a GTZ grant of US$2.7 H equivalent.   PAC provided US$4.0 M
equivalent to cover the local costs, and, in addition, financed about US$5.6 M
equivalent in interest during construction.
Disbursements
3.11      Disbursements were on schedule, and sometimes, in the case of the IDA
credit, were ahead of schedule. The AfDB suspended disbursements on its loan
only on one occasion from September 1985 to May 1986 because Guinea was in



arrears. During this period, the contractor did not stop work completely, but
his productivity was less than normal.
Performance of Consultants. Contractors and Suppliers
3.12      As noted above, the project vas prepared and supervised by the same
consultants.  Their performance was very good, their progress reports were
adequate and useful, and their relation with their counterparts, PAC's management
and the Government were excellent.  This goes also for the contractor who
executed the civil works, and the suppliers of equipment. Civil works were
completed six months ahead of schedule and equipment was delivered within six
to twelve months of PAC's acceptance of suppliers' offers. PAC expressed in its
project completion report complete appreciation and satisfaction to both the
consultants and the contractor.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      With a few minor reservations, the project was a notable success.
PAC has evolved into a credible port manager, but it has not attained full
financial autonomy as foreseen by its statutes. Nevertheless, port operations
have improved since its creation; most of this improvement is attributed to the
long-tern technical assistance financed by GTZ. A problem that has proved quite
intractable was port security.  Although the situation ceased to be critical
since fencing and lighting were installed under the project, losses through
pilferage remained unacceptably high. PAC has recently assumed responsibility
for ensuring port security, and est_blished its own security force to replace
the previously ineffective ones. Security was further improved after privatiza-
tion of the stevedoring and freight forwarding activities, as the now private
operators have assumed responsibility for security in selected port areas.
4.02      Increases  in  traffic  in  response  to  the  improvements  in  port
installation and operations and mostly the liberalization of the Guinean economy
since mid-1984, have largely exceeded those foreseen at appraisal.  General
merchandise imports increased from 215,000 tons in 1983 to 548,000 tons in 1987,
an annual increase of about 26Z on average. The containerized share of this
traffic increased even more steeply, from 26,000 tons in 1983 to 265,000 tons
in 1987, an annual increase of 79X. Total general merchandise volume (imports
plus exports) of 590,000 tons in 1987 exceeds the volume anticipated at appraisal
by 250,000 tons, after an average annual increase of 25Z over four years.
Table 1 gives details of traffic development for different categories of
merchandise. This explosive growth in traffic produced severe congestion in the
newly rehabilitated port facilities.  When appraised, these facilities were
estimated to be sufficient for handling a volume of 470,000 tons annually which
were, at that time, expected to be reached by 1995, whereas, in fact, these were
reached in 1986. This was the rationale for expansion of the port facilities
under the follow-on Transport Sector Project.
Overall Assessment
4.03      Port productivity has increased considerably as shown in the following
table which compares the past and present operating indicators with the appraisal
targets.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.01      The revenue and cash flow objectives set for the implementation period
of the project were achieved, due to larger than expected traffic volumes,
adequate tariff revisions and low working expenses, including very low personnel
costs. As shown in Table 2 detailing PAC's income statements for 1983-87, the
target working ratios and operating ratios as well as debt service coverage were
generally met. On the whole, PAC's net income after taxes has averaged US$1.1 H
on annuail  revenues averaging US$13.9 M over the 1983-87 period.  Cumulated
internal cash generation over the period reached US$20.1 M, allowing PAC to
finance the local cost of the project, build its working capital at the required
levels and, after deduction of financial charges during construction and
provisions for dredging, accumulate a net cash surplus of about US$3.5 M.
5.02      As shown in Table 3 detailing PAC's balance sheets, compliance with
the financial covenant on collection of accounts receivable has been less
satisfactory:    these  increased  steadily  to a peak  of GF 3.3 billion by
December 1986, or more than nine months' revenues, instead of the target of two
months. Due in part to a confusion between PAC and SNG, acting as agent for
shipping lines, collection of foreign exchange payments from foreign clients
presented continuing problems until 1986, while local currency payments by local
public sector clients were consistently in arrears.   PAC started to take
corrective measures in 1986 by appointing a foreign port as agent to completely
overhaul foreign client accounts and collect arrears, and by applying new payment
procedures (including advance payments and deposits by shippers) and detaining
delinquent ships. Receivables from public clients were partly reduced by the
compensation of crossed debts between PAC and the State in 1987. As a result,
total receivables had decreased to GF 2.8 billion by December 1987 which still
exceeded seven months' revenues. Better billing and collecting procedures are
since being introduced under a financial management and accounting improvement
program under the follow-on Transport Sector Project.
5.03      Port tariffs have generally been adequate.  After the introduction of
a new tariff structure at project start-up, regular increases were implemented,
including an intermediate revision of tariffs payable in local currency following
the 1986 monetary reform.   A major adjustment of the tariff structure was



- 11 -
implemented in mid-1987, to reflect the transfer of PAC's stevedoring,
shorehandling and warehousing activities to private sector operators, which
transformed PAC into an organization dealing essentially with infrastructure.
5.04      Progress toward financial autonomy  for PAC has been less than
satisfactory with regard to control by the Government of PAC's operational
expenditures and bank accounts. Expenditures above GF 200,000 were submitted
to a priori Government control and following public sector regulations, PAC's
cash surplus had to be deposited in non-interest-bearing accounts in the Central
Bank, while all payments by PAC's clients were effected directly into Central
Bank accounts. Also, about US$9.3 M of PAC's cash, mostly in foreign exchange,
were frozen in 1986 in the liquidated state banks. Corrective measures were
agreed upon obtained during negotiations of the follow-on Transport Sector
Project, and were implemented in 1988.
5.05      PAC's assets and liabiiities were fully revaluated by its Auditors as
of December 31, 1985 following the monetary reform; this work included a detailed
evaluation of fixed assets and was a first of its kind for a Public Enterprise
in Guinea. In preparation for the Transport Sector Project, a comprehensive
compensation plan of reciprocal debts, arrears and foregone revenues, amounting
to a total of GF 5,672 million, was agreed upon between PAC, the State and other
parastatal enterprises in 1987 and resulted in a net credit of GF 2.1 billion
which PAC used for partial prepayment of its long-term debts.
5.06      PAC's financial management and accounting improved during project
implementation, but still showed some weaknesses in matters of cash management,
budgeting,  billing  and  internal  controls.    A management  and  accounting
improvement program with additional training, technical assistance and
development of computer applications, is being implemented with the follow-up
project.   Audits were carried out regularly from 1983 to 1987 and were
satisfactory.
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.01      The economic rate of return has been reevaluated using the same
methodology and on the same basis as in the appraisal report. The main benefit
is the reduced freight rates to Conakry arising from improved port conditions
and productivity: it can be reasonably estimated that this reduction effectively
occurred, with a time lag of about one year behind appraisal estimates, i.e.,
starting in 1987 after the repaired quays, transit sheds and container storage
areas became fully available and modern full-container ships had begun scheduled
services to Conakry. Similarly, benefits related to reduced cargo losses and
damage, and lower inventory costs for importers, have been assumed to materialize
beginning in 1987.   Incremental maintenance costs higher than forecast at
appraisal, have been taken into account to reflect the important dredging cost
associated with water depth needed to fully accommodate the large container ships
and Ro-Ro ships which contribute significantly to the benefits.   A revised
maximum port capacity (before expansion works undertaken under the follow-on
project) of 628,000 tons of general cargo has been taken into account, based on
the productivity achieved in 1987 and 1988. On the basis of these assumptions,
the rate of return would amount to 382. This rate is significantly higher than
the 30? forecast (with the tugboats) at appraisal, due to the actual higher

traffic.   If traffic had increased only as projected at appraisal,  the
reevaluated rate of return would be 27Z.
6.02      Actual benefits are likely to be higher than assumed above, due to
steadily increasing productivity and diminishing cargo losses, associated with
the dramatic containerization of the traffic and more efficient cargo handling
operations. It is difficult, however, to distinguish what proportion of these
additional benefits is due to the project itself, or due to the privatization
of ancillary port services brought about during preparation of the follow-on
project.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The project was a notable success.  PAC has evolved into a creditable
port manager. However, it has not attained full financial autonomy as foreseen
by its statutes.
7.02      Performance of consultants, the contractor and suppliers was very good.
The project was completed six months ahead of schedule, at a cost of only 5Z over
the appraisal estimate.
7.03      Cargo traffic has grown much more  rapidly than anticipated at
appraisal. The port is now handling about 600,000 tons of general merchandise
cargo, well over the volume originally anticipated for 1995.
7.04      The reevaluated rate of return is 38Z.  This is considerably higher
than the 30Z forecast at appraisal and is attributed to higher traffic.
7.05      Port tariffs have generally been adequate.  Progress toward financial
autonomy for PAC has been less than satisfactory with regard to control by the
Government of PAC's operational expenditures and bank accounts.   However,
corrective measures were agreed upon during negotiations of the follow-on
Transport Sector Project.
7.06      The lessons to be learned from the project may be simple, but they are
worth repeating. They are that excellent results can be obtained in resurrecting
a badly rundown, mismanaged Government-owned entity in a poor country, provided
thats (a) sound feasibility studies and good quality detailed engineering and
supervision are carried out; (b) a competent contractor is engaged to carry out
the work; (c) the Government and its executing agency are cooperative; and
(d) all co-lenders closely coordinate their efforts and thoroughly monitor
progress. A further lesson is that a well conceived project has a better chance
of success than a poorly-defined one.

v  20                 1.    The dredging work for the FRIGUIA berth could not be carried out
D'  * 1for the reasons you list in point III of the report. The cost relating to this
A  &.           work ought to be determined and stated, since the Port Authority has released
£  J  F          the contractor from his obligaticns for this work.
2.    In the estimate of operating results, the increases in traffic due
to the improvement of the port facilities should be separated, in figures, from
those deriving solely from the liberaLization of the national economy.
