F. Results Framework Analysis

(a) PDO Indicator(s):

The main objective of the operation was to assist the Egyptian authorities in further developing the enabling
environment for financial intermediation and financial access, and increase private participation in the provision
of financial services, through a strengthened bank and non-bank financial system.

This operation supported the government’s second generation Financial Sector Reform Program (2009–2012),
aimed at building a financial system that is more inclusive, competitive and effective in financial intermediation.
This, in turn, would contribute to the sustained growth of the Egyptian economy and combat the adverse
consequences of the global economic crisis.

1.      Program Context, Development Ojectives and Design
1.1.    Context at Appraisal

Political Context

1.       The political context at appraisal was completely changed following the January 2011
revolution and Egypt started a long transition to a new political regime. The Egyptian revolution that
started on January 25, 2011 led to the stepping down of the former President, the appointment of an
interim caretaker government, and the dissolution of Parliament on February 11, 2011. The Supreme
Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) assumed executive and legislative powers until the Parliamentary
and Presidential elections are concluded, and a new constitution is in place. Writers of the new
constitution have just been selected. The presidential elections took place on May 23 and 24, 2012,
with a runoff on June 17-18. The results were announced on June 24, 2012, where Mohamed Morsi
won (the Muslim Brotherhood Candidate). Parliamentary elections were held, and the first session of
the newly elected Parliament was on January 23, 2012. Accordingly, the country had no Parliament for
almost a year, which has negatively affected legal reforms and the passage of laws—some of which
were already approved by the Cabinet. The prolonged political transition and change in prime
ministers as well as Cabinet over the 18 months transition period contributed to the delay and
ambiguity about policies and directions. The change in Cabinet also entailed a change in the heads of
most authorities and government entities. However, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), the main
counterpart for this operation, remained in place with the same Governor. Nevertheless, the political
context of the country at the time of appraisal was very different from the current one.

2.       Uncertainty exists about the political and economic future, not just about the hiatus period
and the elections, but the future orientation of Egypt, which was not present at appraisal. The newly
elected Parliamentarians come from new political parties; the majority of Parliamentarians are from
Islamist Parties. A new President has been elected and a new constitution will be drawn up. Although
the political and economic strategy of the government to be elected is unclear at this point, it almost
certainly will emphasize equity, fairness, and a focus on governance, transparency and accountability.
There is also a possibility that the new government will opt for policies that will satisfy the populists’
demands in the short-run but that might not be sustainable in the long-run. This was amplified by the
social unrest, lengthy demonstrations, and strikes, including staff in the financial institutions, which
followed the revolution.

3.       Economic growth has slowed substantially following the revolution. Given the uncertain
situation, as well as the substantial pressure for the underfunded caretaker government to improve the
economic situation of various groups, it is not surprising that the Egyptian economic activity has been
slow to recover, investment has dropped and macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated (as detailed
in the section on macroeconomic framework below). The to-be-elected government, on assuming
office, will need to define its direction quickly and take macroeconomic actions consistent with its
resources and funding from abroad, to create employment opportunities, to avoid inflation that will
hurt the poor most, and to encourage investment and private sector development, with the ultimate
objective of achieving inclusive growth.

4.      The revolution, and its associated risks, interrupted the financial sector reform program
immediately after the loan had closed. The January 2011 revolution led to the closure of banks from
January 27 till February 6, 2011, as well as the shutting down of the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE)
until March 23, 2011. CBE had to respond to critical matters such as capital outflows, international
reserves, the exchange rate, the inflation rate, and the overall macroeconomic policies. Moreover, as a
regulatory and supervisory body, CBE had to closely monitor the quality of banks’ assets and non-
performing loans (NPLs), and undertake rigorous stress testing for banks. Meanwhile, the banking
system was subject to an increasing crowding-out effect by the government from sell-offs of its debt
                                                    1
and the growing budget deficit. Demand for private credit also fell with the deterioration in the
investment climate and the overall macroeconomic environment and growth slow-down. On the non-
bank side, regulations for disclosure and corporate governance were augmented by the Egyptian
Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA) post-revolution, and authorities introduced temporary trading
measures aimed at reducing panic upon resumption of trading (after the re-opening of the stock market)
and helping restore stability in domestic capital markets.

financial crisis, but the January revolution sent the economy into a tailspin and still faces uncertainty.
Egypt’s economic growth was on a recovery path, growing at 5.1 percent in FY10 and 5.6 percent in the
first half of FY11 yet, the revolution led to a complete halt in economic activity during several weeks;
widespread labor action demanding higher wages and management changes increased downward
pressure on growth. Output contracted by 4.4 percent (y-o-y) in the quarter of the revolution, and
registered 1.8 percent in FY11. In FY12, growth has oscillated around 0.3 percent (y-o-y) in the first
semester, but it is expected to climb to around 2 percent for the entire fiscal year. Basically, the
macroeconomic environment at the time of appraisal was different from that at the current time of ICR.

6.       In general, Egypt coped well with the initial economic and market effects of the political crisis.
This was largely due to the financial management of CBE, which stabilized the currency, kept liquidity at
adequate levels, and oversaw commercial banks to ensure their normal functioning after two weeks of
closure due to security concerns. However, as time evolved, traditional challenges such as a high fiscal
deficit, moderately high inflation, and high vulnerability of the population to poverty, called for renewed
action, in the context of new complicating factors such as a falling demand for Egyptian pound
denominated assets which has implied loss of international reserves. Given the prolongued political
transition, and policy inflexibility on both the fiscal and monetary sides, uncertainty prevailed and capital
outflow persisted. International reserves have been declining from February 2011 until March 2012;
however it started to increase marginally starting April 2012 to reach $ 15.2 billion.

7.       Egypt’s revolution raised political uncertainty and significantly dampened economic growth
prospects in the short run. Egypt’s uncertain political outlook makes it difficult to forecast how the
transition will unfold. The final outcome will depend on the political agreement necessary to attain balance
between the Executive, the Parliament, and the Judiciary, as well as on the economic policy responses
required to stabilize the economy in the short run. The main factors affecting the outlook for FY12 are: (i)
the extent of recovery of tourism (20 percent of Egypt’s foreign exchange revenues); (ii) business
disruptions, especially at industrial areas near major cities; (iii) a slowdown in domestic demand, which has
been the main growth driver in Egypt; and (iv) reduced investment following loss of confidence.
Construction, manufacturing, and financial institutions are most likely to continue to suffer losses resulting
from labor actions.

8.       High unemployment, especially among the youth, continues to be a major concern.
Unemployment had declined to 8.9 percent in Q1-FY11, down from a peak of 9.4 percent during the
trough of the slowdown produced by the global financial crisis. By December 2011, unemployment
had increased to 12.4 percent as the private sector accommodated the political shock. Unemployment
is highest for younger age groups, reaching 21 percent for the 15-24 age group. Youth unemployment is
similar to other middle income countries such as Colombia, Turkey, and Indonesia which oscillate around
25 percent, and lower than many European countries such as Italy, Greece, and Hungary that hover around
26 percent, and certainly lower than Spain at 38 percent. However, most of those countries have
unemployment insurance, social safety nets that operate in extreme situation, and mechanisms through
which citizens manifest their grievances. In Egypt, the high level of public debt and fiscal deficit limit the
room for maneuvering.


                                                      2
9.       Inflation has dropped to a single-digit level. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation oscillated
between 7 and 9 percent during the last 7 months (August 2011–April 2012), and stood at 8.7 percent
in April 2012. The fall in inflation is driven by lower food price increases. In the period 2008-2010
inflation rate remained in a double-digit or four consecutive years inflation rate. Food price inflation,
the main driver of inflation, fluctuated between 18 and 22 percent over the same period. Core
inflation 1 was fluctuating between 6.8 and 9 percent and stood at 8.6 percent in March 2012. The
Producer Price Index inflation has a declining trend: from 11.8 percent in September 2011 it dropped
to 7.4 percent in January 2012.

10.      The external balance severely weakened due mostly to the capital account. International
reserves reached US$ 15.2 billion by end April 2012, equivalent to 2.6 months of projected imports of
goods and services, while they stood at US$ 26.4 billion by June 2011. BoP information to December
showed a current account deficit of US$ 1.8 billion and a capital outflow of US$ 4.5 billion. The
September current account deficit was high by historical standards, it was associated with an atypical
oil trade balance results. During H1 FY12, the current account balance deficit soared to US$ 4 billion
(1.6 percent of GDP) up from US$1.3 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) in H1 FY11. The trade deficit is
explained by a 24 percent y-o-y increase in petroleum imports that reached US$ 5.3 billion, up from
US$ 4 billion in H1 FY11, an extraordinarily high figure reminiscent of the pre-global crisis levels of
2008. Exports slightly increased to reach US$ 13.5 billion in H1 FY12, increasing by 7 percent
compared to H1 FY11 driven mainly by oil exports. Other exports declined by 5 percent y-o-y, to
reach US$6.8 billion, down from US$ 7.2 billion in H1 FY11.

11.      The fiscal deficit is expected to be higher than the budgeted figure for FY12. The
FY11fiscal deficit closed slightly higher than expected, at 9.8 percent of GDP. The FY12 deficit is
expected to be 9.2 percent of GDP, exceeding the 8.6 percent of GDP target originally budgeted. This
increase is due to increased public spending, especially on wages and social benefits, and a revenue
shortfall due to a fall in economic activity and trade. The overall fiscal deficit increased in H1-FY12.
The fiscal deficit of the budget sector (narrow definition) increased from 4.4 percent of GDP in H1-
FY11 to 4.7 percent of GDP in H1-FY12, (Table 1). Up to December 2011, the observed fiscal deficit
was LE 73 billion, equivalent to 9.4 percent of the semester’s GDP, higher than last year’s LE 60
billion, or 8.9 percent of GDP, during the same period.

12.      Public spending increased by 17.7 percent in H1-FY12, due mostly to higher wages,
subsidies, and interest payments. This increase in public spending (Figure 2) was mainly due to
higher compensation of employees (up by 27.3 percent in H1-FY12), higher subsidies and social
benefits (up by 37.0 percent), and higher interest payments (up by 23.3 percent), especially those
related to the domestic debt (increasing by 24.1 percent). By contrast, investment decreased by 29.4
percent in H1-FY12.

13.      To reduce pressure on the State budget, electricity subsidies were eliminated for energy-
intensive sectors. The cabinet approved a discontinuation of electricity subsidies for energy-intensive
sectors, such as those producing petrochemicals, aluminum, ceramic and steel. The change was to be
retroactive to January. Energy intensive sectors consume about 80 percent of total fuel oil
consumption and 15 percent of total natural gas usage. Both fuel oil and natural gas account for
approximately 25 percent of total energy subsidies.

14.     Revenues increased thanks to grants and other income, while tax revenue fell as a share of
GDP. Given the slowdown in economic activity and trade, taxes on income, profits, and capital gains
and those on goods and services increased at lower growth rates. In addition, taxes on international
trade decreased by 8 percent during the semester ending in December. On the other hand, grants
(especially from foreign governments) and property income increased significantly, bringing total
revenues up by 16.9 percent in H1-FY12.

15.     Domestic public debt has continued its upward trend with increasing interest rates. The net
domestic debt of the general government increased from 47.6 percent of GDP in June 2010, to 54.6
percent in March 2012. Interest rates on one-year T-bills reached 15.9 percent in March 2012.
Furthermore, the CBE sold US$ 1.53 billion and US$ 1 billion worth of one year, dollar-denominated
treasury bills with a weighted average yield of 3.87 percent and 3.88 percent in November 2011 and
December 2011 respectively. By contrast, gross external debt decreased by 2 percent (y-o-y) at end of
September 2011, reaching 12.9 percent of GDP.

Financial Sector Background and Reforms Supported by the Bank

16.      The government of Egypt pursued a major Financial Sector Reform agenda (2004-2008) that
was consistent with the recommendations of the joint IMF-World Bank 2002 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP). The program included restructuring and privatizing of state-owned
banks, 2 reforming the insurance sector (including restructuring the state-owned insurers), developing a
          1F




new system of mortgage finance for a more sustainable housing market, and strengthening financial
regulatory capacity and financial supervision apparatus. The first generation of these reforms, which
was also characterized by in-depth diagnoses, balance sheet strengthening, development of detailed
strategies for the banking and non-banking sectors, and improved corporate governance (including
privatizing one bank), was supported by the First and Second Financial Sector Development Policy
Loans (DPL I and DPL II).

17.      Prior to this reform program, the financial sector in Egypt faced major challenges. Issues
identified in the 2002 FSAP and subsequent pre-appraisal diagnoses for the DPLs included the fact
that the banking system, which was dominated by public ownership, was burdened by high NPLs that
were not adequately provisioned. The non-bank financial sector was characterized by underdeveloped
bond, insurance, and mortgage markets, and thin trading in equities. Moreover, two of the state-
owned insurers were financially distressed and approximately 25 percent of private pension plans were

significantly underfunded. In addition, the whole system was characterized by weak corporate
governance, an inadequate regulatory and supervisory framework, and poor financial infrastructure.

18.      The first generation reforms, which the Bank supported, reaped positive results. For the first
time in recent history, the banking sector is now majority-owned by the private sector and open to
competition—through the privatization of the fourth largest state-owned bank, Bank of Alexandria,
and divestiture of 94 percent of state-owned banks’ shares in joint venture banks. The banking sector
was consolidated, and the number of banks was reduced from 57 to 39 banks by raising and enforcing
minimum capital requirements. Other achievements included the financial, operational, and
institutional restructuring of the remaining state-owned banks, including in the settlement of 60
percent of NPLs of the state-owned enterprises, and the operational restructuring of the state-owned
commercial banks in three critical areas (human resource development, risk management, and
information technology), as well as the adoption of a detailed program for capacity building in
banking regulation and supervision.

19.      On the non-banking front, 3 the reform program entailed the comprehensive restructuring of
the insurance sector (including reducing public ownership and overhauling the legal and regulatory
framework), establishing a new mortgage finance system and a liquidity facility4, beginning reforms
of private pensions, and deepening and strengthening the efficiency of capital markets and institutions.
In addition, the program included developing a strategy for micro-lending through non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs) to enhance access to finance and achieve a more inclusive financial system.

20.      The success of the First and Second DPLs and the Government’s desire to sustain and enhance
the first generation reforms and support forward-looking second generation reform program in the
context of a still-risky global environment led to the Government’s request for a Third Financial
Sector DPL.. The main challenges for the government of Egypt included low financial intermediation,
low levels of credit to the private sector, relatively high intermediation costs, and limited innovation.
In addition, further work was required on strengthening supervision, preparing the state-owned
insurers for a more competitive environment, and supporting improvements in financial sector
infrastructure.

21.      DPLIII’s main objective was to support the government’s second generation Financial Sector
Reform Program (2009–2012), aimed at building up a financial system that was more inclusive,
competitive and effective in financial intermediation. This was expected to lead to a financial sector
capable of contributing to Egypt’s growth performance and providing access to a broader segment of
Egypt’s population, and combat the adverse consequences of the global economic crisis. Reforms
envisioned further strengthening of the banking system, including continued operational and financial
restructuring of both the state-owned commercial and specialized banks; settling the remaining NPLs
of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); providing adequate provisioning for any outstanding NPLs; as well
as scaling up banker-training focused on serving small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A Bank
Financial Intermediary Loan of US$300 million for Enhancing Access for Micro and Small
Enterprises was approved in March 2010.

  Other achievements in the non-banking sector included: (i) establishment of the Institute of Directors to develop and train
middle and upper level managers in adopting and implementing corporate governance procedures and rules; (ii)
establishment of the Insurance Protection Fund to cover investors against non-commercial risk; (iii) strengthening of the
government debt market, through increases in the share of tradable debt, publication of quarterly borrowing plans for t-bills
and bonds, introduction of a new system of primary dealers in treasury bonds, and lengthening of the average debt maturity;
and (iv) amendment of various laws and executive regulations, related to creditors’ rights, payments system, and stamp duties
to improve the institutional infrastructure of the financial sector.

Finance Project and the Affordable Mortgage Finance Program DPL.

                                                    In addition, private borrowers were not interested
                                                    in borrowing due to the overall uncertain
economic environment and the security situation. Credit of the banking sector to the government has
continued to accelerate (Figure 1); it grew by 41.4 percent in December 2011 and 45.3 percent in
January 2012. Credit in the private sector grew by 6.1 percent in December 2011 and 5.4 percent in
January 2012. The government’s share in total credit increased to 53 percent in January 2012, up from
45.2 percent in January 2011. The private sector’s share shrank to 43 percent in January 2012, from
50.7 percent in January 2011, when it was starting to pick up right before the revolution.

Rationale for Bank Involvement in DPL III

23.      The World Bank involvement in DPL III was fully consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) of May 20, 2005, covering the period 2006–2009, and the CAS Progress Report for
the period of 2006–2011. DPL III addressed two key strategic objectives of CAS, namely to enhance
the capacity of the financial system and facilitate private sector development. DPL III was fully
consistent with the strategy articulated in the CAS and further confirmed in 2008 in the CAS Progress
Report (one of the main thrusts of this strategy was to help “further implement reforms in the financial
sector, including to broaden access to finance?). Moreover, the CAS Progress Report lending program
was indicative, with an explicit mention that it would be implemented with flexibility. The CAS
Progress Report (paragraph 36) mentioned criteria that would be used to select operations going to the
Board, namely: (i) priorities expressed by the government—DPL III was a priority to the Egyptian
government at the highest political level; and (ii) financial exposure consideration. While the DPL III
was not explicitly mentioned in the CAS and the CAS Progress Report, it fitted within both the overall
engagement strategy and the IBRD envelope. Since 2000, the Bank has worked closely with the
government on financial sector development issues, which has been of great benefit to Egypt to
develop the policy, legislative and institutional foundations for a sound and stable financial system.
The Bank has been supporting the Government of Egypt in the implementation of the financial sector
reform program, through an integral package of analytical work, technical assistance, advisory
services, and lending (IBRD).
24.      The DPL III operation was in response to a government request in 2010 for support to its
Second Financial Reform Program (2009-2010) and therefore crucial for supporting the continuation
and deepening of the financial sector reforms, especially after the global financial crisis that began in
2008. It was also important for increasing the irreversibility of the reforms—a key factor that helped to
maintain the dialogue with the authorities when the revolution started, which was not predicted at
appraisal time. There is ample evidence showing a strong and causal relationship between financial
sector development and both economic growth and poverty reduction. Having an efficient financial

system that can deliver essential services makes material contributions to a country’s economic
development. Greater financial development increases growth, reduces economic volatility, creates job
opportunities and improves income distribution, as has been well established by a substantial quantity
of empirical literature.6

25.     The Bank was uniquely placed for this operation given its ability to assemble a cohesive team
of individuals with the required technical skills and relevant experience in other countries. The Bank
also has the capacity to credibly interface with the government and industry counterparts while taking
a completely objective approach. The Bank also was able to leverage this operation through provision
of significant technical assistance and knowledge transfer, for example, the FIRST projects and
assistance in pension reform . This operation was also in response to the government’s request for the
Bank to help play a coordinating role in channeling the financial and technical support of other donors
and development partners to the financial sector within a common framework.

26.      It is worth noting that although each of the three financial sector DPLs built upon the results
made by its predecessor, each DPL was a stand-alone operation and not part of programmatic series.
Three separate operations were considered more underpinning to irreversible policy measures, as
disbursement would occur upon the realizations of up front, specific actions under each phase. This
would in turn ensure more stringent government commitment to the comprehensive implementation of
the reform program.

1.2.       Original Program Development Objectives (PDO), Policy Areas, and Key Indicators

27.     The main objective of the operation was to assist Egyptian authorities in further developing
the enabling environment for financial intermediation and financial access, and to increase private
participation in the provision of financial services, through a strengthened bank and non-bank financial
system. This operation supported the government’s second generation Financial Sector Reform
Program (2009–2012), which was aimed at building a financial system that is more inclusive,
competitive and effective in financial intermediation. This, in turn, would contribute to the sustained
growth of the Egyptian economy and combat the adverse consequences of the global economic crisis.

28.      To this effect, the World Bank operation sought to achieve: (i) financial and operational
restructuring of commercial and specialized state-owned banks; (ii) strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory architecture of the banking sector; (iii) reforming the non-bank financial sector, including
finalizing the legal and operational restructuring of the state-owned insurers, adding to access
opportunities and developing the retail investment market; (iv) strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the non-bank financial sector, largely through the vehicle of the new
integrated non-bank supervisor; and (v) improving the financial infrastructure.

29.        These outcomes were to be measured by key indicators in five areas (pillars), as follows:

30.      Pillar I: Financial and operational restructuring of commercial and specialized state-owned
banks: (i) decline in NPLs-to-total loans; (ii) increase in provisions-to-NPLs; (iii) decline in SOEs’
NPLs; (iv) capital adequacy of the banking system ratio; (v) PBDAC improvement in coverage ratio;
(vi) increase in number of PBDAC products.

31.      Pillar II: Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory architecture of the banking sector:
(i) 100 percent of Egyptian banks adopting Basel II; (ii) periodic stress testing of the aggregate balance
sheet of the banking sector and individual banks; (iii) publication of a Financial Stability Report (at

1.3.     Revised PDO and Key Indicators

35.      The PDO and the key indicators have remained the same during the life of the operation.

1.4.     Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

36.      The five original program areas were the same as the five mutually enforcing pillars described
above, which built on major improvements in soundness, stability, access, and risk management. The
first area/pillar contained measures to enhance the efficiency of state-owned commercial and
specialized banks in financial intermediation and widen access to financial services through extensive
branch networks. The second pillar included actions that aimed at strengthening the resiliency of the
financial system through improving the regulatory and supervisory architecture of the banking sector.
The third focused on reforming the insurance and pension sectors, and improving the efficiency of the
capital market to expand the reach of the non-bank financial sector to remote and underdeveloped
areas. The fourth included measures that aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory
framework for the non-bank financial sector and enable further expansion of access to finance through
non-bank financial institutions. The fifth comprised measures to improve the financial infrastructure
and the legal framework, with the objective of enhancing the financial stability and safety of the
payments system, and extending access to payments to low income and rural households.

1.5.     Revised Policy Areas

37.      The policy areas were not revised during the life of the operation.

1.6.     Other significant changes

38.     There were no changes made to the operation from the design stage to the completion of the
operation.

2.2.         Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment 7

The Egyptian authorities’ commitment to the reform program was key to the success of this operation.
The extensive consultations with the stakeholders helped in building consensus and ownership of
reforms by the market players. At the same time, strong partnership has been established between the
Bank and the Egyptian authorities over the past years through an integrated financial sector work
program, reflected in an effective policy dialogue, analytical work, technical assistance, and key
operations, focusing on financial sector development. The operation’s team had a strong and
professional policy dialogue with the Egyptian main counterpart, namely the Central Bank of Egypt,
as well as EFSA that was in charge of NBFIs. The Bank team has also worked closely with the
Ministry of Investment, the Ministry of Finance, the Stock Exchange, and the Misr Insurance Holding
Company. Commitment to the reform program was maintained even after the revolution

and this DPL were significantly enhanced by the analytical work carried out.9 Several Bank studies
provided strong analytical underpinning to the design of this operation and have helped identify areas
that required further reforms. These studies included the 2002 FSAP; the 2007 FSAP Update; the 2005,
2006 and 2009 Investment Climate Assessments; the 2007 Finance for All: Policies and Pitfalls in
Expanding Access; the 2008 Access to Finance and Economic Growth in Egypt; the 2009 Egypt
Macro Policy Note; the 2010 Determinants of Savings in Egypt Report; in addition to the updates of
the 2004 Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC); and
the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), which assessed the fiduciary risk
based approach on the implementation of the Public Financial Management Action Plan. In addition
the growing technical capacity of the Bank’s Egyptian counterparts has supported the analytical effort.

Assessment of the Operation’s Design 10

41.     The design of the operation was well-thought-out. The operation was a one-tranche operation
to support the government in implementing the second generation Financial Sector Reform Program.
The design was influenced by the findings and recommendations of the 2006 IEG review, which noted
that outcomes of loans classified under the Financial Sector Board were significantly better than
outcomes of financial sector components of multi-sector loans. 11

42.     The operation reflected lessons learnt and benefited from the experience of earlier World Bank
loans in Egypt. Excellent coordination among donors ensured synergy and effective support to the
program. The reforms already implemented have contributed to the resiliency of the financial system
throughout the global financial crisis, as well as the immediate impacts of the revolution.

43.      DPL III was a single tranche, program loan, rather than part of a programmatic series of
development policy loans for a number of reasons, most importantly that the Second Generation of
Reforms and the supported actions had not existed, been identified, or considered possible at the time
of the original Financial Sector Reform Program (2004-2008). First, the Second Generation of
Financial Reforms (2009-2012) supported by DPL III naturally included a continuation of
strengthening of commercial banks and the regulation and supervision of commercial banks and non-
banks such as insurance and pensions. For commercial banks and the financial system, this included
macro-prudential supervision, which had not yet been developed in 2004 and Basel II, which was only
issued by the Basel Committee in June 2004 and has been steadily modified since then. Second, the
Second Generation of Financial Reform also moved to strengthening and reform of the state-owned
specialized banks, which had not been included in the Government’s 2004-2008 Financial Sector
Reform Program because of their small market share (less than 5 percent for the three banks). Third
DPL III included a number of legal changes not foreseen under the initial Financial Sector Reform
Program, notably a law converting the specialized Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural
Credit into a commercial bank with improved governance, a Non-bank Financial Intermediary Law
that would put micro-finance institutions on a sounder basis, a Private Pensions Law, and granting
licenses for mobile phone payments. Fourth, DPL III was two years after DPL II and could not
commit a new Government, which in practice is proving to be very different than the last Government.
Fifth, the request for DPL III from the Government also included support for combating the adverse
effects of the Global Financial Crisis on the financial system, which was unseen in 2004 but which
were still an issue in 2010.

Relevance of Risks Identified

44.      Risks identified at appraisal were relevant, and mitigating factors were embedded in the
design, but obviously the risks of the January 25 Revolution and its implications were not. At appraisal,
there were two types of risks: (i) country risks, including political risk, stakeholders’ opposition, and
fiscal sustainability risk; and (ii) operational risks, including the governance risks associated with
restructuring and recapitalizing state-owned banks, and the risk of non-sustainability and reversibility
of the reform program. The major risk at the time of appraisal was associated with the uncertainty in
the political sphere—Parliamentary elections, in May and November of 2010, as well as Presidential
elections that were to take place in September 2011. Although there were uncertainties regarding
cabinet change, it was considered comforting that the CBE, the operation’s main counterpart, was a
separate and independent entity and its Governor (whose term was scheduled to end in 2011, after the
closing date of the operation) has been a strong advocate for and engineer of the current reform
program.

45.      The risk of having a revolution in Egypt was of course not envisioned at appraisal, nor by any
analyst, but the operation did flag some political and governance risks at appraisal. 12 As mentioned
earlier, although there were several changes in Cabinets, Prime Ministers, and ministers, as well as
heads of authorities, the central bank’s management has not changed. In fact the Governor of CBE was
renewed for another four year term on November 2011. Fortunately, the operation’s main counterpart
CBE remained unchanged after the revolution, although the whole political system in the country was
revamped with the stepping-down of the former President, the dissolution of Parliament, and the
appointment of an interim government.

46.     Nevertheless, the success and sustainability of the financial sector policy reform hinges on a
stable and predictable macroeconomic environment, which may be more difficult to sustain in light of
the revolution and a new political regime. The risks associated with the January revolution were totally
unexpected—and imply much greater risks for the sustainability of the results of operation than
considered at appraisal.

Post Revolution Risks and Potential Challenges for the Financial Sector

47.      Despite the surprisingly good performance of the banking system during the global financial
crisis and the problems arising from the developments in January–February 2011, various issues could
arise during the coming period, until a new President is elected, a new constitution is in place, and the
directions of policies become much clearer. These issues, discussed below, may affect both the
financial sector reform program and, more generally, the financial sector’s ability to mobilize
resources and intermediate them efficiently to support development.

48.      Increased risks can be divided into risks to the financial reforms, including those supported by
DPL III, and more general risks arising from macroeconomic deterioration. Regarding the risks to
financial reforms, there are concerns of possible setbacks in reforms oriented towards private-sector
led growth. The sentiments over the past year have been against privatization and sale of public assets.
Even the sale of Bank of Alexandria, which was sold in October 2006 at well above its book value,
was attacked by the media. This accompanied condemnation of some members of the private sector
that are alleged to have benefited from improper behavior and, could lead to condemnation of a market
oriented economy and private-sector led growth. The reforms that the Egyptian authorities have
undertaken over the past years were based on solid analytical work that has been conducted jointly by

                                                                 11
the IMF-World Bank, the 2002 FSAP and 2007 FSAP Follow-up, which was complemented by
technical support and advisory services from development partners, including the USAID, EU and
AfDB; based on international best practice. Hopefully, the new regime’s assessment of these policies
will be based on their implications on the financial sector and Egypt’s growth and poverty reduction,
and not their association with the previous regime.

49.      Under populist pressure and condemnation of the private sector, a new government may be
tempted to allocate credit to sectors considered more important or strategic. Although such a process
may seem obvious to some, experience world-wide has shown that ultimately, it would add to the
volume of NPLs; further limits the availability of funds to non-preferred clients; and require
government injections of funds into the banking system, problems that were similar to those of the
Egyptian financial system some years ago—prior to the financial sector reform program supported by
the series of DPLs. The CBE has indicated clearly that they would not allow the allocation of credit on
non economic or commercial viable terms. During the reform, CBE established the necessary
grounds/fundamentals in terms of risk management, internal control environment and credit
underwriting to ensure non-occurrence of extending loans to customers based on preference or
subjective criteria.

50.     More specifically, risks to the financial system reform and DPL III relate to the lack of
passage of a number of laws. The dissolution of the Parliament delayed the issuance of several key
laws. The newly elected Parliament faces an overload and may face major political challenges in any
new directions it decides to make, in particular, legislation to improve the functioning of the financial
system and making finance more accessible, particularly if it relates to greater private presence. This
potential problem could affect the results of DPLIII in the areas of non-bank financial institutions
(NBFI), licensing, the regulation of private pension funds, pre-paid healthcare companies,
amendments to the Mortgage Finance Law and Financial Leasing Law, and the legal changes in the
Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit Law, which were approved by the Cabinet
but delayed initially by a legislative backlog at the end of 2011 and subsequently by the post January
25 events, the dissolution of Parliament, and then the political overload in the new Parliament.

51.      NBFI reforms also were slowed due to various reasons associated with the revolution, as well
as the failure to replace the Minister of Investment. The Ministry of Investment and EFSA, sub-units
initially were established to ensure the effective implementation of the various reforms related to the
non-bank financial sector. However, this has not been slowed due to the revolution and several other
factors. The move to a full risk based supervisory approach at EFSA has been disrupted by the
voluntary departure of the first Chairman of EFSA, who could not be replaced due to the freeze on
upper level appointments. Also, the Minister of Investment, the counterpart in the 2007 FSAP,
resigned and was not replaced, even before the resignation of the previous government in February
2012, which affected the ministry and the non-bank financial sector.

52.      The state-owned insurers currently        Table 2: State-owned Insurer General and Administrative
have at least double the staffing levels they      Expense Rates
need to operate effectively and many staff are     ( as a percentage of gross premium revenues)

rates are still sustainable and competitive
thanks to the scale of the state insurers (Table A10.1) and branch rationalization, this trend cannot
continue without affecting the long term viability of the two insurers; particularly if investment returns
are under pressure. Defined benefits private pension funds will also see funding levels reduced
materially if a combination of rapid salary increases and reduced returns continues for even a few
years.
                                                   12
53.      Possible loss of high quality staff in state-owned banks and CBE could occur, with the
significant cut in their wages and change in management. Such staff is needed to run the improved
lending processes and enhanced risk management techniques that were part of the reforms. With the
operational and institutional restructuring of the state-owned banks, high caliber staff was recruited
and potentially competent staff was trained and well compensated based on performance. Hence, staff
quality improved significantly to operate the much improved processes for lending and for risk
management in general, as well as the regulatory and supervisory processes of the CBE. These
improvements have played an important role in reducing the system’s NPLs. A risk exists that these
qualified personnel might leave and take positions in international banks outside Egypt if their real
salaries in Egypt are reduced or working conditions deteriorate. The departure of these personnel
would, in turn, contribute to a return of NPLs and a further limit on the banks’ capacity to lend. More
generally the lack of certainty regarding future government policy, combined with frequent requests to
provide information arising from public complaints, is distracting key officials in the government and
SOEs and making some vulnerable to approaches from other countries in the region that are
experiencing severe shortages of qualified people.

54.      A major macro-financial risk issue is the potential for inflation, damaging to the poor and the
financial sector, and “crowding-out? of credit to the private sector by government deficits borrowing.
The higher government deficit and the sell-off of its bonds indicate the risk of pressures on the central
bank to finance and monetize the deficit creating inflation, and for public sector borrowing to crowd
out bank lending to the private sector. If the government spends beyond its revenues from taxes and
fees, plus its international funding from grants and borrowing, then it must borrow from the domestic
economy, largely the banks, thereby crowding out private borrowing. In order for private activity to
expand, whether in micro-, small-, medium- or large-enterprises, the government must allow room for
bank loans to the private sector.

55.      An increase in NPLs in the banking system is likely following the contraction in economic
activities and the aftermath of the revolutionary turmoil, particularly if low growth continues. A key
sector that has been significantly affected is tourism but construction, mining, and manufacturing have
also suffered. Tourist arrivals and hotel occupancy fell substantially in what is normally the “high?
season. Construction and demand for investment goods are likely to be lower as a result of uncertainty
regarding the policy stance of the new Parliament and the new President.. The operational capacity of
the factories of the groups that came under investigation as a result of the revolution has so-far not
been affected as they continue running under the management of technocrats. However, they have
been affected negatively by the economic situation and the political uncertainty. This could have
negative implications on performance of the loans of borrowers in these sectors. Concerns over
transfers of property or takeovers of assets could also lead to higher NPLs. The stress testing
conducted by the CBE in April 2011 showed that the bank’s capital cushion would be able to absorb
such an increase. The CBE is closely monitoring and supervising all banks to ensure that any financial
weaknesses are addressed in a timely manner. Nonetheless, risk remains associated with
macroeconomic developments, particularly if growth remains low for a prolonged period or
government policy and changes in the political environment lead to generalized defaults by borrowers.

56.     A significant macroeconomic risk to insurers and pension funds in the medium-term is that
rates of investment return drop, and in the case that Misr Life state employee salary costs increase
rapidly at the same time, adding significantly to the need to strengthen retirement fund group life
reserves for certain categories of state employee. The contribution of investment income to insurers’
results has already reduced (the return on investment for the state-owned insurers dropped from
13.8 percent in 2006/7 to 8.5 percent in 2010/11 despite improved debtor ratios), although steps are
being taken to counter this by, for example, moving terms deposits into government paper and
reducing equity exposures. The maximum salary issue is not currently a problem for the management
of state-owned insurers because reasonably high minimum salaries apply. However any moves to


                                                   13
further reduce salary caps could see a significant loss of critical skills and experience. EFSA is likely
to see some losses as some senior officer’s salaries have been savagely cut.

Banks’ profits are likely to be lower with the rise in the expense ratio of banks due to the rise of staff
salaries across-the-board. The government increased nominal salaries in the public sector and
pensions by 15 percent, effective April 2011. This increase was followed by demands for similar or
greater increases in the financial sector. Total increases in banks’ personnel costs have ranged from 15
to 30 percent. These increases not only reduce banks’ earnings and their ability to continue increasing
capital but contribute to cost pressures that may lead to further demands for nominal adjustments in
the coming months. Personnel costs are likely to rise as a result of the higher labor costs that followed
the government’s announcement of a 15 percent increase in wages, salaries and benefits for its
employees and the settlement of strikes in individual banks, in some cases at even higher increases.
Revenues are likely to be negatively affected by the lower demand for investment and lower GDP
growth. In addition, the higher NPLs noted above will require more provisioning. All this along with
a possible decline in revenue could lead to a drop in banks’ profitability and earnings ratios.

2.3.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

57.     M&E design. A set of qualitative and quantitative intermediate outcome indicators were
defined to monitor progress towards the achievement of the Program Development Objectives (PDO).
The M&E framework was established during the design of the operation for the clear purpose of
monitoring progress against the agreed upon benchmarks as outlined in DPL III Operational Policy
Matrix (see Annex 4). These indicators were selected in agreement with government counterparts,
taking into account the availability of data, their relevance and feasibility.

58.      Qualitative operational expected policy outcomes were selected to monitor progress in the
execution of the Financial Sector Reform Program and the operation. Quantitative indicators were
selected in areas where data was available, such as: (i) performance indicators of commercial and
specialized state-owned banks, such as NPLs-to-total loans, provisions-to-NPLs, capital adequacy
ratio, coverage ratio; (ii) 100 percent of Egyptian banks have adopted the Basel II framework;
(iii) improved transparency of risk recognition in the financial system through broader communication
with the financial community by the publication of a Financial Stability Report, and conducting
regular stress-testing; (iv) performance indicators of the insurance sector and the capital market, such
as gross non-life premium to GDP, the number of mutual funds, new bond issues; (v) issuance and
enactment of Law 10 of 2009, as well as improved performance indicators for NBFIs; (vi) individuals
receiving government payments through financial institutions; (vii) mobile phone payments
transactions and mobile phone payment products launched.

59.      M&E implementation. Data availability was adequate to follow up on the policy dialogue
initiated during preparation of the operation. The program was jointly implemented by CBE and the
Ministry of Investment. CBE was the Executing Agency for the aspects of the program dealing with
the banking sector. Within the CBE, a Bank Restructuring Unit (BRU) was set up as the focal point
for implementation of banking reforms. The BRU, headed by the Deputy Governor, a former
international banker, is staffed with highly qualified and experienced professionals, many of whom
were specially recruited for the purpose of implementing the banking reform program. At the Ministry
of Investment, EFSA was responsible for implementing measures related to the non-bank financial
sector.

60.      Monitoring of the implementation of the operation was done regularly from the field, due to
the fact that the TTL of the operation is field-based. The supervision from the field provided therefore
an important channel through which the World Bank team was able to continue to support and advise
the government on the next steps. Also, missions were equipped with high- level international experts.
These missions provided sound technical advice to the authorities. In addition, the team was
                                                   14
responsive to clients' needs and changes in the market after the revolution, and shared their expertise
with authorities to mitigate all unexpected risks. Post-revolution, an emergency supervision mission
took place to guide authorities on means to mitigate unexpected risks associated with the revolution,
and might emerge with the political and economic developments.

61.      M&E utilization. Armed with the information collected from the first ever independent
financial due diligence of the state-owned banks exercise, the Bank in coordination with the BRU was
able to follow up on the implementation of the plans to restructure the state-owned banks and enhance
their governance structure. Specific indicators were designed and monitored through meetings with
the state-owned banks’ management to monitor progress in cleaning up the balance sheets, upgrading
their IT systems to prepare them for the new competitive and risk management environment. The
Bank’s supervision mission’s discussions with the BRU and the state-owned banks also helped the
Bank’s staff monitor progress in implementing these restructuring plans and to pave the way for more
reforms in the future. The most important element of M&E utilization was post-revolution. This is
when there was an urgent need to closely and adequately monitor the performance of the financial
sector during the political and economic crisis. The monitoring indicators developed with the World
Bank support helped significantly the authorities in mitigating the risks. For example, the World Bank
team moved promptly with a mission of experts to help the central bank in conducting stress testing,
and in developing the model to include more projections and different scenarios to enable CBE to
address any problems at an early stage.

2.4.    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

62.      In response to the Arab Spring, the Bank has articulated a Framework for Engagement in the
MENA Region that proposes to do things differently and to provide support that could not be provided
before. Given the political and economic uncertainties facing Egypt in the near term, the Bank
presented an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) as an indicative program of support over an 18-month period,
June 2012 through December 2013. The main focus of the three pillars of this ISN are economic
management, jobs, and inclusion. The ISN does not envision a financial sector operation in the
transition period.

63.      A follow-up operation with a special focus on improving the efficiency and outreach of the
NBFI sector, and enhancing the capacity building of its presently poorly structured regulator is
expected. This would include a comprehensive agenda for the development of non-bank financial
institutions and securities markets, with the objective of building a more diverse and balanced
financial system, capable of providing a broader range of financial services to a wide range of clients
while managing risks effectively. DPL III has paved the way and built a platform for such an operation
to occur, when there is greater clarity regarding the political landscape after Presidential elections
planned for May through June 2012.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1.    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

64.     The main objective of the operation, as mentioned earlier was to assist Egyptian authorities in
further developing the enabling environment for financial intermediation and financial access, and
increase private participation in the provision of financial services, through a strengthened bank and
non-bank financial system by supporting the Government’s second generation Financial Sector
Reform Program of 2009–2012 (DPL III PAD, p.31). The second generation Financial Sector
Financial Reforms aimed at building up a financial system that would be stronger and more effective
in financial intermediation, competitive, and inclusive, This system would contribute to Egypt’s
growth performance and improve access to credit and financial services, for a broader segment of
Egypt’s population, and combat the adverse consequences of the global financial deleveraging and
resultant economic crisis, as requested by the government. By providing support to the second
                                                  15
generation of the reform program, this operation contributed to the sustainability and continuity of
financial reforms and, therefore, to the fulfillment of their final objectives.

65.      The design of DPL III was highly aligned with the country’s priorities and CAS. The
operation was also designed in a truly participatory way through frequent meetings with all key
stakeholders and technical counterparts in the government, state-owned financial enterprises, private
sector, academia, and regulatory bodies, which ensured ownership and commitment; in addition to
other market players; and stakeholders.

66.     The objectives continued to be relevant at ICR preparation as follows:
         DPL III is consistent with the strategic objectives of the 2008 Country Assistance Strategy
        Progress Report and is aligned with the Bank Group’s 2007 Strategy for the Financial Sector,
        which emphasizes the use of Bank policy-based lending in support of market reform and the
        strengthening and expansion of access.
         The Egyptian authorities’ have shown a commitment, both before and after the revolution,
        to financial sector reforms, as they are demonstrably linked to growth and poverty reduction,
        as well as addressing governance and transparency issues. They are fundamental to reforms in
        other sectors as well, including private sector development, infrastructure, housing and social
        policies, being inherently integrated with national pension and health social insurance reform.
         Strengthened regulation and supervision and financial infrastructure act as a steady
        promoter of financial growth, economic growth, and poverty reduction and reduces the
        frequency and cost of financial crises—as evident in the Egyptian financial sector’s
        weathering of the global financial crisis and the Euro-zone crisis, and overcoming the
        immediate impacts of the revolution.
         The mitigation of the effects of financial crises is essential for preventing major economic
        crises, social unrest, and poverty reduction.
         Further reforms in the financial sector, especially post-revolution, could be pursued under
        future operations. Building a sound, competitive, and inclusive financial system is a long-term
        endeavor that requires years of reforms and implementation to fulfill the objectives fully.

67.      Thus, the relevance of objectives, design and implementation is considered satisfactory,
based on: (i) the consistency of the program with government and Bank priorities; (ii) quality of the
design, with a clear focus on the resolution of the problem of NPLs, the financial and operational
restructuring of state-owned commercial and specialized banks, the strengthening the non-bank
financial sector while improving its efficiency and competitiveness, improving the overall financial
infrastructure, and strengthening of the legal, regulatory and supervisory capacity of the banking sector
and the non-bank financial sector; and (iii) adequate implementation, that resulted in increased
sustainability of supported reforms, as evident in the resiliency of the financial sector in weathering
the economic crisis and the immediate impacts of the revolution. Egypt’s commercial banks seemed
well capitalized after the revolution, as evidenced by the CBE’s severe stress testing. The
capitalization of banks was high at the end of December 2011—15.6 percent of risk weighted assets
compared to 10 percent required, which acted as a cushion in times of crises. A severe stress test
performed in 2011 by CBE where the loan portfolio was down-graded by two notches; bank profits cut
by 25 percent, and the value of collaterals by 50 percent, indicated that the Tier one capital ratio would
still exceed 11 percent.

3.2.    Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Achievement of Development Program Objectives is considered satisfactory

68.     Significant progress has been made in the implementation of the second generation reforms
supported by the operation. Key achievements are listed in Annex 8. However, the revolution and it
                                                   16
effects were unforeseen, and there were a number of other unexpected developments after Board
approval of DPL III in May 25, 2010. These developments had implications for both the banking and
non-bank sectors, as well as for the regulatory and supervisory framework and financial infrastructure
development. They include delays on the non-bank financial institutions front, due to the fact that the
Minister of Investment has not been replaced since his resignation in September 2010 and the
unexpected voluntary departure of the first Chairman of EFSA. Parliamentary passage of certain laws
and amendments that had been approved by the Cabinet (the NBFI law, legal changes that reformed
the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit, regulation of private pensions, and
amendments to the Mortgage Finance Law and the Financial Leasing Law) was delayed by the
overload of Parliament in the second half of 2010 and the dissolution of Parliament after the
revolution, and are expected to be further delayed by the overloaded agenda of any new Parliament.

3.3.    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

69.     The overall outcome rating for DPL III is “satisfactory? based on meeting its key development
objectives, in making all the achievements listed in Section 3.2, and more broadly avoiding a systemic
financial crisis — although a force majeure event, the revolution, took place.

3.4.    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Poverty Impacts and Social Development

70.      Though DPL III did not have explicit social development outcomes as objectives, clearly the
shift from a public to a more market-oriented financial system with strong regulation and supervision
is expected to have a direct and positive impact on growth, employment, and crisis prevention, while
also increasing access of various social groups, including the poor, to financial services. Recent
evidence has shown that a developed financial system can help reduce poverty and income inequality.
Through its effect on growth, a mature financial system can also help reduce poverty, through the
strong, causal relationship between the depth and reach of financial systems and economic growth.

71.     Restoring the soundness of the state-owned insurance companies and increased innovation and
competition in the sector is enabling the industry to provide better quality products at a more
reasonable price. The measures aimed at addressing the soundness of private pension funds and
strengthening of the supervisory framework for NBFIs will ensure that the interest of retirees are
protected in the future and that their savings are well managed.

72.     Also, the policy measures outlined in this operation would improve the opportunities for
SMEs and for low income individuals to gain access to financial services, including female-headed
enterprises and for women. Mobile phones will provide a low-cost point of access for financial
services, which will benefit women due to the low barriers to entry in terms of cost, distance to travel,
and paperwork. In addition to better access to finance, women will also be brought into the financial
system through the government’s drive to offer pensions and public sector salaries through bank
accounts.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.     DPL III had, and will continue to have, a substantial institutional development impact in the
financial sector even though it was a single-tranche operation. The policies supported by the program
are rapidly transforming the Egyptian financial sector. Substantial capacity building provided to CBE,
is modernizing this institution while introducing state of the art risk management tools and IT systems
and will lead to the emergence of a robust bank supervisory and regulatory capacity in the country.

74.     The state-owned banks have undergone major reforms, which have significantly improved
                                                   17
their performance.. The comprehensive financial and operational restructuring of the state-owned
banks is modernizing these banks and enhancing their operating environment thereby contributing to
enhancing their capacity to increase intermediation and improve savings mobilization. Substantial
staff training sector wide, in and outside Egypt, will have a long lasting impact and will develop a pool
of financial skills hitherto not abundant in Egypt, thereby contributing to the sustainability of the
reforms.

75.      Further institutional strengthening is required for EFSA, where reforms effectively stalled
after the revolution, although insurance and pension supervision are now operating on a much more
professional basis than at the beginning of the reform program. Further support will be required if
EFSA is to develop the capacity to produce useful risk ratings for the institutions over which has
oversight responsibility.

        Not applicable

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
        Rating: Substantial

76.      Despite the strong performance of the CBE and the resiliency of the financial system that had
been supported by DPL III and the earlier DPLs, which have so far avoided a bank run and systemic
financial crisis; the unforeseen events of the Egyptian Revolution, which began in January 2011 and
the current Euro-zone crisis, have substantially worsened the risk to development outcomes, compared
to the assessment risks at loan appraisal. Financial rating agencies also have down-graded Egypt’s
ratings since the revolution. The events that led to these risks were unseen by all observers. These
resulting unforeseen risks were not taken into account during the appraisal of the operation (unlike
other risks that were foreseen during project preparation, and appraisal, and their mitigation measures
were considered and means of mitigation were identified). However, the Bank team has adjusted to
the new circumstances and will prompt support the authorities in mitigating the new risks.

77.      The revolution that began in Egypt in January 25, 2011, the subsequent developments
associated with it, as well as the current uncertainty has led to opportunities as well as a number of
challenges. As discussed earlier in some detail, these developments had a major bearing on the future
prospects for the economy, and the financial sector, and accordingly represent potential risks to the
operation’s sustainability. Clearly the change of regime and the uncertainty surrounding the interim
administration and the new government and constitution make it difficult to chart out progress and the
risks to it. As noted earlier, it is useful to separate the risks into macroeconomic risks that could affect
the financial sector, and risks that are specifically related to the financial sector. These two types of
risks are discussed below generally; a more extensive discussion, with more specific examples, is
contained in Section 1.

78.       Risks of a Deteriorating macroeconomic environment. The macroeconomic environment is
critical for the stability of the financial sector. Hence, the faltering growth following the global crisis
and the further slowdown post-revolution will have implications on the operation. So far, the
authorities have managed to mitigate some of these risks. Nonetheless, the slowdown is likely to lead
to a rise in NPLs, and deterioration in the asset quality of banks, especially in the most affected sectors
such as tourism and construction. It is also likely to reduce demand for loans by the private sector. In
addition, the worsening deficit of the government raises a) risks of inflation, from monetization of the
                                                    18
deficit by government borrowing from the central bank and any depreciation of the exchange rate
when international reserve sales are no longer to able to support it, which will hurt the poor and the
financial sector, and b) risks of crowding-out bank lending to micro-, small-, medium- and large
private enterprises because the government sells more bonds to the banks, a risk that has already
occurred as discussed in Section 1. This development has already had a major negative impact on
achievement of DPL’s goal of greater intermediation of deposits to private borrowers by the banks.

79.      Risk from the Erosion of international reserves and ratings downgrades. Substantial and
continuous erosion of Egypt's international reserves had taken place in 2011, however they have begun
to increase in April 2012. It accelerated in October and November 2011, along with ongoing political
turbulence which is delaying economic recovery and has contributed to worsened debt dynamics. CBE
has announced that net foreign reserves had fallen to reach US$15.5 billion as of May 2012 (compared
to US$ 36 billion in December 2010). Foreigners’ have largely liquidated their holdings of T-bills,
which in turn has led to compensating government sales of its debt to the banks, furthermore capital
outflows from T-bills have already bottomed which therefore alleviates further pressures on
International reserves from the capital account Egyptian sovereign ratings and banks’ ratings (which
generally must be worse than the sovereign rating), have been downgraded by three rating agencies.

80.     Direct risks to the financial sector. The lengthy transition to the new political regime, as well
as the new Parliament and the new president and the new constitution (drafters have recently been
chosen by the Parliament) already have and can have future major effects on the financial sector. As
noted numerous important laws for financial reform associated with DPLIII were not passed by
Parliament by because of its dissolution and its substantial overburdening with formulation of the new
regime. These laws or similar laws may not be passed. More generally, although Parliament seems to
appreciate the strong resiliency of the financial system to the changes in Egypt and the slow-down in
Europe, it may adopt a new approach to finance, for example, with less emphasis on the private sector,
controls on interest rates and increased government allocation of credit. The revolution has brought
tremendous political uncertainty for investors, and a new government will need a clear, market-
friendly strategy based on inclusive consultation to restore clarity and confidence, while enhancing
opportunity for new investors.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
      Rating: Satisfactory
81.     Bank performance is rated as satisfactory, for the following reasons: (i) the project team paid
particular attention to ensuring high quality at entry for this operation. The loan identification and
design were consistent with the CAS Progress Report, and the recommendations put forward by the
2002 FSAP, and the more recent 2007 FSAP Update (which was conducted after DPL II); (ii) the
Bank was instrumental in taking full advantage of a window of opportunity presented by the reform-
oriented Governor of CBE that led to this major progress on financial sector reform outcomes and
strengthening of the financial system; (iii) sound preparatory work, strong policy dialogue, good
working relationships with government counterparts, high level of consultation with market
participants, and Bank expertise led to the design of this operation; and (iv) the close coordination
with the USAID, IMF, EU, AfDB and other development partners, which ensured synergy that helped
the authorities build the necessary capacity to implement the project.




                                                   19
Quality of Supervision
        Rating: Highly Satisfactory
82.     Bank supervisory performance is rated as highly satisfactory. The supervision has gone
beyond the regular oversight of the project implementation, and provided advisory services and
guidance to the government on how to deal with the unforeseen risks associated with the unexpected
revolution of 2011. Monitoring of the implementation of the operation was performed regularly from
the field, in addition to conducting missions comprising high level international experts. These
missions provided sound and timely technical advice to the authorities. The supervision provided
therefore a crucial channel through which the World Bank team was able to continue to support and
advise the government on the next steps. Post-revolution, an emergency supervision mission was
conducted in May 2011—right after missions were allowed to resume work in Egypt. The policy
dialogue continued with official counterparts throughout supervision and afterward, despite change in
regime and government.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
         Rating: Satisfactory
83.      The rating of satisfactory is based on the following considerations: (i) the project was very
well designed, its PDO was in line with the Country’s and the Bank’s priorities, the intermediate
indicators were relevant and, helped focus the supervision; (ii) the Bank was aware of the challenges
involved in addressing the restructuring of major financial institutions so it adopted a flexible results
based framework and a risk mitigating strategy, in consultation with the authorities, who remained
committed to the implementation of the reforms despite the attendant high political risks; (iii) from
identification to closing, the team was extensively involved in a policy dialogue with the authorities
and independent counterparts (even after the revolution and change in political regime), collaborating
to ensure that strengthening the enabling environment for financial intermediation, resource
mobilization and risk management, and increasing the private sector role and participation in the
provision of financial services would be achieved; and (iv) the project team and the country office
developed a high level of cooperation that played a key role in the success of the operation.

5.2.    Borrower Performance
Government Performance
        Rating: Satisfactory
84.     From the design to implementation stage, the government was in the “driver seat? of seeking
advice from the Bank where needed to implement its strategic reform agenda. The authorities
remained focused on the success of the financial development objective as they recognized its
important contribution to economic growth and improving Egyptians’ living standards. In this context,
the Government took the initiative to seek support from other donors according to their respective
comparative advantage, and was keen on ensuring good coordination between the various partners.
The Bank was requested to play a lead role succeeded in getting the best out of each donor’s support
and avoided waste that comes from unclear donors mandate and overlap. The donors coordinating
committee, chaired by the Bank, also helped the Government address key financial sector issues on a
timely and priority basis.

85.      The authorities’ commitment to the reform program remained post-revolution. The CBE
proceeded with reforms in the banking sector in a timely manner. In some areas, such as banking
supervision and the adoption of a more advanced stress testing model, measures were advanced earlier
than planned, because of their urgency. The issuance of the Code of Corporate Governance was speed
up in response to the market demand for transparency and good governance. Requesting disclosure of
salaries of the top 20 staff in all banks was in response to the demonstrations of the banks’ staff. All
of foregoing reforms show that the CBE did react to the changing environment and the new priorities.

                                                   20
The Central Bank, Banking System, and Money Law 88 of 2003, strengthening the governance of the
central bank itself, was one of the few laws issued by SCAF, as the Governor managed to make a good
case of the importance and the urgency of having a financial system that is operational with good
governance and in a transparent manner.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
         Rating: Satisfactory
86.      The CBE and Ministry of Investment/EFSA were the two agencies responsible for the design
and overall implementation of the operation. The BRU and the Banking Supervision Department at
CBE were in charge of the implementation of the reforms, including at its head the Governor of CBE
and his two deputies, were instrumental to the success of this operation. They were systematic in the
way they went about designing the blueprint for the reforms, and seeking advice from the Bank and
other donors, at critical junctures to keep the implementation moving and get support and advice when
they encountered major challenges. In addition, most of the improvements in financial sector
infrastructure were carried out by the CBE.

87.     The CBE was highly successful in not only keeping reforms moving, but in using results and
techniques related to the DPLIII to avoid bank runs and a systemic financial crisis after January 2011.
Specifically, banks had become stronger in terms of higher capital, lower NPLs, and greater
provisioning before January 2011. The CBE used stress tests and macro-prudential supervision to
assess the risks to the system from the crisis. The CBE appropriately closed banks in January when
public security was threatened, then, when it reopened the banks, appropriately provided liquidity as
needed and issued circulars controlling the amount of daily cash withdrawals and the amount of
foreign currency transfers.

88.     EFSA, under the Ministry of Investment, was in charge of coordinating the reforms of NBFI.
The actual reforms were undertaken by the Insurance Holding Company with its competent chairman,
who managed to reforms the state-owned insurance companies after many years of status quo. The
reporting and coordination of actions between the concerned agencies was efficient and timely
throughout the life of the project, preparation, appraisal and implementation. Their availability and
knowledge of all the program benchmarks allowed for a timely presentation of this operation to the
Board. However, non-bank reforms did not occur at the same pace as bank reforms. Major laws were
not passed by the Parliament in the non-bank financial sector. As noted, these laws were not passed
because of the Parliament’s over commitment, and then its dissolution. In addition, the Minister of
Investment resigned in September 2010 the chairman of EFSA departed, without replacements.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
        Rating: Satisfactory
        The rating of satisfactory is justified by the following:
     The government of Egypt demonstrated clear ownership of the operation. The respective
    responsibilities of the different stakeholders were clearly defined reducing to a minimum the
    potential for overlap or misunderstandings.
       The reform program reflected a clear and complete vision of the needs of the financial sector. It
    was complete, comprehensive, articulated around the most important issues and sequenced
    according to priorities.
     The government of Egypt, and the CBE specifically, were very instrumental in keeping the
    momentum of the financial reform agenda and the operation moving forward —even after the
    revolution, and were highly successful in avoiding a bank run and a systemic banking crisis. . This
    was no small task given the comprehensiveness of the reform and the scope of the operation,
    especially given such a difficult political environment. This was mainly due to the fact that
                                                    21
       extensive consultations with the stakeholders took place before the launch of the program, which
       built consensus.
          Having a champion, such as CBE that is empowered and more important that is technically
       competent to successfully build consensus around the program, and defend it in difficult times of
       political and social unrest, demonstrations, strikes, and when past reforms were questionable was
       key. In the NBFI area, progress was slowed by departures and resignations, without naming of
       replacements, and by inability to push legal changes to passage before parliamentary dissolution.
           However, although the CBE’s performance highly satisfactory, as evident in the successful
       completion of the reform program, and its effective responsiveness and ability to mitigate the risks
       associated with the global financial crisis, as well as the recent revolution, a highly satisfactory
       rating could not be justified for EFSA, the other counterpart, that has not performed as well as a
       result of its need of a great deal of capacity building. But despite numerous challenges faced, EFSA
       is keen on a continued cooperation with the World Bank with regard to developing further the
       financial sector in Egypt.

6.          Lessons Learned 13

Strong analytic underpinning and building on other operations. The 2002 FSAP, and its 2007
Update, helped create a credible blueprint for the design of this operation.
Consultations with stakeholders. Reforms have been undertaken after a process of close and
continuous consultation with all stakeholders.
89.     Effective cooperation with development practices. The Bank team worked in partnership
with USAID, EU, IMF, and AfDB. The respective responsibilities of the different donors and
development partners were clearly defined.

Strong and sustained partnership. The close working relationship with the Egyptian authorities and
implementing entities demonstrated that significant reforms were implemented, backed by a strong
leadership and political commitment.
90.     The design of the policy matrix is key to the sustainability of the reforms. A well-defined
policy matrix owned by the government and endorsed by the Bank and partners is an essential
implementation roadmap for the authorities to move the agenda forward

Having a champion in the government that is competent enough to coordinate efforts with other
implementing entities. Having a government entity or authority that is empowered and competent
enough to successfully build consensus around the program, and defend it in difficult times of political
and social unrest is critical.
The single tranche DPL III proved to be a suitable instrument for the Borrower and the Bank. It
responded effectively to the needs of the authorities by providing them timely support based on clearly
established prior actions.
91.      Lessons Learnt from this operation can be disseminated at knowledge management events.
The experiences in the preparation and implementation of the operation could be shared with other
regions through various means, including the Finance and Private Sector Development (FPD) network
monthly newsletter, as well as through hosting a brown bag lunches (BBL).

7.          Comments on Issues Raised by the Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
92.      The Egyptian authorities were appreciative of the support provided by the World Bank. The
authorities rated the World Bank's performance during the operation as overall highly satisfactory as


13
     Refer to Annex 16 for further details.


                                                    22
indicated in Annex 2. The operation witnessed close coordination and communication with the
implementing entity and the relevant officials, and they acknowledged that the day-to-day support and
close supervision of the operation from the field has helped in ensuring successful implementation.
The government also clearly stated that they greatly valued the technical assistance and advisory
services packaged with the loan.

93.      Moreover, various donors, development partners, and international institutions have been
providing support for the implementation of the government’s overall financial sector reform program
through the provision of technical assistance, and analytical work on reforming and restructuring the
financial sector. This required effective coordination, which the Bank led in chairing the Financial
Sector Donors Subgroup. This cooperation led to mutual design and agreement of conditionality issues
that all donors agreed were essential for financial sector reform. In addition, donors were able to do a
much better job of leveraging resources, both loan and technical assistance, when coordination is
effective. The most effective and successful coordination was with USAID, IMF, AfDB, and the EU.

A. Introduction

The Egyptian financial system, dominated by the banking sector, has resisted very well both the global
economic crisis and the more recent Arab Spring turmoil and the January 25th revolution, maybe even
when compared to other countries in the region. Comprehensive financial sector reforms over the past
seven years with World Bank support, led to a substantial strengthening of the balance sheets of the
banks, as indicated by a risk-weighted capital-asset ratio that rose from 14.7 percent in 2006 to
16.3 percent in 2010 and a loan to deposit ratio has declined to about 51.8% in FYE 2010—typical of
countries that have gone through extensive financial restructuring. These ratios show that Egyptian
banks enjoy comfortable liquidity levels.

The financial sector reform program aimed at creating a sound and diversified financial sector, capable
of contributing to Egypt’s growth performance and providing access to financial services to a much
broader segment of the Egyptian population. The main components of this program included the
empowerment of the private sector in the provision of financial services, the development of effective
bank and non-bank institutions providing a wide range of financial services, and the strengthening of
financial infrastructure and the regulatory and supervisory framework. This entailed strengthening the
institutional framework and the overall environment for financial intermediation, resource
mobilization and risk management.

The World Bank's Financial Sector Policy Loan (III) was affected to evidence the continuing support
to Egypt.

B.     Assessment of the operation's objectives, design, implementation, and operational
experience:

The main objective of the operation was to continue supporting Egyptian authorities in further
developing the enabling environment for financial intermediation and financial access, and increase
private participation in the provision of financial services, through a strengthened bank and non-bank
financial system. This operation aimed at building a financial system that is more inclusive,
competitive and effective in financial intermediation.




                                                  25
The operation's design and implementation was agreed to be as a single disbursement of the full
amount of the loan in the amount of US$ 500 million. This came into effect in view of a series of prior
actions that have been concluded.
C.       Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives:

The loan objectives were satisfactorily met. The reforms implemented have yielded some of the most
impressive results Egypt has seen in the financial sector. These have included:

     Progress in implementing the financial restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks,
    including the full settlement of NPLs of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) held by state-owned
    commercial banks—in addition to improvements in the institutional and operational restructuring
    fronts.
     Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory architecture of the banking sector, evident in
    initiating the implementation of Basel II accords.
     Strengthening CBE’s macroprudential supervision by conducting annual stress testing for the
    banking sector, and by preparing quarterly consolidated banking sector reports that will serve as
    the basis for the CBE’s Financial Stability Report.
     Reforming the non-bank financial sector, and improving the legal and regulatory
    framework—enactment of insurance law, strengthening the regulatory framework governing
    collective investment vehicles, and the establishment of EFSA.
     Improving the financial infrastructure, through strengthening the payments system
    infrastructure and promoting financial inclusion through establishing a real-time gross settlement
    system and automatic clearing house and extending their scope, as well as issuing new
    regulations on mobile phone payments.

Due to early reforms conducted, prudential regulations, and strong supervision, the Egyptian banking
sector remained immune to the effects of the collapse of global financial markets, as well as the
immediate impacts of the Arab Spring and the January revolution. The following summarizes the
landmark developments accomplished during the early reform phases:

     Divesture of state-owned banks’ shares in joint venture banks eliminating conflict of interest,
    and indirect state ownership and intervention. This succeeded in attracting foreign and regional
    strategic investments and inviting banking know-how by means of drawing regional and
    international strategic investors.
     State control of the banking sector was reduced as indicated by the direct and indirect share
    of state-owned banks of banking system deposits which declined from over 70 percent in 2004 to
    45.5 percent in December 2009. This was due to the privatization of Bank of Alexandria, and the
    divestiture of the state-owned banks shares in the joint venture banks.
     The privatization of Bank of Alexandria was acknowledged as one of the most successful
    privatization transaction in the MENA region in recent years.
     Dealing with weak banks by means of consolidations with larger banking institutions, which
    was instrumental in securing depositors’ funds, protecting the financial system and ensuring its
    safety amidst the financial crisis.
     Consolidations were encouraged to create robust entities with strong management, efficient
    processes and proper financial coverage, whereby (i) the number of banks has declined from 57
    banks in December 2004 to a current number of 39 banks; (ii) doubling the Banking Sector’s Net
    worth from LE 35 billion in 2004 to LE 70 billion in 2008 and (iii) increasing the number of
    operative branches from 1795 in 2004 to 2424 in September 2009.

                                                  26
     Implementation of a complete operational and financial reform for state-owned commercial
    banks, whereby (i) recapitalization measures of state-owned commercial banks were taken based
    on results of an independent audit, due diligence and IFRS conversions from EAS and (ii)
    operational and structural reform was implemented for National Bank of Egypt and Banque Misr
    covering 3 backbone areas, namely HR, Risk Management, IT & MIS.
     Setting a national policy for dealing with NPL’s to improve economic performance and
    enhance growth.
     Upgrading the Banking Supervision Unit in line with international standards by
    implementing a risk based approach.
     Completing operational restructuring of the newly merged insurance company (Misr
    Insurance Company). All legal requirements have been fulfilled, and branches merged.
        Strengthening the legal regulatory and supervisory framework in insurance and pensions.
     Improving the ability of capital markets to provide financing and capital market/corporate
    governance discipline through (i) the adoption of International Standards of Auditing (ISA); (ii)
    enactment of amendment to the Executive Regulations of the Capital Market Law (CML),
    enhancing capital adequacy requirements and risk management requirements for financial
    intermediaries; (iii) enactment of amendments to CML simplifying four listing schedules at the
    EGX; (iv) establishment of a new SME stock exchange (NILEX) and initial listing of several
    SMEs on NILEX; (v) better disclosure, legal and pricing clarifications, and reduced capital
    burdens for the sponsors of investment funds; and (vi) bettering supervision and market
    surveillance.
        Issuance of Specialized Economic Courts Law.
     The housing finance market witnessed significant progress on various fronts relating to
    property registration fees, efficiency of procedures for land registration, property valuation, and
    access to long-term credit and cost of funding. Twelve mortgage finance companies and
    Egyptian Mortgage Refinance Company are now operating in the market with around LE 4.5
    billion extended as mortgage finance loans as of December 2011.


D.      Evaluation of the borrower's own performance during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful
in the future:

The operation witnessed a series of reform measures that focused on developing a sound financial
sector. The majority of the concluded reforms were thoroughly discussed with the World Bank on
various occasions. Moreover, they mostly converge with the IMF-World Bank FSAP 2002, and 2007
FSAP Update recommendations.

There has been significant progress by the Egyptian authorities towards achieving the expected
intermediate outcomes of the Financial Sector Reform Program (2009–2012), with regard to the five
main pillars; namely: (i) financial and operational restructuring of commercial and specialized state-
owned banks; (ii) strengthening the regulatory and supervisory architecture of the banking sector; (iii)
reforming the non-bank financial sector; (iv) strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework
of the non-bank financial sector; and (v) improving the financial infrastructure.

On the banking sector and non-bank sector, as well as on the regulatory and supervisory framework
and the financial institutional environment, there have been various developments after Board
approval in May 25, 2010. There has been some delays mainly on the non-bank financial institutions
front, regarding measures that required passage of laws, due to the dissolution and reelection of
Parliament members, post-revolution.
                                                  27
The strategic pillars of the financial sector reform program has led to:

      Substantial improvement in key profitability and efficiency indicators of the state-owned
     commercial banks. The three state-owned commercial banks—National Bank of Egypt (NBE),
     Banque Misr, and Banque du Caire are the largest three banks in Egypt, accounting for about 48
     percent of bank assets—have substantially improved their profitability, efficiency, and capital
     over the last three years. The reported ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets in all three banks
     now substantially exceeds the required 10 percent level. Moreover, as of the end-2010,
     provisions were equal to NPLs. The three banks, particularly NBE, have also increased efforts to
     recover on NPLs. The reported reduced rate of NPLs, the increased coverage of provisions, and
     the recovery on some NPLs, including those of the SOEs, have all contributed to the need for less
     provisioning and thus higher profits.
      Adopting and enhancing corporate governance best practices and regulations within the
     banking system. The CBE Board of Directors Circular of July 5, 2011, announced the corporate
     governance regulations and code that the banks should comply with and abides by. Strengthening
     the governance and enhancing the transparency of the banking sector are key priorities of the
     CBE’s agenda. CBE has also amended the Central Bank, Banking System, and Money Law 88 of
     2003 in October 8, 2011, introducing changes regarding improving CBE’s own governance,
     reconstituting its own board of directors to remove conflicts of interests, and tightening
     supervisory capacity and processes.
      State-owned commercial banks’ financial statements fully reflect bank net asset values and
     economic position in line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
      Implementation of a program of institutional and operational restructuring for the state-
     owned specialized banks. The CBE has been involved in programs of restructuring with the
     state-owned specialized banks, but the restructurings and recapitalizations have been slowed
     recently by developments related to the revolution.
      CBE has continued the implementation of the Basel II project, including preparing guidelines
     for achieving the drafting of regulations in line with Basel II framework. Despite the recent
     events, CBE is maintaining the momentum of further strengthening its capabilities to perform an
     effective risk-based supervision.
      Preparing and presenting to the CBE Board a full-fledged Financial Stability Report based on
     the CBE’s assessment of overall risks in the financial system facilitate the early detection of
     changes and vulnerabilities in the financial system.
      Stress testing became an integral part of the CBE’s systemic surveillance of the banking
     sector.
      Adopting an initiative promoting the development and growth of banking activities/services
     catering for various sectors especially the SME sector.
      Expanding the activities of the financial institutions in remote areas to provide credit and
     other financial services for SMEs.
      Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory Framework in the Non-Banking Financial
     Sector via the establishment of the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA)
     consolidating the regulatory bodies of non-bank financial services, markets, institutions, and
     developing the regulatory framework for the NBFS to ensure the stability of the financial sector,
     by moving from a rule-based to a risk-based regulatory framework.
      Developing the financial culture and raising public awareness of investment and financial
     services, and associated risks and returns associated with their investments.
On the non-bank front, EFSA has undertaken several reforms during the past year post revolution
despite all the numerous challenges faced. Actions were as follows:
                                                   28
      The first organizational chart of EFSA has been approved in 2011, where EFSA was able to
     fully integrate its departments based on functions.
        The supervision department has undergone restructuring.
      The salary scheme of all EFSA employees has been restructured to guarantee a leveled and
     fair compensation to all employees.
      EFSA has succeeded in unifying the regulations and disclosures throughout the nonbanking
     financial sector.
      EFSA has contributed substantially to reducing any systemic risk after the revolution and
     reopening of the Egyptian Stock Market.
E.      Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co-financiers, or of other partners
during the preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of
their relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned:

The World Bank's performance during the operation was overall highly satisfactory. The operation
witnessed close coordination and communication with the relevant Bank officials, and special
acknowledgment should be given to the efforts of the field team, especially the Task Team Leader
during the preparation and supervision.

The team showed a remarkable deal of diligence and technical support for the responsible authorities
throughout the operation. The presence of the TTL on the ground during supervision provided
effective communication and ensured all required and expected intermediate outcomes where duly
met, especially post-revolution. The two emergency supervision missions held were of great support to
the Egyptian authorities.

The World Bank also conducted close coordination efforts with other donors who are actively
involved in the financial sector reform including the IMF, EU, USAID and AfDB.

F.       Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project:

Despite recent events associated with the transitional period after the January revolution, there is a
commitment from the side of the Egyptian authorities to continue its support to ensure the soundness
of the financial sector, and maintain the confidence in the system, as well as taking the necessary
precautionary measures to prevent any crises—evident in circulars issued by the central bank post-
revolution, measures taken by the NBFI regulator EFSA, close monitoring of the banks’ performance,
and severe stress tests conducted.

In that context, the Egyptian government is keen on further cooperation with the World Bank,
specifically on enhancing the financial sector soundness and outreach to the underserved segments of
the society. The support of the World Bank has contributed to that success.

          Annex 3: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


1 Donors, and development partners, that are actively involved in the financial sector work,
including, USAID, IMF, EU, and AfDB have commended the World Bank’s financial sector work,
and especially the series of financial sectors DPLs. Various donors and international institutions
have been providing support for the implementation of the government’s Financial Sector Reform
Program through the provision of technical assistance, and analytical work on reforming and
restructuring the financial sector. This required effective coordination, which the Bank took
leadership in. A Financial Sector Donors Subgroup, chaired by the World Bank was formed in mid
2005, to coordinate efforts related to both technical and financial support provided to the
government and to ensure that borrowed funds are used in the most effective manner. This
cooperation led to mutual design and agreement of conditionality issues that all donors agreed
were essential for financial sector reform. In addition, donors were able to do a much better job of
leveraging resources, both loan and technical assistance, when coordination is effective.

2 There is good collaboration between the World Bank and the IMF in Egypt in the financial
sector, through the joint FSAP program and coordination of technical assistance as indicated in the
IMP Relations Note in Annex 15, of the Program Document. Donors have benefited from the
analytical work that was undertaken by the Bank, especially the 2002 joint IMF-World Bank
FSAP, and its follow-up in 2007. Most of the recommendations put forward by the FSAP were
used in drafting the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the government of Egypt
and USAID. All major elements required for financial sector reform as identified by the FSAP
were used in drafted the conditionality that appears in the MOU. Moreover, technical assistance
to support the financial sector reforms was jointly discussed, designed and deployed, with USAID
and EU, with an understanding that the different donors would support various activities, but
attempting to promote complimentarily.

3 Among the bilateral donors, USAID has provided technical assistance in many areas,
including debt and financial management, a legal framework for secured lending (movable assets),
credit bureau regulation and data management, and the payments system (the latter in coordination
with the EU and the Bank). USAID has a broad capacity-building and technical assistance project
with the EFSA, and provides technical assistance focusing on transforming supervision from
compliance based to risk-based. In addition, work with the Ministry of Finance on pension reform
is ongoing. USAID is also funding a project supporting the development of the mortgage market
through advisory services for strengthening the supervisory authority, securitization, and property
registration.

4 From the USAID perspective, the strong relationship with the Bank was unique in that it was
mutually reinforcing. USAID acknowledges such close cooperation that helped them in designing
assistance strategies to effectively respond to the needs of Egypt. They appreciated the sharing of
information and the close contact to advance in addressing major constraints. This close working
relationship helped to ensure that activities of respective organizations did not conflict with each
other. Both parties had a common objective to support the government of Egypt’s efforts to
implement financial sector reforms. It is much easier for USAID to provide long-term technical
assistance rather than long-term finance, whereas the World Bank is well positioned to address
financing issues, a key component to help the authorities implement their financial sector reforms.
Supporting common objectives helped the government in advancing with its reform agenda. This
was really a three-win situation for the World Bank, USAID and most importantly for the
government of Egypt.

5 The EU has also been actively involved in the financial sector over the past few years,
supporting analytical work on reforming and restructuring the financial sector. The ECB has been
providing technical support in the area of banking supervision. Several US regulators including
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have been providing training in this field as well. The first
phase of the ECB’s large assistance and training program for banking supervision has been
completed, and a second protocol was signed to assist in Basel II implementation.

6 AfDB provided parallel financing to the Financial Sector Reform Program, of an equivalent
amount of US$ 500 million in the first phase of the program. The AfDB appreciates the Bank’s
efforts in processing such a large operation. Their project document was largely based on the
Bank’s analytical work and the preparation work that was done. The World Bank and AfDB have
conducted joint appraisal mission, in which the Bank took a leading role in the policy dialogue,
and in the identification of triggers on banking and insurance sector. This partnership between the
two institutions continued in all financial sector work.

7 Overall, donors and development partners have commended the Bank’s efforts in moving
forward with the implementation of the Financial Sector Reform Program, and in ensuring
synergy in the policy measures supported by the various donors, and effective use of resources.

of base money and domestic credit, the
remaining 67 percent, reflecting the loss of reserves and the expansion of domestic credit,
growing at 57 percent, explains this trend (Figure A8.1). Deposits in local currency of the
banking sector increased by a meager 2.5 percent (y-o-y) in January, while deposits in foreign
currencies increased by 15 percent (y-o-y).

2.      Net foreign assets have declined sharply, while net domestic assets have increased.
While net foreign assets of the CBE have decreased continuously since January, net domestic
assets have surged. The expansion in domestic assets is due primarily to growth in the
domestic credit (Figure A8.2).

rates to 9.25 percent, lending rates to 10.25 percent, and the cost of providing liquidity via “7-
day repo? to 9.75 percent, with a discount rate of 9.5. This suggested that CBE would act
strongly to avoid currency depreciation and to discourage Egyptians from converting local
currency into foreign currency. However, on March 20th, the CBE reduced the required
reserve ratio (RRR) on domestic currency deposits by 200 basis points from 14 percent to 12
percent, which will result in an increase of liquidity in local currency, thereby exerting
pressure on the limited amount of foreign exchange reserves. The CBE issued two press
releases following the reduction in RRR explicitly mentioning that the measure aimed at
providing permanent liquidity and easing credit conditions in the market. The net domestic
assets of the CBE grew over 100 percent (y-o-y) in February, but net foreign assets fell by 55
percent in the same period.

                 Annex 8: Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Pillar I: Financial and Operational Restructuring of Commercial and Specialized State-
owned Banks

1.       Key profitability and efficiency indicators of the state-owned commercial banks
continued to improve despite the global crisis, due to financial and operational restructuring
since the onset of the financial sector reform program that was continued under DPLIII. The
three state-owned commercial banks—National Bank of Egypt (NBE), Banque Misr, and
Banque du Caire, which account for about 44 percent of bank assets in FY 2011—have
substantially improved their profitability, efficiency, and capital over the last three years.14
The reported ratio of capital-to-risk-weighted assets in all three banks now substantially
exceeds the required 10 percent level. Moreover, as of the end-2011, provisions-to-NPLs
exceed largely 80 percent. NBE has increased efforts to recover on the private sector NPLs 15,
and Banque Misr, which has inherited Banque du Caire’s NPLs, is working on their collection.
Moreover, all the three commercial state-owned banks are now managed in line with good
lending practices with a large amount of their existing NPLs reflecting the legacy of the past.
Banque du Caire’s operational restructuring has not gone as far 16, but all three have improved
significantly.

2.       Indicative of the reforms, NBE was able to tap the Eurobond market to get US$ 600
million on a five years bullet basis at 5.25 percent just before the revolution, to enhance its
dollar liquidity. In addition, in the perspective of implementing Basel II regulation in 2013,
Banque Misr plans to convert its US$ 1 billion subordinated loan into equity to shore up its
capital base and Banque du Caire is ready to develop its activities following the strategy
designed by its new Chairman.

3.       In the aftermath of the revolution, state-owned commercial banks are facing various
challenges. First, due to the uncertainty times, lack of bankable opportunities and the
growing deficit and financial needs of the government, the state-owned banks are buying
large amounts of sovereign debt, which now exceeds more than forty percent of their deposits.
At the same time, the demand for loans is declining, reflecting the anemic economic situation.
Second, in 2011, the government granted in 2011 a salary increase (15 percent to 30 percent),
which put some pressure on banks’ profitability. Third, the Parliament tried to put a cap on
the maximum wage in the public sector and then a maximum deviation (35 times) from the
minimum wage. If not well managed, such rules could lead to a departure of top executives
in the state-owned banks, as well as the state-owned, non-bank sector.

4.       CBE has strengthened the corporate governance in the banking system by issuing
Corporate Governance Regulations on July 5, 2011. All banks, including commercial and
specialized state-owned banks, are instructed to comply with the new regulations. The
principles require banks to establish better relations between their management, Board of
Directors, and shareholders, as well as, other stakeholders with a clear definition of powers
and duties of each of them. Banks also will need to have non-executive and independent
members on their Board. Moreover, banks are required to put in place appropriate
committees on compensation, audit, and risk management. They are also expected to develop
policies to address conflict of interest and related party transactions. According to CBE, most

   Its NPLs-to-total loans ratio is at 7.2 percent at the end of March 2012.
16
   It was originally planned to merge Banque du Caire with Banque Misr then. Then it was decided to transfer
ownership of BDC to BM and then privatizing BDC. The privatization transaction was cancelled and BDC is still
owned by Banque Misr but it operates its activities independently from Banque Misr.

                                                    45
of the banks will comply with the corporate governance regulations, including state-owned
banks. CBE also amended the Central Bank, Banking System, and Money Law 88 of 2003 in
October 8, 2011, introducing changes that improved the central bank’s own governance,
reconstituted its own board of directors to remove conflicts of interests, and tightened
supervisory capacity and processes.

5.       Commercial state-owned banks are competing with private banks on a level playing
field. They are subject to the same legal and regulatory framework (Law 88 of 2003), and to
the same supervisory guidelines and corporate governance code. State-owned commercial
banks have also improved their accounting by adopting International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), which are already used by private banks. The state-owned commercial
banks’ financial statements now reflect net asset values and their economic position. The
quarterly balance sheets and income statements of the state-owned commercial banks are
audited by two independent auditors, and published by the banks. Furthermore, as part of the
reform program, the de facto state guarantees for state-owned enterprise loans held by state-
owned commercial banks were abolished, which contributed significantly to putting state-
owned banks on equal footing with their private peers.

6.      CBE has also been involved in programs of restructuring and strengthening the state-
owned specialized banks (that collectively represent less than a 5 percent share of total assets
and deposits in commercial and specialized banks), but the restructurings and
recapitalizations slowed down in PBDAC because of the legal delays and the political and
economic uncertainty after the revolution. It is expected that a full-fledged operational,
financial and institutional restructuring might resume in this bank, once the uncertainty clears-
up.

7.       The restructuring program with the Egyptian Arab Land Bank (EALB) was furthest
along. EALB has to deal with the piling-up of non-interest earning assets in the form of non-
performing loans (LE 4.6 billion) and recollected fixed assets (LE 2.4 billion) because of its
unsound banking operations before 2002. According to the bank, the write off of NPLs could
be around LE 1.3 billion at a minimum. There is also a risk that another portion of the
portfolio may be classified as non-performing loans in the future, particularly in the aftermath
of the revolution. The bank’s lending portfolio is concentrated in tourism and real estate
sectors, which got the biggest hit from the economic slow-down. The government appointed
a new CEO in September 2011 who has focused the bank’s efforts to wind up non-performing
loans and fixed assets, while continuing to develop new business. Currently, the bank can
comply with the capital adequacy regulation thanks to CBE and Government support. The
bank generates losses, amounting to LE 400 million per year because of the deterioration in
its interest generating capacity and increased operating expenses. Even with the new
management`s capabilities, the bank’s bounce-back depends on how the real estate and
tourism sector revive. .

8.      The Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) had started to
undertake a substantial program of financial and institutional restructuring, including
increasing its mobilization of deposits to fund its lending, modernizing its branches and
branch structure, connecting its branches by internet, and improving its risk management. It is
the largest of the state-owned specialized banks, plays a major role in financing the
agricultural sector and including its village branches, accounts for about one-third of
bank branches in the country. The bank has also started new lending products after the
revolution, such as microfinance and Islamic banking to cater the public’s demand for these
products, especially underprivileged groups and those in the rural areas. As a result,
PBDAC represents a major element in access to banking services in rural Egypt and
its continued improvement would improve access to credit and financial services. The
government began the process of changing the bank’s legal status to a state-owned

                                               46
commercial bank, but the law was postponed with the revolution and dissolution of the
Parliament. The Government appointed a new chairman in September 2011, who has focused
so far on putting all the non banking activities into a commercial company. The bank plans to
transfer almost 20 percent of its staff to that company over the next year. Despite these
successes, the bank’s management faces important issues. The bank still has a bad lending
portfolio, weak internal systems, and redundancy, which can be a drag in the bank’s ability to
improve its efficiency and profitability. Salaries were rose substantially as a result of the
Government’s decree. And, in prepartation to PBDAC’s shift to a commercial bank, it is
holding non-interest earning reserves in the CBE. The bank experienced losses (around
LE 600 million) last fiscal year. The bank has fallen short of CBE’s minimum capital
adequacy requirements, which requires government’s extending support. Because of its
weakening cash income generating capacity, the bank’s liquidity ratio is close to CBE’s
minimum requirement.

9.       The very small, state-owned specialized Industrial Development Bank (IDB) has been
gradually undertaking a program of financial, operational, and institutional restructuring. The
merger of the small, Workers Bank into IDB has delayed the restructuring of the bank. The
sharp rise in salaries of the staff of state-owned banks will substantially increase IDB’s
operating costs and the economic situation will make it even more difficult to liquidate
collateral on NPLs, and probably increase NPLs on existing loans. However, it is worth
noting that IDB is a very small bank with 19 branches, and a market share of 0.3 percent of
total assets, and 0.1 percent of total deposits.

10.      Monitoring indicators. Overall, the banking system proved its soundness and
resiliency by weathering of the global crisis and the immediate implications of the January
revolution. This reflects the strengthening of the banks, especially as a result of the
successful financial and operational restructuring of the commercial state-owned banks. The
improvement is evident in the: (i) decline in NPLs-to-total loans, from 14.8 percent in 2008 to
10.9 percent in 2011; (ii) increase in provisions-to-NPLs from 92.1 percent in 2008 to
94.6 percent in 2011; (iii) decline in SOEs NPLs to reach zero in 2011, as opposed to LE 10
billion in 2008; and (iv) increase in the capital adequacy ratio of the banking system to reach
15.6 percent, compared to 14.7 percent in 2008 (see Table 2). Although restructuring of the
specialized state-owned banks was at a slower pace, 17 PBDAC managed to improve its
coverage ratio from 51.8 percent in 2008, to 60 percent in 2011; in addition to introducing 13
products in 2011, as opposed to 10 in 2008.

Pillar II: Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Architecture of the Banking
Sector

11.     Despite the recent events, CBE is maintaining the momentum of further strengthening
its capabilities to perform effective macro-prudential supervision, implement Basel II and
strengthen risk-based supervision and other elements of supervision. These developments
helped CBE monitor the banking system after January 2012, and contributed to its ability to
intervene to avoid a bank run during the year.

12.     CBE has made considerable progress in improving its assessment and surveillance of
macro prudential risks. The Banking Supervision Department has set up a Macroprudential
Unit with the aim to assess and produce regular reports on main developments in the Egyptian
banking sector at the aggregate level. The Banking Supervision Department strengthened the
Macroprudential Unit with the aim to prepare and publish a full-fledged Financial Stability


17
  As discussed earlier, this is mainly due to the dissolution of the Parliament following the revolution, which
delayed issuance of laws and legal reforms; as well as the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease, which adversely
affected the operations of PBDAC.

                                                       47
Report, the first report of its kind in the MENA region. Indeed, the Macroprudential Unit
prepared the first Financial Stability Report at the end of 2011. However, there is a delay in
the publication of the report because of political and economic uncertainty. Financial
Stability Report was presented to CBE board of directors who decided that report publishing
will be subject to improvement of economic and political situation.

13.      Stress testing has become an integral part of the CBE’s systemic surveillance of the
banking sector. The Macro Prudential Unit has been conducting stress testing and standard
financial soundness indicator analysis on the banking sector since 2009, which is also being
supported by the World Bank through a FIRST Initiative. The focus in stress testing is on
credit risk which accounts for around 85 percent of overall risks in the banking system. As
part of stress scenarios, CBE downgrades exposures in each rating by one or two notches.
The CBE also applies a haircut (50 percent) on all collaterals with the exception of cash and
bank guarantees.

14.     Currently, CBE is involved in an intensive technical assistance project with the Bank
to strengthen its stress testing framework through the integration of the Financial Projection
Model (FPM) into its supervision. 18 The FPM will allow CBE to conduct stress tests on
individual and system wide basis against credit, interest rate, liquidity, and foreign exchange
risks. The FPM takes into account second round effects, balance sheet interconnectedness in
the banking system, as well as systemic risks, such as funding liquidity and market liquidity
risks.

15.     Another area of improvement is in the implementation of Basel II in Egypt. An EU
technical assistance program on banking supervision was launched early January 2009 and
aimed at supporting the CBE in designing a Basel II framework customized to the Egyptian
banking system through a long term strategy. The program, which closed at the end of March
2012, successfully achieved all its objectives. The EU representative in charge of the project
rated it highly satisfactory as deliverables went beyond expectations and due to the full
ownership of the project by the CBE staff.

16.      The major deliverable was a set of regulations on Basel II implementation, drawing
on discussions papers, quantitative impact studies and benefiting from an enhanced dialogue
with the banking community. Regulations regarding Pillar I (own funds, credit risk,
operational risk, and market risk) are ready to be adopted by the CBE Board by July 2012. In
parallel, a regulation on internal control should be adopted along the same timeline to help
streamline the implementation process of Basel II. Pillar II regulations (concentration risk,
liquidity risk and interest rate risk) are expected to be enforced at the end of 2013 or later to
give room to banks to absorb Pillar I. As scheduled, the private commercial banks will have
to comply with the new regulatory regime starting from December 2012 and the state-owned
banks by June 2013. (Fiscal years differ for the private and the state-owned commercial
banks.)


18
  The project was initiated in January 2012 after a training program on the standardized FPM in July 2011. Upon
CBE’s request for the FPM to be customized to its prudential regulations and reports, a FIRST funded project was
developed in January 2012. As part of the project, a mission visited CBE between May 6-12, 2012 to determine
the main parameters of the customization of the FPM. Since the FPM Expert was able to determine the parameters
earlier than planned, the customization with regards to the lending section was completed during the mission.
Currently, CBE`s technical team is conducting a plot test on the -partially- customized Model. The customization
of the FPM in relation to lending was done in a way that the CBE would be able to implement stress testing based
on two alternative methodologies. The first methodology is identical to CBE’s current stress testing methodology
with some improvements to take into account second round effects. The second methodology employs
probabilities of default (PDs) and losses given default (LGDs) to estimate loan losses, which is in line with
international best practices and Basel II rules on the calculation of capital adequacy against credit risk. Since the
CBE plans to move to Basel II in capital adequacy calculation, it might find useful to implement stress testing
based on PDs and LGDs in the future.

                                                        48
17.     Another delivery aims at assisting CBE in its reform of the supervision reporting
framework. CBE and the European Central Bank (ECB) experts have focused on the design
of the portal, the setup of a communication policy, the analysis of operational workflow and
completion of work on new reports and surveys. By October 2012, CBE should be ready to
open discussions with banks to fine-tune the operational design of this new data feeding
system. If all goes well, the raw date reporting system could be built, tested and run in by
April 2015. However, CBE needs financing (around US$ 5 million) to acquire hardware and
software. Once this new system is implemented, CBE would make a step further in risk-
based supervision and improve dramatically the accuracy of data communicated by banks.

18.      From the onset, this project has been quite challenging because of the number of
stakeholders involved and the changes in the supervisory process. However, the rationale was
in line with the progress made by the CBE towards a risk based supervision and the diversity
of the Egyptian banking system. Dialogue, awareness and capacity building were key factors
of success in the major achievements of this operation. For example, knowledge sharing and
capacity building have been provided to all the CBE staff on how to monitor the compliance
of the Egyptian banking system with these new regulations and the new data reporting
scheme, in order to build ownership beyond the Basel II core team. Since 2005, Egypt has
built a credible, risk based supervisory and regulatory framework in line with the best
international practices conducing to a stronger and more resilient banking sector.

19.      Monitoring indicators. Despite the revolution and risks associated with it, CBE
maintained the momentum of strengthening its capabilities to perform an advanced risk-based
supervision, evident in: (i) conducting regular severe macro-prudential stress testing, which
has become an integral part of CBE’s systemic surveillance of the banking system; (ii)
preparing the first Financial Stability Report, which was presented to CBE board of directors
who decided that report publishing will be subject to improvement of economic and political
situation; and (iii) applying Basel II framework, where all private commercial banks will have
to comply with the new regulatory regime starting December 2012, and from June 2013 for
the state-owned commercial banks. All these developments helped in monitoring the system
after the revolution and, together with the CBE’s appropriate provision of liquidity and
restrictions on size of deposit withdrawals and purchases of foreign exchange, prevented a
major run on the banks in 2011.

Pillar III: Reforming the Non-bank Financial Sector

20.      In the insurance sector, the legal and organizational restructuring of the state-owned
insurers was completed in July 2010. Misr Life is now the only state-owned insurer selling
life products and Misr Insurance only sells non-life products. The establishment of pure life
and non life operations has brought Egypt into line with global good prudential practices
(2003 IAIS ICP 6, criterion G). 19 Competent management is now in place in both the state-
owned direct insurers and Misr Insurance Holding Company (the group holding company),
and assets are being professionally managed by the insurers and other group companies.
Transparency is excellent and, while some staff issues arising from the restructuring remain,
management is rapidly developing mechanisms to improve communications. As mentioned
in the risk discussion, reducing investment returns combined with rapidly increasing staff
costs represent a medium-term threat. The insurers do have a 4 to 5 year strategy to deal with
staffing levels and costs through attrition (facilitated by a relatively high average age) but


19
   MENA is the only region where a significant number of composite insurers are still allowed to operate, however
strict separation is now being introduced (UAE, Algeria) in some nearby jurisdictions. A partial list of G20
countries requiring separation of life and non-life activities includes the relevant EU countries. the US, Canada,
Australia, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa.

                                                       49
supplementary salary increases will need to be brought under control and new staff
appointments limited to essential needs.

21.      The balance sheets of both of the two state-owned insurers are now largely repaired,
after approximately LE 2.5 billion of reserve strengthening over the restructuring period. The
main technical challenges continues to be maintaining the stability of the Motor Third Party
Liability (MTPL) non-life portfolio in Misr Insurance and containing the cost of certain
legacy group life retirement arrangements that were incorrectly priced and poorly designed in
Misr Life (formerly National Insurance). Although Misr Insurance has significantly
strengthened its own technical reserves it discovered that it had inherited an enormous
technical reserve shortfall when it took over National Insurance’s ‘Act’ insurance claims
portfolio in 2009: in addition claims provisions for business written before claims were
capped (under Law 72 of 2007) continue to prove to be inadequate as the claims are run off.
This reflects National’s former dominant role in the MTPL business and the dependence of a
section of the legal profession on representing accident victims and their need to maximize
returns from the old claims portfolio during its run off period. On the other hand the business
written since the claims cap was instituted and premiums were increased is providing an
adequate overall return to underwriters, although some categories of vehicle continue to be
highly unprofitable. These more recent years’ ratios will likely deteriorate but are
significantly better then the accounted claims ratios which include old years’ run off
deterioration.

22.      Accounting loss ratios tend to understate growth of claims ratios in growing
portfolios and the private sector experience will almost certainly deteriorate with time, but not
to the levels being experienced by Misr Insurance. An alternative approach which helps to
identify the impact of the old system business is to examine Misr Insurance’s post-2007
experience by underwriting year (Table A9.2).

Private sector insurers now account for more than half of the MTPL market, representing a
significant positive deliverable under the reform program. Anecdotal evidence indicated that
several smaller insurers may now be viable as a result. However, under the current regime,
private insurers are able to select the best risks while Misr Insurance continues to have to also
accept inadequately rated and hence loss-making commercial vehicle business (including
taxis). This, as noted by comparing tables 4 and 5, has led to worse underwriting results for
Misr Insurance on post-2007 business than for the industry as a whole. In the past Misr could
have been cross subsidized from appropriately priced government sourced business but in a
competitive market and given current fiscal pressures this is less possible or desirable.
Possible solutions to this issue are discussed in the Financial Development and Growth in

23.     Regardless of the approach taken, there is a need to establish a central statistical
database and analytical capacity so as to be able to produce indicative premiums and analyze
which drivers are responsible for the poor experience. This ideally would be undertaken by
the Egyptian Insurance Federation.

24.      Other positive metrics include the facts that Misr Life in FY2010 and FY 2011 grew
faster than its sector for the first time in many years, partly reflecting managerial actions to
improve agency productivity. Both the life and non life sectors have had an unexpected
dividend from the revolution, in that the corporate and tourist industry sectors (mainly for
Strike, Riot and Civil Commotion (SRCC) Insurance) and individuals (life and medical) have
become more conscious of risk. Reinsurers are imposing limits on the sum insured under
SRCC policies and corporate are having to pay considerably more for full coverage (in the
past this was added ‘free’ cover under most commercial insurance contracts).

25.     Overall nominal insurance density (premium per capita) doubled over the 5 years to
June 30, 2011, while insurance penetration (premiums as a percentage of GDP) dropped
marginally (see outcomes matrix), but still bettered the baseline for life. This drop reflected a
combination of factors including relatively high inflation, the global financial crisis, increased
competition, the removal of the banc-assurance channel as an avenue for distribution
expansion (see below) and more recently the impact of the February 2011 revolution on
economic activity and employment. It is expected that the 2011/ 12 figures will show an
increase in penetration.

26.      Bancassurance now accounts for more than 40 percent of life sales world-wide and
offers one of the best avenues for increasing access to family (life and disability) insurance in
Egypt, particularly for Takaful products, while improving bank operating margins. Industry
estimates are that it could rapidly increase insurance penetration in Egypt by one-third.
However CBE (correctly) placed a ban on any new banc-assurance agreements in 2007 when
examples of poor market conduct were brought to its attention: sales of conventional
insurance under existing agreements between insurers and banks are continuing under an
earlier set of EFSA approvals. A working committee of the Insurance Federation has agreed
on a set of rules for banc-assurance activities and this was presented to the CBE in July 2011,
with a follow up communication in November. CBE has stated that the industry will need to
await the introduction of Basel II risk capital requirements in 2013 before there will be any
possibility of lifting the ban. In the interim one recently licensed family Takaful insurer that

                                                      51
predicated its strategy on the banc-assurance business model has had to withdraw and two
others are under pressure from their shareholders to also consider this option. The unfortunate
(although unintended) result is that regional Takaful insurers are leaving the Egyptian market
while European-based insurers continue to grow.

27.      Solvency II will not solve the issue of banks taking responsibility for their market
conduct where insurance sales are involved and one suggestion made was that banks should
have a majority holding in any insurer with which they have an agency. This is not acceptable
to the insurance sector and is not possible under the current insurance law. The World Bank is
discussing alternative approaches with the CBE after having received clearance at a meeting
held at the Insurance federation offices organized by the Chairman of the Federation.

28.     On capital markets, EFSA Decision No. 88 of 2009 requires investment funds to
appoint independent Fund Administration Companies to avoid conflicts of interest and protect
investors by performing critical functions, per IOSCO best practice, in order to protect
investment fund certificate-holders from adverse actions by fund managers. These critical
functions include calculations of net asset value (NAV), maintenance of fund records on
investment transactions and certificate holders, and calculation of management fees and
bonuses for fund managers. 21As of mid-2009, Egypt’s investment fund regulations fell short
of IOSCO best practices in several regards, including potential for conflicts of interest (e.g.,
possible related-party investment, lack of code of conduct); lack of separate directors for
bank-sponsored investment funds; and limited standards on permissible advertising by
investment funds. Prior to the revolution, the EFSA Board had submitted to the Minister of
Investment draft amendments on investment funds for the CML Executive Regulations.

29.     The Ministry of Investment Decree No.1 of 2010 introduced a number of measures
(such as permitting bond issues by public authorities, authorization of additional rating
agencies, audited projections of main financial ratios in lieu of pro forma financial statements)
to encourage development of Egypt’s corporate bond market. This did allow a quasi-
sovereign agency, the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), to undertake three bond
issuances (including 5-years) totaling LE 7.5 billion during the first half of 2010. 22

30.      The private pension fund sector has seen little progress, partly reflecting uncertainties
as to the likely impact of the Law 135 of 2010 which proposes a radical restructuring of the
social insurance regime in Egypt, and public pensions in particular. This Law has been frozen
by the interim government and its future and its impact are now very uncertain. Discussions
with Ministry of Finance indicate that its main author is willing to consider amendments
(mainly through caps) that would leave scope for the private contractual savings sector while
still improving fiscal space.

31.     Monitoring indicators. On insurance, gross non life premium-to-GDP reached 0.42
percent in 2011; and gross adjusted life premium-to-GDP reached 0.32 percent in 2011. On


21
   Market participants indicate that six Fund Administration Companies are operating and performing these critical
functions. This may have encouraged greater public confidence in investment funds. According to EFSA, 79
investment funds were operating by December 2010 compared to 68 in December 2009 and only 49 in December
2008.
22
   Other corporate bond issuances, however, were down. During 2010, 5 corporations undertook 12 bond issuances
totaling LE 5.2 billion. Thus, the combined 15 bond issuances in 2010 are down from the 22 corporate bond
issuances in 2009. Unsettled market conditions presumably had some negative effect. Market participants note,
however, that Egypt has yet to develop a real secondary market in government securities. The resulting lack of a
reliable yield curve may significantly dampen investor appetite for corporate bonds and discourage development of
a corporate bond market. The Ministry of Finance has made major improvements in its primary issuance practices
and development of benchmark issues. Additional measures are needed to encourage secondary trading in
government securities trading. Such measures might include less liberal rules on government securities holdings by
banks and enforcement of more stringent mark-to-market rules.

under management reached LE 58.4 billion; and there was one new bond issue in 2011.
Pillar IV: Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework of the Non-Bank
Financial Sector

32.      The EFSA merger was completed and in January 2011 the then- Chairman was able
to issue a comprehensive report covering background, establishment, internal restructuring
plans and achievements to date. 23 However the move to a fully integrated approach was
interrupted by the departure of the first Chairman of EFSA, and subsequent limits placed by
the interim administration on new senior appointments that prevented appointment of a
replacement Chairman. The result is that EFSA is stuck in a half-way house with separate
‘islands’ based on sector rather than the functionally based structure originally envisaged (and
still shown on its web still in contradiction to the list of offices shown on the same web site).
In practice, this situation is not working well and this is widely understood in the financial
sector.

33.     Market observance of trading practices in equity markets and governance has
improved. Efforts continue to protect equity investors from the potential for corporate
governance irregularities, especially from insider and related-party share trading. In May
2011, the EFSA Board decided to require expanded disclosure by EGX-listed companies on
major shareholders (i.e. 5 percent or more), free float, treasury stock transactions, and
changes in the board of directors. EGX indicated in May 2011 that it is now attempting to link
disclosures on such insiders to its ongoing market surveillance.

34.      A comprehensive licensing law for all non-bank financial institutions was submitted
to the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2010. The law allowed for the creation of the first
commercial micro finance institutions (MFIs) in Egypt and would allow NGOs that are
actively involved in microfinance to convert into a full-fledged MFIs reporting to EFSA,
establish an MFI arm for their respective NGOs or continue functioning as an NGO reporting
to the Ministry of Social Solidarity. The 2010 Parliament went into recess before the law was
submitted and with the dissolution of both houses of Parliament during the revolution and the
probable cabinet reshuffle after the Presidential elections, it remains unclear when or whether
this law will pass. This not only causes problems for existing institutions, but hinders the
growth of MFIs and their regulation.

35.     After the new public pension law was enacted in 2010, a private pension fund law
was drafted and submitted to Cabinet. However it has not been forwarded to Parliament and
is considered a low priority by the interim government. Thus it is unlikely that the new
private pension law will be enacted in the coming months and it will probably have to wait for
some time until after new President is elected. While the new pension law is not expected to
promote rapid growth in private pension provision, it will improve credibility by
strengthening the role of the supervisor (EFSA) and significantly improve the poor
management and investment standards that characterize the activity. In the interim EFSA’s
pension unit has continued to monitor the funding levels of private pension plans and as noted
these have not been markedly affected by recent developments, although there was a slight
drop in overall funding level between 2011 and 2012 (from 89 percent to 84 percent).

36.       Monitoring indicators.            Progress in the strengthening of the regulatory and


23
   Highlights include: (i) EFSA has decision making, budgeting and organizational autonomy; (ii) a cadre of new
younger graduates not tied to past structures and approaches has been recruited after an exhaustive selection
process and trained (including time with the Monetary Authority of Singapore). New cadres of such individuals
will be recruited on an annual basis; and (iii) an Institute for Non-banking Financial Services has been established
to enable local personnel to attain international qualifications (e.g. through sitting the CII insurance exams in
Cairo).

Sector Law 10 of 2009, which was enacted, and became effective; the establishment of EFSA,
the single regulator for NBFIs; the merger of EFSA in January 2011. However, challenges
remain regarding the move to a full risk based supervisory approach, which was
disrupted by the departure of the first Chairman of EFSA, besides implications
resulting from the revolution. Although legal reforms were lagging, such as the delayed in
the issuance of microfinance law due to the dissolution of the Parliament, following the
revolution, the Egyptian authorities gave priority to enhancing access to finance to the
marginalized regions, and groups. This was reflected in the increase in the percentage of
female microfinance clients from 50 percent in 2008 to 65 percent in 2011. There was also an
increase in the outstanding microfinance portfolio reaching LE 3.1 billion in 2011, compared
to LE 2.21 billion in 2008. On leasing, assets as a percent of GDP have reached 0.66 percent
in 2011, compared to 0.45 percent in 2008.

Pillar V: Improving the Financial Infrastructure

37.      The RTGS became fully operational with additional features in 2010. The ACH
became fully operational in June 2010. About 2.9 million payments cards have been issued to
government workers and pensioners through the government payments system program and
are being used. During the revolution, when banks offices were closed, payments were made
through RTGS/ACH to some pensioners through ATMs. The limited number of ATMs may
become an issue as more and more government employees and pensioners use this system,
because government employees and pensioners typically wish to withdraw cash when they
are paid. A full ACH connection between the Ministry of Finance and CBE will be
established by end of 2012. This connection will allow direct payments to government
suppliers. Also, the National Inter Bank Switch for retail payments is now fully operational
in all banks—a key development in the financial institutional infrastructure. Relevant
regulations applicable to licensing payments system and payments system oversight are
currently being drafted through a process of consultations.

38.     Licenses for mobile payments provision have been issued to two banks, the Housing
Development Bank and BNP Paribas and their partner-mobile phone companies.               The
operation of systems under these licenses was delayed by the revolution, but they are
expected to begin operation soon. The Central Bank, Banking System, and Money Law 88 of
2003 limits deposit taking to banks licensed and supervised by the CBE. This limit means that
mobile payments systems and products involving deposit-taking are legally required to go
through banks; mobile providers cannot offer deposit services independently of banks, as has
been done in some countries, for example, Kenya. The purpose of the law is to ensure strong
supervision of deposit-takers and to avoid bank collapses that would put pressure on other
banks through contagion and could lead to government ad hoc coverage of deposits to protect
depositors by banking laws, including the right to redeem their deposits.

39.     The Egyptian Banking Institute (EBI), of which all banks in the system are members,
has offered an SME Training program for some time. The program includes classes for both
bankers lending to SMEs and a guide to help SME entrepreneurs interact with banks. The
actual courses have been developed over time using participant feedback. The enrollments in
the courses had temporarily slowed and the courses were suspended during the revolution and
the closure of the banks. The courses then restarted. The EBI is also setting up visits to other
developing countries, to examine how banks in these countries make SME loans and develop
their courses further. The EBI expects that the demand for its SME courses will increase
under the future Egyptian government.

40.     The completion of SME Census, and the database was presented in a form that is
accessible to the banking sector. The EBI census of SMEs has been completed in all of the 27

                                              54
Egyptian governorates. It uses a single definition, is based on company registration data, and
excludes micro-enterprises employing less than 5 persons. The results of the census are
available on the EBI web site as the CBE is keen on better disclose of data and information.
The uniform definition of SMEs will permit a much better evaluation and comparison of
banks’ lending to SMEs. At the moment, the NBE which has established an SME
Department is currently the largest bank lending to SMEs.

41.     Monitoring indicators. One of the key achievements of the reform program was the
strengthening of the financial infrastructure, evident in: (i) operational status of RTGS and
ACH with capacity to encompass low value payments, (ii) the increase of individuals
receiving government workers and retirees payments through financial institutions reaching
2.9 million in 2011, compared to 0.6 million in 2008; (iii) CBE issued regulations on mobile
phone payments, and issued licenses to two banks and their mobile phone partners ; and (iv)
licensed money transfer from customer to customer and from customer to merchant.

              Annex 9: Direct Impacts of the Revolution on the Financial Sector


1.       The Egyptian revolution that began in late January 2011 brought large, unexpected
stress to the banking system and the economy overall. The turmoil, protests and deteriorating
security situation in the first few weeks during and after the revolution, led to a temporary
closure of banks for five working days only and the stock exchange, limiting financial
services during that period. The problems were dealt with effectively, on an ad hoc basis, by
the CBE and EFSA. The CBE took the decision to close all banks from January 27 to
February 6. During this period, payments were difficult to make and a shortage of cash
developed. The eight-week closure of the ESE, until March 23, 2011, raised concerns about
reliable access to a ready exit for equity holdings. The authorities delayed reopening of the
stock exchange several times in light of the extended and widespread nature of unrest, and
introduced temporary trading measures aimed at reducing panic upon resumption of trading
and helping restore stability in domestic capital markets. 24

2.       It is worth noting that CBE has responded well to the impact of the Egyptian
revolution on the banking system through: a) provision of cash as needed when the banks
reopened; and b) the issuance of circulars that generally addressed specific, crisis-related
issues that limited withdrawals and foreign transfers and were time-bound. The provision of
cash as needed when the banks reopened gave confidence to the people and helped prevent a
deposit run. Under the circulars, withdrawals of foreign exchange or transfers abroad were
controlled for individuals and limited non-import or non-foreign-investment related
transactions. The reopening of the banking system’s branches was gradual, but by end-March
2011 deposits had recovered to 99.3 percent of their December 2010 level, suggesting there
had been no loss of confidence in the banks, although deposits in foreign currency had risen
to 22 percent compared to 19 percent at the end of 2010.

3.       CBE required banks to also conduct stress tests and assess the quality of their assets.
The most important of these tests were those on credit portfolios. This was complemented by
the CBE’s requirement for banks to monitor their portfolio in a circular. The CBE took
several temporary preventive and precautionary measures in response to the developments, as
it issued six circulars in response to the developments; appropriately they were generally
temporary and limited to time-bound corrections of specific issues that had arisen. These
were mainly related to cash withdrawals by individuals (for foreign and local currency);
however local currency restrictions were removed two months later; risk management related
to retail loans and the tourism-related corporate loans, overseas cash transfers, and the grace
period for banks divesture of their ownership of non-financial corporations. The CBE
estimated that the commercial banks were resilient and solvent in terms of capital after the
revolution, using severe stress tests.

4.      Also, regulations for disclosure and corporate governance were augmented by EFSA
post-revolution. In order to strengthen compliance of listed companies with internationally
recognized corporate governance standards and enhance transparency of equity markets,
EFSA reinforced the revised code on corporate governance. EFSA has added important
disclosure provisions to its listing requirements through two recent decrees. EFSA also
intends to add the "comply or explain" provision to its listing requirements. This means that
any company listing shares on the EGX would have to either fully comply with the new code


24
  For instance, the EGX suspended intra-day trading, shortened trading hours by an hour to three (a measure
recently reversed), and amended price limits on listed equities.; trading would be suspended for half an hour if the
broad EGX100 index declined by 5 percent and for longer if it dropped by 10 percent.

                                                        56
of corporate governance or explain for each provision why and how it deviates from the code.
This reform is expected to strengthen corporate governance and transparency of listed
companies.

5.       Near-term capital market performance will be driven by political and economic
developments. Confidence in Egypt’s political stability, fiscal performance, and credit
prospects could reverse the recent rise in Treasury bill rates and make banks somewhat more
ready to consider business lending as an alternative to buying and holding government debt.
Development of a corporate bond market will remain constrained by Egypt’s lack of a reliable
yield curve, which reflects a lack of secondary trading in government securities. Looking at
equities, Egypt’s regulatory regime for equities already compares favorably with other
MENA jurisdictions and the authorities seem committed to implementation of recent rules
(e.g., on disclosure, on related-party transactions) and a strengthening of investment fund
regulations. Moreover, EFSA’s equity market regulators have already started to shift from
compliance-based to risk-based supervision. That said, both domestic and foreign portfolio
investors will want to see greater prospects for political certainty and economic growth before
supporting higher equity valuations. Without higher equity valuations, corporations will
remain reluctant to move forward with initial or secondary public offerings of shares.

6.      The insurance and private pension sectors are by their nature not subject to liquidity
shocks. Solvency is more of an issue but balance sheet repair combined with the more
professional management of assets that has followed the SOI restructuring and the very
conservative investment policies followed by most private sector insurers and pension funds
has minimized any immediate balance sheet damage to the institutional investors. In addition,
the Deputy Chairman of EFSA currently responsible for the insurance and pension sectors has
taken a strong line in restricting insurers from taking excessive investment risks. The evolving
European crisis is not seen as being particularly relevant to the institutional investors for
similar reasons. The global financial crisis, the revolution and the ongoing European
financial crisis have had more implications for capital markets, given the presence of foreign
investors and the resultant extreme impact on the Egyptian stock market, followed by the
lengthy closing of the Egyptian market.

7.      With the dissolution of the Parliament, the revolution has also delayed
implementation of the Non-Bank Finance Intermediation Law that would provide a sounder
basis for micro-finance institutions, the pension reform, and the treatment of the voluntary
pension law. The reform in the pension law enacted by the Parliament in May 2010 has
important implications for the financial sector, through the introduction of a new, funded-
component of the public pension schemes. The previous administration had decided to
postpone the discussion of the law regulating the market of voluntary private pensions until
the public pension reform was passed, but during the second half of 2010 a number of
important projects were pending Parliamentary treatment. The priorities of the newly elected
Parliament have mainly been limited to matters relating to the drafting of the Constitution and
its amendments, the National Budget, and the dissolution of the interim government and its
program.




                                              57
                   Annex 10: Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

1.       The Egyptian authorities’ commitment to the reform program was key to the success
of this operation. The extensive consultations with the stakeholders helped in building
consensus and ownership of reforms by the market players. At the same time, strong
partnership has been established between the Bank and the Egyptian authorities over the past
years through an integrated financial sector work program, reflected in an effective policy
dialogue, analytical work, technical assistance, and key operations, focusing on financial
sector development. The operation’s team had a strong and professional policy dialogue with
the Egyptian main counterpart, namely the Central Bank of Egypt, as well as EFSA that was
in charge of NBFIs. The Bank team has also worked closely with the Ministry of Investment,
the Ministry of Finance, the Stock Exchange, and the Misr Insurance Holding Company.
Commitment to the reform program was maintained even after the revolution. The successful
implementation of this operation benefitted from the leadership of the reformist Governor of
CBE before and after the revolution, which ensured sustainability and continuity. The
authorities’ continuous commitment to developing the financial system in Egypt, and this
operation, helped significantly in addressing the changing environment post-revolution. These
reforms have contributed to building the capacity of CBE, which enabled them to undertake
crisis management measures. Naturally, some reform areas took priority over others in the
transition period and in response to people’s demands. Enhancing access to finance became
an even more urgent priority, as evident in the recent measures undertaken.

2.       Moreover, stress testing and adequate monitoring of the banks’ portfolios and NPLs,
especially in sectors that were hit by the crisis, were crucial. The close monitoring to the
developments in the stock market and the combating of speculative behaviors, as well as
pension reforms and their implications on the lower income segments of the workforce, were
also of priority after the revolution. Reforms that moved at a slower pace were the legal ones
which required Parliament ratification. Nevertheless, even on this, government commitment
was maintained as evident in the issuance of some laws by SCAF, such as the amendments to
the Central Bank, Banking System, and Money Law 88 of 2003, addressing governance
issues. Overall, the government commitment was adequate, and the reform measures were
implemented smoothly even after the revolution and with the disruptions that followed it.

3.      On stakeholders’ collaboration, the authorities have also sought financial and
technical support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), USAID, the European Union
(EU), and the African Development Bank (AfDB), to carry out this program. Development
partners’ support on the financial sector is continuing. At the request of the government, the
Bank was playing a coordination role among donors in the financial sector through a
Financial Sector Donors Group that it chaired in the field.

                           Annex 11: Soundness of Background Analysis

1.      The design and implementation of the second generation Financial Sector Reform
Program and this DPL were significantly enhanced by the analytical work carried out. 25
Several Bank studies provided strong analytical underpinning to the design of this operation
and have helped identify areas that required further reforms. These studies included the 2002
FSAP; the 2007 FSAP Update; the 2005, 2006 and 2009 Investment Climate Assessments;
the 2007 Finance for All: Policies and Pitfalls in Expanding Access; the 2008 Access to
Finance and Economic Growth in Egypt; the 2009 Egypt Macro Policy Note; the 2010
Determinants of Savings in Egypt Report; in addition to the updates of the 2004 Accounting
and Auditing Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC); and the 2003
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), which assessed the fiduciary risk
based approach on the implementation of the Public Financial Management Action Plan. In
addition the growing technical capacity of the Bank’s Egyptian counterparts has supported the
analytical effort.

2.       While the Bank studies and reports have documented the substantial progress made
by the financial sector reform program since it was launched in 2004, they also identified
areas where there are gaps and where more work is needed. Analytical work showed that the
first generation reforms improved the soundness and performance of the financial system;
however access to finance was still a problem. Improving financial intermediation was a
priority area for the next series of reforms to be undertaken by the government. The analytical
underpinnings highlighted the considerable empirical evidence that has shown the
relationship between access to finance and economic growth and development, job creation,
improving income distribution and reducing overall economic volatility. This has encouraged
the authorities to adopt access to finance as the main theme of their second generation reform
program.

3.       The operation has also benefitted from five FIRST-financed technical assistance
projects that have enhanced staff knowledge of the critical issues and challenges in the
financial sector. These FIRST projects have included: (i) Strengthening Banking Supervision,
building the capacity of the banking supervision department at CBE focusing on connected
lending, large exposures and market risk assessment; (ii) Automation of CBE’s Credit
Information System, with the objective of strengthening the existing credit information
department at the central bank and improving data collection and analysis for credit
information; (iii) Modernizing the Payments System, which aimed at strengthening the
payments system at the central bank done in collaboration with the EU; (iv) Establishing the
Private Credit Bureau, which entailed legal and regulatory amendments to allow for the
establishment of private credit bureaus that would cater both to banks, and non-bank financial
institutions; and (v) Reserving for and pricing mandatory Third Party Liability (Motor Act)
insurance, focusing on developing domestic non life actuarial skills.

4.      The Bank has also provided technical assistance in several aspects of pension reform,
including: sustainability analysis of the current pension schemes and reform options; fiscal
impact of the proposed pension reform; minimum pensions and minimum return guarantees;
costs of survivorship and disability pensions; and draft regulatory framework for public
(mandatory) and private (voluntary) pensions.

5.     It is worth noting here, that the various technical assistance provided to the operation
proved essential and key to the effectiveness of the operations because they provided the


25
   In the form of ESW, earlier loan appraisals and related due diligence investigations carried out by international
firms (including BNP Paribas and Milliman working with local advisors).

                                                        59
necessary background, training and assistance needed to both implement and compliment the
various reforms required by the operation. Although the operation has closed, the Bank team
intend to continue to provide technical assistance to the financial sector in Egypt under the
umbrella of the Middle East and North African (MENA) Regional Micro, Small and Medium
(MSME) Technical Assistance Facility. One of the three pillars of this facility deals
exclusively with the capacity building of financial institutions to help them better serve
MSME clients and enhance overall financial intermediation.

6.      On governance and transparency, the Bank worked closely with the CBE on taking
the required legal and regulatory measures. As a result, the Governance Code was issued in
July 2011. This was followed by an amendment of the Central Bank, Banking System, and
Money Law 88 of 2003 in October 2011. Furthermore, capacity building and training
workshops were held with all banks to support them in complying with the new regulations.
Technical assistance and advisory services were also provided to the central bank to
strengthen its capacity in monitoring compliance with the corporate governance regulations.
Banks are still in the preparatory phase to comply with the regulations. In that context, the
central bank has started working on extensive training and awareness programs on corporate
governance in March 2012, in collaboration with the Bank. A Train of Trainers program for
corporate governance training for banks took place in the same month. CBE is determined to
raise the standards of corporate governance of all banks. The CBE continues to play an
important role in enforcing corporate governance regulations, and enjoys a positive reputation
throughout the banking sector as a strict but fair regulator.

7.       On the lending front, DPL III was closely linked to five key financial sector
operations in Egypt. The World Bank has gained further experience in development policy
lending in the Egyptian financial sector (through DPLs I and II) that was commended and
used by the authorities to guide the design and implementation of the second generation
program. DPLs I and II (each US$ 500 million) supported the government in implementing
the first generation of its Financial Sector Reform Program (2004–2008) discussed above,
where the focus was on attaining a sound and efficient financial sector. DPL III aimed to have
a greater emphasis on improving financial intermediation and access. It was also linked and
complemented the work done under the Mortgage Finance Project (equivalent to US$ 37.5
million) that aimed to establish a mortgage finance liquidity facility, strengthen the regulatory
framework for mortgage lending, and modernize property rights registration; as well as the
Affordable Mortgage Finance Program DPL (US$ 300 million), which focused on reforming
the current system of inefficient and poorly targeted supply-side subsidies for housing for the
broad low and middle income sector and replacing them with a transparent and economically
efficient demand-side subsidy system. The financial sector operations were cohesive and
complementary.

8.      While DPL III focused on supporting the legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms
to improve financial intermediation, the Enhancing Access to Finance for Micro and Small
Enterprises Project (US$ 300 million) provided a line of credit to micro and small enterprises.
This complementary project aimed at contributing to a sustainable improvement in inclusion,
with a focus on regional disparities and gender and access to finance for micro and small
enterprises on a commercial basis. This would ultimately lead to job creation, poverty
reduction, and economic growth as well as reduce the impact of the global crisis on those
enterprises, as improvements in institutions, financial infrastructure, and the legal, regulatory,
and supervisory frameworks, that would sustain the increased levels of lending to underserved
groups, and access to finance more broadly.




                                               60
                          Annex 12: Assessment of the Operation’s Design

1.        The design of the operation was well-thought-out. The operation was a one-tranche
operation to support the government in implementing the second generation Financial Sector
Reform Program. The design was influenced by the findings and recommendations of the
2006 IEG review, which noted that outcomes of loans classified under the Financial Sector
Board were significantly better than outcomes of financial sector components of multi-sector
loans. 26

2.       The operation reflected lessons learnt and benefited from the experience of earlier
World Bank loans in Egypt, especially: a) the 1991 Structural Adjustment Loan, which did
not receive satisfactory ratings and fell short of expectations; and b) The Technical Assistance
Project for Privatization, Enterprise, and Banking Sector Reform, approved in 1992 and
cancelled in 1996 that also received poor ratings, with less than US$0.5 million disbursed out
of US$ 9 million and meager progress on the component to design and implement a
comprehensive banking sector reform. In contrast, DPLs I and II (that paved the way for DPL
III) were successful because of the government’s strong commitment to reform and effective
consultations with stakeholders. Moreover, excellent coordination among donors ensured
synergy and effective support to the program. The reforms already implemented have
contributed to the resiliency of the financial system throughout the global financial crisis, as
well as the immediate impacts of the revolution.
3.       The authorities made extensive consultations with the stakeholders, which ensured
ownership, and consensus on the design of the program. CBE was transparent with the public
on the size of bank losses, and its implications on the performance of the system, and its
ability to cater clients. Consultations with the stakeholders, the market players, banks, NBFIs,
regulatory bodies, the government, and the private sector, as well as the outcomes of those
discussions contributed to the design of the program. This has been evident when the
revolution erupted; while many actions undertaken under the previous regime were criticized,
the financial sector reform was not subject to any accusations or attacks.

4.       Despite the complexity of the reform program and the number of organizations
involved domestically, as well as outside donors, the policy areas were well identified and
narrowly focused; and reforms were organized according to their degrees of priority. The
distribution of responsibilities was clear, and a detailed timeline was set. The previous
Egyptian government repeatedly indicated its appreciation of the Bank’s integrated delivery
of assistance, and requested the DPL III operation as a means to improve program design and
to enhance discipline in reform implementation.

5.       DPL III was a single tranche, program loan, rather than part of a programmatic series
of development policy loans for a number of reasons, most importantly that the Second
Generation of Reforms and the supported actions had not existed, been identified, or
considered possible at the time of the original Financial Sector Reform Program (2004-2008).
First, the Second Generation of Financial Reforms (2009-2012) supported by DPL III
naturally included a continuation of strengthening of commercial banks and the regulation
and supervision of commercial banks and non-banks such as insurance and pensions. For
commercial banks and the financial system, this included macro-prudential supervision,
which had not yet been developed in 2004 and Basel II, which was only issued by the Basel
Committee in June 2004 and has been steadily modified since then. Second, the Second
Generation of Financial Reform also moved to strengthening and reform of the state-owned

sector component see IEG (2006), World Bank, p. 84.

                                                        61
specialized banks, which had not been included in the Government’s 2004-2008 Financial
Sector Reform Program because of their sensitivity. Third DPL III included a number of
legal changes not foreseen under the initial Financial Sector Reform Program, notably a law
converting the specialized Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit into a
commercial bank with improved governance, a Non-bank Financial Intermediary Law that
would put micro-finance institutions on a sounder basis, a Private Pensions Law, and granting
licenses for mobile phone payments. Fourth, DPL III was two years after DPL II and could
not commit a new Government, which in practice is proving to be very different than the last
Government. Fifth, the request for DPL III from the Government also included support for
combating the adverse effects of the Global Financial Crisis on the financial system, which
was unseen in 2004 but which were still an issue in 2010.

                                  Annex 14: Lessons Learnt

1.       Strong analytic underpinning and building on other operations. The 2002 FSAP,
and its 2007 Update, helped create a credible blueprint for the design of this operation, which
in turn rendered easier the coordination of donors’ assistance around the realization of this
blueprint. Given the multifaceted nature of the financial reform effort, the contribution of
many donors was needed. Also, this operation benefitted from a number of analytical
underpinnings, as well as numerous lending operations, as detailed in Section 2.2 earlier.

2.      Consultations with stakeholders. Reforms have been undertaken after a process of
close and continuous consultation with all stakeholders. This participative process with wider
involvement not only encouraged a more informed evaluation of the underlying content of
policies but also enhanced the credibility of policies and generated expectations that the
reform process will be sustained.

3.      Effective cooperation with development practices. The Bank team worked in
partnership with USAID, EU, IMF, and AfDB. The respective responsibilities of the different
donors and development partners were clearly defined. This approach was better than
constant “hand holding? and double guessing of the authorities’ intent. The success of the
operation required the right balance between flexibility in the implementation and pro-activity
in providing technical assistance and guidance where needed. In this respect, the approach of
a sub-donors committee followed under this DPL III can be considered best practice and one
that may benefit other operations outside Egypt. See Annex 3 for more details on donors’
collaboration.

4.       Strong and sustained partnership. The close working relationship with the Egyptian
authorities and implementing entities demonstrated that significant reforms were implemented,
backed by a strong leadership and political commitment. This was supplemented by
supportive policy advice and coordinated sector interventions. This best practice partnership
framework is among the key success factors of this operation. Indeed, the respective
responsibilities were clearly defined, including giving the authorities the flexibility needed to
implement the reforms. Since the Egyptian government had a clear vision of what was
needed to be accomplished, cooperation and coordination of support was determined to be the
best approach. It was critical to work with a team of professionals and build a strong policy
dialogue to go the extra mile and provide technical inputs, in some cases beyond the operation.
This has been evident in CBE’s ownership of the operation, which helped in keeping the
operation on track despite the revolution.

5.      The design of the policy matrix is key to the sustainability of the reforms. A well-
defined policy matrix owned by the government and endorsed by the Bank and partners is an
essential implementation roadmap for the authorities to move the agenda forward. A matrix
that is built on solid analytical work that is endorsed by development partners is critical.
However, most important is having a government’s program, which they have full ownership
of and are committed to implement, and there is no sense of imposition.

6.       Having a champion in the government that is competent enough to coordinate
efforts with other implementing entities. Having a government entity or authority that is
empowered and competent enough to successfully build consensus around the program, and
defend it in difficult times of political and social unrest is critical. Moreover, experience has
shown that having a limited number of implementing entities is often more effective and
efficient and ensures smooth flow of work through the life of the operations—preparation,
appraisal, negotiation and implementation.

7.      The single tranche DPL III proved to be a suitable instrument for the Borrower
                                               64
and the Bank. It responded effectively to the needs of the authorities by providing them
timely support based on clearly established prior actions. It provides quicker feedback and
momentum to the reforms that enables follow up and making early adjustments if necessary.
It allows continuity in the dialogue with the authorities. Single tranche operations define
benchmarks based on information available at the time of implementation and not on certain
future developments which might not materialize. As noted above in more detail above
(paragraph 69) the single tranche loan, rather than a programmatic loan, was appropriate,
because the single tranche DPL III (March 2010) supported a Second Financial Sector
Reform Program (2009-12) which entailed new reforms, some of which were unknown or
underdeveloped at the time of DPL I, e.g. Basel II, mobile banking, and some of which were
requested by the government to support the existing reforms in the context of unforeseen
economic developments, such as the Global Financial Crisis that began in 2008.

8.      Lessons Learnt from this operation can be disseminated at knowledge management
events. The experiences in the preparation and implementation of the operation could be
shared with other regions through various means, including the Finance and Private Sector
Development (FPD) network monthly newsletter, as well as through hosting a brown bag
lunches (BBL).

Comments on Issues Raised by the Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
9.       The Egyptian authorities were appreciative of the support provided by the World
Bank. The authorities rated the World Bank's performance during the operation as overall
highly satisfactory as indicated in Annex 2. The operation witnessed close coordination and
communication with the implementing entity and the relevant officials, and they
acknowledged that the day-to-day support and close supervision of the operation from the
field has helped in ensuring successful implementation. The government also clearly stated
that they greatly valued the technical assistance and advisory services packaged with the loan.

10.      Moreover, various donors, development partners, and international institutions have
been providing support for the implementation of the government’s overall financial sector
reform program through the provision of technical assistance, and analytical work on
reforming and restructuring the financial sector. This required effective coordination, which
the Bank led in chairing the Financial Sector Donors Subgroup. This cooperation led to
mutual design and agreement of conditionality issues that all donors agreed were essential for
financial sector reform. In addition, donors were able to do a much better job of leveraging
resources, both loan and technical assistance, when coordination is effective. The most
effective and successful coordination was with USAID, IMF, AfDB, and the EU. More details
are included in Annex 3.
