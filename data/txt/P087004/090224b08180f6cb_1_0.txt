                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All civil works, under the original and first AF, are completed.
                         Regarding the second additional credit (USD 10 million signed on May 4, 2011), the upgrading of Praia-Cidade Velha road on the island of Santiago is ongoing and expected to be
                         completed before May 2013 while the rehabilitation of the rural roads of Ponta de Talho - Igreja and Ribeira Principal will start in late November of this year. The capacity
                         strengthening of the Road Agency (Institudo Estradas) in the form of Technical Assistance (TA) is progressing well, with the setting up of a GIS-based road data base, drafting of road
                         construction standards and preparation of the second generation performance based road maintenance contracts.
