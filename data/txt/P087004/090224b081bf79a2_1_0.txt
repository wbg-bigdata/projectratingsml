                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All civil works, under the original and first AF, were completed.
                         Regarding the second additional credit (USD 10 million signed on May 4, 2011), the upgrading of Praia-Cidade Velha road on the island of Santiago is ongoing and expected to be
                         completed before May 2013 while the rehabilitation of the rural roads of Ponta de Talho - Igreja and Ribeira Principal is also ongoing and expected to be completed before the closing
                         date. The capacity strengthening of the Road Agency (Instituto de Estradas) in the form of TA is progressing well, with the setting up of a GIS-based road data base and preparation
                         of the second generation performance based road maintenance contracts. Thanks to savings under the road component, US$350,000 have been reallocated to technical assistance
