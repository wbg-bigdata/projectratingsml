3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

         The main development objectives of the Project were to help EGAT: (a) meet, during the 1997
financial crisis, its   investment commitments on generation and transmission projects already under
implementation; (b) not lose ground in accomplishing its organizational restructuring, corporatization and
privatization strategy; and (c) strengthen its environmental management function. The Project also aimed
at improving the regulatory framework for the energy sector. The objective of the Bank's Partial Credit
Guarantee was to help EGAT access long term financing at reasonable maturities and spreads.

         The Project was formulated in response to an urgent request by the Government for Bank
assistance in sustaining EGAT during the financial crisis.       The Government and the Bank         rightly
considered the Bank's Partial Credit Guarantee to be an apt instrument to provide significant additionality,
in terms of narrower margins and longer maturities, for EGAT's debt. It was expected that the issue of two
US$300 million bonds in the international markets would broaden the investor base for Thailand debt and
set a benchmark for EGAT's future bond operations.

         The Project rightly considered regulatory reforms, restructuring, corporatization and privatization
as pre-requisites for mobilizing private sector financing for the power sector, and presented the Bank an
opportunity for continuing its assistance in those areas.     Institutional development aptly focused on
strengthening EGAT's environmental management which was necessary for a sector               coming under
increasing scrutiny of Thai NGOs and civil society.

         Development of electricity infrastructure was fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) which recognized the need to strengthen Thailand's infrastructure base as vital to regaining
its international competitiveness.

         The physical and environmental components of the Project were well within the implementing
capacity of EGAT. However, the expectation of achievement of restructuring, corporatization and
privatization of EGAT, and introduction of regulatory reforms, to the extent foreseen and within a
reasonable time frame, is considered to have been ambitious; this process proved to be tortuous, largely due
to changes in utilities' thinking and Government's policies.

3.2 Revised Objective:

         The original objectives remained unchanged.

3.3 Original Components:

         The Project had the following main components:

         Investment Components: (a) 300 MW, Krabi Thermal Unit 1; (b) 2x700 MW Ratchaburi
         Thermal Units 1 and 2; (c) 600 MW Wang Noi CC Block 3; (d) 500 kV Transmission System for
         IPPs and Hong Sa Project in Laos; (e) Bulk Power Supply for Greater Bangkok; (f) EGAT-TNB
         Stage II Interconnection; and (g) Transmission System Expansion Project 9.

         Policy Components: (a) Restructuring and Corporatization of EGAT; (b) Privatization of EGAT
         Generation; (c) Reforming the Sector's Regulatory System; (d) Formulation of Corporate Policy
         for Environmental and Social Management; and (e) Strengthening EGAT's Environmental
         Management Function.

3.4 Revised Components:



                                                     - 2 -

        EGAT progressively and diligently dropped or deferred several non priority investment
components, as the low power demand situation continued to linger much longer than expected. Major
changes were dropping of: (a) two of the four double circuit 500 kV transmission lines for IPPs, and the
500 kV transmission system for the Hong Sa Project in Laos; (b) two major substations for Bulk Power
Supply for Greater Bangkok, expanding existing substations instead; and (c) several non priority
components of the Transmission System Expansion Project 9.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

        The quality of entry of the Project is rated as highly satisfactory. This operation for Thailand was
in some ways path-breaking, and Bank's desire to be involved only if it brought additionality to EGAT
borrowing was commendable. Formulation and approval of a fairly complex project in a relatively short
period of five months, demonstrated Bank's ability to respond rapidly to a country's need during a crisis.
Provisions for financial discipline and sector reforms underscored Bank's determination and Government's
resolve to sustain sector performance during the financial crisis.        Measures to strengthen EGAT's
environmental capabilities were well conceived and responded to the environmental and social challenges
facing a rapidly expanding power sector; it gave apt recognition to the CAS's priority of improving
environmental management in Thailand. The Project was technically well designed, had a strong rationale
for Bank involvement and met the Bank's Safeguard Policies. The PAD clearly recognized the risks to the
reform process if commitment of the relevant Government agencies faltered and the unions opposed
corporatization and privatization of the sector entities.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

        The overall outcome of the Project is rated as satisfactory.         The achievement of its Policy
components - restructuring corporatization and privatization of EGAT and reforming the sector's
regulatory system - fell somewhat short of expectations, and is rated as satisfactory. The achievement of
the objectives to--help EGAT meet its essential commitments on generation and transmission while
maintaining its financial viability, and of realizing significant additionality through the Bank's Partial
Credit Guarantee support--are both considered to have been admirably met, and is rated as highly
satisfactory. The realization of the objective for environmental strengthening is also rated as highly
satisfactory.

Objective 1. Help EGAT meet its essential investment commitments on generation and transmission
projects whose implementation had already been under way.

This objective was fully achieved as may be surmised from the satisfactory implementation of the Project
components (Section 4.2) and EGAT maintaining a sound financial position (Section 4.4). Due to the
financial crisis, capital expenditures over the period 1997 to 2002 were dropped from a level of about B
236 billion budgeted at appraisal to about B 187 billion, whereas the operating expenses over the same
period were reduced from about B 69 billion to about B 60 billion. These reductions were achieved
through judicious deferment/cancellation of non-essential investment components and improvements in
operational efficiency.

Objective 2.       Help EGAT not lose ground in accomplishing its organizational restructuring,
corporatization and privatization strategy.



                                                      - 3 -

The realization of this objective, as conceived in the PAD, has been partial, though substantial progress
was made in sector reforms. While restructuring of EGAT into Business Units (New Generation and
Transmission Development; Operation/Maintenance and Fuel Procurement; System Control and DSM; and
Support Services) was accomplished, it was done on a Cost Center and not a Profit Center basis (envisaged
in the PAD). While the Corporatization Act for SOE's was passed by the Parliament, conversion of EGAT
into a Private Limited Company was dropped, instead EGAT would be converted into a Public Limited
Company. Splitting up of EGAT and establishment of a wholly-owned EGAT Transmission Subsidiary
has not been achieved. Instead, EGAT would be privatized as a single entity (with assets of about B 300
billion) and listed on the SET as a State-owned Company. The privatization of EGAT thermal plants
(Rayong, Khanom and Ratchaburi) and divestment of its equity in EGCO have been fully accomplished.
EGAT has not constructed by itself any new thermal plants during the project tenure. Thus, while the
momentum of sector reforms was maintained, the path was checkered, as may be seen from Section 10.

Objective 3. Help EGAT strengthen its environmental management function.

This objective was fully met. A major achievement has been the acquisition of an Integrated Environmental
Information Management System capable of analyzing different data required for environmental studies
and analysis. Significant technical assistance was engaged for training in environmental management.
Policies and strategies for environmental and social management were embodied in and institutionalized
through: "EGAT: Corporate Environmental Policy," June, 1999 and "Strategic Implementation
Framework", November, 1999, which sets out Objectives, Targets and Guidelines for implementation of
the Environmental Policy.     Many of EGAT's power plants now have ISO certification.              At Bank's
instance, EGAT prepared the "Power Sector Environmental Assessment" which defines the
framework/guidelines for environmental assessment. Substantial progress has been achieved in gazettment
of the National Park (through which the Yadna gas pipeline passes), a concept proposed by the Bank, as a
forest reserve area. However, gazettment will take time as it is difficult to eject encroachers.

Objective 4. Improving the regulatory framework for the Energy sector.

This objective was partially realized. Following approval of the Pool-based ESI structure (which envisaged
setting up of an Independent Regulator) by the previous Cabinet, a considerable amount of work was
accomplished by the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) in drafting Secondary Legislation. However,
this work was kept in abeyance following the new Government's decision to withhold passage by the
Parliament of the Energy Act (approved by the previous Cabinet). Instead, a new Ministry of Energy
(MOE) was created while the Power Pool model approved by the previous Cabinet was dropped. The
regulatory issues would be re-visited after the new ESI structure has been firmed up and it is expected that
an Independent Regulator would be set up. A significant achievement was the change in the wholesale
tariff structure from October 2000. The bulk supply tariff which contains an energy price adjustment
mechanism (Ft) enabling EGAT to recover from its invoiced sales any excess costs of its fuel and energy
purchases, has now been enhanced to include consideration of efficiency gains and              certain foreign
exchange losses on loan repayments and interest payments over base rates.             The wholesale tariff is
separated into generation and transmission charges by voltage level and by time of use periods; and for
MEA and PEA, these tariffs are the same and cross subsidy payments are made directly via cash transfers
by MEA to PEA, making the subsidies between urban and rural consumers more transparent.

Objective 5. The Bank's partial credit guarantee would result in significant additionality both in terms
of narrower margins and longer maturities for the bond issues.




                                                    - 4 -

This objective was admirably met. The Bank's Guarantee not only secured better terms of narrower
margins and longer maturities - the $300 million bond carries a semi-annual interest payment of 7% and a
balloon payment of principal at the end of the maturity period of 10 years. The spread for sovereign bond
at that time was 900 basis points over US Treasury rate of 4%, or a total interest of 13%. - in fact it made
the bond issue itself possible at a time when investors were turning their backs to even sovereign issues by
countries (including Thailand) affected in the region by the 1997 economic crisis. Further, with EGAT and
its bonds being now rated by international credit rating agencies (Moody's and S&P), which have
encouraged EGAT to adopt International Accounting Standards, it is expected that the process of EGAT
corporatization and listing on the SET would be greatly facilitated. The second US$300 million bond was
not required as EGAT's financial position recovered considerably and the local debt markets improved
(bonds are currently available at interest rates of 2-3% with maturity of from 3 to 7 years).

4.2 Outputs by components:

         The implementation of the Project's physical components is rated as highly satisfactory. While
some sub-components were rightly dropped or delayed to suit system demand conditions (Section 3.4),
implementation of the remaining components was achieved efficiently and without any serious issues in
procurement, consultant or contractor performance. (refer Annex 2).

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

         At appraisal in 1998, the economic justification of the Project was based on evaluating the ERR of
a time-slice of EGAT's Power Development Plan (PDP). This ERR was 10.87%. At ICR stage in 2003,
the ERR of EGAT's latest PDP was re-evaluated at 9% (1 percentage point below the hurdle rate of 10%
for economic viability of projects in Thailand), considering economic fuel costs based on NEPO's
estimates, which were also used at appraisal. An ERR of 9% under the very adverse financial and
economic conditions is considered to be reasonable. A detailed analysis of economic fuel costs conducted
by the Bank mission during evaluation of the Nam Theun 2 Power Project indicated that these costs were
actually about 20% lower than those suggested by NEPO. Based on these lower fuel costs the ERR of the
PDP was reevaluated at 13% (see Annex 3).

4.4 Financial rate of return:

         In spite of the 1997 economic/financial crisis, the financial objectives of the Project, as reflected
through the covenanted financial ratios, were substantially achieved (see Annex 1). Only on two occasions
did EGAT not comply with the financial covenants - SFR in FY97 and FY00 and Debt Equity Ratio in
FY99 and FY00 (which resulted in the Project receiving a U rating for Development Objectives in
February 1999). As the overall financial health of EGAT continued to remain sound, the Bank allowed a
relaxation of these covenants in FY99-00. In FY02, the SFR covenant was dropped by the Bank as this
parameter was no longer considered relevant for monitoring the financial health of a utility undergoing
significant divestiture and privatization. EGAT maintained a sound financial performance by: (a) prudent
financial management; (b) drastic reduction in capital investments; (c) improvements in operating
efficiency; and (d) generation of liquidity by its sale of shares in the subsidiary company (EGCO) and
power plants (Ratchaburi, Rayong and Khanom).

4.5 Institutional development impact:

         The Project's institutional development impact is rated as high. As a result of organizational
restructuring that EGAT carried out in preparation for commercialization and corporatization, a distinct



                                                     - 5 -

business-oriented culture has emerged in the organization, and there have been discernable improvements in
its operational efficiency. This culture is expected to mature as EGAT becomes a Public Limited
Company and is listed on the SET. In regard to sector reforms, although the momentum has been
maintained over the years, the reform path has been tortuous and the institutional development impact is
regarded as modest.      EGAT's environmental and social policies have been institutionalized and its
organizational and implementation capabilities in these areas demonstrably improved, meriting a high
impact rating.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

         The 1997 economic/financial crisis that struck Thailand led to a severe reduction in power demand,
with a dramatic impact on Thailand's power development plans. Further, as the crisis lingered longer
than expected, the rationale for completion of even priority projects progressively weakened and pruning of
some of the sub-components had to be resorted to during implementation to maintain a reasonably sound
economic and financial position. The California Power crisis and the adverse reports about operation of
the British Power Pool were two other significant external factors that dampened the introduction of the
Power Pool in Thailand, a concept that was developed by NEPO, but not alluded to in the PAD.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

         No Government actions as such adversely affected implementation of the physical components of
the Project. While the Government allowed the restructuring of wholesale tariffs, it did not agree to raising
base tariffs or forgoing remittances (albeit, allowing EGAT to remit in tranches) to meet Bank covenants.
These actions, however, did not have any long-term adverse impact on EGAT's financial health. In regard
to sector reforms, changes in the Government and reluctance on the part of the new Government to follow
the reform course charted by the previous Government led to the abandonment of a competitive Power Pool
structure.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

         While several physical components of the Project were delayed or dropped, it was done
intentionally to suit system demand. The implementation of sector reforms was delayed substantially due
to opposition to corporatization and privatization by EGAT unions, reluctance of the Thai utilities to be
split up and vacillations in Government sector policies.

5.4 Costs and financing:

         The completion cost for the Project was US$2.04 billion, about 66% of the appraisal estimate of
US$3.06 billion (see Annex 2). This was due to EGAT taking decisions to progressively shelve or drop
more and more project components as depression of demand persisted longer than expected. (Section 3.3).

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

         Project sustainability is rated as highly likely. The Project has been constructed in a technically
sound manner and with its long experience in operating complex power projects, it is expected that EGAT
would operate and maintain it successfully. The Project has been constructed with due attention to



                                                     - 6 -

minimizing environmental impact and mitigating social impact. The institution-strengthening measure on
environment management under the Project is already bearing fruit. EGAT has demonstrated its capacity to
restructure and privatize; two of its large generation facilities were privatized recently, the Rayong Thermal
Plant in 1998 and the Ratchaburi Thermal Plant in 2000. The Government's power sector reform,
restructuring and privatization program is still under debate, however, Government is committed to the
privatization of SOEs, including EGAT, MEA and PEA, through their listing on the SET, and it is
expected that an Independent Regulator would be created in the near future. Hence, drastic stalling or
reversal of the power sector reform process is highly unlikely, albeit being on a tortuous path.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

         A summary of the understandings between the Bank and EGAT for operation of the Project for the
next 5 years is presented below. EGAT would furnish annually to the Bank, a summary report on the
following (see Annex 8):

         ·       its latest power development plan, including generation reserve margin
         ·       significant events in corporatization and listing on the SET
         ·       progress in the gazettment of the National Park
         ·       any significant issues on resettlement and compensation
         ·       any events that may adversely affect the physical and policy components of the Project


7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

         Through a concentrated deployment of resources, the Bank was able to formulate and approve the
Project in a period of five months. Bank staff/consultants worked closely with EGAT in reviewing the
massive amount of environmental and social assessments. The Bank correctly foresaw the need for
environmental strengthening of EGAT and encouraged it to make this a Project component. The financial
discipline and sector reform measures insisted upon by the Bank: (a) resulted in EGAT emerging from the
crisis with a sound financial position; and (b) substantially benefited the sector reform process. The Bank
exhibited flexibility in allowing its guarantee to extend to coverage of interest payments, the first time a
Bank guarantee has done so.         Finally, the Bank provided substantial assistance to EGAT in the
appointment of experienced consultants for the bond issue, in the preparation of necessary documents, and
in participation along with the staff of the Government, EGAT and the bond issuers, in road shows in
Europe and USA. This effort on the Bank's part, contributed significantly to securing good financial terms
for the bond, in an environment where investors had little appetite for such issues. The Bank performance
is rated as highly satisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:

         The Bank fielded adequately staffed supervision missions. It maintained a substantial level of
dialogue, largely in an informal, though extensive manner, with EGAT and the Government on pricing,
sector reform, restructuring and privatization. As the power sector was already set on a path of reform, the
Bank saw its role as a facilitator rather than an enforcer of reforms or of their pace. Bank's more formal
involvement was through the ESMAP initiative which fielded a team of experts to independently review the
Power Pool and ESI Reform Study conducted by NEPO. Bank's involvement in discussing, reviewing and



                                                     - 7 -

commenting on various elements of EGAT restructuring and in advising NEPO on the pros and cons of the
industry structures proposed by consultants, are considered to be significant contribtions to the sector
reform process.


         Bank missions emphasized reduction in investments and improvements in operational efficiency. In
times of dire economic distress, the Bank was sympathetic and desisted from demanding tariff increases or
cutting down remittances to the Government.          Finally, in the realm of Environment, the Bank was
instrumental in helping EGAT formulate its Corporate Environmental and Social Policy, preparing a Power
Sector Environmental Assessment, two useful instruments in environmental management. The Bank was
also instrumental in setting the ball rolling for gazettment of the National park. The Bank performance is
rated as highly satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

         The Bank's overall performance is rated as highly satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

         Without EGAT's full cooperation with Bank staff, the Project could not have been developed in
such a short time frame. EGAT staff readily accepted all Bank suggestions to improve the Project
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA's) to Bank standards and turned round a massive amount of
documentation it had earlier produced in record time. EGAT and the Government appointed skilled
consultants as advisors to the bond issue and planned and executed the road shows in a highly successful
manner. EGAT's performance is rated as highly satisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

         Government performance is rated as satisfactory.             NEPO conducted several studies on
restructuring of the ESI, drafted the Energy Act, finalized the regulatory regime for the Energy sector,
formulated the Power Pool Model and secured Cabinet approval. It introduced the new bulk supply tariff
and reforms in the tariff structure. While implementation of the Power Pool was about to take off, the new
Government stepped in and required the entire ESI plan to be reviewed. While the reform process thus
slowed down, it took certain key actions. First, it created the new Ministry of Energy in FY02 which
reorganized and centralized the diverse energy related governmental departments into one single ministry
charged with coordinating the country's energy requirements. Second, it concluded that the Thai economy
is better served in the short term by maintaining control of the market and power pricing and privatizing
thermal generation through the sale of EGAT's components. Hence, it allowed for the sale of EGAT's
Ratchaburi power plants. Third, it revised the original model of restructuring and corporatization of
EGAT, MEA and PEA and speeded up the privatization process by directing all the three utilities to be
privatized by listing (as a whole, without breaking up) on the SET. This model is currently being pursued
diligently by the three utilities. Government's latest decision is to postpone the Power Pool indefinitely and
to continue with EGAT as a single buyer.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

         EGAT implemented the Project's physical components efficiently. Its actions in the face of the
economic/financial crisis were sound, dropping or deferring components in tune with faltering demand. Its



                                                     - 8 -

management of the privatization of power supply through its IPP (with a total of 5,935 MW of new
capacity to come into operation progressively in FY01-07 from 5 fully operational IPPs) and SPPs (with a
total contracted capacity of 2,114 MW from 62 SPPs from FY03-06) programs is commendable. Its
financial and operational management were laudable, enabling it to maintain a reasonably sound financial
health. While EGAT management pursued restructuring and privatization, its efforts were hampered by
the unions; nevertheless the momentum of reform was maintained. EGAT satisfactorily resolved complex
environmental issues in fuel handling for the Krabi and Ratchaburi plants and effectively handled social
issues associated with relocation and compensation of persons affected by the transmission lines. EGAT
efforts towards and results achieved in strengthening its environmental capabilities and getting ISO
certifications for its thermal power plants were exemplary.         EGAT performance is rated as highly
satisfactory.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

         Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated as highly satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

         The following are key lessons learned from this Project: That ­

·        Preparation: Complex projects could be formulated and approved within a short time frame when
there is full cooperation between the Bank and the Borrower.
·        Bank Guarantee: The Bank's Partial Credit Guarantee could be a useful tool in securing
favorable terms for the Borrower, provided it is selectively applied, i.e., when market conditions are
appropriate and the Borrower's own credit rating is sound.
·        Economic/Financial: Sudden economic/financial crisis in a country, especially following a
prolonged period of growth, could severely impact power demand and void power development plans.
Under crisis conditions, utilities need to exercise great financial discipline, drastically cut down operating
expenses and strike an appropriate balance between curtailing and carrying on with investments. Under
such circumstances, the Bank would do well to take a flexible and sympathetic approach to Government
actions and compliance with covenants.
·        Power Sector Reforms: Introduction of complex power pool operations in a developing country
needs to be thought through with care. Active support rather than reluctant acquiescence of the utilities is
necessary to push through a complex reform agenda. The Bank could best play the role of advisor and
facilitator for countries that have already embarked on the path of power sector reforms and should
recognize that restructuring proposals cannot be cast in stone and could change as Government and utility
thinking evolves.

10. Additional Information

Power Sector Reform Stages

         In early 2000, NEPO oriented the reform strategy for the ESI to the creation of a "Competitive
Power Pool", representing a departure over the earlier plan of unbundling EGAT and creating a Single
Buyer sector structure. It proposed a gradual restructuring of EGAT, PEA and MEA to create an industry
with wholesale competition by 2003.         It called for unbundling EGAT's generation and transmission
functions, with the creation of: (a) a state-owned Transmission Company (TransCo); (b) Hydro plants; (c)
Thermal power plants (GenCOs). (d) an Independent System Operator (ISO); (e) an Independent Regulator
(IR); and (f) Distribution Companies (DisCos). The legal framework and implementation of this ESI were
embodied in the new Energy Act which was prepared by NEPO and approved by the Cabinet (earlier
Government) in October 2000. The SOE Corporatization Act was approved by Parliament in 2000.

         In response, EGAT formulated a three-stage Privatization Action Plan: Stage 1 (2000-01) -
Commercialize EGAT into 5 autonomous Business Units (i) Maintenance-Engineering-Construction-Fuel,
(ii) Hydro Generation, (iii) Transmission with System Operator, (iv) Power Purchaser and Wholesaler, and
(v) Corporate Support; Stage 2 (2002-03) - Corporatize EGAT by establishing one ThermalGenCo
subsidiary company (contrary to three proposed by NEPO), separate within itself the Grid Business and
Power Pool Function, including System Operator, Market Operator, and Settlement Administration, with
EGAT becoming a Single Buyer and Central Supplier of power; and Stage 3 (2004 onwards) - Power
pool commencement - Privatize EGAT by reducing its shareholding in ThermalGenCo to less than 50%
and commence the competitive wholesale power pool system with EGAT assuming the role of operator of
the Transmission, Hydropower and Power Pool systems and (i) establishment of comprehensive pool rules
for the electricity market; (ii) further privatization of generation facilities and other subsidiaries; and (iii)
establishing within EGAT the DebtCo and the PPA Trader (that would eventually be separated from
EGAT).

         In February 2001 the new Government announced an Agenda on Privatization, which called for
listing 16 SOE's on the SET, from 2001 to 2003 (EGAT in the 3rd Quarter and MEA and PEA in the 4th
Quarter of 2003).     In May 2001 the new Government initiated a complete review of the previous
Government's Power Sector policy and decided to postpone consideration of the Energy Act approved by
the previous Cabinet. In parallel, EGAT (sensitized by the California Power Crisis) did some serious
rethinking on the creation of a Power Pool by 2003 and advocated a "Third Party Grid Access" model,
wherein ownership and operation of the grid would still be with EGAT but competitors would be allowed to
use it, on non-discriminatory terms. An EGAT Company, 70% State-owned would be formed, while an
EGAT Thermal Power Plant Company would be spun off from the EGAT Company, but still remaining
70% EGAT-owned.          To comply with the Government's directive for listing on the SET, EGAT
commissioned in January 2002, consulting studies to recommend the most appropriate ESI structure for
Thailand and an appropriate corporate strategy and privatization structure for EGAT.

         A Ministry of Energy (MOE) was created on October 1, 2002 comprising five departments ­
Office of the Minister, Office of the Permanent Secretary, Department of Petroleum Resources,
Department of Energy Business, Department of Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation and Energy
Policy and Planning (EPPO) which replaces the erstwhile NEPO.

         Subsequently, an unanimous decision was taken by EGAT, MEA, PEA and the Government to



                                                      - 10 -

move away from NEPO's "Power Pool " model. EPPO proposed a new model: (i) split EGAT into three
PowerGens.; (ii) create an Independent System Operator (ISO); (iii) create a Transmission Company
(GridCo); (iv) create an Independent Regulator; and (v) separate "network" and "retail" functions within
MEA and PEA. Disagreeing with EPPO's model, EGAT proposed an alternative model (i) up to 30% of
total demand to operate in a "free market" under a Power Exchange; (ii) EGAT would maintain the
generation function, its present PPAs with GenCos, and ability to contract power under new PPAs for
future GenCos; (iii) EGAT would maintain the transmission and system control functions; (iv) MEA and
PEA could buy power only from EGAT; and (v) residential, commercial and small industrial consumers
would purchase power from MEA and PEA. While MEA and PEA broadly supported EPPO's model they
strongly opposed EGAT's model. To resolve the impasse between the utilities the Government called for a
wider debate on the subject.

         The Government has decided to postpone indefinitely the plan to set up the "Power Pool" and focus
attention on listing of EGAT, MEA and PEA on the SET - EGAT (2004 - Q1); MEA (2004 ­ Q2) and
PEA (2004 ­ Q3). There are indications that an Independent Regulator would be created in the near
future. The internal restructuring of EGAT (as also of the other utilities MEA and PEA) have been steps
in the right direction for commercialization and corporatization. However, as the overall sector structure is
still under finalization, it is premature to comment on its efficiency. Departure from a complex power pool
model, though apparently a retrograde step, could still be an appropriate decision under the current state of
the electricity industry. The creation of a Ministry of Energy is considered to be a very positive step and
the proposed setting up of an Indepenent Regulator bode well for the sector's efficient operation.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

        The economic cost-benefit analysis is done for EGAT's latest Power Development Plan
(PDP-2003), evaluating the incremental costs and benefits streams over the period 2003-2012. The
following assumptions are made:

·       The analysis is done in constant 2002 prices.
·       The capital investments pertain to projects planned to be completed during 2003-2012,
exclusive of duties, taxes and interest during construction (IDC).
·       The base year for calculating incremental costs and benefits is 2002.
·       The incremental Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and administrative costs for EGAT's
plants as percent of capital costs are: (i) Oil/gas fired thermal ­ 3.0%; (ii) Lignite/gas fired      thermal
­ 3.5%; (iii) Combined Cycle ­ 4.0%; (iv) Internal Combustion Turbines ­ 4.0%; (v)              Hydro ­ 1.0%;
(vi) Transmission -1.5%.
·       For EGAT plants the incremental costs are those for fuel and O&M.
·       For IPP and SPP plants the incremental costs are those for availability (capacity) payments
and energy (fuel pass through) payments.
·       Benefits from sale of electricity are evaluated at the tariffs (inclusive of 7% VAT and Fuel
surcharge Ft) derived from financial projections.
·       The deflators for conversion to constant 2002 prices (see project Files)
·       The ERRs are evaluated for two cases: Case 1- Based on fuel prices used by EGAT for its
Power Development Plan PDP-2003; and Case 2 ­ based on fuel prices developed by the IBRD mission
for the Nam Theun 2 Project (see tables below).

        The details of the ERR calculations are given in Attachments 1 and 2. The ERRs are 9% for Case
1 and 13% for Case 2.

Introduction

1.       A World Bank Mission composed of Darayes Mehta visited EGAT during the period August 20 to
25, 2003 for preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the above mentioned project.
This Aide Memoire presents the Mission's findings and agreements reached with EGAT. The Mission
wishes to thank EGAT for its excellent cooperation.

Summary of Mission's Findings

2.       The following is a summary of the Mission's findings:

Physical Implementation. Physical implementation progress is very satisfactory. Some project components
- Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9 and 500kV Transmission System for IPPs - have been
deliberately delayed by EGAT in keeping with the reduction in demand growth and delays in some of the
IPP projects.

Disbursements. Disbursements from the bond proceeds have been completed in full.

Financial Performance and Audit. The financial performance of EGAT in FY02 was satisfactory and
complied with all Bank covenants.        The projected financial performance for FY03-07 also shows
satisfactory results and compliance with all financial covenants.

ESI Restructuring and EGAT Corporatization and Privatization. The Government's current policy is to:
According to the Memorandum of the State Enterprise Policy Office, Ministry of Finance on the occasion of the
Prime Minister's visit to EGAT on March 13, 2003. (i) postpone the setting up of the Power Pool indefinitely;
(ii) corporatize EGAT as a single entity; and (iii) list EGAT in the Stock Exchange Market of Thailand and
distribute shares on the basis of state owned shareholder holding not less than 50 percent of the equity.
EGAT is well on its way towards corporatization under the Corporatization Act B.E. 2542 by December
2003, and listing itself on the SET by March 2004, with an asset value of four hundred (400) billion Baht.
The new organization structure will comprise 3 business units - Generation and Transmission
Development; Power Plant Operation and Maintenance and Fuel Procurement; and Transmission systems
Operation and Maintenance, System Control and Demand Side Management; with the remaining services in
the Holding Group.

Sale of Ratchaburi Power Plant. The sale of Ratchaburi Thermal Power Plants 1-2 and Combined Cycle
Power Plants 1, 2 and 3 has been completed.



                                                      - 25 -

Environmental Issues. There are no outstanding environmental issues.

Gazettment of the Thung Pha Phum Forest Area. The proposal for gazettment of the TPP forest reserve to
a National Park has still not been submitted to the Cabinet as removal of park encroachers has not yet been
accomplished. The survey and mapping of the area proposed for gazettment is being finalized by the
National Park Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department, following which key steps in gazettment would
be proceeded with.

Economic Analysis. The Mission discussed in detail the methodology of performing the economic cost
benefit analysis of the Project. Subsequent work done by EGAT shows, prima facie, that EGAT's current
Power Development Plan is economically viable with EIRR exceeding the 10% threshold. Further detailed
analysis will be done by the Mission.

Agreements reached with EGAT

10.     The following agreements were reached with EGAT.

Borrower's Own Report

11.     EGAT will furnish to the Bank the Borrower's Own Report on the Project, following the Bank's
ICR Guidelines, by September 30, 2003.

Bank's ICR

12.     The Bank will submit its ICR to EGAT by November 15, 2003.

Operational Phase

Additional Annex 9. Borrower's Evaluation Report


                           EGAT INVESTMENT PROGRAM SUPPORT PROJECT



Introduction


1.       Following the financial crisis that hit Thailand in 1997, the exchange rate plummeted from Baht 25
per US dollar to Baht 50 per US dollar. This had serious consequences on the financial health of EGAT,
which suffered heavily on account of higher operating costs, debt service requirements and foreign
exchange losses.      EGAT could no longer comply with the Bank's self financing ratio covenant.
Government was reluctant to allow tariff increases to help the electricity utilities, as it did not want to
increase the financial burden on the people who were already reeling under financial difficulties. As prior
to the financial crisis, the demand was growing rapidly in Thailand, at the rate of about 10-12% per year,
EGAT had already under way several power generation projects. While EGAT management could curtail
several projects, it had to carry on with those projects for which contractual and other commitments had
already been made, as stopping such projects would have had serious financial implications, and besides, it
was not certain how long the emergency would last. EGAT's borrowing requirements to continue
implementing these projects was heavy and this was further aggravated by the fact that EGAT could not
access long term financing that it needed for power projects at reasonable rates, due to the markets
perception of higher country risk and the near collapse of the domestic debt market. The Government
directed EGAT to raise part of its financing needs from international capital markets and to explore the
efficacy of the World Bank's Partial Credit Guarantee instrument in securing debt at reasonable rates.
EGAT quickly assessed its borrowing requirements in terms of two bonds of US$300 million equivalent
each, suitably spaced in time. EGAT, requested the World Bank, which was at that time preparing a
transmission project, to stop that project and instead concentrate on processing a Partial Credit Guarantee
operation on an emergency footing, in a very short time frame.            The World Bank's response was
encouraging, although it realized that it would have to deploy large resources, especially to appraise the
environmental and social aspects of several power generation and transmission projects for which EGAT
wanted to use the proceeds from the proposed bonds.

Assessment of Project Objectives, Design, Implementation and Operation Experience

Project Objectives

         From EGAT's view point, the main objective of the project was to be able to secure long term
financing at reasonable maturities and reasonable interest rates, using the Bank's Partial Credit Guarantee
instrument. Such financing would help EGAT maintain its financial health during the emergency years
while continuing to implement projects it had already committed. EGAT also appreciates the other
objectives of the project which were: (a) to support its organizational restructuring, corporatization and
privatization; and (b) strengthen the regulatory framework for the energy sector (essentially under
Government's jurisdiction).

         In EGAT's opinion, the project's main objective to secure long term financing with reasonable
maturities and at reasonable rates, was fully met. EGAT was able to secure the first US$300 million bond,
which provided for semi-annual interest payments and a balloon payment of principal at the end of the
maturity period of 10 years. When this bond was secured, the spread of the sovereign bond was 900 basis



                                                      - 27 -

points over US Treasury rate of 4%, or a total interest rate of 13%. Further, with financing secured from
this bond and the efforts made by EGAT management to closely monitor the power demand situation and to
drastically slow down implementation of projects and weeding out non priority sub components of many
projects, EGAT was able to maintain a reasonably sound financial position. With the improvement in its
financial position and ability to access funds, and improvement in the financial climate, EGAT did not need
to go in for the second bond operation. The first US$300 million bond was fully disbursed on schedule.

         EGAT believes that the project's objective of organizational restructuring, corporatization and
privatization was also very substantially met. EGAT successfully restructured its organization in line with
the current Government's directive to convert EGAT into a state majority owned corporation and to list a
portion of its equity on the stock market in 2004. EGAT has also taken necessary steps to proceed towards
listing of the company. During the project implementation period, EGAT plans to sell out all of its power
plants at Rayong and Khanom and acquires more shares of Ratchaburi to retain at least 60% by the year
2004. In regard to the competitive Power Pool that was proposed by the National Energy Policy Office
(NEPO) under the previous Government, EGAT had very strong reservations on the need for such an
industry structure. EGAT believed that Thailand was not yet ripe for such a structure as this could lend
itself to abuse by private power producers, (based on experience in more advanced countries like UK and
USA) and the Thai power system was already very efficient so that benefits gained could be marginal.
EGAT was successful in persuading the current Government to abandon the Power Pool concept, at least in
the near future.

         In regard to reorganization of the Regulatory Framework for the Power Sector, EGAT believes
that this is something for the Government to decide upon, although EGAT has conveyed its views to the
Government during the various committee meetings.

Project Components

         The main components of the project and the status of their implementation is given below. Major
changes in the transmission components (d) and (e), both in terms of physical components and timing of
installation, had to be introduced as the demand dropped substantially. There were no major issues in
procurement and construction. Major delays were encountered in the finalization of the fuel supply
systems for Ratchaburi and Krabi, due to the lengthy process of environmental assessment and clearance.
In general, EGAT considers overall implementation performance to be very satisfactory.

(a) 300 MW, Krabi Thermal Unit 1. The unit was synchronized on August 14,2003 and has been
operating satisfactorily.

(b) 2x700 MW Ratchaburi Thermal Units 1 & 2. The first unit was taken into commercial operation on
June 15, 2003 and the second unit on October 28, 2003. Both units are operating satisfactorily.

(c) 600 MW Wang Noi CC Block 3. The CC Block was put into commercial operation on May 5, 1999
and has been operating satisfactorily.

(d) 500 kV Transmission System for IPPs and Hong Sa Project in Laos. The Hong Sa Project in Lao PDR
was dropped as the Power Purchase Agreement between the Lao Government and EGAT could not be
satisfactorily negotiated, and EGAT could do without this power.            Hence the 500 kV associated
transmission line project for Hong Sa was dropped. The 500 kV transmission project for IPPs, envisaged
construction of two double circuit transmission lines each in the Eastern and Western Corridors, with
associated substations. As demand dropped and IPP projects were either postponed or cancelled, this


                                                     - 28 -

component was substantially curtailed during implementation, with dropping of two of the four double
circuit 500 kV transmission lines. The 500 kV system will be fully completed by December 2004.

(e) Bulk Power Supply for Greater Bangkok. Due to lower than expected demand, two major substations
were cancelled and instead existing substations were expanded. This project component will be fully
completed by December 2004.

(f) EGAT-TNB Stage II Interconnection. This project was successfully completed in September 2001 and
has been operating satisfactorily.

(g) Transmission System Expansion Project 9. This component is about 96% complete and is expected to
be fully completed by March 2005.

Borrower's Own Performance

         On the whole, EGAT considers its performance in project design and in project implementation to
be very satisfactory. EGAT also took prompt actions in its organizational restructuring, corporatization
and in listing on the SET. On the financial front, EGAT was able to record satisfactory financial results
and largely complied with the Bank's financial covenants, under very adverse financial circumstances.
EGAT also promptly made all interest payments on the US$300 million Bond.

         The main lessons learned under the project are (a) the need to maintain strict financial discipline
and curtail non priority expenditure, during an emergency situation; (b) to allow a long lead time for
environmental clearances for generation projects; and (c) not to rush into accepting major industry
restructuring, like introduction of a competitive Power pool.

Bank's Performance

         Overall, the Bank's performance from EGAT's viewpoint was very satisfactory. EGAT gratefully
acknowledges Bank's assistance in securing the Bond financing, with Bank staff accompanying EGAT
during road shows. It also appreciates Bank's prompt response in appraising the project in a very short
time frame. EGAT found Bank's supervisions to be very regular and dialog with Bank staff on policy
matters, especially environmental strengthening and organizational restructuring to be very useful. Above
all it appreciated Bank's flexible approach during the financial crisis and its understanding of EGAT's
problems in restructuring and coproratization, many of which were beyond EGAT's control. Thanks to the
Bank's Field Office, the implementation support and rapid response to addressing needs were provided.
More importantly, the project leader was fully authorized which was found key success of this project. His
decisive actions taken on the overall project implementation was considered timely, adequate responsive
pushing the project well on progress despite a number of encountered problems.

Proposed Arrangements

Future Operation

         The future operation of the project will be closely followed up by the respective departments of
EGAT concerned with the various project components. These departments have very capable operation
and maintenance staff to efficiently and appropriately operate and maintain its plant. Comprehensive and
well-documented operation and maintenance procedures, including environmental management, are in place
to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the new facilities.

        Regarding EGAT Corporatization and Privatization, EGAT, with the assistance of experienced
consultants in necessary fields including management, finance, legal, accounting and tax and change
management, is on schedule to register itself as the EGAT Public Company Ltd. with the Ministry of
Commerce in March 2004 and to privatize itself as a whole by way of public offering in May 2004.
