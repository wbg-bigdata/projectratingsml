EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The proposed project includes four generation components at three sites and four
transmission components in various stages of completion. Generation Components:
Krabi Thermal Unit 1 (300 MW); Ratchaburi Thermal Units 1-2 (2x700 MW) and
Combined Cycle Blocks 1-3 (3x600 MW); and, Wong Noi Combined Cycle Stage 2 (600
MW). Transmission Components: 500 kV Transmission System for IPPs; Strengthening
of Bulk Power Supply System for Greater Bangkok Area; EGAT-TNB (Malaysia) - Stage II
Interconnection; and Transmission System Expansion No. 9 (TS. 9). Executive Summaries
of the environmental impact assessments (EA) or environmental impact analyses (EIA) of
each component prepared by EGAT are attached.
Environmental Protection. Power plants and transmission lines are subject to stringent
environmental standards in Thailand (more stringent than the Bank guidelines in general).
The proposed generation facilities will utilize cleaner fuels like natural gas. Flu Gas
Desulfurization (FGD) will be installed for power plants at Rachaburi and Krabi (fuel oil
with 2% sulfur). The selected FGD systems represent commercially proven technology
and will be designed to remove at least 80% of sulfur at Krabi and 90% at Ratchaburi. An
environmental monitoring and management group will be instituted at each facility in
order to meet regulations, along with EGATs corporate policy goals and responsibility.
Environmental Considerations. In accordance with the Bank Operational Directive
4.01 on Environmental Assessment, the overall project has been assigned Category 'A'.
EGAT, with assistance of local and international consultants, prepared the EAs for the
four generation facilities (at three sites) and two transmission lines as required by the
Thailand's regulation. Focused EIAs for the remaining two transmission lines (not
required by the Thailand's regulations) were prepared for the Bank project. All EAs
required by the Thailand's regulation have been submitted and most of them approved by
the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP) of National Environmental
Board (NEB). The two transmission line EAs were reviewed by the Bank earlier as a part
of another project and were found satisfactory. EGAT has provided addendum and
executive summaries to the EAs for this project which provide updated information,
further clarification and explanation. All eight components of the project have been
designed and will be implemented in accordance with the modem concept of
environmental management and Thailand's regulations. EGAT is also considering
implementation of ISO 14001 at their current generation facilities.
Fuel transport EAs for each generation facility (not financed under this project) have also
been prepared by fuel suppliers (e.g. Petroleum Authority of Thailand - PTT) and
reviewed and approved by the OEPP in Thailand. These EAs have been sent to the Bank.
Generation Components.   For power generation, EGAT has proposed to use
environmentally friendly and clean natural gas at Wang Noi and Rachaburi Combined
cycle and 2% sulfur fuel oil for Rachaburi thermal and Krabi. FGD systems with at least
2



80% efficiency at Rachaburi thermal and 90% at Krabi will be utilized to meet stringent
sulfur dioxide emissions standards in Thailand.  Particulates will also be partially
controlled by the FGD. The theoretical amount of particulate emissions at Ratchaburi
thermal and Krabi are expected to be around 70 mg/Nm3 which is less than the 1988
Bank guidelines (applicable when these power plants were designed and initiated but
these are higher than the 1998 guidelines of 50 mg/Nm3>. Dispersion modeling for the site
predicted maximum ground level contribution of the power plant to be luss than 5 urnimn
which is minimal. Considering the location of these facilities, further particulate control
is not needed. However, ambient monitoring will be conducted and if power plant is
shown to be a major contributor to the exceedance of particulate standards, further
controls may be considered.
When possible, gypsum which is a by product of FGD will be utilized for construction
industry. Nitrogen oxides will be controlled at each facility by low NOx burners, flue gas
recirculation and water injection as required to meet emissions standards. Continuous
monitoring for sulfur and nitrogen oxides and early warning systems for air pollution will
be instituted at each facility.
Water usage will be minimized by employing close loop (or recirculating cycle) cooling
systems. Water intakes will be pretreated and discharges will be controlled to meet Thai
standards and World Bank guidelines. A holding pond, water reservoir and a waste water
treatment system will be constructed to reduce discharge water temperature. When
required, water will be neutralized before being discharged. Oil/water separators are
provided at oil storage and handling areas, and sanitary sewage would be treated. Net and
other methods to prevent fish entering the inlet water pipes will be employed.
EGAT facilities will be surrounded with visual screens like greenbelt and other barriers to
reduce noise and intrusion. Noisy activities (mine blasting) will be conducted only during
the day time and in coordination with the local authority.
Transmission Components. In selection of routes for transmission lines and
substation sites, EGAT uses design criteria to minimize environmental impacts on forest,
wildlife, watershed areas, populations, archeological sites. and scenery. Transmission
line right of ways are not to be located through: (a) restricted Class IA watershed area,
according to laws and regulations; and, (b) holy places, archeological sites and
government sites. Transmission line right of ways should also avoid: (a) watershed area
class IB, Class C forest conservation areas, mangrove forest, national parks and other
conservation areas; (b) community and developed areas; (c) lines should be in parallel
with or close to telephone and telegraph cables for a long distance to avoid interference;
and, (d) airports.
Detailed Route Surveys. Before construction of the transmission system, detailed route
surveys will be performed by EGAT staff together with the Royal Forest Department
(RFD). The number of forest trees to be cut will be documented. In addition, final route
3



selection adjustments to avoid dwellings and circumvent other areas of potential negative
impact will be made, according to EGATs environmental design criteria.
Construction. EGATs guidelines for construction activities are: (a) avoid installation of
new access roads for construction purposes; try to utilize existing trails; (b) no
cutting of trees over the limitations set by RFD; and, (c) clean up construction sites
upon completion of construction work.
Maintenance of the Right of Way. Along the valleys, only trees considered to be
hazardous to the stability of the transmission system would be cut down. Landowners
are permitted to cultivate economic crops along the right of way corridors. Upon
completion of transmission line construction work, ground cover around the towers will
be planted and land contouring will be done as required to provide a protective covering
for the earth and to prevent soil erosion. No herbicides are used in right of way
maintenance.
Environmental Management and Monitoring. For all components in this project,
environmental aspects have been taken into consideration and should cause minimal
disturbance to the human and natural environment. An environmental management
program consisting of mitigation, monitoring, and action plans at the plant level have
been incorporated into the project to confirm environmental performance on a sustainable
basis. Monitoring will be conducted at each facility for air and water effluent quality,
noise. ground water hvdrologv and qualitv. aauatic ecologv. solid waste management.
socio-economic indicators, public health and safety.
Analysis of Alternatives. In planning and development analysis, EGAT takes into
account the alternatives for: site locations, fuel type and transport, and gypsum supply and
dispo,sal when FGD is utilized. Before the projects are included in the formal power
sector development (PDP) analyses of: feasibility; alternatives; fuel availability both
locally and in the international markets; flexibility and reliability of fuel supply; transport
options; initial environmental impacts; land availability and ownership; extent of
resettlement; socio-economic impact; political and international treaties; and others are
performed by EGAT along with local and international consultants. EGAT also takes into
account the Government of Thailand's needs related to energy security by diversifying
fuel -use and sites. The projects that satisfy these criteria, are further processed through a
program called PRO-SCREEN for prioritization and inclusion in PDP. All components
under considerations in this project were selected after an extensive analysis as described
above.
Public Consultation. EGATs corporate policy requires public participation and seeks
their acceptance of the development project. For the components in this project, EGATs
objectives in public consultation was to obtain the opinions, needs, problems and
obstacles of the people and communities living in the operational areas, as well as
disseminating accurate information about the project. Local communities, leaders, and
government and non-governmental organizations (NGO) were canvassed and requested
4



recommendations. Several public meetings were held at each of the project site to discuss
concerns, mitigation measures and seek resolutions. Alternatives to the projects were
discussed with the local communities, as appropriate for each site as detailed in the
project specific environmental executive summaries. Even though public participation is
included in EGAT policy, the timing, transparency and public awareness of planning
considerations in project selection will be further improved.

Executive summary
Krabi Thermal Power Plant Unit 1 and 2
Environmental Impact Assessment
1.     Introduction: The Krabi Thermal Power Plant Unit I and 2 will be located at
Tambon Khlong Khanan, King Amphoe Nua Khlong, Changwat Krabi. The plant will use oil
(2% sulphur) as main fuel source. The nominal capacity for each unit is 300 MW. The proposed
power plant would be located within EGAT premises near the old lignite-fired Krabi Power
Plant which was decommissioned in September of 1995. Civil works had just begun on site as
of June, 1998.
2.      Fuel Transportation: The Krabi Power Plant will use domestic or imported oil. The
barge transport EIA has been submitted to the Thailand Office of Environmental Policy and
Planning (OEPP). Oil would be transfered from ships to 1,000 ton barges, through an estuary
(24 km) to a dock near the power station, and then via pipeline to the power station.
Preliminary analysis indicates an alternative for cost and environmental reasons may be a
pipeline from an offshore ship loading facility, to an underground pipeline (16 km) along an
existing road right of way to the power station. This alternative is under study; if this
alternative is preferred, the Pipeline EIA would be subject to review by the World Bank after
approval by OEPP.
3     Fuel Storage: Backup fuel (diesel and heavy stock) would be stored in aboveground
tanks with environmental safeguards including: impermeable diked storage areas; grounding;
high and low level alarms; and fire fighting systems. Emergency spill and firefighting plans
have been develnped and an arccident prevention program would bp institd. Fie protecion.
systems within the power plant area and vicinity will be designed according to National Fire
Protection Association (NFPA) Standards. The facility Emergency Plan covers fire and
explosion. A spill prevention, control and response plan will be added to the site Emergency
Plan, and added to the emergency response drill routine.
4.    Hazardous Chemical Containment and Storage:  All chemical storage tanks,
solution tanks, and chemical feed pumps will be located on curbed concrete containment
areas drained through separate chemical waste collection piping to a neutralization basin or a
chemical waste collection sump. A curbed concrete area will be provided with a chemical-
resistant coating suitable for the particular service. As a minimum, the combined volume of
the curbed area and the associated neutralization basin or waste sump will be adequate to
contain the entire volume of the largest single tank served. A spill prevention, control and
response plan will be added to the site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response
drill routine.
5.    Chlorine: The chlorination station for the condenser cooling water will be equipped
with a leak detection and alarm system, wind sock, leak stemming gear and personnel
protective equipment, including self contained breathing apparatus. A chlorine leakage
response scenario will be added to the plant emergency plan, and leak response drills
undertaken as part of the emergency response drill routine.
6.      Water Demand and Raw Water Sources: During operation water will be used for
steam production, S02 removal system, and domestic consumption. The main sources of raw
6



water tor tne aDove purposes are two existing reservoirs. Kaw water wouli be pre-treatea Dy
clarification, filtration, and chlorination. Make up water for the circulating cooling system
would be drawn from Khlong Pakasai, and would amount to only 4.5% of the minimum flow
rate of Khlong Pakasai. Water quality in Khlong Pakasai has been found to meet standards.
7.      Wastewater Treatment: Oil handling areas would be drained through oil/water
separators and then to the holding pond. Chemical area drains and the demineralisation plant
effluent would be treated in a neutralisation basin prior to discharge to the holding pond.
Sewage will be treated to meet Ministrv of Lndust-y discharge standuards before discharge into
the wastewater holding pond. Wastewater treatment facilities are meet Thai and World Bank
discharge standards at the treatment unit. The holding pond discharge would amount to less than
one percent of the flow of Khlong Pakasai.
8.      Ambient Air Quality:   Since the lignite-fired Krabi power station was
decommissioned, ambient air quality has been well below limits for pollutants; there are no
other significant sources of air pollution in the vicinity. One year of meteorological data was
used in dispersion modelling, while ambient baseline air quality was sampled in wet and dry
seasons. Modelling results indicate that ground level concentrations of NO2, S02 and TSP are
within Thai and World Bank standards when the FGD is in operation.
9.      Enission Control System: Sulphur Dioxide and dust will be controlled by a wet
limestone Flue Gas Desulfurization System (FGD) with a minimum of 80% efficiency prior to
emission. An emergency plan has been adopted in case of FGD malfunction, since dispersion
modelling indicates unacceptable air quality would result. The operation of the power plant will
be stopped within 10 minutes after the signal of FGD break down is shown. Stopping the
operation of the thermal power plant with FGD system can be done immediately since there is
enough Reserved Margin in the system. There will be 2 units of power plant; stopping operation
of one 300 MW unit would not affect the total national electricity demand. In case the FGD
breaks down but it is necessary to continue operation of the power plant, diesel fuel would be
used with the oil, and generation would be reduced.
10.     Solid Waste Management: Gypsum will be generated from operation of the FGD's.
This by-product will be transported to an existing mine pit within EGAT's premises with
capacity of about 10 MCM, sufficient for the 25 year operating life of the power plant.
Wastewater treatment plant sludge will also be disposed in an onsite mine pit, according to
regulations of the Ministry of Industry for sanitary landfills. Domestic waste will be removed
and disposed of properly by the Nua Khlong Sanitary District. Used resin will be sent back to
the supplier as designated in the contract. If necessary, it can be buried in the area in accordance
with the regulations on waste landfill of the Ministry of Industry. Used oil will be bumed with
the fuel.
11.     Analysis of Alternatives: Two alternatives for fuel, oil versus imported coal, were
studied. Two alternative gypsum disposal sites were considered, and two alternatives for fuel
transport. Dispersion modelling was used to determine the need for FGD, and the response to
FGD malfunction.
12.     Cultural and Aesthetic Resources: The nearest archaeological sites, (which have
been vandalized over the years) are 5.5 and 13 kIm from the power station, and would not be
impacted. Aesthetic and tourist sites are at least 20 km from the power station, routes for
7



transportation of construction materials are not access roads to tourist sites, and the plant site is
surrounded by a visual screen of mangrove forest and rubber plantations.
13.     Public Consultation: EGAT's objectives included: assessing public opinion, needs,
problems and obstacles relating to the project from the peopie and communities living in the
operational project area, as well as disseminating accurate information about the project. Local
communities were canvassed, local leaders, govemment and non-governmental groups. NGO's
contacted included local business and the Krabi Environmental Conservation Society. Three
public meetings and were held during February - April, 1996, to present project and
environmental analysis progress, and for gathering needs, opinions, and recommendations.
Environmental concerns raised at these meetings included concern over the barge fuel transport
option, and oil spill prevention and response measures; need for accurate information about the
power station boundary; worry that the use of fuel oil could have an impact on local shrimping;
and concern over the use of low grade fuel oil and sulphur emissions. EGAT responded to these
concerns, including explanation of the use of only low sulphur fuel oil, as well as the FGD
emissions control system; oil spill response and control measures, and analysis of a pipeline as
an alternative fuel oil transport method.
14.     Environmental Management and Monitoring: An environmental management
unit will be instituted at the power station, responsible for carrying out the monitoring plan,
reporting performance, environmental training, and follow up with management. The
environmental unit would report directly to the Plant Manager. The environmental monitoring
plan covers the construction period as well as ongoing operations, and includes: effluent and
surface water quality; noise; groundwater hydrology and quality; aquatic ecology; solid waste
m..anagem-ent; transportation; srocior%ntn mic indicators; public health-; nennatinnal health and
safety and public relations. The monitoring plan includes continuous air emissions and ambient
air quality monitoring during operations.

Executive Summary
Ratchaburi Power Plant Project
Environmental Impact Assessment
1.   AritaIUuetioU: ThLle Xatciuazuri rower Plant Project will be iocated in subdistrict
Tambon Ban Rai, approximately 7 km northeast of Ratchaburi Province about 5 km. north of
Mae Khlong River. The project will incorporate four 700 MW (nominal) supercritical,
conventional heavy oil fired units and three 600 MW (nominal) combined cycle blocks, for a
total site development of 4,600 MW. The thermal units will burn residual fuel oil (2% sulfur)
and/or natural gas and the combined cycle will burn natural gas as the primary fuel or
distillate oil as the back-up fuel. The area of the site is approximately 2,000 rai, and current
land use is rice cultivation and fishponds.
2.    Fuel: Sources of natural gas for Ratchaburi Power Plant are developing production
regions located in the Gulf of Martaban, Union of Myanmar. Estimates of natural gas reserves
and production are 5,700 billion cubic feet and 525 cubic feet per day respectively. Natural
gas pipelines will be extended from production wells across peninsular Myanmar and enter
Thailand at the border (Kanchanaburi Province), then continue to the Ratchaburi Power Plant.
3.    Delivery of the residual (No. 6) fuel oil will be via a seaberth, fuel oil terminal and a
dedicated pipeline. The EIA for this pipeline to the power station has been finished. If
alternative fuel delivery schemes are contemplated for the project, an additional EIA would
be required, and would have to pass review by OEPP and the World Bank.
4.    Water Supply: The raw water supply (75.03 M.m3/year) will be provided from Mae
Khlong River at Ban Bang Li via pipeline to an onsite-raw water reservoir. The water will be
pretreated and will serve for all plant needs, including cooling water makeup (69.60 M.
M3/year), potable water, general service water and demineralized water. The project will not
cause any change in the hydrology of the river basin.
5.    Condenser Cooling:- Wastewater from the closed cycle condenser cooling system at
a maximum summertime temperature about 36 °C will be discharged into a holding pond
before being relayed to a wastewater retention pond.
6.    Baseline Ambient Air Quality:  An eight month sampling program  before
construction found maximum background concentrations of S02 and NOx were less than 7
perqent of the 1 hour and 24 hour national standards. TSP concentrations were higher,
especially in the dry season, at about half the national standard.
7.    Water Quality: Water quality in the Mae Khlong River is high in total and fecal
coliform counts. This may be due to the Ratchaburi Municipality and Lak Muang Sanitary
District wastewater discharges. Khlong Bang Pa irrigation drainage canal water quality is
poor (BOD5 4 - 23 mg/l) in the dry season, when the sluice is shut and the water stagnates.
Khlong Bang Pa receives effluent from poultry and prawn farms.
8.    Air Pollution Control for Thermal Units:    Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions
from the thermnal unit will be controlled by a wet limestone FGD system, of 90% efficiency.
The limestone source for the FGD is at Khao Ta Krao, Tambon Hin Kong, Amphoe Muang
17



Ratchaburi Province. Limestone (1,056 tons/day) would be crushed at the power plant site;
the EIA for the limestone quarry is currently under OEPP review.
9.    Air Pollution Control for Combined Cycle: To control NOx, low NOx burners
would be used. Each stack would be equipped with continuous on-line emissions monitoring
systems.
10.   Wastewater: The wastewater sources to be recycled through an irrigation pond
include: sewage treatIment plant acivate sl-uuge and extended aeration); and plant drainage
through the oil/water separator. Water from the irrigation pond will be reused for gardening
and green area maintenance inside the plant boundary. Storm drainage from the power plant
area will be collected in a 100,000 cubic meter retention pond and pumped back to the
reservoir for reuse.
11.   Chemical wastewater and cooling tower blowdown would be discharged to the
Khlong Bang Pa irrigation drainage canal, via an onsite holding pond. Air heater washwater
will be routed to a lined pond for detention and treatment (pH adjustment, metals and
suspended solids reduction). Demineralization plant effluent would be neutralized. The
effluent would have higher total dissolved solids (TDS) than the irrigation system drain'
however, the effluent would meet the Royal Irrigation Department standard. The quality of
the water discharged into Khlong Bang Pa would be better with respect to all other
parameters than the water currently in Khlong Bang Pa, furthermore, the discharge would
increase flow in the Khlong Bang Pa, which is stagnant during the dry season.
12.   Solid Waste Disposal: The wastewater from the treatment system for circulating
water makeup consists of an alkaline slurry which will be dewatered using a thickener and
then a filter press. The sludge will be landfilled, and an impermeable liner of clay or synthetic
material will be used to contain leachate. A groundwater monitoring program similar to the
one for the plant site will be used for the gypsum landfill. The landfill area will be
approximately 600 rai (625 rai = I kmn2) and will also be used to colleck discharge from the
FGD system, sludge from sewage treatment plant and solids from the air heater wastewater
treatment system. Gypsum by product from the FOD system is approximately 2,000 tons per
day or 350,000 m3 per year will be dumped in the landfill area of 600 rai at approximate heap
height of 10 meter. The estimated volume about 9.6 million m3 will serve for the 25 year
power plant life. Alternative uses of gypsum are being evaluated.
13. . Hazardous Chemical Containment and Storage:  All chemical storage tanks,
solution tanks, and chemical feed pumps will be located on curbed concrete containment
areas drained through separate chemical waste collection piping to a neutralization basin or a
chemical waste collection sump. A curbed concrete area will be provided with a chemical-
resistant coating suitable for the particular service. As a minimum, the combined volume of
the curbed area and the associated neutralization basin or waste sump will be adequate to
contain the entire volume of the largest single tank served. A spill prevention, control and
response plan will be added to the site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response
drill routine.
14.   Chlorine: The chlorination station for the condenser cooling water will be equipped
with a leak detection and alarm system, wind sock, leak stemming gear and personnel
protective equipment, including self contained breathing apparatus. A chlorine leakage
18



response scenario will be added to the plant Emergency Plan, and leak response drills
undertaken as part of the emergency response drill routine.
15.   Fuel Oil Storage: Fuel oil will be stored in four tanks of 32 million liters capacity
each: a supply that would last fnr seven days of genera:ion. The combined cycie units will
have three 17 million liter diesel oil tanks, a supply that would also last for seven days of
generation. The area surrounding the fuel oil storage tanks will be designed to contain oil
spills resulting from equipment failure or leaks occurring during norrnal operations. The oil
containment will be berms constructed of compacted earth with liner or retaining walls built
of reinforced concrete. Design and performance must conform with the concerned Ministry
Announcement and Act concerning oil storage B.E. 2474. (Modify no. 1-5 B.C. 2474-2530).
Fuel oil piping will be routed above grade on pipe racks in order to facilitate detection and
repair of leaks. If for any reason the pipe must be located underground, it will be placed in a
concrete trench which will be drained to the oil/water separator. The facility Emergency Plan
covers fire and explosion. A spill prevention, control and response plan will be added to the
site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response drill routine.
16.   Analysis of Alternatives: Analyses of alternatives with respect to environmental
aspects included site selection, fuel delivery systems (separate EIA for pipelines, sea berth,
undersea pipeline), FGD technology and wastewater discharge point. Two altematives, Mae
Khlong River or Khlong Bang Pa irrigation drainage canal, were considered for discharge
from the onsite wastewater holding pond (cooling tower blowdown and pH adjusted
demineralization plant effluent). The preferred alternative is to discharge to the irrigation
drainage ditch.
17.     Environmental Management and Monitoring: An environmental management
unit will be instituted at the power station, responsible for carrying out the monitoring plan,
reporting performance, and follow up with management. The environmental unit would report
directly to the plant manager. The environmental monitoring plan covers the construction period
as well as ongoing operations, and includes: effluent and surface water quaity; noise;
groundwater hydrology and quality; aquatic ecology; solid waste management; transportation;
socio-economic indicators; public health; and occupational health and safety. The monitoring
plan includes continuous air emissions and ambient air quality monitoring during operations.
18.     Public Consultation: Public consultation activities were undertaken from December,
1995, until November, 1997. Meetings included heads of local and provincial administratives,
Pikulthong Subdistrict Women's Group, Ban Choa Rai Nua Subdistrict women's Group, Sam
Rtien Subdistrict Women's Group, and a Ratchaburi teacher's meeting.

WANG NOI COMBINED CYCLE POWER STATION
Environmental Impact Assessment
Executive Summary
i.    Background: The 1,800 MW Wang Noi combined cycie base ioad power station is
fully constructed and operational on an area of 718 rai in Tambon Khao Ngam arid Wang
Chula, Amphoe Wang Noi, Ayudhaya Province. The generating system includes 3 blocks of
600 MW generators. Each block is composed of 2 sets of 200- MW gas turbines and a 200-
MW steam turbine. The EIA study report was approved by the National Environment Board
in the meeting no. 5/2537 on June 8, 1994. The commercial operation of the power plant
started in May 1998.
Fuel: Natural gas will be supplied from the Gulf of Thailand and inland sources
through a Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) pipeline; there are no storage facilities on
the plant site for natural gas. Distillate No. 2 oil (0.05 - 1.0% S, average 0.53% S) is used
only as backup. The oil is delivered to the site by tank truck. the EIA for the pipeline has
been done by PTT and approved by NEB.
Water Supply: Makeup water for the power station is drawn from Khlong Raphiphat
and a well. The power station demand would be only 6 % of the minimum (July 1992)
recorded monthly flow of Khlong Raphiphat. A groundwater well on site serves only as
backup and potable water supply.
Condenser Cooling: A closed cycle condenser cooling water system is used.
Air Pollution Control: Oxides of nitrogen are controlled in the combustion turbines
by water injection in the first two blocks. the third block will use the dry, low Nox burner
system. The stacks are equipped with on-line NOx monitors.
Ambient Air Quality: Ambient air quality measurements have been taken every six
months during commissioning of the first two blocks. Two sets of data are available: dry
season, January - February, and wet season, May. Sulfur dioxide averaged over 24 hours
ranged (0 - 6 ug/m3); that is, from undetectable to 2% of the national standard. The
maximum NO2 measured at any receptor was 26 ug/m3, less than a tenth of the national
standard, and a fifth of the World Bank standard. Tanking into account the planned expansion
to 1,800 MW, the actual air quality monitoring results to date indicate the dispersion
modelling was conservative.
Dispersion Modelling Estimates, 1,800 MW: One year of meteorological data was
used in the dispersion modelling. In case of diesel-fired (6 x 200 MW) combustion turbines,
1-hour maximum GLC of NO2 is 84.4 ug/m3 (worst case), below the national standard of 320
ug/m3.. For S02, the 24-hour maximum GLC is 10.5 ug/m3 (worst case); well below the
national standard of 300 ug/m3, and the World Bank (NOx) guideline of 150 ug/m3. The
annual average for SO2 is estimated at 7.6 ug/m3, well below the national standard of 100
ug/m3, and the World Bank guideline of 80 ug/m3.
For the case of natural gas fueled (3 x 600 MW), 1-hour maximum GLC of NO2 is
estimated to be 154.9 ug/m3 which is also below the national standard of 320 ug/m3.

Wastewater: Sanitary wastewater and neutralized demineralization plant eftluent are
routed through a 4.000 m3 holding pond, which overflows to the retention pond (75,000 m3)
onsite. Sanitary wastewater treatment consists of aeration. clarification and chlorination
(calcium hvpochlorite). The closed cycle cooling tower blowdown is discharged to the
wastewater retention pond, along with effluent from the oil/water separator. An automatic
water quality sampling station is located at the outlet of the retention pond to Khlong 26.
Water Quality: Plant effluent is pumped from ;i retention pond to Khlong 26, "'hin
also receives irrigation system drainage, domestic and agricultural wastes. Water quality
monitoring at the raw water source, holding pond discharge and Khlong 26 has been
undertaken every six months during project development. In 1997 the results of effluent
water quality sampling during operation of the plant were within the effluent quality standard
for irrigation canals of the Royal Irrigation Department.
Solid Waste Disposal: Domestic solid waste, raw water and wastewater treatment
sludge is taken off site and disposed by the Lam Ta Sao sanitary district in Amphoe Wang
Noi.
Fuel Oil Storage: Oil storage is in two 29.45 million liter tanks. The oil storage
facilities are is built to ASTM and API standards. The area surrounding the fuel oil storage
tanks is designed to contain oil spills resulting from equipment failure or leaks occurring
during normal operations. The oil containment is berns constructed of retaining walls built of
reinforced concrete. Fuel Oil piping is routed above grade on pipe racks in order to facilitate
detection and repair of leaks. If for any reason the pipe must be located underground, it is
placed in a concrete trench which is drained to the oillwater separator. The facility
Emergency Plan covers fire and explosion. A spill prevention, control and response plan will
be added to the site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response drill routine.
Hazardous Chemical Containment and Storage: All chemical storage tanks,
solution tanks, and chemical feed pumps are located on curbed concrete containment areas
drained through separate chemical waste collection piping to a neutralization basin or a
chemical waste collection sump. A curbed concrete area is provided with a chemical-resistant
coating suitable for the particular service. As a minimum, the combined volume of the curbed
area and the associated neutralization basin or waste sump is adequate to contain the entire
volume of the largest single tank served. A spill prevention, control and response plan will be
added to the site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response drill routine.
Chlorine: The chlorination station for the condenser cooling water is equipped with a
leak detection and alarm system, wind sock, leak stemming gear and personnel protective
equipment, including self contained breathing apparatus. A chlorine leakage response
scenario will be added to the plant Emergency Plan, and leak response drills undertaken as
part of the emergnecy response drill routine.
Analysis of Alternatives: Alternatives analylzed for the project included choice of
technology, site selection, water sources, wastewater treatment schemes and choice of
receiving waters.
Environmental Management and Monitoring: An environmental management
unit will be instituted at the power station, responsible for carrying out the monitoring plan,
28



reporting performance. and follow up with management. The environmental unit would report
directly to the plant manager. The environmental monitoring plan covers the construction period
as well as ongoing operations, and includes: effluent and surface water quality; noise:
groundwater hydrology and quality; aquatic ecology; solid waste management; transportation;
soci-ecnnorwmir indicators; public health; and occupational health arid safety. The monitoring
plan includes continuous air emissions and ambient air quality monitoring during operations.

Executive Summary
500 KV Transmission System for Independent Power Producers
and
Grate#r B3ng   Are,a"
Environmental Guidelines for Planning, Construction and
Maintenance of Transmission Lines
Introduction
1.    The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is a state enterprise under
direct supervision of the Office of the Prime Minister. EGAT was established on May 1,
1969 to nationalize and consolidate the functions and responsibilities of three independent
state enterprises: the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA), the Lignite Authority (LA) and the
North-East Electricity Authority (NEEA). EGAT is now in the process of privatization.
EGAT has the responsibility to provide electricity for the entire Kingdom of Thailand by
generating, transmitting and selling bulk energy to two distributing entities, namely the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).
2.    The current EGAT long term Power Development Plan (PDP 95-01) includes about
13,100 MW total power purchase from IPPs up to the year 2011, representing 30% of the
total installed capacity at that time. To facilitate private sector investment in IPP projects,
EGAT will construct two 500 KV transmission lines along the Gulf of Thailand from Bang
SaRhan (Prachuap Khiri Khan Province) to Chom Bung on the western coast and from
Ravong to Nonz Chok and Wang Noi on the eastem coast. These 500 KV lines will receive
the power from IPP power plants and transmit most of the generated power to the load centers
in Greater Bangkok and the surrounding area. In addition, a 500 KV transmission system for
the Greater Bangkok Area will be developed, replacing the existing 230 KV system.
Proiect DescriDtion
3.    Western Area, 500 KV Transmission Lines: The transmission system  for the
disbursement of power from IPPs in the Western Area includes construction of two
transmission lines: (i) 275 km long VSt route of 500 KV double circuit line from Bang Saphan
to Chom Bung; (ii) 280 km long 2 nd route of 500 KV double circuit line from Bang Saphan
substation to Chom Bung.
4.    Western Area, Substations: The substation projects for the Western Area include
expansion of the following 3 existing substations: (i) Expansion of Bang Saphan 500 KV
substation with installation of 500/230 KV of 1000 MVA transformer, line shunt reactors and
addition of a communication system; (ii) Expansion of Chom Bung 500 KV substation with
installation of line shunt reactors and addition of a communication system; and (iii) expansion
of Sai Noi 500 KV substation and addition of a communication system.
37



5.    Eastern Area. 500 KV Transmission Lines: The transmission lines for the Eastem
Area include two transmission lines: (i) 155 km long I" route of 500 KV double circuit line
from Rayong 4 to T Junction; and, (ii) 170 km long 2 nd route of 500 KV double circuit line
from Rayong 4 substation to T Junction.
6.    Eastern Area, Substations:  The substations for the Eastern Area include the
construction of one new and expansion of one existing substation: (i) new 500/230 KV
Rayong 4 substation with installation of line shunt reactors at 500 KV Rayong 4-Nong Chok
end Payong A -Wong Noi iines, anci addition ot a communication system; and, (ii) expansion
of the 230 KV Rayong 2 substation with addition of a communication system.
7.    Greater Bangkok Area: The project would replace four existing sections of 230 KV
transmission line with 500 KV transmission lines: Bangkok Noi - Sai Noi (29.4 km); Sai Noi
- Rangsit (24.7 km); Rangsit - Chaeng Watthana (7.4 km); and, Nong Chok - On Nuch,
(17.9 km).
Lega1 and Administrative
8.    Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not required under current Thailand law
and regulation for the 500 KV Transmission System for IPPs Project. The EIA for the
transmission system will be expected only when all or a portion of the transmission line
routes are located in Watershed classification class lB or forest conservation area class
C, Wildlife sanctuary area, National Park area, or Mangrove area. The project route does
not traverse any of these. The report is a focused environmental analysis of environmental
impacts of project components and their mitigation measures as required by the World Bank.
9.    EGAT would have to submit a report to the RFD for permission to use some part of
the National Forest Reserves as right of way for the transmission lines.
Analysis of Alternatives
10.   Westem Area: It was determined that the transmission line route should not parallel
the railway line and main road (highway 4) because both sides of these corridors are densely
populated, in addition, the transmission line should not pass over railway lines, according to
EGAT design criteria. The selected transmnission line route would pass through the National
Forest Reserves only in low areas at the edges where the land use is now mostly agricultural.
The bottom lands of the National Forest Reserves have been heavily encroached and
converted to agricultural uses. There is no alternate route in the western area of the southern
peninsula because it is narrow and near the border of Myanmar.
11.   Eastern Area: The final route selection was based on the following: (i) there are very
dense residential areas along both side of the main road, including a network of secondary
roads; (ii) EGAT environmental criteria call for avoidance of residential areas as much as
possible; only line two of the transmission system passes through (two) National Forest
Reserves. These sections of the National Forest Reserves have been encroached and are
currently agricultural areas and forest plantations.
12.   Greater Bangkok Area: The new 500 KV transmission line would be constructed as
far as possible along the existing 230 KV transmission line ROW. The alternative would be
38



to acquire new ROW's through the populated Greater Bangkok Area, which would entail far
greater environmental and social impact.
Route Selection Cri:eria an'd Mitgation Strategies
13.   In selection of routes for transmission lines and substation sites, EGAT uses design
criteria to minimize environmental impacts on forest, wildlife, watershed areas, populations,
archeological sites and scenery. Transmission line right of ways are not to be located
through: (a) restricted Class IA watershed area and Class C forest conservation areas,
according to laws and regulations; and, (b) holy places, archeological sites and government
sites. Transmission line right of ways should also avoid: (a) watershed area class IB,
mangrove forest, national parks and other conservation areas; (b) community and
developed areas; (c) parallel with, or close to telephone and telegraph cables for a long
distance; and, (d) airports.
14.   Detailed Route Surveys: Before construction of the transmission system, detailed
route surveys will be performed by EGAT staff together with the Royal Forest Department
(RFD). The number of forest trees to be cut will be documented. In addition, final route
selection adjustments to avoid dwellings and circumvent other areas of potential negative
impact will be made, according to EGAT's environmental design criteria.
15.   Construction: EGAT's guidelines for construction activities are:   (a) avoid
installation of new access roads for construction purposes; try to utilize existing trails;
(b) no cutting of trees over the limitations set by RFD: and. (c) clean up constructinn sites
upon completion of construction work.
16.   Maintenance of the Right of Way: Along the valleys, only trees considered to be
hazardous to the stability of the transmission system would be cut down. Landowners are
permitted  to cultivate economic  crops at EGAT's option  along  the right of way
corridors. Upon completion of transmission line construction work, ground cover around
the towers will be planted and land contouring will be done as required to provide a
protective covering for the earth and to preventsoil erosion.
Environmental Issues:
17.   Environmental Impact on Water Resources: Potential impacts of a transmission
system on water quality are related to construction activities: surface run-off from
construction sites; wastewater from the temporary office and construction camps; and,
wastewater contaminated with oil or grease from machinery. The study of the 500 KV
Eastern and Westem systems revealed that the banks of the Pranburi River at the end of
Pranburi Dam where both of the Westem transmission lines cross are steep. The soil is sandy
and liable to erosion. Any transmission tower located here should be located at least 50
meters from the riverbank. The Eastem Area transmission system crosses over the Bang
Prakong River; but would have little impact from soil erosion since the river is so large, the
river banks are not very steep, and the water is already rather high in turbidity. In the Greater
Bangkok area, the existing ROW would be used, and minimal soil disturbance and clearing
would be necessary.
39



18.   Forest resources: The field study revealed that the national forest reserves in the
proposed Western transmission line area are degraded due to encroachment and conversion of
the land for agricultural purposes. However, forest areas can still be found in the mountainous
areas. These areas are not traversed by the proposed transmission system right of way. The
transmission line right of ways have been laid out through topographically level areas and
within the forest reserve areas that have been converted to agriculture through encroachment.
Only the Western right of way area represents the potential to impact on forest resources.
The area in question is a stunted dry dipterocarp forest. In the area of the right of way for the
two lines the national forest reserve is deteriora:cd forest, wiih smali and stunted trees. The
Eastern ROW areas do not traverse forest cover. Impacts on eucalyptus and casaurina
plantations are minor because the right of ways use a narrow stretch of private land, and this
can be reforested or compensation paid to the owner(s). There are no forest resources
involved in the Greater Bangkok Area component of the project.
19.   Wildlife: The field study did not find any species in the ROW  areas that are
significant for conservation. Significant species are usually found in unspoiled natural
habitats; and these are strictly protected. The reserve forest where the 500 KV transmission
system traverses has already been cleared for agriculture and other purposes. The species
found in the ROW's are mostly small in size and they can adjust well to various human
activities. There is little wild flora or fauna in the existing ROW in the Greater Bangkok
Area.
20.   Land Use: The project will cause the lost and limitation of agricultural land use in the
ROW; however, the impact is on a small total land area because most of the crops have a short
growing season and they do not exceed the hieght restrictions for vegetation in the ROW.
These crops include rice, pineapple and cassava. In addition, after the project construction is
done, the crops can be grown as usual, with the exception of tall perennials and trees. In the
Greater Bangkok Area the 230 KV lines already exist in the ROW's, and the area has been
developed into a combination of residential, industrial and agricultural land.
21.   Cultural and Esthetic Resources: There were no cultural or esthetic resources that
would potentially be impacted along the Western Route (Bang Saphan-Chom Bung). The
Eastern transmission line one would traverse Tharanukroh Cemetery, as revealed by the
preliminary route survey. In Greater Bangkok there are 17 temples and mosques located
within 1 km either side of the existing 230 KV ROW. The existing 2330 KV line cannot be
clearly observed within the visual context of these cultural landmarks. There are two temples
located adjacent to the existing 230 KV ROW's; however, there would only be a slight
change in the visual impact of the 500 KV line in the same ROW. There are no known
archaeological sites along the existing ROW in the Greater Bangkok Area.
PCB Mana2ement
22.   The proposed 500 KV transmission system (Eastem and Westem lines) will not
involve replacement of equipment potentially contaminated with PCB. EGAT has surveyed
all potentially contaminated electrical equipment in the Greater Bangkok Area; the only
remaining PCB's are in the power generation facilities.
40



Mitigation Measures:
23.   Natural Resources:   Foundation towers and construction activities including
transportation of construction materials, material storage and worker housing would be
located at least 50 meters awav from surface water resources to avoid soil erosion. in case it
is necessary to use areas closer to water resources, soil barriers would be built to block
erosion and sedimentation. Vegetative cover would be replaced along streambanks and the
surrounding project site if disturbed, to prevent soil erosion. In all areas, sanitary latrines will
be constructed for workforce and temporary offices, and good housekeeping measures will
minimize potential water contamination due to oily waste or chemicals.
24.   Forest Resources:  The following mitigation measures would be followed: (i)
deforestation to be done only in the right of way; ii) reforestation is the responsibility of
EGAT, the area of reforestation would be more than the area of national forest reserve used
for the ROW; iii) in case private land is used in construction, it is the responsibility of EGAT
to contact the owner and pay fair compensation.
25.   Wildlife: The impacts can be controlled by:  i) 'deforestation only in the right
of way area; ii) prohibition on disturbing wildlife, including nests, eggs, holes, hollows and
other habitat; iii) prevention of noise pollution by limiting work hours between 8.00 am and
16.00 pm., all work to be forbidden at night.
26.   Land Use:  EGAT would plan all the project activities including material
transportation, pole mounting and others in the dry season, because most of the crops would
already have been harvested. Removal of agricultural plants (particularly perennials') onuld
be done oniy as necessary and compensation paid. Farmers would be allowed to grow short-
lived crops with heights of less than 3 meters in the ROW.
27.   Cultural and Esthetic Resources: The transmission line one of the Eastern area
(Rayong 4-Nong Chok) goes through Tharanukroh Cemetery; therefore, it would be moved
away to minimize visual impact.
Monitoring
28.   The following monitoring plan will be adopted to track the effectiveness of
mitigation techniques, and to address recognized problems in an appropriate
and timely manner. This regular scheduled monitoring program will consist
chiefly of visual inspections during construction and operation for:
o     erosion  along  access  roads,  substation  and  transmission  tower
foundations;
o     encroachment of settlements within rights of ways, encroachment of
settlements within protected areas via transmission line access roads,
exploitation of forest resources in protected areas via access roads;
41



o    vegetation clearances below transmission lines, and invasion of exotic
species along right of ways;
o    transformer fluid leakage and spills.

Executive Summary
TNB Stage IT Inter Co.nection and
Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9
Environmental Guidelines for Planning, Construction and
Maintenance of Transmission Lines
Introduction
1.    The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is a state enterprise under
direct supervision of the Office of the Prime Minister.- EGAT was established on May 1,
1969 to nationalize and consolidate the functions and responsibilities of three independent
state enterprises: the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA), the Lignite Authority (LA) and the
North-East Electricity Authority (NEEA). EGAT is now in the process of privatization.
EGAT has the responsibility to provide electricity for the entire Kingdom of Thailand by
generating, transmitting and selling bulk energy to two distributing entities, namely the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and ~he Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).
2.    The current EGAT long term Power Development Plan (PDP 95-01) includes about
13,100 MW total power purchase from IPPs up to the year 2011, representing 30% of the
total installed capacity at that time. To facilitate private sector investment in IPP projects,
EGAT will construct Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9 and TNB Stage U Inter
Connection .
Proiect Description
43



3.    Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9 is also prepared in response to the
Government's policy to continue the development of infrastructure to sustain the economic
growth of the country. TS 9 is a package of 26 subprojects of transmission lines and substations
expansion and reinforcement. The project involves the construction and reinforcement of
transmission lines totalling 1,890.0 circuit-kilometers, and 10 substations. The total amount of
5,900 MVA transformer capacity and 1,202.4 MVA reactive power compensation equipment
installed at the existing substations are also included.
4.    TNB stageII Interconnection consisits of two parts: the construction of HVDC
transmission, and intemal system reinforcement.
Legal and Administrative
5.    Environmental ImRact Assessment (EIA) is not required under current Thailand law
and regulation for the Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9 and TNB StageII Inter
Connection . The EIA for the transmission system will be expected only when all or a
portion of the transmission line routes are located in Watershed classification class lB (or
wildlife sanctuary area, or national park area, or mangrove area). The project routes do not
traverse any of these. This report is a focused environmental analysis of environmental
impacts of project components and their mitigation measures as required by the World Bank.
Analysis of Alternatives
6.    Power system studies were reviewd based on the latest EGAT and TNB Power
Development Plans (PDP) to firmn up the 300 MW EGAT - TNB Stage It Interconnection .The
studies have been carried out for three options: (1) Without EGAT - TNB Stage II
Interconnection , (2) With EGAT - TNB HVAC Interconnection , and (3) With EGAT - TNB
Stage II Interconnection . The EGAT PDP , revised PDP 92-01 , and 1991 load forecast
together with the updated version of TNB' s PDP and load were adopted for the study .

Route Selection Criteria and Mitigation Strate2ies
7.    In selection of routes for transmission lines and substation sites, EGAT uses design
criteria to minimize environmental impacts on forest, wildlife, watershed areas, populations,
archaeological sites and scenery. Transmission line right of ways are not to be located
through: (a) restricted Class IA watershed area, according to laws and regulations; and, (b)
holy  places, archeological sites and government sites. Transmission line right of ways
should also avoid: (a) watershed area class IB, Addiional forest conservation areas (Class
C),mangrove forest, national parks and other conservation areas; (b) community and
developed areas; (c) parallel with, or close to telephone and telegraph cables for a long
distance to avoid interferance; and, (d) airports.
8.    Detailed Route Surveys: Before construction of the transmission system, detailed
route surveys will be performed by EGAT staff together with the Royal Forest Department
(RFD). The number of forest trees to be cut will be documented. In addition, final route
selection adjustments to avoid dwellings and circumvent other areas of potential negative
impact will be made, according to EGAT's environmental desian criteria.
9.    Construction: EGAT's guidelines for construction activities are:   (a) avoid
installation of new access roads for construction purposes; try to utilize existing trails;
(b) no cutting of trees over the limitations set by RElD; and, (c) clean up construction sites
upon completion of construction work.
10.   Maintenance of the Right of Way: Along the valleys, only trees considered to be
hazardous to the stability of the transmission system would be cut down. Landowners are
permitted to cultivate economic crops under EGAT's criteria along the right of way
corridors. Upon completion of transmission line construction work, ground cover around
the towers will be planted and land contouring will be done as required to provide a
protective covering for the earth and to prevent soil erosion. No herbicides are used in
right of way maintenance.
45



Environmental Issues:
11.   Environmental Impact on Water Resources: Potential impacts of a transmission
system on water quality are related to construction activities: surface run-off from
construction sites; wastewater from the temporary office and construction camps; and,
wastewater contaminated with oil or grease from machinem' y-hich will bc mitigatcd . Th
construction sites, temporary office and construction camp will locate more than 100 meters
far from water resource or stream and all of slope area is less than 45 degree. The
construction will follow the EGAT'S Environmental Guidelines for Transmission System.
12.   Forest resources: There are 25 sub projects, with a length of approximately 159.55
kilometers, that pass through the reserve forest (non protected forest). There are no watershed
area class IA and 1B, wildlife sanctuary, national park ,mangrove forest area or addition
forest conservation area (C) near any transmission line of subproject on Transmission System
Expansion Project No. 9. TNB Stage II Inter Connection Project comprises 3 tranmission
lines ,a distance of approximately 213.5 kilometers, that pass through the reserve forest.
Many of these 'forest areas' have already been cleared for agriculture are other purposes
The attached route maps show the actual conditions found in walk-throughs . There is no
watershed area class IA and lB, wildlife sanctuary, national park ,mangrove forest area or
addition forest conservation area (C) near any transmission line of subprojects.
13.   Wildlife: There are 159.55 kilometers of Transmission System Expansion Project
No. 9 and 213.5 kilometers of TNB Stage II Inter Connection Project that pass through the
reserve forest that are not significant for conservation. Many of the reserve forest areas where
-the transmission lines traverse have already been cleared for agriculture and other purposes
(see maps). The wildlife are mostly small in size and they can adjust well to minor change in
the environment.
14.   Land Use: The project construction phase will cause the loss and limitation of
agricultural land use in the ROW; however, the impact is on a small total land area because
most of the crops have a short growing season and they do not exceed the height restrictions for
vegetation in the right of way. Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9 and TNB Stage
II Inter Connection Project have tranmission lines which pass through the agricultural land
46



totalling about 1,121.45 and 360.3 km . The Maintenance of the right of way will follow the
EGAT policy on post-project land use.
15.   Cultural and Esthetic Resources: There were no cultural or esthetic resources that
would potentially be impacted along the Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9 and
TNB Stage II Inter Connection Project.
16.   PCB Management: Transmission System Expansion Project No. 9 and TNB Stage I
Inter Connection Project will not involve replacement of equipment potentially contaminated
with PCB. EGAT has surveyed all potentially contaminated electrical equipment.
17.   Electromagnetic Freguencv (EMF): A full discussion of EMF effects and EGAT
transmission lines is included in the Environmental Impact Analyses of the Greater Bangkok
Area, and the Environmental Report for 500 KV Transmission Line for IPP's.
Mitigation Measures:
18.   Natural Resources:  Foundation towers and construction activities including
transportation of construction materials, material storage and worker housing would be
located at least 50 meters away from surface water resources to avoid soil erosion. In case it
is necessary to use areas closer to water resources, soil barriers would be built to block
erosion and sedimentation. Vegetative cover would be replaced along streambanks and the
surrounding project site if disturbed, to prevent soil erosion. In all areas, sanitary latrines will
be constructed for workforce and temporary offices, and good housekeeping measures will
miinimize potential water contamination due to construction.
19.   Forest Resources:  The following mitigation measures would be followed: (i)
deforestation to be done only in the right of way ii) reforestation is the responsibility of
EGAT, the area of reforestation would be more than the area of national forest reserve used
for the ROW; iii) in case private land is used in construction, it is the responsibility of EGAT
to contact the owner and pay fair compensation. Many of the 'forest areas' along the routes
have already been cleared for agriculture and other purposes (see map section).
47



20.   Wildlife: The impacts can be controlled by:  i) deforestation only in the right
of way area; ii) prohibition on disturbing wildlife, including nests, eggs, holes, hollows and
other habitat; iii) prevention of noise pollution by limiting work hours between 8.00 am and
16.00 pm., all work to be forbidden at night.
21.  .'Lau Use:   EGAT would plan all the project activities including material
transportation, pole mounting and others in the dry season, because most of the crops would
already have been harvested. Removal of agricultural plants (particularly perennials) would
be done only as necessary and compensation paid. Farmers would be allowed to grow short-
lived crops with heights in the ROW under EGAT's Criteria after construction .
Monitoring
22.   The following monitoring plan will be adopted to track the effectiveness of mitigation
techniques, and to address recognized problems in an appropriate and timely manner. This
regular scheduled monitoring program will consist chiefly of visual inspections during
construction and operation for:
o     erosion along access roads, substation and transmission tower foundations;
o     encroachment of settlements within rights of ways, encroachment of settlements
within protected areas via transmission line access roads, exploitation of forest
resources in protected areas via access roads;
o     vegetation clearances below transmission lines, and invasion of exotic species along
right of ways;
o     transformer fluid leakage and spills.
