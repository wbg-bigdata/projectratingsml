REPUBL1C OF TURKEY
ISTANBUL WATER SUPP'LY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Loan and Project Sum nm
Borrower:           Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage General Directorate
(ISKI).
Guarantor:          Republic of Turkey.
Loan Amount:        US$218 million equivalent.
Terms:              Seventeen years, including 4 years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project             The Project consists of high priority components in
Description:        ISKI's 1987-94 investment pregram.  The objectives of the
Project are: (a) to improve and extend sewerage service to
70 of the population of Istanbul by the end of 1994;
(b) to provide for appropriate disposal of sewage to
protect the waters and shorelines of the Sea of Marmara and
the Bosphorus; (c) to reduce unaccounted-for water; (d) to
strengthen ISKI's operation and maintenance and industrial
waste management capabilities. The Project includes
rehabilitation of parts of the water distribution system;
installation of a system for water supply monitoring and
control; and construction of sewage collection and sewage
treatment facilities. A technical assistance component of
the Project would provide advice and training to strengthen
ISKI institutionally.
Benefits            The proposed loan will finance 90% of the estimated
and Risks:          foreign exchange cost of the Project.  Project components
not to be financed by the loan include land acquisition,
local staff engineering, sewer networks and sewer
connections. The beneficiaries of the Project would be:
(a) 2.3 million people who would receive sewerage service;
(b) 1.0 million people already connected to the water
distribution system who would receive improved service; and
(c) residents and visitors who now encounter polluted
waters and shorelines along the Sea of Marmara and the
Bosphorus. The Project's financial risk that ISKI would
not adjust its tariffs to compensate for inflation is small
since ISKI has shown willingness to raise tariffs when
needed in the past. The Project's environmental risk is
associated with the Black Sea disposal method planned for
approximately half of Istanbul's sewage. The method uses
the bottom current of the Bosphorus to transport partly
treated sewage to the Black Sea, where it will be dispersed
and treated naturally. Although the method is untried, it
is theoretically sound and the risk is considered to be
insignificant. If the method should not prove to be fully
satisfactory, ISKI would be expected to take corrective
measures.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ISTANBUL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
L iNTRODUCTION
1.01     The proposed project is for the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality,
which has a population of 5.7 million growing 4.3S per year. Istanbul is
Turkey's principal commercial and cultural center and its most active port.
It is also the gateway to Turkey and the center of Turkey's growing tourist
industry.
1.02     The Project includes rehabilitation of water distribution facilities,
and construction of new sewerage facilities needed to keep pace with
Istanbul's rapid growth and to provide for the safe and environmentally sound
disposal of its wastewater. The sewerage components of the Project would con-
tinue the pollution abatement program initiated under the first Istanbul
Sewerage Project (Loan 2159-TU). The water components would eliminate water
shortages now affecting 18X of the population. Approximately 2.3 million pre-
sent and future residents of Istanbul are expected to benefit directly from
the Project. In addition, the population at large should benefit from an
improved quality of life resulting from a cleaner environment.
1.03     Preparation of the Project began during 1985 and expanded during 1986
with engineering financed in part by Loan 2159-TU. The field appraisal began
with a mission in March 1987 which was interrupted by work on another project;
it was completed during a missl-4i in May 1987.
IL SECTORAL CONTEXT
Country Bd
2.01     The population of Turkey at the end of 1986 was 52 million, with 53
percent living in urban areas. The population growth rate averaged 2.5 per-
cent per annum during 1981-1985 (4 percent for urban and 0.9 percent for rural
areas). The rate is expected to decrease gradually, and the population by the
year 2000 to reach about 66 million. Turkey is a middle income country with
per capita GNP of approximately US$1,200. Following economic difficulties in
the late 1970s, measures were introduced to liberalize the economy. The
economy recovered, GDP growth averaged 5 percent per annum in the 1980-85
period, exports grew at an annual rate of 23 percent, and inflation has been
reduced. Despite these favorable trends, inflationary pressures persist, and,
while exports declined by about 8 percent in 1986, largely due to reduced
market demand in the Middle East, export performance in 1987 has been
satisfactory. Also, the debt burden remains high. Nevertheless, with careful
economic management, GDP is expected to continue to grow at about 5 percent
per annum through 1990.
Water SUPPlY Service Levels
2.02     Nationwide water and sewerage figures for urban areas in 1983 are
summarized in Table 2.1. Although approximately 80 percent of urban



households had piped water connections, a substantial proportion of them did
not have reliable service because of inadequacies in water production, treat-
ment and distribution systems. Water losses were estimated at 36 percent.
Daily per capita consumption for connected urban households was 85 liters for
domestic users, or 122 liters including commercial and industrial
consumption. Although adequate to meet minimum health requirements, these
consumption levels are substantially below those in richer industrialized
countries-' and are below potential demand, which is suppressed by system
inadequacies. In the Istanbul metropolitan area, 93 percent of the population
had house and apartment connections, but only two thirds of those served had
adequate supply. The most serious problem was, and still is, that inadequate
and aging distribution systems lead to low pressure and intermittent supply in
elevated and fringe areas.

Sewerage Service Levels
2.03    Ac-ording to the 1984 Buildings Census, 56 percent of urban dwellings
have a sewer pipe. This figure may, however, be misleading since many sewer
pipes connected to buildings discharge into a nearby creek or open drain.
None of the sewerage systems include treatment, and only a few have adequate
disposal facilities, Precarious sanitary conditions prevail, parti ]Jarly in
high density, low income urban areas.  The insufficiency of sewerage and the
indiscriminate disposal of domestic and industrial wastes have caused deteri-
oration of rivers and coastal waters, and have increased the danger of contam-
inating drinking water supplies. According to ISKI's figures, only about 54
percent of Istanbul's population is connected to the public sewerage system,
much of which is archaic and leaking. Discharge of sewage into the Golden
Horn will soon Le controlled as a result of the first Istanbul Sewerage
Project (L n 2159-TU), but untreated sewage is still discharged into the
Bosphorus d.id Sea of Marmara, causing severe pollution in some areas.
Future Demand for Water and Sewerage
2.04    It is estimated that 6 million of the present urban population of
approximat%ly 28 million do not have piped water, and 12 million do not have
adequate sewerage. Substantial investment will be necessary to make up for
these deficiencieg.  Furthermore, with the continuing urban growth accompany-
ing Turkey's rapid economic development and industrialization, there will be
even greater demand for water and sewerage infrastruzture. The urban popula-
tion is expected to increase from 28 million in 1986 to about 45 million by
the year 2000.
2.05    Water supply and sewerage objectives formulated by the Government in
1978 were: (i) by 1990, the total urban and rural population should have ade-
quate water supplies; (ii) by 1990, the total rural population should have
satisfactory exereta disposal facilities; and (iii) by 2000, the total urban
population should have satisfactory sewerage and sewage disposal facilities.
It is now expected that more time will be needed to achieve these goals, and
that by the year 2000, perhaps 90 percent of the population will have adequate
water and 75 percent of the urban population will have sewerage.  This will
require provision of water for an additional 26 million people-i-', and sewer-
age for 19 million people.  Water production for urban areas would have to
increase to 3.5 billion m3/year!/ (compared to 1.4 billion m3/year in
1983), with corresponding increases in treatment and distribution facilities,
in sewerage networks, and in sewage treatment and disposal facilities.
T-  18 million urban and 8 million rural inhabitants; about 63 perce.at of
rural households have access to a piped water system.
t'  Assuming that unaccounted-for water will be reduced from 36 percent to 20
percent; that the serviced urban population will be 40.5 million; and
that overall consumption will increase from 120 1/cd to 190 1/cd.



- 4-
Sector OrEanization and Development
2.06    With the exception only of certain major water source operations, the
provision of public water supply and sewerage services in Turkey is a respon-
sibility of municipalities and village councils. Local financial resources
and technical capabilities, however, have not been sufficient to support sys-
tem development (except recently in the cases of Istanbul and Izmir).
Planning, design, and construction of new systems, therefore, have been, and
are being carried out by three central government organizations, except for
projects in the largest municipalities.   The three organizations are:
(a)  The State Hydraulic Works (DSI) under the Ministry of Public
Works, responsible for national water recources management,
major water source development and operation, and water supply
development for the larger towns, but excluding the four largest
municipalities. DSI has its headquarters in Ankara and operates
21 regional offices.
(b)  The Iller Bank (IB, meaning Bank of the Provinces), a semi-
autonomous Government corporation responsible for water supply
development for towns with a population of less than 100,000,
and for major sewerage development in all urban areas except
Istanbul and Izmir. IB has its headquarters in Ankara and
operates 16 regional offices. Its shareholders are the
municipalities.
(c)  The General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) under the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Village Affairs (MAFRA).
There are two departments within GDRS dealing with rural water
supply programs, the Rural Water Supply Department (RWS) and the
Research and Planning Department. The RWS has 17 regional
offices which supervise 67 provincial offices.
2.07     In all but the four largest municipalities, responsibility for
municipal water and sewerage operations is embedded within operating depart-
ments which carry out a variety of other functions as well (e.g., transporta-
tion, gas service). The first of the four exceptions is the Istanbul
Municipality. In 1981, the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage General
Directorate (ISKI) was created by Law No. 2560 as an autonomous entity respon-
sible for the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of all
water supply and sewerage facilities in Greater Istanbul. This was intended
to strengthen the sector's organization, and to enable an increasing share of
the sector's investment for Istanbul to be financed with internally generated
funds. The experience has been successful, and Law No. 3305 of June 5, 1986
has amended the first ISKI law (No. 2560) to authorize the establishment of
similar organizations in Izmir, Ankara and Adana. Also, national legislation
in 1981 defined Greater Municipal Areas, by which administrative responsibili-
ties and organizations for water supply and sewerage services of many smaller
municipalities could be taken over by a nearby large urban center. In the
case of Istanbul, 24 water supply organizations were merged into ISKI.

Investments in the Sector
2.08     In 1985-86, the total of all public investment grew about 15 percent
per year in real terms, with the energy and transport sectors and expenditures
by municipalities accounting for the majority of the increase. This rate of
growth has been considered excessive, but at the same time it has been recog-
nized that increases in municipal expenditures may be appropriate in many
cases to make up for service deficiencies that developed as a result of under-
funding in previous years. Accordingly, it has been the Government's objec-
tive to have investment in water and sanitation increase from 5 percent of
total public investment in 1984 to an average of 9 percent over 1985-89,
within a public investment total increasing at an average rate of about 42 per
year. The World Bank supported this in its March 1987 Public Investment
Review with the Government.
2.09     The 1987 public investment budget for the Greater Istanbul metropoli-
tan area may be summarized as follows:

' Includes foreign borrowing by ISKI.
Investments financed in the municipal budget are planned to continue at about
the 1987 level in real terms through the rest of the 1980s. It is planned
that foreign borrowing will decline from TL 130 billion equivalent in 1987 to
TL 80 billion in 1988, and to lower amounts later. Major projects to be
financed in part with future foreign borrowing include the Golden Horn
Improvement Project, a third Bosphorus Bridge, and an urban road artery,
together costing an estimated US$400 million; and a first stage rapid transit
system costing US$300 million. Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) Projects
under consideration include four hotels, a car park, a lorry park, a
Disneyland and, possibly, a hospital. A principal reason for growing interest
in this form of development is its minimal impact on the Municipality's budget.
2.10     ISKI's 1987 budgeted investment expenditures represent about 11% of
the Istanbul total. They will grow rapidly during the next few years, but
will be financed mainly (88X) by revenue from sales (para 6.08), the balance
being obtained through borrowing, and with no requirement for a budgetary
provision from the Municipality or the Government.



-6-
Constraints to Development
2.11     Except in Istanbul and, in the near future, in Izmir, Ankara and
Adana, responsibility for the construction of municipal water supply and sew-
erage systems has been held by DSI and IB. This has had several conse-
quences. Firstly, central agency supervision of construction of widely
scattered projects has not always been adequate. Secondly, lobbying by munic-
ipalities for water supply and sewerage systems has put central organizations
under pressure to start projects when funds may not have been available to
proceed at an efficient pace. Thirdly, municipalities responsible for many
other services' in addition to water, have not always operated and maintained
systems satisfactorily, and have set charges at too low a level to provide for
sufficient maintenance. The situation is, however, expected to improve given
the Government's decentralization policy (para. 2.07) ana the example of the
positive experience with ISKI.
Previous World Bank Involvement in the Sector
2.12     The Bank made a US$37 million loan to the Government in 1972 for the
Istanbul Water Supply Project (Loan 844-TU), which was completed in 1981. The
Project included expansions of water treatment, transmission, pumping and dis-
tribution systems for the Istanbul metropolitan area. The Project Performance
Audit Report (No. 4853, issued in 1983), concluded that the main oroject
objectives were achieved: water production was increased to the levels antic-
ipated at the time of appraisal, and a reorganization of the sector was
achieved through the creation of the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage
General Directorate. In 1982, a loan of US$88.1 million was made by the Bank
for the Istanbul Sewerage Project (Loan 2159-TU) to improve sewage disposal
facilities and to increase the proportion of the City's population to be
served by sewerage. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily, with
81 percent of the loan disbursed as of October 1987. The Project will
eliminate discharges into the Golden Horn today amounting to about 30 percent
of Istanbul's effluent, and an industrial pollution control program already
has been put into operation.
2.13     Loan 2818-TU or US$184 million was approved in May 1987 for a water
and sewerage project for Izmir (estimated total cost of US$522 million). An
authority similar to .SKI has been established to implement the Project and
manage water and seweiage operations. An engineering loan of US$9.2 million,
including funds for water supply and sewerage studies for the Cukurova Region
(Loan 2537-TU), was approved in 1985. This was followed in May 1987 by Loan
2819-TU of US$120 million for a municipal infrastructure project for the
Cukurova Region (estimated cost of US$467 million), 47 percent of which would
be for water and sewerage. An authority similar to ISKI has been established
for the largest city involved, Adana, and operationally autonomous water
departments are to be established in four other towns in the Region. The
Cukurova Project also aims to build up the capacity of Iller Bank as a finan-
cial intermediary. A unit is to be established within Iller Bank to appraise
and monitor municipal infrastructure projects and investment programs in the
Cukurova area. Total lending for the urban and water sector under ongoing
loans is US$401 million.

World Bank Lending Justification
2.14     The Bank's strategy for the sector is to continue to support the
Government's objective of reducing inadequacies in water and sewerage infra-
structure in the most cost-effective and environmentally sound way possible.
The strategy is also to support the decentralization and cost recovery poli-
cies of the Government through assistance in the near and medium term to the
new autonomous water and sewerage organizations in the municipalities. In
addition, the Bank would begin lending for projects in medium-size cities,
where considerable potential lies for improving service levels and achieving
efficiency improvements and full cost recovery and autonomy. Lending by the
Bank for medium-size cities may be accomplished best through an intermediary,
specifically the Iller Bank if it can be further strengthened for the purpose.
2.15     Addi.ional financial assistance from the World Bank for water and
sewerage development in Istanbul is justified for the following reasons:
(i)    Istanbul is the industrial center and largest city of Turkey,
with a rapily growing population and a need for substantial
further expansion in water and sewerage capacity to meet
expanding industrial and domestic requirements;
(ii)    the proposed assistance would further strengthen institutionally
the autonomous water and sewerage organization of Istanbul,
which already is recongized as a successiful model for sector
organization in Turkey's municipalities;
(iii)    the Project would contribute to badly needed environmental
improvement t :h in the city and in its surrounding waters; and
(iv)    support for Istanbul's strong cost recovery policy for the
sector would be reaffirmed^
III. THE BORROWER
Introduction
3.01     The proposed borrower, implementing agency, and operating organiza-
tion for the Project is the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage General
Directorate (ISKI) of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. ISKI was formed
by combining water supply and sewerage staff and assets from existing service
organizations within the Greater Municipal Area into a separate, autonomous,
administratively self-sufficient organization specified by Law No. 2560
approved by the Turkish Parliament November 20, 1981, and amended by Law No.
3009, May 23, 1984.
3.02     ISKI is responsible for the development and operation of all public
water supply and sewerage for the metropolitan area except its water sources
outside the area which are developed and in some cases operated by DSI. ISKI
operates surface water reservoirs and well fields with a safe yield of 1.06
million m3 per day. In 1986, it distributed water through 835,000 connections
to approximately 5.1 million persons in an area totalling about 600 km2, and
handled the collection and disposal of sewage from 520,000 connections.



-8-
Organization and Stafing
3.03     ISXI is administered by:
(i)    a General Assembly consisting of the Metropolitan Municipal
Council;
(ii)    a full-time, six-member Board of Directors with the Mayor as
Chairman, which reports to the General Assembly; and
(iii)    a General Director who is the Board's Vice Chairman and the
chief executive officer responsible for day-to-day operations.
The General Director is supported by Assistant General Directors for Operations
(water transmission, water and sewage treatment, and electrical and mechanical
operations); Networks (all water distribution and sewage collection); Planning
and Construction; and Finance and Administration.   He also has a staff of
advisors and small, specialized departments (e.g., Legal Department; Annex 1).
3.04     The General Assembly approves ISKI's investment plans and annual bud-
gets, staffing, tariffs and borrowings. The Board of Directors approves
operating principles and regulations, matters to be submitted for final
approval by the General Assembly, and appointments of senior officials and
staff other than the General Director and Assistant General Directors. The
General Director is appointed by the Central Government (Ministry of Interior)
upon nomination by the Mayor. The Assistant General Directors are appointed
by the General Director.
3.05     Board Members, the General Director, and the Assistants are required
under the ISKI Law to have professional qualifications and experience in their
fields. One of the most significant developments realized in the formation of
ISKI as an independent entity has been the strengthening of its management,
which now is a model for the sector in Turkey.
3.06     ISKI's 5,680 employees include 159 management and senior advisory
staff, 364 engineers and technicians, 759 accounting and commercial operations
staff, 245 other office workers, and 4,153 unskilled and semi-skilled service
and maintenance workers. The total number of employees gives ratios of
approximately 7 employees per 1,000 water connections (one employee for every
890 persons served), and 11 employees per 1,000 sewerage connections.l/
These ratios are satisfactory for public utility organizations of this type.
The number of employees has risen by about 200 per year since 1982, and fur-
ther growth at kbout the same rate will be necessary as the networks expand.
Staffing plans Are prepared annually, and recruitment procedures are satis-
factory. Turnover is low.
3.07     ISKI provides training for its employees in operations and mainte-
nance, more advanced technical subjects, management and administration,
and a variety of other subjects. The program is satisfactory. Among areas
¢' ISKI also provides a cesspit emptying service to households not connected
to the sewerage system.



- 9 -
currently receiving emphasis are vehicle operation and maintenance, network
maintenance, administration and billing procedures, English Language training,
and computer training.
3.08     Training consists mainly of short, in-house courses of one to four
weeks spread throughout the year. Limited overseas training through courses
of short duration in specialized technical areas also is provided. In 1987,
1,300 employees, nearly 25 of ISKI's staff, will attend courses totalling
approximately 95 staffyears.

Acounting and Auditing
3.09     ISKI maintains separate, commercially oriented accounts which were
designed for ISKI by the Institute for State Economic Enterprises at Istanbul
University with support under Loan 2159-TU. Accounting operations were fully
computerized starting from January 1987, and ongoing manual bookkeeping on a
transitional basis will be discontinued by early 1988.
3.10     In addition to its external audit by an auditor from the Treasury
(Central Government), ISKI is required under the ISKI Law to be audited by an
internal auditor who reports to its General Assembly. The form of the exter-
nal audit is prescribed by law and limited essentially to the inspection of
accounts to detect any deficiency or irregularity, and to the certification of
the annual income statement. Although this may be done competently, it omits
features considered essential by the Bank. ISKI plans to address the matter
in two ways. The first will be to obtain a commercial, independent audit
according to international standards and the Bank's Guidelines. A proposal
for this service from the Institute for State Economic Enterprises is under
consideration by ISKI for the years 1987 and 1988. Also, there are competent
accounting and auditing firms in Istanbul which could be engaged to do the
work. In addition, ISKI is requesting that the Treasury audit be revised to
incorporate international standards, a matter on which assurance has been
received from the Treasury that sericus consideration will be given. ISKI
agreed in the Loan Negotiations to hbve its accounts audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and to submit their report to the
Bank by June 30 of the following year.



- 10 -
Bilhing and CoUection
3.11     ISKI's sales are fully metered and its billing has been computerized
for several years. Meters are read two times a year for most customers.
Bimonthly bills are sent, two per year on the basis of the meter readings, and
the other four per year on an estimated basis. (High quantity customers are
read and billed every month.) Billing prior to 1987 was done for ISKI by an
outside data processing firm, and for a variety of reasons, including meter
malfunctions and incorrect records on ISKI's part, overbillings totalling TL
12.9 billion had accumulated by the end of 1986. These were then cancelled,
but because of customer resistance and inadequate effort devoted by ISKI to
collections, customer arrears amounting to the equivalent of six months of
1986 billings still remained. ISKI was able to address only 50,000 of approx-
imately 300,000 delinquent accounts in 1986.
3.12     ISKI now has fully taken over its billing operations, and is using a
newly acquired computer for the function. In addition, a private firm is
being engaged to augment ISKI's capacity for payment enforcement operations,
principally closing and reopening connections. Because of the large backlog,
ISKI does not expect to bring its accounts receivable within desired limits
until well into 1988. ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations to reduce its
accounts receivable to the equivalent of no more than five months of current
billings by the end of March 1988, four months by the end of June 1988, three
months by the end of September 1988, and two months by the end of December
1988.
Industrial Waste Management
3.13     ISKI's industrial waste management program is making significant
progress in monitoring and controlling waste discharges to Istanbul's sewer
system and aquatic environment. Implementation of the program began in
November 1986 with the establishment of ISKI's Department of Industrial Waste
Management. At present, the Department has a staff of 35, of which 18 are
engiueers and scientists with university degrees. The Depart,aent is autho-
rized 70 positions, including 35 professionals, and is searching for qualified
persons to fill vacancies.  The Department has a laboratory for sampie analy-
sis and has promulgated industrial waste discharge regulations. It has inven-
toried 2,000 firms with liquid waste discharges, and has issued discharge per-
mits to 250 firms for the safe discharge of their liquid waste. Detailed
investigations and issuing of permits to all of the 2,000 firms inventoried is
scheduled to be completed by the end of 1989, assuming that all of the
Department's positions are filled throughout 1988 and 1989.
3.14     ISKI's industrial wastewater regulations place restrictions on the
types of wastes that may be discharged to the sewer system, and they establish
surcharges based on types and concentrations of discharges. The regulations
are consistent with the national environmental law, and with national indus-
trial waste discharge regulations now in draft form. The basic unit charge is
for wastewater equivalent to domestic wastewater. Surcharges increase with
the types and coneentrations of the contaminants in the wastewater. The
surcharges are sufficiently high to encourage the undertaking of on-site
treatment. At present, 350 firms are being required to pay surcharges.
3.15     In general, industry in the Metropolitan area is cooperating in the
effort to eliminate pollution from industrial wastes. So far, there are 45
industrial waste treatment plants in operation. Two large plants are under



- 11 -
construction to serve industrial )arks established in Tuzla and Ikitelli by
industrial associations for the tanning and textile industries, respectively.
Each of these parks will have wastewater collection and a treatment plant
designed to handle wastes peculiar to its industry. The park and treatment
plant in Tuzla is scheduled for completion by mid-1988, and 150 tanneries have
agreed to relocate to this site. The park and treatment plant in Ikitelli
will be ready for occupancy by the end of 1988.
3.16     To date, all of the industrial waste treatment plants have been
financed by the firms involved. Private finance is expected to continue to be
the main source of funding. A limited amount of support is available through
loans from the Ministry of Industry for construction of facilities, mainly
industrial parks. Also, the national environmental law established a small
fund for financing waste treatment plant construction using fines and penal-
ties for non-compliance collected from industries and municipalities.
3.17     ISKI's program for industrial waste management is well designed and
is being implemented successfully. Because of the results already being
obtained, technical assistance for industrial waste management under the
Project would be limited to training abroad for managers and key technical
staff (para. 5.10). Progress in the program would be monitored by the Bank
during project implementation (Annex 11).
Insurance
3.18     ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations to maintain appropriate
insurance against fire, other forms of damage, theft, and potentiel
liabilities. ISKI agreed also to continue to require its suppliers and
contractors to obtain insurance for assets of the Project, and against risks
related to its implementation.
IV. SECTOR SERVICES, DEMAND AND PROPOSED MVESTMENTS
Projeet Area
4.01     The Istanbul metropolitan area is Turkey's largest in population,
area, and economic activity. The population in 1986 was 5.7 million, and the
area inside the municipal boundaries was 600 sq. km., of which about 60 pert-
cent was developed. An estimated 60 percent of the Country's industrial
capacity is located in the area. The City is of unique historic interest. It
is a major tourist and commercial center, and the Country's principal port.
4.02     The City is divided by the Bosphorus, a strait 30 km long and one to
eight km wide separating Asia from Europe and linking the Black Sea with the
Sea of Marmara, which in turn leads to the Dardanelles, the Aegean Sea, and
the Mediterranean. The European side of the City is divided by a narrow inlet
known as the Golden Horn. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Golden
Horn have provided convenient means for disposal of the City's wastewater,
which has been and is discharged untreated causing extreme pollution.
Sector Services
4.03     WaterSuwly. The City's main existing sources of water are four
surface reservoirs with a combined safe yield of approximately 1.0
million m3 per day (see IBRD Map 20401). Two reservoirs currently under



- 12 -
construction will add another 0.5 million m3/day. Sources of supply and
their safe yield capacities are as follows:
Safe Yield
Source                         (thousand m3/day)
Omerli Reservoir                         493

A'    The Darlik Dam and Reservoir will be completed in mid-1988.  Initially,
water from the Darlik Reservoir will be transferred to the Omerli
Reservoir, where it will be withdrawn and treated at an addition to the
existing Omerli treatment plant. The addition will be completed on the
same date as the dam and reservoir.
~'    The Buyukeekmece Dam and Reservoir will be completed by year end 1987.
ISKI plans limited withdrawals in 1988, with chlorination as the only
treatment. A rapid sand filter plant with flocculation and settling is
under construction and scheduled for completion by December 1988. A
transmission main and pumping station are already completed.



- 13 -
With one exception, the treatment at all of the plants consists of floccula-
tion, settling, and rapid sand filtration followee by chlorination. The
exception is the Kagithane Plant, which has a slow sand filter unit. The
treatment for groundwater consists of chlorine addition only.
4.05     When the source works currently under construction are completed, the
total supply capacity will be adequate to meet the projected demand for 1991,
but the treatment capacity will still be deficient. Treatment capacity is
needed to meet the maximum day demand for Istanbul, which is estimated at 120
percent of the average day demand. The 1987 maximum day requirement exceeds
the total of the existing treatment capacity and the capacity under con-
struction. As a result, shortages during periods of maximum demand will per-
sist until new treatment works have been designed and constructed (Annex 5).
4.06     The water distribution system consists of two networks separated by
the Bosphorus and connected since 1981 by two parallel 1.0 meter diameter
underwater mains. The system is complex, and in many places is antiquated and
in need of rehabilitation. There are insufficient pressure and intermittent
supply to areas of higher elevation and to fringe areas of the City, caused
mostly by lack of production capacity, and aggravated in some areas by under-
size pipes. In 1986, there were 835,000 connections serving 5.1 million
people, or 89 percent of the service area population, but not all of these
people were adequately served.
4.07     Sewerage.  Istanbul's sewerage system is incomplete.  In many
areas, it consists only of street sewers that discharge to the nearest water
course. Its sewers installed before 1960 were designed to carry stormwater
and wastewater together. Since 1960, separate stormwater and wastewater
sewers have been constructed for newly urbanized areas. The system comprises
1,000 km of collectors, 2,600 km of street sewers, and 520,000 connections
serving 55 percent of the population. The remainder of the population have
latrines, septic tanks, or cesspits, many of which are inappropriate because
they are in areas of high population density.
4.08     The service area is divided into 11 drainage zones, each having inde-
pendent sewage collection systems (Map 20405). Most of the effluent eventu-
ally reaches the Sea of Marmara.  Because there is little flow in the Golden
Horn, pollution there is at its most extreme.  The Sea of Marmara is severely
polluted along the shoreline causing bathing beaches close to the City to be
closed.  The Bosphorus has remained somewhat less polluted due to the large
volume of its flow.  The pollution in the Golden Horn and a small part of the
Sea of Marmara will be eliminated by facilities being constructed in the on-
going Istanbul Sewerage Project (Loan 2159-TU), which will intercept and treat
the sewage from two of Istanbul's most populous drainage zones. Facilities
being constructed consist of 40 km of interceptors, two preliminary treatment
plants, and two sea outfalls. Effluent from the treatment plants will be dis-
charged to the bottom current in the Bosphorus, which in turn will dilute and
transport the effluent to the Black Sea, where it will be further diluted,
dispersed, and treated naturally (Annex 2).
Demand for Water
4.09     The city's future demand for water has been calculated based on esti-
mates of future population and per capita water requirements, and on goals for
the percentage of the population to be served and for the proportion of the



- 14 -
total amount of water produced which actually will reach the customer. A
percentage allowance for "unaccounted-for water" is added to the projected
consumption by customers to obtain the projected water supply capacity
requirement. The calculation indicates an average demand of 2.5 million
m3/day in the year 2000, compared to 1.8 millioa m3/day in 1984 (Annex 3).
4.10     Population.  The population of Istanbul grew at annual rates aver-
aging 4.3 percent between 1980-1985, &nd 4.1 percent for 1975-1980. The
average annual growth rate in 1980-1985 for the total urban population of
Turkey was 4.0 percent. Istanbul's growth rate is expected to declitie to 3.8
percent by 1995, and to 3.6 percent by the year 2000 as shown below:
Istanbul                   Annual

2000             9.7                        3.6
These figures are the appraisal mission's projections and are slightly lower
than the projections by ISKI's Planning Department and the Municipality. They
imply an increase of 1.8 million in the City's population over 1987-1994, the
project period, and an increase of 4.0 million by the year 2000.
4.11     Population Served.  ISKI plans to increase water service levels from
89 percent in 1986 to 92 percent by 1994, and to improve the quality of
service for the population already served. With the projected growth in popu-
lation, 285,000 new connections would be needed by 1994 (Annex 3).
4.12     Consumption by Customers.  Consumption is expected to increase
because of growth in per capita consumption as well as growth in population.
It is projected that consumption in Istanbul will increase from 0.9 million m3
per day in 1986 to 1.4 million m3 per day by 1994, and to 2.0 million m3 per
day by 2000. Per capita water consumption is expected to increase from 175
1/cd in 1986 to 200 1/cd by 1994, and to 210 1/cd by 2000, an increase of.
about 1.3 percent per year.'- The tendency for per capita consumption to
increase is the result of: (a) improvements in living standards; (b) elimina-
tion of supply shortages that have suppressed per capita consumption in the
recent past; and (c) increased industrial activity. Factors that sometimes
are cited as causes for decreasing per capita consumption--tariff increases
and a tendency of new customers to be poorer and more conservative in their
water use than existing customers--are not expected to be significant. ISKI's
tariffs are affordable to low income consumers as well as to higher income
'1/ These figures include industrial and commercial uses, about 35 pe.:cent of
total consumption.



- 15 -
consumers because of the block tariff structure introduced with the last
tariff increase. Expenditure on water and sewerage currently accounts, on
average, for about 3.4 percent of total household expenditures (para 7.08).
Since tariffs are expected to remain approximately constant in real terms over
the project period, the effect of future changes in prices on water
consumption is not expected to be significant.
4.13     Unaccounted-for Water and Production Capacity.  ISKI's unaccounted-
for water is currently 30 percent of the total amount of water produced, down
significantly from 1980's 40 percent. The improvement is the result of an
on-going leak detection and repair program using equipment provided under the
Istanbul Sewerage Project. The program would be continued under the proposed
project, with unaccounted-for water targets of 22 percent by 1994, and 20 per-
cent by the yeur 2000. Reduction below 20 percent is unreal1stic, given the
antiquated nature of parts of the system, many of which cannot be rehabili-
tated in the foreseeable future.
Demand for Sewerage
4.14     The projected demand for sewerage in Istanbul is based in part on
projected increases in the connected population from today's level of 55 per-
cent to 70 percent by 1994. With the projected population growth, 330,000 new
connections and 2,500 km of new street sewers would be needed by 1994. The
annual volume of sewage to be treated and disposed of by 1994 is estimated at
1.2 million m3/day, assuming that 80 percent of the water consumed by the
connected population reaches the system (see Annex 4). Facilities currently
under construction will intercept and dispose of 0.4 million m3/day by 1994.
This, therefore, calls for additional capacity to handle 1994's balance of 0.8
million m3/day.
ISKIrs Investment Program
4.15     The investments projected for ISKI for 1987-94 would total an
estimated US$2.6 billion (see Annex 5). The program was reviewed by the
appraisal mission and found to be feasible and sound, with all major com-
ponents being the least-cost solution for the problems addressed. The overall
objectives of the program are: (i) to provide a safe supply of water in
adequate quantities for the City's growing population; and (ii) to provide for
the collection and environmentally sound disposal of wastewater. The program
consists of: (i) the completion of works in progress, principally the Darlik
and Buyukcekmece Dams and Reservoirs, and the facilities being constructed in
the Istanbul Sewerage Project; (ii) construction of the Isakoy Dam and
Reservoir; (iii) water treatment and transmission facilities; (iv) water
distribution system reinforcement, expansion, and rehabilitation; (v) sewage
collection facilities; (vi) seven preliminary and eight secondary sewage
treatment plants; (vii) a water supply monitoring and control system; and
(viii) purchases of maintenance equipment. The engineering feasibility and
economic justification of the program were outlined in the 1971 DAMOC Master



- 16 -
Plan Study1-', and were updated by subsequent studies in 19751' and
19771/. ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations that by the end of February
each year, it would submit to the Bank for review and comment a report on the
implementation of the investment program, including up to date plans as well
as current accomplishments.
V. THE PROJECT
Introduction
5.01     The proposed project is approximately one fourth of the investment
program projected for ISKI for 1987-94. The selection of components for the
proposed project was made using the following criteria: (i) priority in the
investment program; (ii' stage of preparation; and (iii) need for foreign
exchange financing. The initial selection was made by ISKI and was presented
to the Bank in a May 30, 1986 letter from the Government requesting
financing. Changes since then were made in consultation with the Bank. The
high priority of the sewerage components in the Project was foreseen by the
Bank and ISKI in 1982 during the appraisal of the Istanbul Sewerage Project,
and, as a result, financing for project preparation was included in Loan
2159-TU.  Preparatica by ISKI began in 1985, and discussions then began with
the Bank on project timing. ISKI engaged consultants in 1986 to prepare final
designs and bidding documents.
Proiect Objectives
5.02     The project objectives are: (i) to improve and extend sewerage ser-
vice to 70% of the population of Istanbul by the end of 1994; (ii) to provide
for appropriate disposal of sewage to protect the waters and shorelines of the
Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus; (iii) to reduce unaccounted-for water; and
(iv) to strengthen ISKI's operation and maintenance and industrial waste man-
agement capabilities.
Project Desception
5.03     The Project consists of the following components (see also IBRD Maps
Nos. 20401 and 20405):
Part A: Water DiLstribution
1.   Implementation of a program to reduce unaccounted-for water
including training of personnel, system mapping, district meter-
ing, repair of leaks, and replacement of deficient customer
meters;
1-' A consortium sponsored by Daniel, Mann, Johnson and Mendenhall, Los
Angeles, Ca, and including Alvord, Burdick, and Howson, Chicago, Ill;

- 17 -
2.   replacement of 1,200 km of old, defective pipe in the Asian
distribution network;
3.   rehabilitation of 20 network pumping stations; and
4.   installation of a supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) system.
Part B: SewaaZe Coleetion and Treatment
1.   Construction of the Atakoy pumping station, the Sahil Yolu pump-
ing station, and the Atakoy collector; rehabilitation of the
Zeytinburnu pumping station in the Atakoy Drainage Zone;
2.   construction of the Kucukcekmece pumping station, secondary
treatment plant, and submarine outfall, and 14 km of collectors
in the Kucukcekmece Drainage Zone;
3.   construction of the Tuzla pumping station, secondary treatment
plant, and submarine outfall; a collection pumping station; and
27 km of collectors in the Tuzla Drainage Zone;
4.   construction of the Kadikoy pretreatment plant, pumping station
and submarine outfall; the 21 km Kadikoy-Pendik Interceptor; and
the Dragos pumping station in the Kadikoy-Pendik Drainage Zone;
5.   construction of the Uskudar preliminary treatment plant and sub-
marine outfall;
6.   construction of 2,500 km of street sewers; and
7.   installation of 330,000 customer service connections.
Part C: Initutional Improvement of ]SKI
1.   Training in the operation and maintenance of sewage treatment
plants, pumping stations, and the SCADA system constructed under
the Project;
2.   training in industrial waste management; and
3.   acquisition of operation and maintenance vebicles and equirment,
including equipment for the detection and repair of leaks.
5.04     Water Distribution. The program to reduce unaccounted-for water,
Part Al of the Project, consists of analysis, design, training provided by
consultants, and field operations by ISKI staff. Parts A2 and A3 of the
Project consist of continuation of the water pipe replacement program begun
under Loan 2159-TU, pumping station rehabilitation, and repairs identified in
Part Al of the Project, the program to reduce unaccounted-for water. Pipe
replacement would be limited under the Project to the Asian distribution
network since KfW plans to finance pipe replacement in the European network.
European as well as Asian pumping stations would be eligible for rehabili-
tation under the Project. Pumping station work would consist of rebuilding of



- 18 -
pumps, motors, and other mechanical equipment when feasible, and replacement
when the existing equipment is under-capacity or not reparable.
5.05     The SCADA system, Part A4 of the Project, would make it possible to
directly monitor and control the operation of the city's water supply system
from a central location. In addition, SCADA computers would store and analyze
data such as source flows, storage tank levels, flows and pressures at criti-
cal locations in the distribution network, pump operating times, and energy
consumption. The data would enable ISKI to minimize operating costs by opti-
mizing water system operation and maintenance.
5.06     Sewage Colection and Treatment.  Part Bl of the Project comprises
facilities for pumping Atakoy sewage to the Yenikapi Zone for treatment at the
Yenikapi plant being constructed under the already ongoing sewerage project.
This would be an interim solution intended to last unti) the Yenikapi Zone
facilities are loaded to capacity in about eight years. A force main would
then be constructed to permit the Atakoy Zone sewage to be pumped to an
expansion of the Kucukcekmece treatment plant included in Part B3 of the
Project.
5.07     Parts B2, B3, B4, and B5 of the Project would intercept and treat
untreated sewage from the Kucukcekmece, Tuzla, Kadikoy-Pendik and Uskudar
Drainage Zones, respectively. Treatment plants included in Parts B2 and B3 of
the Project for the Kucukcekmece and Tuzla Drainage Zones would be biological
plants that would produce a high quality secondary effluent for disposal to
the Sea of Marmara through relatively short submarine outfalls. The Kadikoy
and Uskudar treatment plants included in Parts B4 and B5 of the Project would
provide preliminary treatment to remove grit and floatables. The effluent
would be discharged through submarine outfalls extending to the Bosphorus
bottom current. The current would dilute and transport the effluent to che
Black Sea where it would be dispersed and treated naturally (Annex 2).
5.08     This use of the Bosphorus bottom current for sewage disposal was pro-
posed originally in the DAMOC Master Plan in 1971, and again in the Camp-Tek-
Ser Master Plan update in 1975. The collection and disposal systems cur-
rently under construction for the Yenikapi and Kabatas-Baltalimani Drainage
Zones, which are being financed in part by Loan 2159-TU, are based on this
method. Analysis of the Bosphorus currents indicates that effluent disposal
in the bottom current is theoretically sound, but this has not been demon-
strated in practice. The risk that the method might prove not to be fully
successful is considered to be very low (para. 7.14).
5.09     Parts B6 and B7 of the Project would extend sewerage service to an
existing population of approximately 0.9 million persons, and to another
1.4 million person3 representing 70% the projected population increase during
the project period. ISKI would construct 50 percent of the street sewers and
connections. The other 50 percent would be constructed by public and private
developers under ISKI's supervision.
5.10     Institutional Improvement.  Technical assistance and training under
Part C of the Project would assist in improving ISKI's capabilities in opera-
tions, maintenance, and industrial waste management. Under Part Cl, opera-
tions and maintenance personnel to be assigned to new facilities constructed
in the Project would be trained in a program designed and administered by the
consultants responsible for the construction supervision and start-up of the



- 19 -
facilities. Contractor and equipment representatives would be used in the
effort also. Under Part C2, overseas training would be provided for key per-
sonnel responsible tur implementing the industrial waste management program.
The training would consist of assigning selected staff to operating water and
sewerage authorities in Europe for periods up to two months. Trainees would
work side by side with counterparts. The purpose of the training would be to
familiarize key staff with alternative approaches which may be applicable in
Istanbul. The cost of all training is estimated at US$1.8 million, including
US$0.1 million for overseas training. Under Part C3, operations and mainte-
nance capabilities would be strengthened through the purchase of vehicles and
construction equipment.
Project Cost and Financig
5.11     The cost of the Project is estimated at US$569.9 million equivalent
excluding interest during construction. Allowances for value added taxes
totalling an estimated US$59.9 million are included. ISKI must pay a twelve
percent value added Lax on its purchases other than land. No allowances for
duties and import taxes are included in the estimate because ISKI is exempt.
Engineering and technical assistance costs include the salaries of ISKI staff
participating in the Project, as well as the costs of the Project consultants.
Consulting services for design, construction supervision, and technical
assistance are estimated at US$12.0 million (US$10.1 million in base costs).
This does not include US$3.0 million in consulting costs for design work
carried out under the Istanbul Sewerage Project financed in part by Loan
2159-TU. Man-month requirements for the consulting services are estimated at
1,830 man-months, of which 550 man-months would be for internationally
selected consultants. ISKI staff are to contribute approximately 13,600
man-months for engineering and administration having an estimated cost of
US$7.2 million equivalent (US$6.8 million in base costs).
5.12     The project cost estimate is summarized in Table 5.1.  Base costs are
in July 1, 1987 prices, updated from January 1, 1987 prices which were used to
prepare the original estimates. The total amount includes physical contin-
gencies of US$46.2 million (10 percent of base costs for equipment, materials,
and civil works) and price contingencies of US$28.4 million (about 5 percent
of the US$ base cost plus physical contingencies; the assumed annual rates of
inflation of US$ prices are 32 for 1987, 12 for 1988 through 1990, and 3.5%
for 1991 through 1994). The estimated foreign exchange requirement is
US$241.4 million (42 percent of the total cost). The bases for the cost
estimate and further breakdowns of costs are presented in Annex 6. More
detailed figures are in the Project File.

Project Ipl ementation
5.14     Project Cr>adzation and Mai.ment.  The Project would be managed by
ISKI's Construction and Maintenance Department under the overall responsi-
bility of the Department Head (Annex 1). Project managers from the Water and
Sewer Construction Departments would be assigned responsibility for components
of the Project. A Project Coordinator has been appointed from the Planning
and Research Department to monitor project implementation and expenditures; to
prepare requests for loan disbursements; and to prepare consolidated reports
for the Bank on project implementation.
5.15     Design, bidding, and construction supervision of the larger compo-
nents of the Project would be carried out by consultants. These components
include the SCADA system, Part A4 of the Project, and the sewerage works in
the the five drainage zones, Parts Bl through B5. The distribution network
and pumping station rehabilitation (Parts Al and A2), the street sewers (Part
B6), and the sewer connections (Part B7) would be designed and supervised by
ISKI without the assistance of consultants; about 302 of the construction work
on these items would be performed by the Construction and Maintenance
Department, and most of the remaining 70 would be contracted out, with the
balance to be implemented by outside developers.
5.16     Installation of the SCADA system, Part A4 of the Project, would be
supervised by SOGREAH, French consultants who were responsible for the design
of the system and the preparation of the bidding documents. Bidding admini-
stration and construction supervision for the sewerage works in three of the
four drainage zones, Atakoy, Kucukcekmece, and Tuzla, Parts Bl, B2 and B3 of
the Project, would be carried out by the joint venture of firms which was
responsible for the designs: Watson-Hawkesly Engineers (UK), Motor Columbus
(Switzerland) and Temel Engineers (Turkey). Construction supervision of the
sewerage works in the Kadikoy-Pendik Drainage Zones, Parts B4 and E5 of the
Project, would be carried out by the joint venture of Taylor Binnie (UK) and
UBM Engineers (Turkey) which prepared the designs and bidding documents. All
consultants under contract are satisfactory to the Bank.

5.17     The Project works have been organized into 30 bidding and contracting
groups or packages (Annex 7). Except for continuing water pipe rehabilitation
and street sewer installation, all contracts will be bid by the end of 1988.
The estimated completion date for the contract planned to be completed last is
December 1994 (Annex 8). Eight of the packages, representing 12% of total
procurement, have already been awarded (para. 5.21). Bids have been
advertised for another 23% and bid documents for another 34% are expected to
be ready by January 1988. The remaining 30% of the procurement consists of
equipment purchases, water main replacement, street sewers and customer
connections to be implemented on a continuing basis throughout the project
period. Terms of reference for technical assistance consultants have been
prepared.
5.18     Land Acquisition. Approximately 30 hectares of land and 12 km of
easements are required to implement the sewage collection and treatment com-
ponents of the Project. Sites for the Kucukcekmece and Tuzla sewage treatment
plants are already owned by ISKI., The sites are unoccupied, and Do resettle-
ment will be involved in the Project. The Kadikoy sewage treatment plant will
be constructed on an offshore fill area to be constructed as part of the
Project. Both the Metropolitan and Kadikoy Municipalities have approved the
site and have authorized ISKI to proceed. Most of the easements needed have
not yet been obtained. Significant problems are not expected since there is
flexibility for selecting locations of the interceptors and collectors requir-
ing easements.
Procurement
5.19     Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.2.  An estimated
98 percent of goods would be procured through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines.  The other two
percent would be low cost items of operation and maintenance equipment to be
procured through Local Competative Bidding (LCB) and international and local
shopping (contracts smaller than US$200,000).  An estimated 64 percent of the
Civil works would be procured through ICB in accordance with the World Bank
Guidelines.  The other 36 percent would be for water distribution pipe instal-
lation, street sewer construction, water system rehabilitation and service
connections. LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank1' would be used for
about 50 percent of the street sewer construction, and all of the installation
work for the rehabilitation of the water system. Service connections and the
construction of the balance of the street sewers would be carried out by
private developers and by ISKI's own construction force; the proposed loan
would not finance these works. Consultants already under contract and addi-
tional consultants needed for design, construction supervision, and technical
assistance have been/would be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants.
LCB procedures in Turkey are generally consistent with the need for
economy and efficiency in the execution of the proposed Project. There
are, however, a few procedures which are inconsistent with the
Procurement Guidelines of the World Bank, and there are others which
require clarification. The Government and ISKI agreed in the Loan
Negotiations on the changes needed to make the procedures acceptable to
the Bank.

5.20     Prequalification of contractors would be used for large or complex
civil works contracts not already bid. Bidding now underway for five civil
works contracts is being conducted using a postqualification procedure
proposed by ISKI and agreed by the Bank for these cases in order to shorten
the time to be taken in contracting. ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations
that for all future procurement in the Project of large or complex civil
works, ISKI would use prequalification according to the Bank's Guidelines.
5.21     The estimated total value of all procurement under the project is
US$473.9 million. As was mentioned above, contracts for an estimated US$59.1
million (121 of the estimated total) have been awarded. Contracts for an
estimated US$105.7 million (231 of the estimated total) have been bid but will
not be awarded until after Board Presentation. The remaining procurement,
totalling an estimated US$309.1 million, will not be advertised until after
Board Presentation.

5.22     Approval of advance contracting and US$6.0 million in retroactive
financing (para. 5.30) is recommended for high priority contracts totalling an
estimated US$54.1 million for the supply and installation of the SCADA system
(US$12.3 million), an interceptor (US$11.4 million), pipe supply (US$26.4
million), and four consultant engineering assignments."'  The procurement
procedures were in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Three of the four
consultant contracts were awarded under Loan 2159-TU. They cover design work
being financed by Loan 2159-TU, but also cover future construction supervision
work which it would be reasonable to finance with the proposed loan.
5.23     An estimated US$202.0 million in contracts (43 percent of the esti-
mated total of all procurement) is expected to be won by foreign contractors,
suppliers, and consultants (see Table 5.4). Goods contracts totalling an
estimated US$121.6 million for the supply of water distribution pipes, sewage
treatment plant equipment, large pumping equipment, electromechanical equip-
ment, and 70 percent of the operation and maintenance vehicles and construc-
tion equipment have been or are likely to be won by a foreign supplier. These
include a US$12.3 million contract won by a Swiss contractor to supply and
install the SCADA system. Contracts for small pumping equipment and 30
percent of the operation and maintenance vehicles and construction equipment
are likely to be won by local manufacturers. Qualifying local manufacturers
would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or
the prevailing import duty, whichever is less.

5.24     Most of the civil works contracts have been or are expected to be won
by local contractors who, in recent years, have been difficult to underbid in
Turkey. An Italian contractor in a joint venture with a local contractor,
however, won the Project's already awarded sewage interceptor contract
(US$11.4 million). The already awarded contract for the supply of large diam-
eter concrete sewer pipe was won by a local contractor (US$26.4 million).
5.25     Two consultant contracts with estimated values totalling US$3.8 mil-
lion remain to be awarded, one for technical assistance and one for the super-
vision of street sewer construction. The technical assistance contract would
most likely be won by a foreign consultant. The street sewer construction
supervision contract would most likely be won by a local firm. The four
consultant contracts which have already been awarded were won by two UK firms,
a French firm and a Turkish firm. The three foreign firms have Tu.rkish
partners.
5.26     Draft tender documents and proposed awards for goods having an esti-
mated contract value of more than Us$500,000 equivalent and for civil works
having an estimated value of more than US$1,000,000 equivalent would be sub-
ject to prior review by the Bank. Contracts for lesser amounts would be sub-
ject to ex-post review. These limits would result in prior review of con-
tracts representing about 90 percent of all procurement not yet under contract
to be financed by the proposed loan.
Disbursements
5.27     Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made for:
(a)  100 percent of foreign expenditures and 26 percent of local
expenditures for civil works;
(b)  100 percent of foreign expenditures and exfactory local expendi-
tures, and 65 percent of other local expenditures, for goods; and
(c)  100 percent for consultants and overseas training.
5.28     Withdrawal applications would be supported by standard docuzuentation
with the exception of applications for local expenditures and expenditures
against contracts valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent, which will be
submitted on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE). Use of the SOE
procedure is justified based on the appraisal mission's evaluation of ISKI's
accounting and administrative procedures, which were found to be satisfactory,
and on the Bank's experience with ISKI's administration of funds from Loan
2159-TU. ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations that the SOE accounts would be
audited annually by an independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank, and would
be submitted to the Bank with the report on the audit at the time of sub-
mission of the audit reports on ISKI's annual financial statements.
5.29     A Special Account would be opened for ISKI at the Central Bank of
Turkey with an initial deposit of US$20.0 million from the proposed loan.
ISKI would .aake withdrawals for the Project from the Account based upon appro-
priate documentation. When disbursements from the Account would total about



- 26 -
one-third of the initial deposit, ISKI would apply to the Bank for replenish-
ment of the Account. ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations that the Special
Account would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank, and would be submitted with the report on the audit to the Bank together
with the audit reports mentioned above.
5.30     Retroactive financing up to a total of US$6.0 million equivalent is
proposed for expenditures incurred on contracts signed after April 1, 1987
(para. 5.22). The proposed allocation of loan proceeds is shown in Annex 9.
The loan Closing Date would be December 31, 1995, 12 months following project
completion. The disbursement period would be 9 years, which is the same as
the disbursement period for general investment type loans in Turkey.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.31     ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations to submit to the Bank semi-
annual reports (due February 28 and August 31) on the progress of project
implementation during the preceding semesters ending December 31 and June 30,
respectively. The reports would measure performance against the construction
and procurement schedules (Annexes 7 and 8), and the monitoring indicators
(Annex 11). Also, ISKI agreed that it would submit a Project Completion
Report to the Bank six months after the Loan Closing Date.
VL FINANCE
Past Performance and Current Financial Position
6.01     ISKI's financial performance fell during 1985 and 1986 because of low
tariffs and large arrears in customer accounts.  Tariffs were frozen from
January 1985 while general price levels increased more than 80X. Approxi-
mately 300,000 of a total of 835,000 customer accounts were substantially in
arrears, and accounts receivable at the end of 1986 amounted to the equivalent
of six months of 1986 billings. ISKI's self-financing of its investments for
the year was 14X, the balance being funded from Loan 2159 and two loans from
the Government's Public Participation Fund (Annexes 12, 13, and 14).
6.02     ISKI raised its tariffs in January 1987 by amounts averaging close to
300Z because of increases planned in capital spending during 1987-89, and
because financing from the Government was expected eventually to be reduced,
or possibly discontinued entirely. The tariff increase was intended to
establish in a single step a level of tariffs which '2 maintained in real
terms by periodic adjustment should be sufficient for the foreseeable f!,ture.
ISKI also began recently to increase its effort to collect from customers in
arrears, following its shift of billing operations from an outside data
processing firm to a new, in house computer (para. 3.12). Effects on ISKI's
balance sheet have been apparent in increases both in cash and in accounts
receivable. The latter are increasing despite the strengthened collection
effort, and will coatinue to do so for some time, because of ttne exceptional
magnitude of the tariff increase, and the difficulty of addressing so many
accounts in arrears.
6.03     ISKI's debt to equity ratio at the end of 1986 was 34:66.  About two
thirds of the debt was World Bank Loans 844 and 2159 (US$62.2 million



- 27 -
equivalent owed, with US$51.6 million of Loan 2159 still remaining to be dis-
bursed). ISKI also had received disbursements from the Public Participation
Fund totalling approximately US$29.4 million equivalent, and it owed US$7.1
million equivalent to the Kuwait Fund.
Financing Pla
6.04     ISKI's 1987-94 financial requirements consist of: (a) funds for works
already in process, principally the Istanbul Sewerage Project f-nanced in part
by Loan 2159; (b) funds for the proposed project; (c) funds for other new
works comprising, principally, expansion of water source and distribution
works; (d) debt service; and (e) increases in working capital. The proposed
financing plan calls for obtaining approximately 862 of the US$3.1 billion
equivalent needed through charges to customers, and for the balance of the
funds to be borrowed. Seven percent of the total would be the proposed loan
of US$218 million equivalent from the World Bank. The plan may be summarized
as follows (annual figures are presented in Annex 13):

$86.0 million, customer contributions (15X).
C/    Loan 2159, three loans from the Public Participation Fund, and a loan
from the European Resettlement Fund.
6.05     Approximately US$42 million equivalent will be disbursed from the
three loans from the Public Participation Fund during 1987-88. ISKI's terms
for repayment to the Fund are formulas based on incremental revenue which will
be obtained by ISKI from the works financed. For each loan a fraction of the
incremental revenue will be paid each year for ten years following completion



- 28 -
of the works. There are to be no payments of interest per se, ISKI's only
obligation being the single annual payment for each loan calculated according
to the respective formula. The estimated payments imply in imputed interest,
however, highly concessional terms for several years after works completion.
The European Resettlement Fund is to disburse approximately US$51.5 million
equivalent to ISKI through the Istanbul Municipality during 1987-89. ISKI's
debt to the Municipality is to be denominated in Turkish Lira and repaid over
13 years at 22.5% interest.
6.06     The proposed KfW credit would be for DM110 million (estimated at
US$61.1 million equivalent) for the supply of pipe to rehabilitate portions of
the water distribution network in the European part of Istanbul. The terms
would be twenty years including ten years grace, level payments of principal,
and 4.752 interest.
Future Finances
6.07     The cash generation projected in the financing plan is based on the
assumption that at the beginning of each year tariffs would be adjusted for
prior year inflation, so that annual average tariffs during 1988-94 would
remain unchanged in real terms (Annex 12). Because this cash generation com-
bined with the planned foreign borrowing would be more than needed during
1987-89 for the projected levels of investment, there would be a large accumu-
lation of cash by 1989 (Annex 14). This would be drawn down after 1989 as
decreasing borrowing and increasing debt service then would dictate. (It must
be noted that ISKI expects its investment program to progress more rapidly,
ana its temporary accumulation of cash to be less, than the figures indicated
in Annexes 13 and 14).
6.08     With the financing plan's projections, ISKI's annual self-financing
ratio (the percentage of the year's investment total financed with cash gener-
ated from customers, including their contributions, after covering cash oper-
ating expenses and debt service) would average approximately 88% during 1987-
94, and would be no less than 70Z in any year. ISKI's annual self-financing
of the lroposed project would range from 56% to 78X, and would average 62X.
As noted above (para. 6.07), ISKI would achieve these percentages by maintain-
ing its tariffs' annual averages unchanged in real termsL. Implementation of
the investment program would, however, require in addition: (i) that foreign
currency be available for purchase by ISKI for foreign costs other than those
financed by the Bank and KfW, and (ii) that ISKI succeed in tightening its
billing and collection.
6.09     ISKI has reaffirmed the intention to maintain in real terms on aver-
age its tariffs and other charges to customers at no less than the 1987 aver-
ages, and, accordingly, to-achieve annual self financing of its investments at
levels of 70% and upwards. ISKI and the Government, however, consider self
financing this high to be inappropriate for formal commitment. It was agreed
in the Loan Negotiations, therefore, that ISKI's commitment in the Loan
Agreement would be to annual self financing covering: (i) all expenditures
for the Project which are not covered by the proposed loan, plus (ii) not less
than 452 of ISKI's other capital expenditures during the year. Inasmuch as
the proposed loan would cover an estimated 38% of the Project's cost, thereby
leaving 62% to be covered by ISKI, the formal commitment of ISKI to self
financing overall is equivalent to no less than approximately 48S (the
weighted combination of the 62% for the Project and the 45% for all other
capital expenditures).



- 29 -
6.10     This commitment is considered a satisfactory one even though the
financing plan calls for higher self financing, principally for three
reasons. Firstly, self financing in the 452-502 range is a standard which
assures financially sound operation, and which, moreover, is high by
comparison with self-financing objectives set in connection with lending by
the Bank for other water and sewerage authorities. The second reason is that
if local funds difficulties should arise, ISKI would be able, and wod'4 be
expected, to respond within the framework of the Loan Agreement first by
deferring investments other than the Project. The third reason is that ISKI
agreed in the Loan Negotiations that in any case: (i) it would consult in
advance with the Bank with respect to future long term borrowing which it
would contract, if any, which would aggregate to more than US$5 million
equivalent in any year, and (ii) it would obtain the agreement of the Bank
prior to contracting any new long term debt in excess of the total amotant of
US$250 million equivalent until the completion of the Project. Thus, any
future shortfall in revenue or intention to further expand ISKI's investments
need not lead to unduly burdensome debt, a matter of importance nationally
with respect to foreign exchange requirements, as well as to ISKI itself.
Tariff Structure and Specia Charges
6.11     ISKI introduced a new tariff structure while increasing tariffs in
January 1987. The structure's basic rates are the same for customers receiv-
ing both water and sewerage services as those for customers receiving water
only.

6.12     ISKI also imposes surcharges for industrial effluent entering the
sewerage system in concentrations exceeding prescribed limits (para. 3.14).
In addition, ISKI charges private well owners for water which they draw from
their wells; it charges customers for maintenance services; and it charges
septic tank owners for emptying their tanks. Revenue from these charges
approaches, in total, approximately 30% of the revenue from basic water supply
and sewerage services (Annex 12).
6.13     The rate structure provides significant subsidization of household
consumption, as is apparent in Table 6.2, by charging above average rates to
commercial and industrial customers (the average cost to ISKI per m3 for the
latter is well below ISKI's overall average cost). The incentive for indus-
trial customers to develop private wells and avoid the basic rate of TL
1,050/m3 is limited by ISKI's charge of Tl 525/m3 on private well water.
Most commercial customers have no private well option because of location and
other limitations. The first block rate for households (TL 225/m3 for 0 to
7.5 m3/month) provides affordable service to lowest income customers
(para. 7.08).
Financial Reportin,
6.14     ISKI agreed in the Loan Negotiations to provide to the Bank semi-
annual financial reports. The reports are to forecast and identify as early
as possible significant variations from planned expenditures and financial
performance objectives so that appropriate action may be taken. The reports
are to be provided at the same times as the reports on project implementation
(para. 5.31).
VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND RISKS
Benefits
1.01     Sewerage and sewage treatment account for the major part of the
investment under the Project. An additional 2.3 million people would be
served by the end of 1994, and facilities for appropriate disposal of most of
Istanbul's sewage would be obtained.
7.02     Reduction of pollution in the Bosphorus and Sea of Marmara would be a
major benefit. Without the Project, environmental conditions would continue
to deteriorate in many parts of the city, especially along its shorelines, and
recreational uses of the Sea of Marmara would be substantially reduced.
Pollution reduction in the Bosphorus and Sea of Marmara would increase land
values along the shoreline and promote Greater development of tourism and
recreation.
7.03     Deferral of the Project would necessitate continued use of septic
tanks and cesspits in densely populated areas. These combined with inadequate
water distribution networks increase the risk of sewage leakage into the water
system. Replacement of septic tanks with sewerage systems would, therefore,
reduce risks to health. Without the Project, the incidence of waterborne
diseases would be likely to increase; with it, there should be a reduction.
7.04     The Project's network rehabilitation would improve the water supply
for inhabitants of the city's Asian section who at present are experiencing



- 31 -
intermittent supply and low water pressure. Also, the Project would improve
water supply to industrial and commercial customers, thereby increasing their
productivity. An additional benefit would be a water saving estimated to be
130,000 m3 per day by 1994 from reductions in unaccounted-for water.
Rate of Retur
7.05     The benefits of the proposed project cannot be practically separated
from those of ISKI's other 1987-94 investments. A rate of return assessment
of a combination of the proposed project and other 1987-94 investments of ISKI
has, therefore, been made.
7.06     Because quantification of all of the benefits of the investment pro-
gram is not practical, incremental sales resulting from the program have been
taken as a minimum indicator of benefits for the rate of return calculation.
About 2.1 million persons not now served would be provided with water as a
result of the program, and annual sales by 1994 would be 213 million m3 per
year higher than the 1986 level. The program's full benefits would be real-
ized in 1997 when the Isakoy Reservoir would be used to full capacity. At
that point, annual sales would be 300 million m3 per year above the 1986
level. An additional 3.0 million people would be provided with water, and 3.5
million with sewerage (Annexes 3 and 4). Incremental revenue and incremental
capital and operating costs, are indicated in Annex 15 in January 1987 prices,
including physical contingencies. The sales are calculated at current tariffs
in January 1987 prices. Based on these assumptions, the internal financial
rate of return is 13.6%, which is satisfactory. The program's long run aver-
age incremental cost of water and sewerage with annual discounting of 10 is
estimated at TL 492/m3, compared to the tariff average of TL 510 per m3.
7.07     The additional benefits which would be taken into account to calcu-
late the program's internal economic rate of return include: (i) property
value increases which would result from the program's improvements in the
environment and (ii) most of the consequences of health improvements (reduc-
tions in healthcare expenditures, and increases in worker productivity). The
value of these additional benefits is significant but difficult to quantify.
Affordability of Services
7.08     Average monthly disposable household income in Istanbul is currently
estimated at TL 170,000.-' It is expected to grow at about 2% p.a.&'in
real terms through the project period, and would, therefore, be equivalent to
about TL 195,000 in 1994 in 1987 prices. Assuming average monthly household
water consumption in 1994 of approximately 16.8 m3,O' the average monthly
1/    This figure based on the household expenditure survey conducted in late
1978. At that time the average household income was TL 14,300. It is
assumed to have increased by a factor of 12 since then. Wages increased
by a factor 10.9 to late 1986, and an additional 10% has been added to
account for inflation during 1987.
-'    This is a reasonable assumption given GDP growth of 5% per annum and
population growth of 2.52 per annum.
Domestic consumption of 144 l/c/d; average household size 3.9.



- 32 -
household expenditure on water and sewerage would be TL 6,575 (TL 5,870 at
current tariffs plus VAT), about 3.4S of household income. The most
recent estimate of the 'absolute poverty' income level in Istanbul is US$340
per capita per year (1987 TL280,000). Based on the 1978 household expenditure
survey, approximately 18% of the population of Istanbul are living at or below
the poverty level, with a median monthly disposable household income of
approximately TL 60,900.-'  Assuming that these lower income households con-
sume an average of 8.5 m3 per month, their average monthly expenditure on
water and sewerage would be TL 3,100 (TL 2,800 excluding VAT), 2.71 of the
average monthly income.
Poverty Impact
7.09     A total of 2.1 million people would receive piped water, and 2.3 mil-
lion people sewerage under the overall investment program. Household connec-
tions would be provided to 275,000 people who are today without piped water.
Of these, it may be assumed that virtually all would have incomes below the
poverty threshold, given the present relatively high proportion of people
already served (892). Similarly, sewerage would be provided to nearly 1 mil-
lion people presently without the service. Of these, it is estimated that
about two-thirds, or 660,000 people, would be in the lowest income group.
7.10     The great majority of new water connections, however, and nearly half
of the new sewerage connections, would be provided to maintain service levels
for the added population of the city, expected to be about 2.1 million over
the project period. Of these, about 1.8 million people would be provided with
water and 1.4 million with sewerage. It is estimated that about one-third of
these beneficiaries, ' or 600,000 people receiving water and 460,000 people
receiving sewerage, would have income below the poverty threshold.
7.11     In summary, about 431 of those receiving wate. supply (875,000
people), and 50% of those receiving sewerage (1.1 million people) would have
incomes below the poverty threshold.
Environnental Impact
7.12     The environmental impact of the Project would be positive.  As
mentioned above, pollution would be substantially reduced in the upper levels
of the Bosphorus and in the Sea of Marmara.
7.13     The Project includes treatment facilities for approximately 801 of
the sewage now being discharged into the Sea of Marmara. Some of the facili-
ties are secondary treatment plants, which are for sewage which is to continue
being disposed of in the sea of Marmara. The other facilities are to
No increase in real incomes of the poor is assumed over the project
period given that many of the poor will be new arrivals from rural areas.
On the assumption that half the population increase is made up of natural
increase, with income distribution representing that of Istanbul (181
poor), and half of immigrants, mostly from rural areas, of whom 50% would
be poor, at least in the initial years.



- 33 -
provide preliminary treatment (removal of grit and floatables) before dis-
charge into the bottom current of the Bosphorus. The effluent there would be
diluted and transported to the Black Sea. Once in the Black Sea, it would be
further diluted and treated naturally (Annex 2). This method is considered
satisfactory given: (i) the expected dilution in the Bosphorus (in the order
of 1,000 times on average); and (ii) that ISKI has an effective industrial
waste program to control the discharge of toxic substances. Disposal of
Istanbul's sewage to the Bosphorus bottom current was proposed by the DAMOC
master plan study in 1971 and confirmed as technically feasible and environ-
mentally sound by the Camp-Tek-Ser master plan update in 1975. The two con-
sulting firms now implementing the program also have confirmed the feasibility
of the method. Secondary treatment of all sewage would provide low marginal
benefit at high marginal cost. In addition, the acquisition of land areas
needed for secondary treatment plants would be difficult and require resettle-
ment of a large number of persons.
Risks
7.14     There is a risk that because of change in the the Bosphorus current,
some sewage might flow into the Sea of Marmara rather than into the Black
Sea. This risk is not considered to be a significant one because of: (i) the
rarity and brevity of flow stoppage of the bottom current; (ii) the degree of
dilution obtained in the Bosphorus; and (iii) the assimilative capacity of the
Sea of Marmara, which, while insufficient for the continual loading of the
entire city's sewage experienced today, is adequate to receive and treat
naturally the small fraction, if any at all, which might arrive on a rare
occasion in the future.
7.15     The Technical University of Istanbul monitors the water quality of
the Black Sea, Bosphorus, and Sea of Marmara under contract to ISKI, and ISKI
recently extended the contract to December 1991. ISKI and the Government give
high priority to pollution abatement in the waters surrounding Istanbul, and
%ould be expected to take further measures if-.he monitoring program should
indicate that the solution being implemented is not fully satisfactory.
7.16     The Project also has financial risks, principally possibilities of
failure to adjust tariffs upward with inflation, and of cost overruns in pro-
gram implementation. These risks are minimal because of the organizational
and financial strength of ISKI, and the economic strength of Istanbul.
Sensitivity tests were carried out to estimate the return of the project under
less favorable assumptions. If capital costs should increase by 10%, the IRR
would be reduced from 13.61 to 12.1%. If operating costs should increase by
101, it would be 13.41. If revenue should be 101 lower than expected, it
would be 11.61.
VIIL AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     ISKI agreed during the Loan Negotiations that it would:
(a)    establish and carry out a program of collection from custome,rs
in arrears to reduce ISKI's accounts receivable to the equiva-
lent of no more than five months of current billings by



- 34 -
the end of March 1988, four months by the end of June 1988,
three months by the end of September 1988, and two months by the
end of December 1988 (para. 3.12);
(b)    submit to the Bank by the end of February each year for review
and comment a report on the status of the ISKI investment pro-
gram, including up to date plans and current accomplishments
(para. 4.15);
(c)    generate funds from charges to customers so that annual self-
financing by ISKI would cover: (i) all expenditures during the
year for the Project which are not covered by the proposed loan,
plus (ii) not less than 45% of ISKI's other capital expenditures
during the year (para. 6.09);
(d)    consult in advance with the Bank with respect to future long
term borrowings if these aggregate to more than US$5 million
equivalent in any year (para. 6.10); and
(e)    obtain the agreement of the Bank priur to contracting any long-
term dett in excess of the total amount of US$250 million equi-
valent until the completion of the Project (para. 6.10).
8.02     In addition, ISKI agreed during the Loan Negotiations on standard
requirements for: progress reports on the Project (para. 5.31); annual audits
(para. 3.10); financial reporting to the Bank (para. 6.14); administration of
a Special Account (para. 5.29); use of Statements of Expenditures
(para. 5.28); preparation of a Project Completion Report (para. 5.31); and
prequalification of bidders for civil works (para. 5.20).
8.03     With the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project would
be suitable for a Bank loan of US$218.0 million equivalent to the Istanbul
Water Supply and Sewerage General Directorate for a period of 17 years,
including four years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.

Black Sea Disposal of Sewage
1.       Istanbul is located on the Bosphorus end of the Turkish Straits,
which extend approximately 300 km from the Aegean Sea through the Dardanelles
(60 km), Sea of Marmara (210 km) and the Bosphorus (31 Km) to the Black Sea.
There is a two-layer current system in the Straits, resulting from the
difference in salinity between the less saline and therefore lighter Black Sea
water and the more saline and therefore heavier Aegean oater.
2.       The surface flow in the Straits is from the Black Sea to the Aegean.
At lower levels, however, a "bottom" current of more saline water flows from
the Aegean to the bottom portion of the Black Sea. This portion of the Black
Sea has been anerobic for centuries, and presently amounts to 88% of the Sea's
total volume.
3.       The two currents are most pronounced in the narrowest sections of the
Bocphorus where the velocity averages 1.0 m/sec in the upper current and 1.5
m/sec in the lower current.  Flow rates average 12,600 m3/sec in the upper
current and 6,100 m3/sec in the lower current.
4.       Studies indicate that sewage discharged to the Bosphorus bottom
current will be transported to the bottom portion of the Black Sea, where it
will be treated through natural processes. Sewage disposed of in this manner
would require only preliminary treatment to remove grit and floatables.
5.       Although the two-layer current exists in the Sea of Marmara, it moves
very slowly there and is not sufficiently defined to be used for sewage
disposal. Treatment plants serving drainage basins bordering the Sea of
Marmara, therefore, have been designed for secondary level treatment.
6.       The sewe-age master plan for Istanbul includes 18 sewage treatment
plants. Seven plants are close enough to the Bosphorus to take advantage of
its bottom current for effluent disposal and will, therefore, provide
preliminary treatment only. Eleven other plants will discharge to the Sea of
Marmara, and will be designed to provide secondary treatment. Plants
providing preliminary treatment would treat 60% of the expected sewage flow in
1995, and 50% in the year 2000.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ISTANBUL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
ISKI Investment Program
Background
1.       The original basis for ISKI's investment program is the 1971
DAMOC't master plan report. The program has undergone modifications since
1971 in later planning and final design studies i', but the main principles
and features of the DAMOC recommendations are still being followed. After 15
years, the only significant changes have been in the growth and location of
the demand for services; i.e., the current population size served by ISKI was
not expected to be reached until the year 2000, according to the DAMOC report.
Implementation Period
2.       The implementation period addressed in the appraisal is 1987-94.
Included in the program presented, however, are works already under
construction, and works started near the end of the period which would require
additional time to complete.
Water SUPP1Y
3.       The water supply part of the program would correct existing service
deficiencies and provide productioi capacity to meet the vrojected demand fqr
1997.  Although the city's water supply'coverage is high '89% of the
population is presently served), the quality of the service is poor because of
insufficient source capacity and undersize distribution pipes.
4.       The development of new surface water sources has been influenced
greatly by the division of the city by the Bosphorus. ISKI's current strategy
is to develop sources on both sides of the Bosphorus, the European side and
the Asian side, to meet the demand of each side in order to minimize the need
for costly Bosphorus crossings. This strategy will be increasingly difficult
to follow in the future because most of the identified future sources are
located on the Asian side. The first crossing of the Bosphorus consisting of
two 1.0 meter pipes was constructed in 1982. A second crossing consisting of
a third pipe paralleling the first two is in the investment program.

Angeles, CA and including Alvard Burdick and Howson, Chicago, Ill;

5.       The program includes the development of three new sources.  Two of
them, the Buyukcekmece Dam and Reservoir and the Darlik Dam and Reservoir and
three associated treatment plants now under construction will increase average
supply capacity from 1.1 to 1.6 million m3/day. The Buyukcekmece Reservoir
and Treatment Plant to the west of Istanbul is now almost completed, and is
expected to begin operation in early 1988. The Darlik Reservoir, 70
kilometers to the east, should be completed by 1988. The Isakoy Reservoir,
the third source, is currently in the preliminary design stage. The Isakoy
Reservoir is 16 km east of Darlik, and will increase the average supply
capacity by 0.6 million m3/year. The Buyukeekmece Treatment Plant will have
a capacity of 0.3 million m3/day, and will treat only Buyukeelkmece Reservoir
water. Water from the Darlik and Isakoy Reservoirs would be conveyed by pipe
to the Omerli treatment plant complex, whose capacity will be expanded to
treat the additional water. A 0.2 million m3/day expansion of the Omerli I
Plant is being designed, and should be constructed by 1988. An additional
plant, Omerli III, sized for 1.0 million m3/day, is planned for completion
by 1991. Production capacities will thus total 2.2 million m3/day by 1994,
compared with projected requirements of 1.9 million m3/day by 1994 and 2.5
million m3/day by the year 2000 (see Figure A5.1). The long-term
development of water sources for the Istanbul area is currently under study,
and a revised master plan prepared with the assistance of a consulting firm,
is scheduled to be completed in early 1988.
6.       Substantial improvements to the distribution system are also included
in the program. Additional transmission capacity from the Omerli water
treatment plants would carry water from the Darlik and Isakoy Reservoirs.
Expansion of the distribution system would provide 285,000 new connections
between 1987-1994. A network rehabilitation program would improve service to
existing customers by increasing system pressure and reducing leakage. A
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system would centralize and
automate the operation of pumping stations and control valves, transmit real
time data on the status of the system for central display and analysis, and
store data useful for maintenance of the system. All proposed expansions of
transmission and distribution capabilities are being reviewed by consultants
to ISKI as part of the water master plan revision study.
Sewerage
7.       The sewerage part of the program has two main objectives:
(i) rehabilitation of local streams, and (ii) pollution elimination/prevention
in the Golden Horn, the Sea of Marmara, and the Bosphorus. Stream
rehabilitation is needed because many existing street sewers and collectors
discharge to the nearest stream or drairnage channel. The rehabilitation
includes channel improvement works and the construction of parallel

Page 3 of 5
collectors. The pollution prevention program consists of 15 treatment plants
and associated interceptors, giving priority to improving water quality in the
Golden Horn first, the Sea of Marmara second, and the Bosphorus third.
Progress in meeting the sewerage program objectives has been slow. Since the
program's inception in 1980, 40 km out of a total stream length of 450 km have
been rehabilitated, and designs have been completed for four of the 15 sewage
treatment plants. Significant benefits are expected from these initial works,
however, because they are located in the three most populous and
industrialized drainage zones, Yenikapi, Kabatas and Uskudar, and will arhieve
the first priority objective of the program, pollution prevention in the
Golden Horn.
8.       Completion of the program's remaining eleven treatment plants, the
stream rehabilitation program, 330,000 new connections, and 2,000 km of street
sewers and collectors, would eliminate pollution of the area's waters, and
would Increase service levels from 552 to 681.
Status of Progam FPreparation
9.       Preparation of most components of the program is well advanced.
Components representing 20% of the total cost of the program are already under
construction, and components representing another 50S are being designed.
Distribution components representing 20% of program cost are the least
prepared. Components representing the remaining 101 of the program cost are
being prepared by ISKI's own engineering staff, and are in various stages of
preparation.
Cost
10.      The estimated cost of the program in current prices is US$2.7 billion
equivalent, including expenditures already made on components of the program
which began before 1987. A breakdown of the program's cost by component is
presented in Table A5.1.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ISTANBUL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Proiect Cost Estimates
1.       Summary cost estimates by expenditure category, year and financing
source are included in Tables A6.1 through A6.4 of this Annex.  Detailed
estimates are included in the Project File.  All cost estimates were prepared
using January 1987 prices and an exchange rate of TL 758 to 1.  The base costs
are presented in average 1987 prices, updated to account for inflation and  an
exchange rate of TL 840 to 1.
2.       Bid prices have been used where available.  The civil works cost
estimates are based on preliminary quantity estimates and unit prices of
similar work in Turkey and other countries in the Region. Pipe, equipment,
and material costs are based on supplier quotations. Land costs are based on
recent sales data obtained from the Municipality for similar types of land.
3.       The cost of consultants for design, construction supervision, and
technical assistance are based on man-month estimates and rates charged by
foreign and local consultants in Turkey. Local staff costs are based on
man-month estimates and current salaries paid by ISKI.
4.       A 12Z value added tax on all goods and services is reflected in the
local cost component of the affected components. Import duties are not
included since ISKI has obtained an exemption from the SPO for all projects in
its investment program.
5.       Physical contingencies are 0 percent for consultants, staff salaries
and land and 10 percent for equipments materials and civil works. Price
contingency factors and factors for updating base costs estimates assume
c2nstant purchasing parity exchange rates and the following inflation rates:
