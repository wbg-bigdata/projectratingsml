MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT OF THE
ISTANBUL MtUNICIPALITY IN THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.       The following report on a proposed loan of US$218.0 million
equivalent to the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage General Directorate,
ISKI, is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for a term of
seventeen years, including four years grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, and would help finance a water supply and sewerage project.
2.       Background.  The proposed project will serve the Istanbul
Metropolitan Municipality, Turkey's largest in population, area, and economic
activity. The population in 1986 was 5.7 million, growing at 4.3% per year,
and the area inside the municipal boundaries was 600 sq. km., of which about
60 percent was developed. An estimated 60 percent of the Country's industrial
capacity is located in the area. The City is of unique historic interest, and
it is a major tourist and commercial center, and the Country's principal port.
3.       The City is divided by the Bosphorus, a strait 30 km long aid one to
eight km wide separating Asia from Europe and linking the Black Set with the
Sea of Marmara, which in turn leads to the Dardanelles, the Aegean Sea, and
the Mediterranean. The European side of the City is divided by a narrow inlet
known as the Golden Horn. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Golden
Horn have provided convenient means for disposal of the City's wastewater,
which has been and is discharged untreated causing extreme pollution.
4.       The water supply system at year-end 1986 had 835,000 water connec-
tions in the area serving 5.1 million people, or 89 percent of the area popu-
lation, but not all of these people were adequately served. This is because
the water distribution system in many places is antiquated and in need of
rehabilitation. There are insufficient pressure and intermittent supply to
areas of higher elevation and to fringe areas of the City, caused by a growing
lack of production capacity and increasing losses, and aggravated in some
areas by undersize pipas. Also, the water treatment capacity is deficient,
and -water shortages during periods of maximum demand will persist until new
treatment works have been designed and constructed.
5.       The sewerage system serves only 55% of the population, and in marny
areas consists only of street sewers that discharge to the nearest water
course. The remainder of the population have latrines, septic tanks, or
cesspits, many of which are inappropriate because they are in areas of high
population density. There are no treatment plants in the system, and as
mentioned above, pollution of Istanbul's water courses is extreme.
6.       ISKI already is constructing works, including the sewerage project
financed by Loan 2159-TU, which address parts of these problems. The bulk of
Lhe City's needs in the sector would, however, be filled through additional



- 2 -
investments, of which the proposed project would account for approximately one
fourth during the planned project period, 1987-94. The large scale of the
need has created unprecedented financial and administrative burdens. This in
turn has called for a new Government strategy for the City's water supply and
sewerage sector. Since the needs are widespread in urban areas throughout the
Country, and not confined to Istanbul, the Government has established the
strategy: (i) to begin shifting responsibilities for sector development from
Central Government agercies to municipalities; (ii) to create separate, auton-
omous municipal authorities; and (iii) to improve cost recovery and reduce
local financial dependence on Central Government resources. The strategy is
proving to be highly successful in Istanbul, as evidenced by ISKI's recently
developed administrative and financial strengths, which enable it to undertake
such an ambitious program.
7.         Project Objectives.  The objectives of the Project are: (a) to
improve and extend sewerage service to 70% of the population of Istanbul by
the end of 1994; (b) to provide for appropriate disposal of sewage to protect
the waters and shorelines of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus; (c) to
reduce unaccounted-for water; (d) to strengthen ISKI's operation and
maintenance and industrial waste management capabilities.
8.         Project Description.  The Project, to be carried out during
1987-94, would help to provide ISKI with facilities to continue the pollution
abatement program started under Loan 2159-TU, to reduce water shortages, and
to operate its systems more efficiently. Each investment of the 1987-94
program projected for ISKI, of which the Project forms a part, has been
reviewed by the appraisal mission and found to be feasible and sound, with all
major components providing the least cost solution for the problems
addressed. The principal components of the Project would be: a telemetered
and computerized system for water supply monitoring and control; a program to
reduce unaccounted-for water; rehabilitation of a part of the water distri-
bution network; construction of sewage collection, preliminary treatment, and
marine disposal facilities '-or five drainage zones of the city; installation
of 330,000 customer sewerage connections; training in operations, maintenance,
and industiial waste management; and acquisition of operation and maintenance
vehicles and equipment, including equipment for the detection and repair of
leaks.
9.         The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$569.9 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$241.4 million equivalent
(42b). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Turkey are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps also are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6985-TU dated November 2, 1987 is being distributed
separately.
10.        Rationale for World Bank Involvement.  The proposed loan would
support the Government and Muncipality objectives of providing adequate water
and sewerage facilities and reducing pollution in the Bosphorous and Sea of



-3-
Marmara. The environment is increasingly a high priority concern in Bank
lending, and the proposed project would bring major environmental
improvement. The proposed loan also would follow the Bank's strategy to
continue to support the decentralization and cost recovery policies of the
Government for municipal organizations. Continued Bank assistance would
demonstrate our support of ISKI as the model for large-city water and sewerage
authorities in Turkey, which already is being emulated in connection with the
recently approved Bank project in Izmir. Finally, the proposed loan would
broadly support continued economic development in Istanbul through assisting
in the provision of essential infrastructure.
11.        Agreed Actions.   Agreements have been reached that ISKI would:
(a)  establish and implement a program of collection from customers in
arrears to reduce ISKI's accounts receivable by the end of 1988 to
the equivalent of no more than two months of current billings;
(b) submit to the Bank by the end of February each year for review and
comment a report on the status of the ISKI investment program,
including up-to-date plans and current accomplishments;
(c) generate funds from charges to customers so that annual self-
financing by ISKI would cover: (i) all expenditures during the year
for the Project which are not covered by the proposed loan, plus
(ii) not less than 45% of ISKI's other capital expenditures during
the year;
(d) consult in advance with the Bank with respect to future long term
borrowings if these aggregate to more than US$5 million equivalent in
any year; and
(e) obtain the agreement of the Bank prior to contracting any long term
debt in excess of the total amount of US$250 million equivalent until
the completion of the Project.
12.      Justification.  As a result of the proposed project, an additional
2.3 million people would have sewerage service by the end of 1994, and
facilities for appropriate disposal of most of Istanbul's sewage would be
obtained. The Project would improve the water supply for inhabitants of the
City's Asian section who at present are experiencing intermittent supply and
low water pressure. Also, the Project would improve water supply to
industrial and commercial customers, thereby increasing their productivity.
An additional benefit would be a water saving estimated to be 130,000 m3 per
day by 1994 from reductions in unaccounted-for water. Deferral of the Project
would require continued use of septic tanks and cesspits in densely populated
areas. This combined with inadequate water distribution networks would
increase the risk of sewage leakage into the water system. Replacement of
septic tanks and cesspits with sewerage systems would, therefore, reduce risks
to health. Without the Project, the incidence of waterborne diseases would be
likely to increase; with it, there should be a decrease. Reduction of
pollution in the Bosphorus and Sea of Marmara would be a futher major
benefit. Without the Project, environmental conditions would continue to
deteriorate in many parts of the City, especially along its shorelines, and
recreational uses of the Sea of Marmara would be substantially reduced.



- 4 -
Pollution reduction in the Bosphorus and Sea of Marmara would increase land
values along the shoreline and promote greater development of recreation and
tourism.
13.      The Project's affordability is assured by the exist.ig tariffs
established by ISKI at the beginning of 1987. These tariffs approximate, on
average, the incremental cost of water and sewerage under the projected
investment program, and in the future need only be adjusted for iniflation to
maintain their value in real terms. At this level, charges for household
consumption average less than 42 of disposable income of households overall,
and less than 3% for households in the "absolute poverty" range.
14.      Risks. The Project has financial and environmental risks.  The
financial risks include possible failure to adjust tariffs upward with
inflation, and cost overruns in program implementation. The financial risks
are minimal because of the organizational and financial strength of ISKI, and
the economic strength of Istanbul. The environmental risk is the possibility
that the Black Sea disposal method selected for part of the city's sewage
might prove not to be fully satisfactory. The method consists of preliminary
treatment of the sewage (removal of grit and floatables), and discharge of the
effluent to the bottom current of the Bosphorus, which flows to the Black
Sea. The effluent would be diluted and carried by he current to the Black
Sea where it (i) would be further diluted and dispersed, and (ii) would under-
go natural treatment. The risk is that on occasion, because of change in the
Bosphorus current, some sewage might flow into the Sea of Marmara rather than
into the Black Sea. This risk is not considered to be a significant one
because of: (i) the rarity and brevity of flow stoppage of the bottom current;
(ii) the degree of dilution obtained in the Bosphorus; and (iii) the assimi-
lative capacity of the Sea of Marmara, which, while insufficient for the
continual loading of the entire city's sewage experienced today, would be able
to receive and treat naturally the small fraction, if any at all, which migh-
arrive on a rare occasion in the future.
15.      ISKI has in place a monitoring program to detect changes in water
quality resulting from the program. ISKI and the Government give high
priority to pollution abatement in the waters surrounding Istanbul, and would
be expected to take further measures if the monitoring program should indicate
that the method being implemented is not fully satisfactory.
16.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
