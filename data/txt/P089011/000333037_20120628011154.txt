     BRAZIL MUNICIPAL LENDING PROGRAM I: UBERABA ?GUA VIVA
                            PROJECT
                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper responds to the request of the Municipality of Uberaba
to amend the Loan Agreement for the Uberaba Agua Viva Project (7437-BR) to
encompass the following changes: (i) application of the Bank’s safeguard policy OP 4.12
on Involuntary Resettlement linked to land acquisition activities, with no relocation of
people nor displacement of economic activities; (ii) reduction in scope, specifically
related to water supply activities under Component 1 and a change in the name of the
Park under Component 2; (iii) revision of the results framework to reflect the proposed
reduced scope and to refine targets to the actual project’s expected results; (iv) increase in
the Project’s total cost through an increase of counterpart funds; (v) minor reallocation of
funds between categories; and (vi) updating of the Financial Management reporting
instrument for the project. In addition, this paper corrects a typing error on the safeguard
table of the original project documents in which the box related to the safeguard policy
OP 4.37 on Safety of Dams was not checked, despite the fact that the policy itself was
triggered during project appraisal and indicated as such in the Project documentation (the
datasheet (page 47) and safeguard table (page 68) on the Uberaba Project Appraisal
Document); in addition, its implementation is underway.

2.      A new Bank Safeguard policy is being triggered by the Project, OP 4.12
Involuntary Resettlement. Small scale land acquisition of 18 land lots (total of 66.30 ha
of land) occurred during implementation of components 1 and 2 of the Project, with the
large majority of these acquisitions carried out on a voluntary/amicable basis. Except for
2 cases under negotiation (which started in 2001, long before project preparation), for
which a value has been agreed upon and the form of payment is being negotiated2, all
others have been resolved and paid. Neither the relocation of people nor the
displacement of economic activities took place. An evaluation report of all such land
acquisitions (a retroactive involuntary Resettlement Action Plan - RAP) was developed
by the Municipality and assessed by the Bank that found it in compliance with the Bank’s
safeguard requirements. The Municipality also developed an involuntary Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) to be used in case any resettlement might be needed until
project completion (at this stage, no additional land acquisition or resettlement is
expected).

3.     The Project has three components: (1) Environmental Sanitation includes
improvements to wastewater collection and treatment, urban drainage and water supply
systems; (2) Environmental and Cultural Preservation and Recovery includes actions
aimed at improving quality of life by providing new recreational opportunities,
preserving natural resources, in particular the city's main drinking water source and
expanding the research and tourist opportunities associated with the municipality's rich

 The property has liens of significant value against it, and the owner so far has not agreed to payment in
form of settlement of these liens.
                                                      6
fossil deposits and the research center that supports them; and (3) Planning and
Management aims at improving the capacity of municipal government entities, by
supporting actions directly related to the project's core components, and are therefore
focused on the environment, planning and project management.

4.      The cost of the original project, as indicated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) cost table, was estimated at US$28.78 million. With the addition of counterpart-
financed activities in the amount of US$13.27 million that were originally described as
part of the project yet were not reflected in the project’s PAD costs,3 the total original
cost of the Project would amount to US$42.05 million.

5.      The Borrower’s primary reason for requesting a restructuring of the Project is to
better align the activities envisioned within the scope of the Project to the amount of
available funding and to its timeframe. A misalignment had taken place, caused by three
factors:

a. the Brazilian Real (BRL) has appreciated significantly against the United States Dollar
   since Project preparation, going from BRL 2.14 for 1 USD, to the current exchange
   rate of BRL 1.74 (a 23 percent increase);
b. the actual cost of Project original activities, specifically works, proved to be
   significantly higher than the estimated costs after the detailed engineering designs
   were prepared; and
c. a significant increase (39 percent for the period) of construction costs in Brazil, due to
   specific circumstances of high demand caused by economic growth, including public
   and private investments in infrastructure, housing and other civil construction
   activities, as well as the effect of federal infrastructure investments in the last couple
   of years, specially through the Federal Government’s Growth Acceleration Program
   (PAC).
6.      As a result of the above-mentioned three factors, the total costs linked to the
project activities increased from the original estimate of US$42.05 million to US$77.34
million (84 percent increase). Although the municipality was eventually able to increase
its counterpart financing share with Federal Government resources, the available
implementation timeframe and resources remain insufficient to carry out all of the
planned activities and achieve the expected results and impacts by the Project’s closing
date. Consequently, in the face of a near doubling of the total project costs within the
same implementation timeframe, some reduction in scope became necessary under the
Project’s Environmental Sanitation Component. Such reduction does not, however,
require or entail changes to the original project development objectives.


B. PROJECT STATUS

7.    The Project was approved by the Board on March 21, 2007 for the amount of
US$17.27 million. The Loan Agreement was signed on May 19, 2008, and became

3
 Wastewater related-works (Conquistinha and Uberaba wastewater conveyance systems and Treatment
Plants) and the Leopoldino Retention Pool.
                                                7
effective on July 30, 2008, with a closing date of December 31, 2012. Since
effectiveness, Project implementation has progressed satisfactorily. The progress towards
its development objectives has similarly been satisfactory. The Project Implementation
Unit is established and well staffed with trained professionals. Approximately 95 percent
of the loan amount has been disbursed and 99 percent of loan funds have been contracted.
Disbursements have increased rapidly as the main works financed with loan funds to
build the sewerage system in the central urban area of Uberaba are progressing well.
Although some of the ongoing works are planned to be completed by June 2013, it is
expected that the World Bank loan resources will be fully disbursed by December 2012.

8.      Implementation of activities funded with 100 percent counterpart funds is
progressing satisfactorily. Out of the total original counterpart resources allocated to the
Project, US$11.51 million, the Municipality was able to scale it up to US$60.07 million
and up until December 2011 had executed US$31.43 million (nearly three times the
originally indicated amount).

9.      The counterpart resources to complete the ongoing works are secured from the
PAC and the Municipal water and sanitation utility (CODAU), which will finance the
execution of the Conquistinha wastewater treatment plant, macro drainage works in the
main drainage basin in the urban center and micro-drainage in critical micro basins. All
these activities are ongoing and expected to be concluded by June 2013.

10.      During Project preparation and implementation, the Municipality has built its
capacity to develop good project designs and proposals. Its commitment to addressing its
water, sanitation and drainage issues compelled them to mobilize financing from other
sources, especially the PAC. As a result, it was capable of leveraging more resources to
fund activities originally planned under the Project, in addition to other activities beyond
the scope of the project. These activities include, among others, building a new water
treatment plant (WTP), rehabilitating of two older WTPs; building a water transfer line
from the Claro River to the WTP; as well as complementary macro drainage works for a
total of US$90 million.

11.   Under the Environmental Sanitation component all of the major works are
underway and a number of them have been concluded already:

a. Sewerage subcomponent: (i) engineering designs for subcomponent’s activities,
   Uberaba wastewater conveyance system and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
   and wastewater conveyance system to the Conquistinha WWTP have been
   concluded; (ii) the Conquistinha WWTP is 20 percent concluded, expected to be
   finished by June 2013; and (iii) out of the 26 km of wastewater interceptors 74
   percent have been concluded, and works are expected to be finalized by June 2013;
b. Drainage subcomponent: (i) engineering designs for all subcomponent’s activities,
   Leopoldino retention pool and its urbanization have been finalized; (ii) macro
   drainage works in the urban center is ongoing and is expected to conclude by June
   2013; (iii) micro drainage works in six key micro basins are 20 percent completed,
   and expected to be finalized by December 2012; (iv) a system of flood control and
   alert will be purchased for the Leopoldino retention pool, once the current system
   proposal is evaluated by dam safety experts, this system is expected to be purchased

                                             8
   and installed by December 2012; and (v) engineering designs for micro drainage in
   key critical areas is being prepared and will be finalized by December 2012;
c. Water supply subcomponent: (i) engineering designs for subcomponent’s activities,
   update of the technical water system cadastre; rehabilitation of three critical water
   pipelines; and minor rehabilitation of water treatment plants were all concluded; (ii)
   replacement of 74 percent of 91 thousand micrometers is ongoing. The following
   activities originally planned will need extra resources and time to be concluded and as
   a result are being removed from the project scope: (i) regularization of the flow of the
   Uberaba river through the transfer of water from the Claro river (engineering designs
   are being prepared); (ii) the automation of the water system (bidding process
   ongoing); (iii) the rehabilitation of two WTPs (works have initiated and expected to
   be concluded by June 2014); and (iv) modernization of CODAU’s commercial
   operations (water loss control program still being developed).

12.     Under the Environmental and Cultural Preservation and Recovery component
(i) the urbanization of the Lajes stream and a business plan for the Live Fossil Project
have been concluded, (ii) monitoring of water resources is ongoing; and (iii) the
development of a management plan and the implementation of main recovery actions for
1,500 hectares in the Uberaba Environmental Protection Area (APA) will be carried out
by December 2012.

13.     Under the Planning and Management component (i) programs of environmental
education have been developed and are being used by the Municipality during ongoing
environmental training events and social communication activities with the population at
large and are considered as best practice by the Bank; (ii) the Secretary of Environment’s
capacity to start evaluating and issuing environmental licenses has been strengthened;
and (iii) capacity building activities to the Secretariats of Environment and Tourism,
Planning and Infrastructure have been implemented. This component is also financing
aspects related to project management.

14.     With regards to safeguards, the Project is progressing satisfactorily in compliance
with all policies triggered by the Project, including the OP 4.12 which is proposed to be
triggered by this restructuring.

15.    OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment - An Environmental Assessment Report
was prepared during Project preparation in compliance with the environmental policies of
the Bank, applicable to Category A projects. The mitigation measures of the project’s
negative impacts have been included in said report as part of the Environmental
Management Plan, and have been satisfactorily addressed during project implementation.

16.    Public consultations were held during the environmental licensing of the Project’s
components and during the preparation of the Project’s social assessment. They were
complemented by an additional public consultation during Project preparation, which
occurred on February 2, 2005, in which the Environmental Assessment Report was
presented and discussed. In addition, communication, information and environmental
education campaigns are continuously being carried out by the project with a solid
performance and high quality material produced.

17.     OP 4.04 Natural Habitats - The Safeguard Policy for Natural Habitat was
triggered because of the proposed interventions in the Uberaba river’s Environmental
Protection Area. During project implementation, OP 4.04 and licensing demands and
conditions have been addressed. The construction of the Linear Park of the Lajes’
stream, deemed a compensatory measure, is currently finalized. The selection process for
the preparation of the management plan is under way. Once the management plan is
prepared, the implementation of main recommended recovery actions for 1,500 hectares
in the environmentally protected area (APA) of the Uberaba River will be carried out.

18.     OP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources - The Physical Cultural Resources
Safeguard was triggered by the Agua Viva Project due to the fact that Uberaba is part of
one of the largest and more important paleontology sites in Brazil, with fossil records
dating from 65 to 80 million years. Although the interventions expected by the Project
are located in areas of non-potential occurrence of fossiliferous deposits, the Project
includes special procedures which have been adopted during the construction phase with
the support and supervision of a paleontology center. These procedures comprised in the
Environmental Manual of Construction and applied during project implementation
include foresee: (i) previous field inspection (before issuance of the notice to bid for the
works) of all expected interventions by a team from the Paleontological Center to
evaluate the possibility of sites’ occurrences and the measures to be adopted; (ii)
definition of the chance find procedures, including training of the contractor’s team,
provision of “what to do in the case of? booklets, etc. These procedures have been
followed during implementation with close supervision by the Bank.

19.     OP 4.37. Safety of Dams. The datasheet (page 47) and safeguard table (page 68)
on the Uberaba Project Appraisal Document (in the appraisal document of the Brazil
Municipal Lending - APL - Program) both show that OP 4.37 on Safety of Dams was
triggered as is the case; however, the corresponding box in the Appraisal Stage Integrated
Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS) was not checked due to a typing error. Implementation is
already underway. An assessment of the dam safety aspects has already been carried out
through a panel of experts during Project preparation, and its results were taken into
consideration to define project supported activities. In addition, a panel of experts has
already been contracted to provide support to key project activities regarding the
Leopoldino retention pool, as recommended in said assessment.

20.     OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. Project documents (PAD, Loan Agreement
and Environmental Assessment) indicated that land acquisition (to be paid with
counterpart funds) would take place to implement the works under Component 1.
Considering the small scale of this activity and that the large majority of the acquisitions
has been carried out on a voluntary/amicable basis (through land donation, land swaps
and purchase at mutually agreed market prices), the team documented the lands needed to
support project activities and vetted the process by which these lands had been acquired
until May 2005 and this was deemed at the time sufficient to comply with the
requirements of OP 4.12; as a result the policy was not formally triggered. During the
first years of project implementation, from July 2008 until December 2009, no major
change in land acquisition was notified by the Municipality.



                                            10
21.     In January 2010, as part of the Portfolio Review Exercise, the Bank carried out a
formal assessment of the land acquired by the project. OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
was triggered and the Municipality prepared a detailed assessment (a retroactive
involuntary Resettlement Action Plan - RAP) of all processes of land acquisition that
occurred as a result of the Project since preparation, as well as an involuntary
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to govern the possibility of further land
acquisition that may be needed in the course of project implementation4. The Bank also
provided hands-on support on social and involuntary resettlement issues to the Borrower.
The scheduled Project mid-term review in March 2010 served as an opportunity to carry
out a comprehensive review of the Project, which identified all necessary adjustments.

22.     Based on the outcomes of the mid-term review and implementation progress, the
Municipality finalized a comprehensive restructuring proposal, which was officially sent
to the Federal Government for approval in November 2010.                 New incoming
administrations at Federal and State levels coupled with the increased demands from the
State Governments led to a backlog in the clearance of new lending and restructuring
requests by the Federal Government inter-ministerial committee (COFIEX). As a result,
the restructuring package was only approved by the Federal Government in June 2011.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

23.     Project Components. Because of the impact of the BRL appreciation and the
increase in estimated costs and local construction costs in terms of doubling the volume
of counterpart funds under the projects within the same implementation timeframe, there
emerged the need to reduce the project scope. Most activities planned under the project
have been concluded or are underway with funds already secured. However, in the Water
Supply subcomponent, there are activities without funding available or which are
financed at 100 percent with counterpart funds but which are yet to be procured and/or
have their engineering designs still at the development stage. Considering the resource
and implementation time limitations, some water supply activities planned under the
Environmental Sanitation component therefore needed to be removed from the project
scope. These reductions impact Part A.3 (Water supply system) of the Project, where
Part A.3 (a) referring to the regularization of the flow of the Uberaba river by making
permanent the seasonal transfers of water from the Claro river to the Uberaba river,
which would be removed, as well as the portion of Part A.3 (b) referring to the
modernization of CODAU’s commercial operations and the automation of their water
supply system. Although seemingly substantial, the reduction in scope does not affect the
achievement of the PDO, as Project activities already concluded or underway (e.g.
rehabilitation of pipelines and water treatment plants, replacement of micrometers and
development of users water system cadastre) have already contributed to the
improvement in the delivery of water services. The city has not been impacted by water
scarcity and the Uberaba river flow has been maintained at the environmentally required
level.

4
 The IRPF also indicates the agreed actions and timeline to identify the need for a Process Framework, in
case any involuntary restriction of access is needed as a result of the preparation of the management plan
for a portion of the Uberaba APA.
                                                    11
24.    In addition, the restructuring is an opportunity to correct the name of the park
from “Parque da Cidade? to “Parque das Lajes?.

25.     Project Results/indicators. This restructuring paper proposes few modifications
to the results framework, which do not impact the achievement of the Project’s
Development Objectives. These revisions will streamline the indicators and contribute to
a better and more realistic monitoring of the project’s achievements and impacts.

 o PDO Indicator:
       o Merged the two PDO indicators related to the water quality of the Uberaba
          River into one, which avoided repetition and added simplification without
          any impact on the ability to measure and reflect the Project’s outcomes;
       o Readjusted said indicator to focus only on the Uberaba River, removing
          the Conquistinha stream from the indicator, as improvements of water
          quality resulting from the construction of the Conquistinha wastewater
          conveyance system and WWTP can only be verified by end of 2013 (6
          months after the end of construction of these structures). In return and as
          an adjustment, a new intermediate results indicator was added to measure
          the impacts of these interventions in the volume of wastewater treated;
       o Changed the target on water quality classification to Class III, as recent
          more precise measurements show that the current water quality
          classification of the Uberaba River is Class V (worse than what was
          measured at appraisal). This would maintain the same level of incremental
          improvement that the Project set out to achieve from the onset.

 o Intermediate Results:
        o Added an indicator to component 1 that measures the share of the
           collected wastewater that is now treated as a result of project
           interventions.
        o Added an indicator to component 2 that measures the elaboration of a
           management plan and implementation of main recovery actions for 1,500
           hectares in the environmental protection area of the Uberaba River;
        o Revised the indicator on “loss of treated water? to decrease the anticipated
           target from 20 percent to a more realistic 36 percent. The initial target
           was too ambitious for the type of activities that are being supported by the
           project, as well its timeframe and resources allocated. For instance,
           SABESP, Sao Paulo State’s water supply and sanitation company and one
           of Brazil’s most sophisticated utilities, has been implementing a water loss
           reduction program since 2008 that is investing a total of BRL 2.7 billions
           (approximately USD 1.56 billions) to reduce in a 10 year period their
           water loss percentage by 16.4 (from 29.5 percent in 2008 to 13.1 percent
           in 2018). Comparing this to the Project’s reality indicates that the target
           set during Project preparation to reduce the water loss percentage from 38
           to 20 percent in a 5 year period with an original investment of USD 4.35
           million (currently proposed USD 4.94 million) was unrealistic.
        o Removed the repetition of water quality indicators from the intermediate
           results portion of the results framework (components 1 and 3); and the
           indicators on “change in the number of visitors to the Fossil Research

                                          12
              Center? and “donations received by the Center/Museum? as there are no
              actual activities planned in the Project that are directly linked to this result;

 o Performed minor revisions to other indicators to clearly state the targets and the
   data source to facilitate its measurement. This includes: (i) the PDO indicator of
   guaranteed adequate water supply while maintaining the Uberaba River flow at
   minimum levels; (ii) the municipal environmental licensing system target to reflect
   the actual legal mandate of the Municipal Secretariat for the Environment (SMA -
   Secretaria Municipal do Meio Ambiente); (iii) correction of the name of the park
   from “Parque da Cidade? to “Parque das Lajes?; and, (iv) revision of the frequency
   in the measurement of occurrence of flooding in the city center to year 5 only, as
   the Project related works will be concluded only in June 2013.

26.     Safeguards. This paper proposes that the box corresponding to OP 4.37 be
checked in the safeguard table of the ISDS; and that OP 4.12 be formally triggered, and
its instruments – which were prepared, disclosed and evaluated by the Bank as
satisfactory - be reflected in the Project documents.

27.   Reallocation. The Borrower proposes the following minor reallocation of funds

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

30.     Technical – The main activities proposed under the Environmental Sanitation
Component are well aligned with the original Project proposals. All engineering designs
have been closely evaluated by the Bank and found to be satisfactory. Most works and
studies are under way and have been closely monitored. Exclusion of activities originally
planned in the project was thoroughly discussed with the client, and although not
financed by the loan or implemented in the Project’s timeframe, will still occur as the
municipality was able to secure resources from other financiers.


5
  Complementary activities originally proposed were not included in the project’s PAD costs, which included the
implementation of wastewater works (Conquistinha and Uberaba wastewater conveyance systems and Treatment
Plants) and the Leopoldino Retention Pool – for a total estimated original cost of US$13.27 million as counterpart
financed activities.
6
    Complementary activities originally proposed were included with their actual cost of US$29.73 million.
                                                           14
31.     Social – Land acquisition was needed for the implementation of activities in
components 1 and 2 of the Project, but neither relocation of families nor economic
displacement took place. A retroactive involuntary Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for
all land acquisitions was developed by the Municipality and assessed by the Bank in
January 2010; and regularly updated until March 2012. This RAP was considered by the
Bank to be in compliance with its safeguard requirements.

32.     The report indicates that the Municipality acquired, using counterpart funds, 18
lots – land only (total of 66.30ha of land) – using the following solutions: 5 voluntary
exchanges of land; 3 donations to the municipality; 7 amicable land acquisitions wherein
the Municipality’s proposed market price for the purchase of the land was agreeable to
the land owner and the transaction voluntary7; 1 judicial land acquisitions for which a
decision has already been issued and a court-determined compensation was paid and no
contestation was subsequently registered8, and 2 cases that are still being negotiated.
Except for the 2 cases under negotiation (which started in 2001, long before project
preparation), for which a value has been agreed upon and the form of payment is being
negotiated,9 all others have been resolved.

33.     As part of its due diligence, the Bank carried out interviews with several affected
owners and verified that they were fully satisfied with the procedures and outcomes
reached during the land acquisition process. In addition to the detailed evaluation report
for each land acquisition (the retroactive Resettlement Action Plan - RAP), the
Municipality developed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to be used in case any
resettlement is needed until project completion (at this stage no additional land
acquisition or resettlement is expected). The RPF also indicates the agreed actions and
timeline to identify the need for a Process Framework, in case any involuntary restriction
of access is needed as a result of the preparation of the management plan for a portion of
the Uberaba APA. This RPF was formally adopted by the client and was considered by
the Bank to be in compliance with its safeguard requirements. The first consolidated
version of the RAP and the RPF was disclosed to the public in the Project’s website
(www.uberaba.mg.gov.br/portal) and in the Bank’s website in March 2010, and the
updated versions of the individual documents were disclosed in March 2012.
