INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR THE NOUADHIBOU PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the equivalent
of US$8.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the
expansion of Nouadhibou Port and for the improvement of its management and
operations. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) and the
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) will provide cofinancing
for this project. The KFAED loan for the equivalent of US$8.3 million will
be for a term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, at a 1 percent interest
rate with an 0.5 percent service charge. The CCCE loan for the equivalent of
US$5.7 million will also be for a term of 25 years with 5 years of grace but
at an interest rate of 5.5 percent.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        Based upon the findings of an economic mission to Mauritania in
February/March 1973, a report entitled "The Current Economic Situation and
Prospects of Mauritania" (243-MAU) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 9, 1974. The following analysis is essentially based on that report.
Though projections were later updated following worldwide price increases,
particularly for oil, they do not reflect the recent nationalization of the
Mines de Fer de Mauritanie (MIFERMA) iron ore operation which may have a
substantial impact on both the public finance and balance of payments situa-
tions. An updating economic mission which will, inter alia, address itself
to these issues is scheduled for the end of this year. Country data sheets
appear as Annex I.
Background
3.        Mauritania's economy is organized around three main imperfectly
inter-connected centers from North to South: the port of Nouadhibou that
services the modern mining activities in the northwest and the fish process-
ing industries; the capital city of Nouakchott, important only as an admin-
istrative center; and the northern bank of the Senegal River where livestock
and agricultural activities take place. The rest of the country is desert,
practically uninhabited and unexploited.
4.        Mauritania's main political and economic links have traditionally
been with France and the French speaking African countries south of the
Sahara; however, it has established closer relations with its North African
neighbors and, more recently, with other Arab countries, particularly members



- 2 -
of OPEC. In June 1972, it asked for revision of the 1961 Cooperation Treaty
with France in the economic, monetary, technical, cultural, and military
fields, and a new agreement was reached in February 1973, except, however,
for monetary affairs. As a result, Mauritania left the West African Monetary
Union and the franc zone and it established its own central bank and intro-
duced its own currency, the ouguiya, in June 1973, with financial support
from Arab OPEC countries. However, it still wishes to keep and develop
economic ties with all its West African neighbors and is a member of the
West African Economic Community. Mauritania is a member of OMVS (Organiza-
tion pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal) with Senegal and Mali.
5.        The country is relatively rich in natural resources:   iron ore and
copper deposits, fertile land along the Senegal River Valley, large livestock
herds, and fish resources. However, the factors limiting economic growth are
many, as development of these resources is largely complicated by difficult
natural and human conditions that cannot be overcome in a matter of a few years.
Thus, iron ore activities after 1983 (when present mines will be exhausted),
will largely depend on the feasibility of the exploitation of the Guelbs
deposit which is known to have a low iron content. Copper mining continues
to encounter major technical difficulties which seriously puts into question
that activity. Mauritania has one of the harshest Sahelian climates and even
in the South rainfall is low and irregular. The development of irrigation
could be a major breakthrough, but it appears to be a very costly operation.
Fishing is not a traditional activity in Mauritania, and the existing fishing
operations have mostly been of an enclave type. More generally, Mauritania
is handicapped by great distances and arduous and costly transport. Probably
the most important factor is a definite lack of skilled manpower at all
levels; adult literacy and school enrollments are among the lowest in the
world, and furthermore school curricula are ill-adapted to the needs of the
economy.
Past Economic Performance
6.        Between 1960 and 1968, the Mauritanian economy grew at 10-11 per-
cent annually in real terms, mainly due to a rapid expansion of the mining
and related sectors, but little of the value added generated in the modern sec-
tor spilled over into rural areas; yet per capita income of the rural poor
could still increase by about three percent annually during that period.
From 1969 to 1973, overall economic growth slowed down to three to four per-
cent per year as mining production levelled off and the country was struck
by the Sahelian drought.
7.        Mauritania was particularly affected by the drought. Between 1969
and 1973, agricultural production decreased by about 60 percent while the
cattle herd was reduced by an estimated 40 percent. This wiped out all of
the progress made in the rural sector in the early sixties and further
widened the gap between per capita incomes in the traditional (US$70) and
modern sectors (more than US$500). Widespread famine and human deaths were



-3-
drastically limited thanks to exceptional aid, particularly from the U.S.
Although rainfall in 1974 and 1975 was about normal, and food production
returned to former levels, the consequences of the earlier droughts will be
felt for many years in the form of: (i) lower output in the livestock
sector; (ii) additional demands on the national budget for social and health
services; and (iii) social problems created by the concentration of
refugees around the emergency food supply centers.
8.        The combined effects of the drought, the sharp increase in world
market commodity prices, and accelerating world inflation led to a rapid
increase in imports from about US$108 million in 1972 to an estimated
average of US$162 million in the years 1973-74. Cereal imports alone in-
creased from US$9 million in 1972 to an annual average of about US$30 mil-
lion in 1973-74, while ref-ned petroleum imports increased from US$4 million
in 1972 to an estimated annual average of US$10 million during that same
period.
9.        However, this increase in the import bill was largely offset by
favorable prices for Mauritania's main exports (iron ore, copper, fish pro-
ducts and livestock) and a 30 percent increase in iron ore production be-
tween 1972 and 1974. As a result, the current account deficit increased by
US$6 million only, or from US$26 million in 1972 to an estimated US$32 mil-
lion average in 1973-74. Although substantial (20 percent of total export
earnings), this gap was, as in the past, fully financed by foreign aid.
Presently, foreign exchange reserves are high, about US$40 million at
the end of June 1975 (i.e. the equivalent of 3-4 months' imports), but this
figure is probably inflated by the fact that, over the last few months, sub-
stantial financial transfers by MIFERMA were suspended pending the outcome of
negotiations with shareholders.
10.       The public finance situation improved in some respects in the
1960s. From a US$7 million deficit in 1960, budgetary savings reached a
positive US$5 million in 1972/73 or about 15 percent of Central Government
revenues. Public savings (after debt amortization) financed about 20 per-
cent of the public investment programs in the past three years, the rest
being financed by foreign aid (US$12 million per annum). However, this was
only achieved by establishing very tight budgetary policies which resulted
in insufficient current budget expenditures in the productive sectors, result-
ing in a lack of material and supplies. Maintenance expenditures have also
been insufficient.
Strategy and Prospects
11.       The Government's economic policy in the first decade after indepen-
dence focused on the development of urban and transport infrastructure in an
effort to equip Mauritania with a modern capital and the facilities needed
to run the country and decrease the dependence of Mauritania on Senegal for
the transport of goods into and out of the country. Thus, about 80 percent



of pu bic Inves.ment s iD e_ee. -,  Iv  ..an  '972 we--e aLsorbed J  projects in 
transport and urban sectors.   ?uI-oc invesriaents irncreased steadily during
this period to reach an annr.al average o't US$15 m_ilion in 1968-72, or 8 per-
cent of GD?.   However, inves.uents outside infrastructure have been small
because of the limited capacfty of goverr.ment services to identify, prepare,
and execute projects.
12.       The Goernment Us fficure strazegy s'rould be to develop the country's
,zauura  resou-    _a -,Yes                                   f i;rcultureies.
ceeS, a  1is o           f the scverme-t 's iniestment progran for the Third
Plar. per-od ('-197 -79\' are not yet known, the number of project presently under
pre-aration in the rura   secto; inkdicates that a much larger share of public
investmenits w-.1    d na devotea to this sector than in the past.  The developrment
of irrigated agr:lzulture ina parLicular is expected to play an important role
in ensur_.iig -hat le consequences oL a recurrence of the recent drought would
not be so drastic.
i3.       Xu.ture growth in the modern sector is also essential to improve the
public finance situatiorL and provide a substantial part of the revenues
needed to fi-nance investment and recurrent expenditures for the development
of the rural sector. Hotfever, while new iron ore investments are planned,
mining alone cannot provide employment for more than a very small fraction
of Mauritania's active population and its indirect effects on the rest of
the economy will continue to remain limited.    Similarly, establishment of
manufacturing industries--so far strongly supported by the Government-- can-
not raise the standard of living for the mass of the Mauritanian population,
as high productLon and transport costs, limited skilled manpower, and small
local markets severely limit possibilities.
14.       Even assuming niormal rainfall conditions, growth in real terms in
the rural sector wdill probably not exceed an estimated 2-3 percent per annum
for the rest of the decade. Therefore, the standard of living on a per capita
basis in the rural sector carnot be expected to reach its 1968 level again
before the eariy 1980s as the reconstitution of the national herd will be a
slow process and the effects of the investments planned in the agricultural
sector will only be felt after a substantial lag. Growth in the modern
sector during the same period could reach about five percent. As a result,
economic growth for the country as a whole could be about four percent per
annum between 1971/72 and 1980 or 2 percent more than population growth.
Fin.acial Prospects and tha lieed for Aid
15.       At this juncture prospects for che balance of payments appear
particularly uncertain. no .ie --contrary to many African countries-- the
outlook for -L'uorenia s e.port prLces is reasonably favorable, the pace at
which it -au 2'caSe La ne vole    O' both exports (maainerals, 'beef, and fish)
aad imoort subs-- utees (anridcluLre) is severely constrained by physical
factors as weil as cost- conLsierations.  In this respect, M'auritania, like
most ozher small African countries, is particularly vulnerable to 'mported
,:,rlation.



- 5 -
16.       Local financing capability is expected to remain limited.   Assuming
continuing tight budgetary policies, except in a few key areas where some relax-
ation of limits to current spending is needed, public savings could perhaps reach
10 to 15 percent of Central Government revenues or an annual average of US$12
million over the Third Plan period. However, public debt amortization will
probably absorb about 50 percent of those savings and it is doubtful whether
the Government could finance more than 10 to 15 percent of the public invest-
ment program at a time when project opportunities, the need to broaden the
base of economic development, and inflation combine to justify a public invest-
ment program of about US$40 million during the Third Plan period, or a level
two and a half times higher than under the previous plan.
17.       In the meantime,the overall terms of foreign aid have progressively
hardened as the share of grant aid decreased from 100 percent in the early
sixties to about 35 percent in 1970-72. Terms of borrowing proper have, however,
continued to be concessionary with an average interest rate of 3.8 percent on
external debt outstanding as of December 1973. During 1970-72, the Bank Group
was the third largest aid donor (providing about 18 percent of Mauritania's
external capital assistance), after France (21 percent) and the European
Community (19 percent).
18.       The implementation of the public investment program in the coming
years would require a trebling of foreign aid capital inflows from an annual
average of US$12 million in 1970-72 to US$33-35 million in the Third Plan
period. This appears to be a feasible target with the European Community,
several Arab countries, France, the People's Republic of China and the Bank
Group expected to be the main donors.
19.       Several considerations justify lending on concessionary terms in
Mauritania and also financing some local costs: (a) the very low-income level
of the mass of the population, and expected slow growth of the economy;
(b) the tight public financial situation; and (c) the uncertain balance of
payments outlook. At the same time, while the debt service ratio based on
outstanding debt will remain low (less than 5 percent) in the medium term,
total public debt service could increase substantially as a result of the
arrangements to be reached with MIFERMA's shareholders in respect of the
nationalization last year.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MAURITANIA
20.       The Bank Group has had 9 operations in Mauritania to date.    Total
lending amounts to US$110.3 million, including one Bank loan of US$66 million
for the MIFERMA iron ore mining operation in 1960 (now totally repaid), 7 IDA
credits, totalling US$24.3 million, and one IFC operation of US$20.0 million
for the development of copper mining in 1968. Three credits were for projects
in the transport sector, one of US$6.7 million in FY 1964 for construction of
the Nouakchott-Rosso road and two for road maintenance (US$3.0 million in



- 6 -
FY 1969 and US$3.0 million in FY 1975); three in the rural sector (US$4.2
million for livestock development in FY 1972, US$2.5 million for a Drought
Relief Fund Project in FY 1974 and US$1.1 m llion for an Irrigation Engineer-
ing Project in FY 1974); and one for education (US$3.8 million, also in FY
1974). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and
IFC investments as of August 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
21.       Implementation of the more recent projects has been complicated by
both administrative difficulties, which have sometimes substantially delayed
project execution, and large cost overruns due to the combination of the
dollar devaluation, steady inflation since project appraisal, and the excep-
tionally difficult conditions prevailing in Mauritania (extreme poverty of
the country, very unfavorable climate, large distances, insufficient transport
network, and a lack of trained manpower). Project implementation is, however,
expected to improve. The recent creation of a super Ministry of National
Economy which will include both the Ministries of Finance and of Economic
Planning should help to alleviate many of the administrative difficulties
experienced in the past. In addition, substantially greater experience with
the conditions prevailing in Mauritania should lead to better project cost
estimates in the future.
22.       In line with the development strategy outlined in Part I above, the
primary objectives of Bank Group operations in Mauritania are to help the
Covernment (i) develop the potential of the rural sector and decrease its
vulnerability to drought, (ii) expand activities in the fishing sector and
(iii) imDrove and expand the education/training system in order to make it
more relevant to the country's needs. These objectives will be achieved by
supporting the development of mining activities and the channeling of benefits
from these activities into other productive sectors, of which the rural sector
is the most important.
23.       During 1970-72, the Bank Group accounted for about 18 percent of
Mauritania's external capital assistance. This is expected to decrease over
the next decade with the expected substantial inflow of capital from Arab
countries. As of December 1973, the Bank Group held 23 percent of Mauritania's
external public debt of US$50 million and accounted for about 3 percent of
total debt service payments in 1973.
PART III: THE PORT AND FISHING SECTORS
The Fishing Sector
24.       The main fishing grounds off the coast of Northwest Africa are
located near Mauritania. However, only about 5 percent of the approximately
1.5 million tons of fish caught annually are landed at the port of Nouadhibou.



- 7 -
The only purely Mauritanian fishing activity is carried out by 200 fislher-.,e-.
belonging to the lraguen tribe; their catch is about 1,000 tons per year
with a value of possibly US$100,000.
25.       In 1965, Government decided to establish a mixed corporation, the
Societe Mauritanienne de Peche (SOMAP), to purchase and operate a fleet of
fishing vessels to supply the local processing industry wjth fish. However,
the inadequacy of boats and equipment, poor management, the lack of trained
local personnel and crews, and the high cost of operations led to SOMAP's
failure and the processing industry is now almost completely dependent on
foreign fleets for its supply of fish.   Spanish, Japanese and Russian trawlers
presently land demersal (bottom living) 'ish at Nouadhibou for the freezing
and salting industries, while Dutch and Norwegian vessels bring pelagic (mid-
depth and surface-swimming) fish for meal and oil production.
26.       There are six (largely foreign-owned) processing plants in Nouadhibou
for fish salting, drying, freezing, canning and fishmeal and oil production.
These plants employ about 1000 persons of whom 800 are Mauritanians. The
plants have an effective capacity of about 140,000 t p.a. but in 1973 received
only about 80,000 t of fish; exports of fish products totalled about 34,000 t
with a total value of US$16 million (i.e. about 5 percent of GDP and about 8
percent of total exports). This low utilization of the processing plants
reflects a mixture of physical constraints combined with Nouadhibou's relative
unattractiveness to foreign fleets in comparison with other ports. Thus, in-
sufficient berthing and vessel servicing facilities, inadequate storage
facilities, lack of skilled local labor, the high cost of fuel oil, water,
and ice, inadequate shore facilities for shipst crews and harsh (and sometimes
uneven) enforcement of customs procedures have combined in the past to limit
use of the port.
27.       Since 1970 the Government has taken several measures to increase
landings at Nouadhibou: territorial jurisdiction has been extended from 20 km
to about 55 km, territorial waters are being policed, and, coupled with the
licencing arrangements permitting fishing in national waters, agreements have
been signed with foreign companies to land part of their catches at Nouadhibou.
These agreements were expected to yield minimum annual landings of approximately
160,000 t of fish by 1973. However, although landings did increase (from
52,000 t in 1970 to 80,000 t in 1973), the full potential of the agreements
has not been realized due to the limitations enumerated above.
28.       The measures that were taken are only part of a wider Government
strategy in the fishing sector which also includes expanding facilities at
Nouadhibou and making the port generally more attractive to fishermen by
improving port administration, customs procedures, and fishing port opera-
tions. Achieving these objectives is the purpose of the present project
which provides for expanding port facilities as well as technical assistance
to improve port activities. The recent increase in oil prices combined with
an adjustment in the price of diesel oil (which is now slightly lower in
Nouadhibou than in Dakar and Las Palmas) has increased the cost of diversion



from fishing grcn'nds near Nouac.'nL.'Du to zhose por.s, and -as p?t  ua-;nu
in a much better competitive posic-On.   ..-;rved sericing and expanded ber.;.-
ing facilities at Nouadhibou should permiC full implementation of the agrec-
ments with foreign fleets and help tne developm.,ent of a rational fleet.  Thc
value added by the fishing sector could increase by as much as 13 percent pp:-
annum (in constant prices) over the next decade and amount to about 9 percen.
of C(;DP in ;1980. By then, landings at Nouadhibod would represent about 15
percent of total cacches along the northwester-n coast of Africa.
29,       Lxt-enslon of che e:istin,g cozmerciaib ertrhs is also included in the
?roposed Droject in conjunction with -he expected growth of exports of pro-
cessed fish, and in view of the expected expansion of regional mining opera-
tions and the urdertaking of new industrial deveiopnments in the area, in-
cluding an oil refir.ery.
Port of Nouadhibou
30.       Nouadhibou is basically a fishing port where landing of the fisl,
catches and comunercnal traffic generated by the fishing industry togethler
comprise about 70 percent of total cargo tonnage. In 1973, total traffic at
Nouadhibou was about 210,000 t, including 80,000 t of fish landings, 21,000 
of petroleum products for fishing vessels, and 108,000 t of dry cargo traffic.
Of the dry cargo traffic, 40 percent is generated by the fishing industry
(including 17,000 t of frozen fish and 12,000 t of fishmeal and oil); and the
rest mostly by MIFERMA.
31.       Port facilities consist of two commercial berths which form an
island 80 m long and 22 m wide, linked to the shore by a piled approachway;
fishing berths, which are on a 290 m long piled quay; a lighterage wharf used
mainly for heavy lifts; three 20 m long ramps which lead off the approachway
to the commercial berths and which accommodate small fishing craft; and a
marine slipway with a hauling capacity of 250 t but without a workshop. These
facilities are beccrmIng increasingly inadequate to handle the fishing traffic.
The major bottlenec,k is the shortage of berthing space at the fishing berthls
and ramps which accommodate about three-quarters of all ships berthing at
Nouadhibou.
32.       All port equipment is owned by port users.   Bulk oil is handled
through pipelines. General cargo is handled by mobile equipment which is
adequate; transit and storage sheds and stacking yards are sufficient,
although located far from the commercial wharf.   Fish for fishmeal is un-
loaded by fixed pumps; fish foGr human consurption is unloaded by the fishing
ves.els' own gear.  Ice is `istributed by both fixed and mobile icecrusaers.
Operations at the port are complex Decause they involve many firms and various
types of services. Fishing vessel and fish carrier operations are conducted
by locai firms, whichl have a very low productivity (one ship per day per berth)
caused by inadequate Dort equipzr.ent ann poor port- organization.  General cargo
operations are carried out by a iGixed company, and are satisfactory.



- 9 -
33.       The port is administered by the Port Autonome de Nouadhibou (PAN),
which was established in 1973, taking over the operations of the local de-
partment of the Ministry of Equipment. Its management needs improvement,
primarily because of lack of experience and training. In addition, its
accounting and financial systems need to be reorganized. The present project
provides technical assistance to meet these needs.
PART IV: DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
34.       In 1971, the Government of Mauritania asked the Association to help
finance a project to expand Nouadhibou's fishing port facilities to accommo-
date increased fish landings. In 1972/73, a feasibility study was carried
out by the Bureau Central des Equipements d'Outre Mer (BCEOM, France) with
financing by a grant from the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC).
On the basis of these studies, the present project was appraised in March
1974. Negotiations began on November 25, 1974. The Mauritanian delegation
was led by Mr. Ibrahima Ba, Director of the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Development. In view of the difficulty in finding comparable recent civil
works in Mauritania on which to base a cost estimate, it was decided to post-
pone the conclusion of negotiations and subsequent Board presentation until
bids for the civil works had been evaluated. Bids were called for in
February of this year and received in June. Negotiations were resumed from
September 3-4, 1975, and an agreement reached with government and the co-
financers on the scope of the project and its financing. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III.  The project Appraisal Report (No. 548a-MAU)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
35.       The objectives of the project are: (a) to help provide additional
physical capacity at Nouadhibou port, and (b) to assist PAN in improving its
administration, organization, and operations. Specifically, the project would
include:
(a) civil works for:
-    extension of the fishing berths by 300 m,
-    extension of the commercial berths by 48 m, reconstruction
and widening of the approachway linking the berths to the
shore, and extension of one of the ramps for fishing craft,
-    construction of a sewerage scheme,
-    construction of administrative and residential buildings,
and a sailors' club,
-    consulting services for supervision of construction;

(b) equipment consisting of a harbor master's launch and navigation
aids maintenance equipment;
(c) technical assistance to PAN for port administration, operations
and reorganization of accounting and financial systems; and
(d) consulting services for studies on the need for and development
of ship-repair facilities.
Civil Works
36.       Implementation of the proposed civil works would (i) extend the
total length of the fishing berths from 290 m to 590 m and increase the capa-
city to 230,000 t p.a.; (ii) extend the length of the commercial berths from
80 m to 128 m with an alongside depth of 8 m on one side and 7 m on the other;
and (iii) widen the 210 m approachway linking the commercial wharf to the
shore from 12 m to 17.5 m.
37.       New administrative buildings will be constructed to replace existing
light or temporary buildings that will be demolished to make room for the pro-
posed extensions. The new buildings planned are: (i) the marine services
office; (ii) administrative buildings for the Port Authority and for the
Merchant Navy/Fisheries; (iii) Police/Health Station; (iv) three lodgings
for port officers; and (v) a sailors' residential club.
38.       A sewerage scheme will be constructed to serve the industrial fish
processing plants and the administrative and other buildings in the port.
The works include the lift stations, a treatment plant and a sea outfall for
the treated effluent.
Technical Assistance
39.       Technical assistance to be provided under the project will help the
Government and PAN to establish and implement a coordinated plan of action
aimed at reorganizing port operations so as to increase productivity, improv-
ing the port administration and finances (including revision of the accounting
system and establishment of cost-based tariffs), establishing a manpower plan
for development of the port and maritime sector, and estimating the need for
additional port facilities. The project also includes funds to finance studies
on the need for and development of ship repair facilities in Nouadhibou.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
40.       The total estimated cost of the project is US$27.55 million (includ-
ing taxes) with foreign exchange costs of US$18.09 million. Taxes are esti-
mated to amount to US$5.55 million. The bulk of the above costs are based on
tenders for the civil works received in June. The Government received 4 bids
and selected the lowest one. Since no bid was received for the sewerage com-
ponent, it is Government's intention to ask the contractor selected to build

the berths to also undertake the construction of the sewerage scheme. Other
costs have been estimated by the Association.
41.       The project will be cofinanced by IDA, US$8.0 million; the Kuwait
Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED), US$8.3 million; and the Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), US$5.7 million. The Government's
contribution, US$5.55 million,represents the value of the taxes and duties.

Details of cost estimates and the financing plan are set
forth in Annex III.
Project Execution
43.       The Government's Ministry of Construction would be responsible for
carrying out the project with the assistance of consultants. Construction is
scheduled to start by end 1975 and to be completed by end 1977. The techni-
cal assistance component is expected to be completed by end 1978. With
regard to supervision, the Government, PAN and the cofinancers have agreed
that Bank Group procedures would be followed and that the Association would
have the principal role in supervision.
Procurement
44.       Construction of civil works would be executed by contract.     Inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines has
already taken place. Each bidder was invited to prepare a combined offer for
the marine works, sewerage scheme and the various buildings included in the
project and another offer for each of these components separately; the latter
arrangement to encourage local contractors who could undertake building construc-
tion to bid on this part of the project. However, the acceptable low bid
for the major portion of the civil works (the berths and approachway) does
not involve a local contractor although it is almost certain that the build-
ings component (on which bids are being called for a second time with the
expectation that lower bids will be submitted) will be carried out by local
contractors. All consultants/technical assistance experts would be selected
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.
Economic Justification
45.       The proposed project as a whole is expected to yield an economic
rate of return of about 26 percent for Mauritania over a 25 year period. The
fishing berths will provide a rate of return of 30 percent which reflects (a)
increased landings of fish due to doubled berthing capacity which would enable
Mauritania to take advantage of existing and proposed landing agreements with
the major foreign fishing fleets, (b) greater revenue from fish products in
the form of taxes and benefits retained in Mauritania due to an expected
increase in productivity in and expansion of the fish processing plants, and



13 -
(c) employment opportunities for the local population both on foreign vessels
as well as in the fishing plants. Extension of the commercial berths and re-
habilitation of the approachway are expected to yield an 18 percent rate of
return. Benefits accruing from the additional berths (including the approach-
way) consist mostly of the reduction in ship waiting time, lower costs for
stevedoring and shore handling, and savings on loss and damage as a result of
decreased lighterage.
46.       Sensitivity analysis confirms that even under exceptionally un-
favorable conditions where all expected benefits streams are reduced by
30 percent from the best estimate (due to lower than expected traffic at the
commercial berths or a smaller than anticipated increase in operational pro-
ductivity at the fishing berths), the project would still yield a satisfactory
return of 19 percent. The port extension is also expected to generate sub-
stantial indirect benefits which are not quantified in the economic evaluation.
Most important of these would be additional employment in sub-contracting
activities of the fishing industry, and training of local labor.
Financial Results
47.       Until the recent establishment of PAN, there was no separate port
budget, and therefore no significant conclusions can be drawn from past
financial data. The Government has agreed that tariffs will be adjusted
to allow PAN to cover operating, maintenance, replacement, depreciation,
taxes and administrative and other expenses, including payment of interest
and other charges on debt, if any (section 5.05 (a) of the draft Credit
Agreement). It has also agreed that PAN will achieve a minimum rate of
return on fixed assets of not less than 6 percent up to 1977 and of not
less than 2-1/2 percent thereafter (section 5.06 (a) of the draft Credit
Agreement). PAN will, in addition, earn interest on cash surpluses retained
for expansion and renewal purposes which, combined with the return of 2-1/2
percent on fixed assets, will enable it to pay from 1977 a required annual
dividend of not less than 3 percent on the Government's total equity (section
5.08 of the draft Credit Agreement).
48.       The proposed reorganization of the accounting system will enable
a cost-based revision of the tariffs. The extent to which tariffs can be
increased has to be carefully assessed keeping in mind the port's competitive
position vis-a-vis nearby attractive ports. Pending this assessment, which
will be conducted by technical assistance experts under the proposed project,
the financial forecasts assume that the entire project cost will be financed by
an equity contribution from the Government, and that PAN will generate additional
revenue of at least US$0.33 million in 1977 with some tariff revision. The
project should enable Government to realize additional net income over the
period 1977-80 from fishing rights' fees and taxes on the fishing sector as
a whole which, combined with the annual dividend from PAN, will enable the
Government to recover the entire project cost within 7 years of its implement-
ation and to earn after 1979 an annual return of about 21 percent on its
equity contribution to PAN through the proposed project.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Mauritania and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed Credit, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.       Features of particular interest include (i) cross remedies in case of
suspension or default under the CCCE and KFAED loan agreements (sections 6.01
and 6.02 of the draft Credit Agreement) and (ii) additional conditions of
effectiveness, namely that the CCCE and KFAED loan agreements are fully effective
(section 7.01 of the draft Credit Agreement).
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   Projects in Execution
Cr. No. 159-MAU - First Road Maintenance Project: US$3.0 million;
Credit Agreement: June 26, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
This project included (a) the purchase of highway maintenance
equipment, (b) the provision of technical assistance to execute a four-year
highway maintenance and betterment program, and (c) the training of mechanics
and operators. The project is now nearing completion; it has contributed to
setting up an effective maintenance organization. The major difficulty en-
countered during implementation was the inability of the Government to assign
a sufficient number of counterparts to the expatriate experts as a result of
a general shortage of middle and upper level staff in Mauritania. This pro-
ject is being continued by a Third Highway Maintenance project (Credit No.
519-MAU), hereunder described.
Cr. No. 274-MAU - Livestock Development Project: US$4.15 million;
Credit Agreement: December 17, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The project is to assist semi-nomadic herdsmen in improving their
herds by providing watering and animal health facilities, and through main-
tenance of firebreaks to protect the pastures. The project has experienced
managerial and administrative difficulties. Moreover, the bidding procedure
for the pastoral wells component did not achieve satisfactory results.
Last July, the Board approved the following changes to the project
to be carried out within the same overall credit amount: (a) establishment
of a strong project unit (project coordinator plus accountant) to assist
the Director of the Project; (b) strengthening of the water services of the
government; (c) reduction of the number of wells to be repaired and recons-
tructed for two major reasons: first, since project appraisal in 1971,
inflation has caused an estimated 50-80 percent increase in costs; second,
and more important, it has been decided to limit repair and reconstruction
of wells to areas where the risks of pasture deterioration through over-
grazing are relatively minor; and (d) in view of the limitation of funds, it
has been decided that the revised project would not finance the construction
of new wells as originally planned, and exploratory drilling would be limited
to four sites in a zone with good grazing potential.
The progress made by the Government in implementing these changes
has thus far been encouraging. The accountant has already assumed duties
and the Government is in the process of finalizing the contract of the
project coordinator. Negotiations for the services of well diggers and
mechanics are underway and the Government has initiated procedures for pro-
curement of equipment.

Cr. No. 444-MAU - Drought Relief Fund Project: US$2.5 million; Credit
Agreement: December 7, 1973; Closing Date:
November 15, 1976
The project objective is to contribute to the re-establishment of
the country's productive base. It includes four subprojects: (a) the reha-
bilitation and extension of small rice irrigation schemes; (b) the develop-
ment and improvement of irrigated vegetable production; (c) the establish-
ment of a fodder and cattle production center in Rosso; and (d) advisory
services to the Ministry of Rural Development. Project implementation has
been delayed by at least one year because of administrative difficulties.
Nevertheless, technical consultants have now arrived and equipment is almost
entirely delivered. The feasibility study of (c) is now complete and being
reviewed by IDA; preliminary estimates indicate a substantial overrun on
that component. This issue will be discussed with Government during the next
supervision mission.
Cr. No. 459-MAU - Education Project: US$3.8 million; Credit Agreement:
February 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This project provides for (a) the establishment of a vocational
training center in Nouakchott to meet training needs for clerical, mechanical
and construction workers; (b) the establishment of a technician training pro-
gram in Nouadhibou; (c) equipment and technical assistance for the National
Pedagogical Center for the upgrading and counseling of teachers through
educational broadcasting and related teaching materials; (d) the establishment
of a pilot farmer training center in the irrigated rice perimeter of M'Pourie;
(e) the establishment of a farner radio programming center at Kaedi; (f) an
experimental study of the feasibility of introducing basic education (reading,
writing, arithmetic) in the Koranic school system; and (g) technical assistance
for the Directorate of Planning to help develop better indicators of manpower
demand.
The project is experiencing a substantial cost overrun due to the
depreciation of the dollar and general inflation. The July 1975 supervision
mission recommended that the project be reduced in scope to address the priority
sectors of farming and mining as well as the study of Koranic schools.
The mission also suggested that alternative financing be sought for items to
be excluded from the project (the rural radio station and the primary teachers
upgrading program) or that they be included in a subsequent project. The
Government was in general agreement with the mission's recommendations and
we are now expecting their final reply on the proposed changes.
Cr. No. S-16-MAU - Irrigation Engineering Project: US$1.1 million;
Credit Agreement: June 12, 1974; Closing Date:
March 31, 1977
The project provides for (a) the execution of the engineering
studies needed for the implementation of the first phase of the Gorgol Basin



ANNEX II
Page 4
Development Scheme; (b) the carrying out of related health and education
studies; (c) the preparation of final designs, tender documents and technical
uchedule3; (d) assistance to the Goverment in bid evaluation; and (e) tech-
nical assistance to the Ministry of Planning for the analysis of rural develop-
ment projects. Essential parts of the studies are completed. However, they
have shown alarmingly high costs. A preappraisal mission to study the reasons
for such high costs is scheduled for December 1975.
Cr. No. 519-MAU - Third Highway Project: US$3.0 million; Credit
Agreement: December 11, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980
The principal aim of the project is to consolidate and expand the
maintenance and betterment efforts started under the First Road Maintenance
Project (Cr. No. 159-MAU). The project consists of: (a) technical assistance
to relieve the shortage of qualified highway personnel and to allow for the
continuation of the training program undertaken under the previous credit;
(b) purchase of highway equipment for maintenance and betterment works;
(c) a betterment program of about 365 km including earthworks in new align-
ments to avoid sandy or periodically flooded areas, construction of surface
drainage and high river-crossing structures; and (d) a feasibility study and
detailed engineering of the Rosse-Boghe road (200 km). The project, which
costs a total of US$13.7 million, is cofinanced by the KFAED (US$3.8 million)
and the Government of Canada (US$4.2 million). It is not yet effective due
to a delay in (a) signing the consultants' contract (for technical assistance
and the feasibility study) and (b) signing and effectiveness of the KFAED and
Canadian loans. Because of the depreciation of the dollar and steady infla-
tion since project evaluation, a cost overrun is possible.

Project
Management:       The Government's Ministry of Construction will be
responsible for carrying out the project with the
assistance of consultants.
Procurement
Arrangements:   Construction of civil works would be executed by
contract. International competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines has already
taken place. Each bidder was invited to prepare a
combined offer for the marine works, sewerage scheme
and the various buildings included in the project and
another offer for each of these components separately;
the latter arrangement to encourage local contractors
who could undertake building construction to bid on this
part of the project. However, the acceptable low bid
for the major portion of the civil works (the berths
and approachway) does not involve a local contractor
although it is almost certain that the buildings
component (on which bids are being called for a second
time with the expectation that lower bids will be
submitted) will be carried out by local contractors.
All consultants/technical assistants experts would be
selected on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association.
Consultants:        Total consultants' service would amount to 40 man-
months.
Rate of Return:     Overall Project                26 percent
