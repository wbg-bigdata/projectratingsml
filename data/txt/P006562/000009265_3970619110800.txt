This report is based on appraisal missions which visited Brazil in April 1995 and May
1996. The April 1995 mission consisted of Mary Sheehan, task manager (LAIEU); E.
Varon Lenis, sanitary engineer; T. Campbell, urban specialist (LATAD); C. Ramsay,
finance specialist (LATSO); and R. Gilbert, economist (Cons.). The May 1996 mission
comprised Messrs. Philip Owusu, task manager (LAIPS); David Vetter, housing and
urban specialist (LAIPS); and Roy Gilbert, economist (Cons.). W. Dillinger, economist
(LAIPS); J. Redwood, environmental specialist (ENVLW); M. Sugar, disbursement
officer (LOAEL); and J. Michelsen (Cons.) also participated in missions. F. Manibog, A.
Manterola and D. Gross (LAIEU) assisted in project preparation. The Peer Reviewers for
the project are T. Campbell (LATAD) and P. Jones (LASHD). B. Menezes, Pr.
Operations Officer was appointed task manager in November 1996; Messrs. P. Meo, 0.
Grimes and G.T. Nankani are the managing Division Chief, Projects Adviser, and
Department Director, respectively, for the project.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE
DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1. PROJECT ORIGIN AND DESIGN
1.1   Brazil's 1988 Constitutional reforms enhanced the importance of municipalities,
giving them both greater responsibilities and increased revenues to meet their new
responsibilities. These reforms leave municipalities better off now than they were in 1989,
largely as a result of Federal and state transfers but also from newly-created own sources.
Responsibilities that previously had been delegated to higher levels of government due to
lack of local resources and Brazil's centralist system -- in particular in the area of provision
of infrastructure and social services -- are now back in the hands of municipal mayors.
The challenge is for municipalities to provide these services efficiently, increasingly relying
on own rather than transferred resources, borrowing prudently, streamlining current
expenditures, investing in cost-effective projects, and contracting out and privatizing
services where appropriate.
1.2   The proposed project was initiated during elaboration of the urban policy of the
State of Bahia in the late 1980s. Bahia had been until then a predominantly rural state.
Urbanization rates that exceeded the regional and national averages by the end of the
1 980s, however (coinciding with the decentralization reforms), convinced State authorities
that well-managed, self-reliant local governments would be essential to the economic
growth of the State. Because of the commitment of high-ranking State officials, the
project concept gathered force with the explicit support of successive State Governors.
The project thus became a key element of development policy for the interior of the State.
Government leaders' commitment to the project, and the maturing process that it has
undergone, augur well for strong borrower ownership during implementation.
1.3   This is the seventh State-based municipal development project designed to support
Brazil's decentralization. The gradual transfer of lessons from projects under
implementation in the South of Brazil to the Northeast has been a long-term strategic
objective. It is the first such dedicated Bank-supported project in the Northeast --
following a similar component in a multi-sectoral project in Ceara (Loan 3789-BR) and a
pilot component in a municipal management project in Minas Gerais (Loan 3639-BR).
Lessons from these projects, as well as the recent OED report on urban lending,' have
been incorporated into project design. The major difference in the Bahia project is the
explicit introduction of a reform component to enable the municipalities to increase

revenues generated from own sources, and to encourage municipalities to privatize the
delivery of municipal services. Other key differences are simplification of sub-project
evaluation procedures; a standardized, strategic approach to institutional development;
and an explicit poverty-targeted component that builds on the lessons of urban upgrading
programs Bank-wide.
1.4   If municipalities are to be responsible for expenditures on many types of public
goods and services, then reform of the role, functions and financial management of local
governments must be designed as a coherent and cohesive package. A set of criteria to
assess design of municipal policy-making and reforms2 and their application to the case of
Bahia is shown in Annex IA. It is this analysis, along with lessons learned (Annex 1 B),
the urban poverty strategy in Brazil (Annex 1 C), and the State's own development
objectives that have principally guided both the Bank and State teams in project design.
1.5   The project was identified in April 1993. Three missions assisted the State of
Bahia in project preparation. The project was appraised in April 1995 and reappraised in
May 1996, following a review of the state's creditworthiness.

2. THE URBAN SECTOR
A. INTRODUCTION
2.1    Brazil's 1988 Constitutional reforms enhanced the importance of municipalities in
the country's Federal system, so that they now have both greater responsibilities -- in
particular in the area of provision of infrastructure and social services -- and increased
revenues from own and transfer sources to fulfill their new responsibilities. This reform
comes at a time when Brazil's municipalities confront increasing challenges in the adequate
and efficient provision of services. Against the background of macroeconomic crises
(which began in the early 1980s) and high urbanization rates, municipalities face the
following set of circumstances: The first is low productivity of infrastructure assets.
Brazil's mature infrastructure networks are among the most extensive in the region. These
aging assets have not been adequately maintained, however, and are insufficient to meet
the growing demand for service. Second, with population pressure and economic
volatility, services increasingly have been provided in an informal and unregulated fashion,
which has led to degradation of the urban ecosystem, particularly infavela areas. Third,
over the past decade, poverty in Brazil has become increasingly an urban problem. Urban
poverty's share has increased to roughly half of the total poor. Fourth, with economic
crisis has come the failure of federal infrastructure delivery programs, creating an
institutional and resource gap. And fifth, despite decentralization, municipalities continue
to be dependent financially on Federal and State transfers, particularly in Brazil's North
and Northeast Regions. These factors point to a need to strengthen municipalities'
capabilities to efficiently manage both their resources and their responsibilities.
B. URBANIZATION: STRUCTURE AND TRENDS
2.2    Brazil's federal structure of government encompasses 26 states and about 5,000
municipalities.3 With about 75% of its 153.2 million inhabitants living in urban areas in
1990, Brazil is one of the most populous urban societies in the world.4 In addition to the
megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro -- with metropolitan region populations of
about 16 million and I 1 million, respectively -- Brazil has another nine cities with more
than one million inhabitants, including Salvador, the capital of Bahia (metropolitan region
population of about 2.5 million), and numerous medium-sized cities (with populations of
100,000 to one million). The largest urban concentration is found in the more developed
Southeast region of the country, while the North and Northeast Regions until the last
decade have been predominantly rural.
2.3   In the past, rapid urban population growth required a major effort by public sector
authorities to keep pace with the increasing demand for urban infrastructure. During the
3   The decision to create new municipalities belongs to the states. During 1992 approximately 300 new
municipalities were formed.
4   "Urban" is defined as urban concentrations with populations greater than 20,000.



4
1970s, Brazil's urban population grew by 4.4% per year. Migrants leaving depressed rural
areas, the populations of which fell by 60% during the decade, helped fuel this urban
demographic growth. Nationwide urbanization rates slowed in the 1 980s to an average of
3.4%. The census also indicates a significant slowdown in Brazil's demographic growth to
1.9% per year over the 1980-91 period (against 2.5% per year during 1970-80). This
reduced pace of population growth may give municipalities some breathing space to make
much-needed improvements in the quality of urban services provided.
C. THE CENTRALIZED MODEL OF URBAN SERVICE DELIVERY
2.4   Until recently, Brazil's urban policy and infrastructure service delivery mechanisms
were strongly centrist through a large network of federal and state institutions. National
urban policy was formulated by the National Commission on Metropolitan Regions and
Urban Policy (CNPU) during the 1 970s, by an inter ministerial National Urban
Development Council (CNDU) in the mid-i 980s, and finally by a short-lived Ministry of
Urban Development (MDU) from 1985 to 1988. Throughout the entire period urban
infrastructure financing was dominated by the National Housing Bank (Banco Nacional de
Habitacdo - BNH). BNH channeled the proceeds of workers' compulsory savings
(FGTS) into housing and sanitation infrastructure. Among the most important BNH-
financed programs were the National Sanitation Plan (Plano Nacional de Saneamento -
PLANASA) for water and sewerage works, executed through state water and sewerage
companies; and the National Low-Cost Housing Plan (Plano Nacional de Habita(ao
Popular - PLANHAP), also executed through state agencies. Urban transport was
centralized as well, under the Brazilian Urban Transport Company (Empresa Brasileira de
Transportes Urbanos - EBTU).
2.5   These efforts deliberately excluded municipalities in the name of centrist national
coordination objectives and economy-of-scale gains. Since 1982, federal government
fiscal deficits have precipitated a steady retreat from the use of these central financing
institutions and their policy-making counterparts. The principal financial intermediary of
the Government of Brazil (GOB), and one of the country's largest banks, the Caixa
Economica Federal (CEF), has inherited the remainder of these earlier programs without
the resources to sustain them. In retrospect, the effective collapse of these centralized
financing schemes in the early 1990s could have been foreseen as inevitable since they
relied on unsustainable subsidies in the absence of meaningful cost recovery.
D. DECENTRALIZATION AND CURRENT URBAN POLICY
2.6   In the wake of the restoration of democracy in the 1980s, and free elections at all
levels of government, the 1988 Constitution represented a watershed. Key provisions of
the Constitution consolidated the process of decentralizing authority away from the
federal government. Article 30, for example, spells out the responsibilities of
municipalities with respect to tax collection and the provision of local services; Articles
156 and 158 provide for enhanced fiscal revenues for municipalities to meet these
responsibilities.



5
2.7   Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The Constitution increased both municipal
shared and own-source revenues, at the expense of federal revenues (Annexes 2A and
2B). Between 1988 and end-1993, the municipal share of federal income tax (IR)
increased from 17% to 22.5%; federal industrial product tax (IPI) increased from 16% to
22.5%; and value-added tax collected by states (ICMS) grew from 20% to 25%. The
Constitution also established a new municipal tax on fuel sales (IVVC) and gave exclusive
collection rights to municipalities for the property transfer tax (ITBI), which was formerly
shared with the states. Additional fiscal revenue has accrued to municipalities mostly
through increased revenue sharing, primarily the ICMS. New municipal taxes have not
replaced the property tax (IPTU) and service tax (ISS) as municipalities' principal source
of self-generated revenue. Studies indicate that by end- 1993, these reforms had increased
municipal revenues by approximately one-third. The municipal share of all taxes collected
in Brazil in 1993 reached nearly one quarter, against a pre-reform level of 18%. Revenue
sources for a sample group of Brazilian state capitals are shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Municipal Revenue Sources; Average for Selected Brazilian State Capitals
(percent distribution, 1990)

Report 10161-BR, February 1992.
bl It should be noted that State capitals' own resources as a percent of the total is
significantly higher than for the total of all municipalities.
2.8    Both the states and the federal government are affected. States have gained
slightly. While their shares of IR rose from 16% in 1988 to nearly 25% in 1993, and IPI
from 16% to just over one-third, they have lost an extra 5% of ICMS to municipalities.
The federal government has seen its 67% share of IR and IPI drop to some 50%.
2.9   Political Change. In addition to its administrative and financial aspects,
decentralization is an important dimension of Brazil's governance framework. It
strengthens the country's return to democracy, begun in 1982, when the first free elections
for state governors were held as part of the then-military government's move towards
political opening, or abertura. In 1984, municipal mayors were elected in some
jurisdictions for the first time. Democratic consolidation continued with elections in 1986
for part of Congress and for state governors for the second time. The promulgation of the
new Constitution and elections for city mayors for the second time occurred in 1988. In
1989, there was direct vote by universal suffrage for President and in 1992 elections for
municipal mayors were again held. The second set of municipal elections are set to take
place in October 1996. Expanded responsibilities for these elected officials are expected
to lead to increased local accountability.

2.10   Current Urban Policy. With the Cardoso Administration in 1995 a new
Secretariat of Urban Policy (SPU) was established in the Ministry of Planning. The SPU
replaced the former Secretariat of Urban Development, and is intended as a policy-
formulating agency, rather than an executive agency. This secretariat will not have
responsibility for allocation of funds. It will instead be responsible for establishing broad
urban development policies. In this work it will coordinate closely with IPEA, the federal
government's institute for economic and applied research, and with the government's
newly-established Community Solidarity Program (Programa de Comunidade Soliddria-
PCS). The PCS plans to address poverty through decentralized implementation and direct
involvement of beneficiary communities in five areas: (a) nutrition and health; (b)
employment generation; (c) social safety nets for vulnerable populations (children and
elderly); (d) rural poverty; and (e) urban poverty. The urban poverty focus will
concentrate on the peripheries of medium-size and large cities. The SPU will work closely
with the PCS in coordinating poverty-alleviation efforts in urban areas. The federal
government has requested Bank assistance in developing an integrated urban policy,
including an urban poverty strategy. A program of technical assistance, training, and
seminars is under preparation.
E. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT
2.11  Brazil sustained buoyant economic growth of 8.6% per annum during the 1970s
through industrial expansion was based initially on inexpensive energy supplies and
subsequently on inexpensive external credit following the oil price shocks of 1973 and
1978. Brazil's total external debt rose from US$12.0 billion in 1973 to US$91.3 billion in
1982, and the country followed Mexico into default on debt repayments that year.5
Rampant and unstable inflation has hampered Brazil's economic recovery since 1982. It
has also played havoc with public finances, frustrating attempts of the public sector at all
three levels to generate savings. Economic growth driven by federal government funding
faltered as additional external resources dried up and interest rates on outstanding loans
soared. Thus, even without the concurrent political pressures in favor of decentralization,
economic crisis has made decentralization an appealing financial alternative. In July 1994,
the Franco Administration launched a new stabilization plan, the Plano Real, named after
the new currency created as one of the key fiscal reform measures. In tandem, the
Government introduced significant structural reforms (beginning in 1990), including trade
liberalization, deregulation, and privatization of state enterprises. These measures are
being continued under the Cardoso Administration.
2.12  The Share of Brazil's Local Governments in the Economy. As demonstrated in
Table 2, municipalities have become significant players in Brazilian public finance. In
1990, total municipal resources amounted to 5.2% of GDP (nearly twice the 1985 level),
total expenditures 4.3% (1.8% of which represented the wage bill), and capital
investments 1% of GDP, or nearly twice the federal government's investment expenditures
fiscal base (Annex 2B). With urban growth has also come an important potential, (as yet

Appendix 2.



7
unexploited). Total municipal revenues now are derived about 20% from own sources,
such as property taxes. Better local service provision will increase residents' willingness to
pay both local taxes and user charges.

2.13  Municipalities have in the recent past confronted three important linkages with the
macroeconomy. First are the negative effects of endemic inflation: (i) parameters of
property and other taxes, which are important sources of own revenues, are difficult to
adjust for inflation; (ii) financial administration, notoriously weak in smaller municipalities,
must be agile and efficient to manage inflation; and (iii) high inflation makes adequate
planning and budgeting virtually impossible. Second is the potential for a municipal debt
crisis if borrowing is not done on a prudent scale. Off-budget items such as suppliers'
credits and rollover of existing debt are common, primarily in the larger municipalities,
which have a history of borrowing (the smaller ones do not). Caution will need to be
exercised in ensuring that discretionary transfers are not relied on to service imprudent
borrowing, and that rollovers, transfers and suppliers' credits are adequately accounted for
in calculation of credit limits. And third is the paucity of adequate, consistent financial
reporting and financial data across municipalities with which to monitor progress on
implementation of policy and impact on the macroeconomy of the country.
F. SECTOR STRATEGY: A MEDIUM-TERM VISION FOR THE ROLE OF MUNICIPALrrIES
2.14  With decentralization, municipalities act as quasi-autonomous managers of
expenditures for services such as health, education, water supply, waste collection,
drainage, paving and public transport. Municipalities, in theory, have a comparative
advantage in the provision of these services because local governments, particularly after a
return to democratically-elected leaders, are more knowledgeable about local needs and
better at responding rapidly to changes in these needs. This does not mean that
municipalities should provide all services by themselves. For many of these activities,
municipalities should rely on the private sector through concessions, contracting or
investment participation, expanding the scope of service delivery. Since many of these



8
services are intermediate goods in the production of private services, municipal
perfornance in managing these expenditures will also contribute to Brazil's
macroeconomic performance. Municipalities should also contribute to a return to
sustainable macroeconomic growth through their own fiscal efforts, and ensure their
financial independence and health by maximizing the revenues they can raise from their
own sources. The local tax burden -- including local tax levels, but also local user fees
and the pricing of local services -- should increasingly be determined by the level of
demand for services.
2.15  In sum, over the medium-term municipalities will need to place greater emphasis
on efficiency and financial management. The challenge for municipalities today is to
establish their own mechanisms of infrastructure delivery based on increased fiscal
autonomy. To this end, improved municipal administration can help to fill the vacuum left
by the demise of national programs. The key goals for municipalities will be to:
(a)    mobilize their own resources more effectively, by widening their tax bases
and exploring alternative sources of revenue, such as user charges and
betterment taxes;
(b)    allocate these resources more efficiently through rigorous appraisal of new
investments;
(c)   increase efficiency in the use of resources for current expenditure through
the improvement of day-to-day administration;
(d)    engage the private sector, through privatization and contracting out, for
those municipal investments and services it can provide more efficiently;
(e)    prudently borrow market resources to fund priority operations with high
economic and financial rates of return; and
(f)    begin to plan and budget more effectively while explicitly monitoring
financial performance.
2.16  Rationale for Bank Involvement. According to the current Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 6, 1995, and
updated in June 1996, support for structural reforms at the federal and state levels is a
major element in the Bank's assistance strategy for Brazil. Moreover, the Bank seeks to
shift its assistance strategy increasingly toward states. This re-orientation of emphasis on
lending to the states is principally due to the increased importance of the states in the
provision of key services and infrastructure, and the finding that projects are successful
primarily in states with viable fiscal positions (and hence investment programs); only in
such cases is the needed volume of counterpart funding available. Therefore, the Bank
will focus its lending on: (i) developing policy dialogues differentiated by states or groups
of states; (ii) formulating investment operations that serve as vehicles to improve the
policy and institutional framework; and (iii) supporting some states' efforts to improve
their finances.



9
2.17   The Bank proposes a three-pronged strategy toward state lending: (i) investment
loans, principally in the social sectors and in infrastructure in creditworthy states; (ii)
reform loans where strong fiscal and sector policy reforms are being implemented; and (iii)
for states with poor creditworthiness, the Bank would lend via federal loans (requiring
federally funded counterpart financing), if suggested by the Federal Government. The
Bank would not lend directly to uncreditworthy states. In summary, to improve overall
state creditworthiness, future sector lending operations will take place on a state-by-state
basis, and will primarily be targeted toward those reform-prone states, while other
operations will be targeted toward less reform-prone states in order to enable them to
become eligible for future Bank support.
2.18  In this case, Bahia is a creditworthy state (see Annex 3G). The proposed project
will seek to reduce municipal dependence on state transfers by helping the municipalities
to increase their own resources and to use them wisely, as well as developing a municipal
development fund.
2.19   Urban Sector Strategy. The Bank's strategy in the urban sector in Brazil, as set out
in the report, Brazil: The Challenge of Municipal Sector Development in the 1990s,
February 1992 (IBRD No. 10616-BR), is to support the decentralization reforms which
took effect with the 1988 Constitution, and foster among Brazil's municipalities
strengthened financial management and increased fiscal responsibility. This would be
achieved through support to financially-sound and reform-oriented states, and through
continuing policy dialogue and technical assistance at the federal level. The proposed
project is part of a strategy that has sought to gradually transfer the lessons of urban
experience in the South of Brazil to the Northeast, where ongoing and planned operations
would reach those states with the largest urban populations.
2.20   Urban Poverty Strategy. The urban share of total poor in Brazil has increased
significantly, from about 40% in 1980 to about half of the total in 1993. The report
Brazil: A Poverty Assessment (March 1995) sets out a profile of urban poverty. It
indicates, for example, that a key differentiating feature of the poor and the non-poor is
access to basic urban infrastructure. Urban sector strategy has also emphasized the
importance of targeting of benefits to the very poor. The project is part of a poverty-
alleviation strategy for Brazil that involves economic and sector work, country dialogue
and lending in the areas of rural development, health and education as well as urban
development (Annex 1C).
2.21   The primary emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the
public sector, improved environmental management and the appropriate targeting and
delivery of services to the poor. The proposed project is fully consistent both with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and with the Brazilian Government's evolving
urban policy and poverty strategy.



10
G. BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE URBAN SECTOR
2.22  Lessons Learned. Since 1978 the Bank has made 18 loans for urban development
and transport projects in Brazil, totaling about US$1.78 billion. In addition, 19 loans
totaling about US$2.18 billion have been made for water and sewerage projects since
1971, also largely in urban areas. The proposed project would build on lessons learned
over several decades in the urban sector. The recent OED review of urban sector lending'
cites several features of best practice, among them demonstrated borrower ownership,
emphasis on institution-building, secure land tenure for beneficiaries, well-designed
environmental components, and explicit poverty reduction aims. Constraints to successful
implementation are excessive focus on physical outcomes (at the expense of institutional
outcomes), poor design of environmental components, mechanisms that favor high-
standard infrastructure, and inadequate assessment of effective demand. The OED review
argues for a more comprehensive approach to the design of urban projects that secures
project ownership, relies on institutional development and policy reform, taps potential
macroeconomic linkages, strengthens the congruence of objectives and design, and
provides for well-defined monitoring and evaluation. Consistent with these
recommendations and Brazil's decentralization reforms, the Bank's project objectives have
shifted towards improving the capacity of states and municipalities to effectively assume
increased responsibilities for efficient management of resources and services under a series
of projects which began in the southern states of Santa Catarina (Loan 2623-BR --
PROURB - closed in 1993); Parana (Loan 3100-BR - PEDU); Rio Grande do Sul (Loan
3129-BR - P1MES); Minas Gerais (Loan 3639-BR - SOMMA); and CearA (Loan 3789-
BR - PROURB). Lessons from preparation, implementation, mid-term reviews, and
completion of these projects, among others, have been incorporated into project design.
Annex lB presents significant lessons learned and how they are incorporated into the
design of the proposed project.

I1
3. THE STATE OF BAHIA
3.1   The State of Bahia covers an area of about 560,000 square kilometers, or about
the same size as France, making it the fifth largest of Brazil's states and the largest of the
Northeastern states. With I 1.9 million inhabitants (8% of the country's total), Bahia is
more populous that Portugal, and is fourth nationwide in terms of population and first in
the Northeast region. Bahia is composed of three regions: the coastal mata atlantica, or
native Atlantic forest; the cerrado or plains; and the sertdo or semi-arid "outback". The
mata atlatitica is by far the most populous of these areas, in which are located the State's
major urban centers, including Salvador -- the State's capital -- and the nine other cities
which form the Salvador Metropolitan Region (RMS). Bahia is divided administratively
into 15 "economic regions," on the basis of geographical and economic similarities.
A. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
3.2   The State's economic activity has driven its patterns of urban growth.
Traditionally an agricultural region (with 74% of its residents in rural areas in 1950), the
State relied on primary export commodities such as cocoa and other agricultural products
until the 1 970s when the cocoa market collapsed and the State began to diversify into
other areas. Major efforts to industrialize the economy stem from this era, with the
construction of refining/petrochemical, pulp and paper and mining and metallurgical
activities. While economic activity in 1960 was primarily agricultural, by 1993 just 14.5%
of the State's GDP of about US$20 billion was produced in the primary agricultural
sectors, with 34.6% in the secondary industrial sectors and 50. 1% of GDP produced in the
service-related sectors (Annex 3A). Industrialization has brought wealth to the State, with
GDP of the State the sixth in Brazil, amounting to 5% of the country's total GDP. This
transformation of the State's economy has brought a dramatic shift in patterns of urban
growth, with a large part of the population and a large share of GDP generated in urban
areas, particularly in the RMS.
B. URBANIZATION
3.3    As recently as 1980, Bahia was still essentially rural, with less than half its
population (49%) living in urban areas. This reflects the traditional rural character of the
Northeast, and the fact that it industrialized more recently than Brazil, thus giving it
slower urbanization rates than the average for Brazil. By 1991, however, roughly 60% of
Bahia's population, or about 7 million people, lived in urban areas (Annex 3B). While this
leaves Bahia significantly less urbanized than Brazil as a whole (where the average of
urban population as a percent of total is 75%), this level matches the average urbanization
of the Northeast Region. Although several Northeastern states have higher rates of
urbanization, Bahia has by far the greatest absolute number of urban dwellers, with nearly
one-third (27%) of the Northeast's total urban residents, and 28% more than the next-
ranked urban state (Pernambuco). In fact, the states of Pernambuco, Ceara and Bahia
together are home to two-thirds of the urban residents of the Northeast. Bahia has 415
municipalities, 225 of which have total populations over 15,000 (Annex 3C). Projections



12
indicate that by the year 2000, Bahia will have 14.7 million people, or 67% of the total,
living in urban areas.
3.4    Bahia has fewer smallholdings of less than two hectares than the rest of the
Northeast, with roughly 85% of all smallholders being owners (compared with 56% in the
Northeast). Further, drought is not nearly as pervasive as in Ceara, and in the west of
Pernambuco and Piaui. These factors make conditions of rural subsistence farming less
difficult in Bahia than in many other areas of the Northeast, and help explain the still
relatively large rural population, despite significant industrialization.
C. SOCIAL INDICATORS
3.5    While it is one of the country's richest states, Bahia's large population gives it a
comparatively low per capita income of US$1,660, or about 60% of the country's average.
Further, wealth is unevenly distributed, with about one-third of the population living
below the poverty line (Annex 3D).7 The State has the second-lowest level of literacy in
the Northeast (a region which ranks among the worst in Brazil), after Alagoas. Other
social indicators confirm the notable contrast between Bahia's comparatively well-off
status within the Northeast Region and the poor quality of life it affords most of its
residents. Sanitation services are among the Region's worst: 43.7% of Bahia's residents
(73.9% in urban areas) have access to piped water supply (only the State of CearA has
lower coverage); 5% of residents (8.4% in urban areas) have collected waste water (only
the State of Piaui, the poorest state in the country, has lower coverage). There is no
meaningful sewage treatment (Annex 3E). As could be expected from such indicators,
60% of children's hospital visits are caused by poor sanitation, with 30% of the deaths of
children under the age of one year old due to water-borne diseases. There are wide
regional differences among the State's fifteen economic regions (Annex 3F).
D. THE STATE'S DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
3.6   Since the early 1990s the State recognized this contrast between its economic
wealth and the condition of misery of most of its residents. The State's objective,
continued under the current administration which took office in early 1995, is to
modernize and expand its industrial base, with the objective of bringing the State to third
or fourth place in terms of economic strength, while at the same time improving the
quality of life for its residents. In order to meet this objective, the State has established a
clear developmental strategy, at the center of which is the need to strengthen the
administration of urban areas, particularly in the State's interior. The objective is to
gradually shift from providing intermediate goods to the provision of finished products,
both for export to other states and countries, and to meet the needs of the State's
increasingly large urban-based markets. Economic growth will bring increased
7  The poverty line is here defined on the basis of the report Brazil: A Poverty Assessment (March
1995) as a per capita income of about one-third the minimum wage (of September 1990, or about
US$60) in rural and urban areas of the Northeast, and about half the minimum wage in the case of
Salvador.



13
employment opportunities, and will be balanced by a program of investments in the social
sectors, particularly education and health, to prepare a well-qualified work force. In order
to attract investment, however, the State will need to diversify away from its current
geographic industrial center which is the Salvador Metropolitan Region (Regiao
Metropolitana de Salvador-RMS). This implies strengthening of the cities in the interior,
so that they are well-administered and self-sufficient, and attract investment and provide
urban services for their local communities. The proposed project is a direct result of the
State's multi-year development plan and its development strategy beginning more than
two years ago in the previous administration.
3.7   Investment priorities for State development have focused on ongoing projects to
support the health and education sectors, the reformulated rural poverty projects, and
support to the RMS. Planned investments which are of the highest priority in the State
administration are cleanup of the Bahia dos Todos os Santos in the Salvador Metropolitan
area, financed by an IDB loan, a follow-up rural poverty alleviation project supported by a
World Bank loan (3917-BR), and the proposed municipal infrastructure development and
management project.

4. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE
4.1    Objectives. The primary objectives of the proposed Bahia Municipal Management
Project (PRODUR) are to:
(a)   improve the living conditions of the urban poor, through: (i) development
of detailed, reliable systems for mapping of urban poverty in the state to
guide state and local investment strategies; and (ii) a poverty-targeted
program of urban upgrading in critically poor urban areas, or bolsoes de
pobreza (pockets of poverty).
(b)   increase municipal public sector efficiency and sustainability of financing
for key municipal services;
(c)   support privatization and concessioning of service delivery,
(d)   increase cost recovery of municipal investments; and
(e)   strengthen municipal financial management capacity, especially for effective
expenditure control and capital budgeting.
4.2   These project objectives have been explicitly defined in an Urban Development
Policy. The State is commited to strengthening local governments, through sound fiscal
and administrative management, accountability and efficiency in investments and current
expenditures and equity in service provision. As one of the key means of achieving these
goals, the State's intention is to reduce discretionary transfers to municipalities and instead
channel these funds as counterpart to the PRODUIR program, where they will be invested
according to clearly-defined criteria. Urban areas are expected to play a major part in the
future economic growth of the State.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
4.3   The project would consist of four primary components: Municipal Reform (MR)
(US$10.0 million, 4.5 % of total project costs); Institutional Development (ID) (US$10.0
million, 4.5% of total project costs); Urban Infrastructure (UI) (US$186.5 million, 84%
of costs); and poverty-targeted Urban Upgrading (UU) (US$15.5 million, 7% of project
costs). A detailed project description is provided in Annex 4A, and is summarized below.
Part Al: Municipal Reform (MR)
4.4   The Municipal Reform component, which is being tried on a pilot basis, would
finance basic reforms that would reduce the role of the municipal government in the



15
delivery of urban infrastructure and social services where appropriate. This is to be
accomplished through either privatizing or using private concessions for municipal
services such as water supply and sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal, bus and
other transport, operation of markets and slaughterhouses. Funds under the MR
component would finance: (i) the technical studies needed to define the reforms; (ii) the
actual costs of specialist assistance to implement the reforms (e.g., the cost of audit
specialists and investment firms); and (iii) the incremental recurrent cost of the actual
privatization or concession (for instance, if a municipality decided to privatize its solid
waste collection service, the loan could finance the cost of the transfer to the private entity
on a declining basis).
Part A2: Institutional Development (ID)
4.5    The institutional development (ID) component (Part B) consists of technical
assistance, training and equipment purchases for municipalities and for CAR, as well as
studies associated with the modernization and administrative reforms of the municipalities.
Needs would be evaluated in three areas: (a) fiscal and administrative; (b) planning; and
(c) training. The menu of possible ID interventions are shown in Table 3, and would
include, inter alia:
Table 3: Eligible Institutional Development Investments
Investments                    Description
Fiscal and Administrative      Upgrading property tax cadastres; improving procedures,
policies and physical infrastructure for billing and
collection of property and other taxes and tariffs; and
improving procurement procedures.
Planning                       Preparing and updating master plans; updating real
property mapping; and works and construction codes and
technical standards. Also included would be assistance
for preparation of environmental legislation and
strengthening local environmental councils.
Training                       Training in areas complementary to above, including
other priority areas such as environmental education.
4.6    Of the total of 415 municipalities in the State, it is expected that about 77 will
participate in the Municipal Reform and the Institutional Development components.
These would be the key to entry into the PRODUR program. Individualized technical
assistance and training plans for the MR and ID components would be developed for each



16
municipality on the basis of a simple diagnostic questionnaire based on rapid-assessment
methodologies successfully employed in the South of Brazil and elsewhere.
4.7    Technical assistance interventions would be combined with on-the-job training, to
ensure effectiveness. On the basis of the diagnosis, a Municipal Reform and Institutional
Development Plan, or Plano de Reformas e de Modernizaqao InstitucionalMunicipal
(PRIM) would be prepared together with the executing agency, CAR. It would then be
discussed and agreed with each municipality in consultation with local groups and
representative bodies, setting specific targets for municipal reforms as well as for financial
and institutional improvements. To encourage participation in this initial phase of the
project, and ensure wide access to all municipalities, preparation of PRIMs would be
grant-financed. Once committed to such a satisfactory PRIM, municipalities would be
eligible for grants for technical assistance and training. Following initiation of this
process, and providing adequate creditworthiness (see paras. 5.9-5.10), client
municipalities would be eligible to apply for sub-loans for infrastructure investments.
Grants for technical assistance would be linked to performance standards regarding
resource mobilization, cost-recovery and management efficiency which, in turn, would be
linked to sub-project eligibility criteria for infrastructure (para. 5.16).
4.8    This approach builds on past sector work and project experience by establishing a
long-term plan for strengthening of local governments. Both the willingness to reform and
to undertake the institutional development components increase the level of commitment
for capacity strengthening of local governments by working through a state-level
institution which will develop a strategy, create procedures, set standards and norms to
facilitate institutional strengthening of municipalities. Implementation of technical
assistance and training would be done through private sector, university and other
providers, with standard-setting and supervision and monitoring by CAR, which over time
will shift to providing "wholesale" interventions aimed at fostering private sector delivery
of technical assistance and training.
Part B: Strengthening of CAR and poverty study
4.9    A technical assistance package has also been developed under this component that
would strengthen the CAR in this role. Also included would be a statewide poverty-
mapping effort which would enable the State to gauge the extent to which the needs of the
urban poor were being addressed by the project -- and make mid-term adjustments if
required -- as well as serving as an instrument to guide other State programs.
Part C: Urban Infrastructure (UI)
4.10   Urban infrastructure (UI) investments (Part C) would focus on basic urban
infrastructure for which municipalities typically do not have sufficient resources without
external financing. It is estimated that the 77 or so municipalities with urban populations
above 15,000 would be the universe among which clients would be drawn for the
infrastructure component. All these municipalities are expected to participate over the life
of the Bank-financed project. Sub-project investments would be fully repaid at long-term
market-approximating interest rates (para. 5.5), with full cost recovery via user charges



17
based on economic costs, or indirectly via increased property values and tax collection as
a result of infrastructure improvements (para. 7.6 and Annex 7). Investments shown in
Table 4 would be eligible:
Table 4: Eligible Infrastructure Components
Investments           Description
Urban        These would be the large primary investments, which would be carried out
Infrastructure    in an integrated fashion whenever possible (e.g., sewerage networks
togetlier with street paving and drainage).
Water       Water treatment and amplification of production; incremental network
extension and domestic connections; operational and commercial
improvements, such as metering, leak detection and rehabilitation of
equipment.
Sewerage         Equipment for treatment systems, extension of networks and domestic
connections. Well-tested, low-cost technologies, in particular in small
communities, would be encouraged.
Solid Waste      Solid waste collection equipment, construction of landfills, and equipment
for final disposal. In this component also well-tested, alternative low-cost
solutions would be encouraged.
Paving and     Street paving, macro- and micro-drainage, flood and erosion control,
Drainage      channeling of watercourses and vias sanitarias.
Complementary    A group of smaller-scale investments, which are usually done in
Investments     conjunction with the larger basic infrastructure investments above,
including, inter alia, street lighting, sidewalks and trees/shrubbery.
Regional      A small amount of funds would be available for well-justified regional
Investments     cooperative investments, such as multi-municipal landfills. The project also
includes the construction of municipal markets and slaughter houses as well
as the construction or expansion of air, road and water transport passenger
shelters and tourist bureaus.
Part D: Urban Upgrading (UU)
4.11  The urban upgrading component would be targeted to areas with average
household income below three minimum wages per month. The objective of the
component would be to provide a package of integrated urban infrastructure investments



18
to low-income residents in the peripheral areas of cities and towns, where the bulk of the
urban poor are located. The component would be based on standardized designs and unit
costs and would be maraged by a special unit within CAR. Eligibility criteria would
include that: (a) beneficiary areas must be within a maximum threshold income level (for
example, three minimum salaries per month per household); (b) the investments would be
limited by a maximum project cost per capita; (b) investments should be integrated; (c)
community participation and organization would need to be demonstrated; (d) residents
would need to have possession of land title, or the area would be able to be converted, or
residents would need to have lived in the area for equal to or more than the amount of
time stipulated by law before titling becomes automatic. Since this is a new approach to
infrastructure service delivery in the State, the overall scope would be limited to US$15.5
million, and it would start small in the first year (limited to US$2.0 million). Publicity for
the program would include reference to the limited funds available under this component
for the first year, in order to stimulate demand. It was agreed that the municipalities would
contribute 15% of the cost of the urban upgrading component. The Bank loan will finance
45% of the total cost and the remaining 40% will be covered by the state. Both the World
Bank funding and the State contribution would be passed on to the municipalities as
grants.
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
4.12  Project Costs. The project cost table is shown in Table 5 below. As shown, total
project costs are estimated to be US$222.0 million equivalent, including taxes. The
proposed Bank loan of US$100.0 million equivalent would finance about 45% of total
costs (50% of costs less taxes). A detailed table of cost estimates is presented in Annex
4B.
4.13  Project costs would consist of about US$10.0 million equivalent (or 4.5% of
project costs) for each of the municipal reform and institutional development components;
US$186.5 million (or 84% of costs) for urban infrastructure; and about US$15.5 million
(about 7% of costs) for low-income urban upgrading. Costs have been calculated in
Brazilian reais (base costs of 1995 updated to May 1996) and converted to equivalent US
dollars at prevailing exchange rates. The aggregate scale of investments at the local level
was determined by the estimated demand for services, borrowing capacity of
municipalities, and counterpart payment capacity of the State and municipalities (see para.
6.8). A total of 77 municipalities have already been screened for the PRODTR program
and 14 sub projects have been appraised for inclusion in the first year program.

4.14  The foreign exchange component is estimated to be about US$52.5 million (24%
of base costs). Indirect taxes are about US$22.0 million (10% of base costs) and will be
financed by the State. Due to the project's programmatic approach -- whereby the Bank
loan would finance a time-slice of municipal investments -- contingencies have not been
budgeted. Rough cost estimates for civil works are based on existing engineering designs
and unit costs of other similar investments in Brazil, supported by engineering estimates
and recent contract prices. Consultant service costs are based on prevailing local and
foreign person-month rates.
4.15  Financing Plan. The project financing plan is shown in Table 6 below. As
indicated, the project would be financed by the proposed loan, totaling US$100.0 million
(45% of project costs); by State resources of about US$88.8 million (40% of project
costs); and by municipal counterpart of about US$33.2 million (15% of project costs).
The proposed loan would finance all expected foreign exchange costs (about US$52.5
million). The loan would also finance about US$47.5 million of local expenditures, due to
the widespread availability of competitive locally-provided goods and services in Brazil.

D. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY
During Negotiations, agreement was reached on the project financing plan and the
Borrower's guarantee regarding necessary project counterpart funds

4.16  The State of Bahia. The Borrower would be the State of Bahia. The State would
use the proceeds of the Bank loan and its own counterpart funds to capitalize a municipal
development fund (FUNDlURBANO), to be managed by a commercial bank to be selected
under procedures to be agreed. A financial evaluation of the State is given in paras. 6. 1-
6.2.
4.17 The State's Companhia de Desenvolvimento e Avao Regional (CAR) would be the
project's executing agency. During Negotiations, agreement was reached that CAR would
execute Parts A-D of the project. CAR would have primary responsibility for all aspects
of project implementation, including evaluation of sub-borrowers' financial and
institutional capacity, diagnosis of institutional requirements and formulation of technical
assistance and training packages, evaluation of technical, economic and financial feasibility
of sub-projects, and all general aspects of management, operation and monitoring of the
project. These procedures would all be undertaken on the basis of agreed Operational
Manuals (para. 5.3). Environmental evaluations would be done through the State's Centro
de Recursos Ambientais (CRA; see para. 5.20 and Annex 5H).
4.18  CAR was created by State Law in 1983 as a public "autarky," and later
transformed into a public company in order to provide more flexibility in implementation
of its responsibilities. CAR's shares are wholly owned by the State. CAR's Executive
Director is appointed by the Governor. The Secretary of Planning serves as Chairman of
the Board of Directors. CAR is headquartered in the State's capital, Salvador, and has



21
regional offices in seven medium-sized cities around the State. CAR has historically acted
primarily in the rural sector, and in this capacity has significant experience implementing
decentralized programs, including the World Bank-financed Northeast Rural Development
Program (or PAPP; Loans 2523-BR and 2524-BR). The implementation of the PAPP in
Bahia was in fact one of the most successful of these state-based programs. As of 1991,
CAR has also been given responsibility for the State's programs in urban areas. This is a
significant challenge for CAR, which has an excellent history and experience in the rural
sectors but which has relatively little experience in urban areas. A further challenge stems
from CAR's recent assumption of the responsibilities of technical assistance to
municipalities, a role previously performed by a now-defunct State company, CEMUR.
4.19  Detailed discussions have been held with the State and CAR regarding the
institutional capacity of the latter, and plans for strengthening capabilities in the urban
area. Plans include restructuring CAR into three Departments: (a) Regional Development
(for rural-oriented programs); (b) Urban Development; and (c) Municipal Action (for
support to institutional strengthening of local governments). The management and
infrastructure aspects as well as the institutional development and municipal reform
components of PRODUR would fall under the Urban Development Department. The
ongoing PAPP and its successor, the Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Program
(NRPA), would be handled by CAR's Regional Development division. CAR also has
plans to establish about 12 additional regional offices, in the context of the PRODUR and
NRPA projects.
4.20  Regarding specific project tasks, CAR has established a financial nucleus in the
Urban Development Department, which has been trained in public financial analysis, as
well as similar groups for economic and technical evaluation of sub-projects. It was
agreed that CAR would hire specialist consultants, as needed, to assist with project
implementation.
4.21   Status of Proiect Preparation. Project preparation began during the late 1980s by
a group in the office of the Secretary of Planning. Many of those involved in this initial
stage of preparation remain involved in the current State government administration;
continuity is an important factor in the advanced status of the project. Equally important,
CAR has hired consultants to assist in the preparation of the project: one to guide them in
the details of project implementation, and a specialized firm to assist in the preparation of
operating manuals. This seems a successful approach to project preparation which may be
replicable in other projects. Detailed designs for all first-year sub-projects are underway.
These and other documents related to project preparation are available in the Project File
(see Annex 8).



22
5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
5.1   The Bahia Municipal Infrastructure Development and Management Project
(PRODUJR) will support the development of municipal reforms and efficient financial
management capacity on the one hand, and priority infrastructure investments on the other
hand. The Institutiohal Development and Municipal Reform Components will be financed
by grants to the municipalities and the Infrastructure component will be financed through
an urban development fund. The project's reform component will ensure that the
municipalities in the state reduce their role in the delivery of urban services through
privatizing and concessioning of most of such services. Through the proposed project, the
Bank loan and State counterpart funds would capitalize the PRODUR Municipal
Development Fund (FUNDURBANO) which would on-lend resources to municipalities
for economically-viable urban infrastructure investments on the basis of well-defined sub-
borrower creditworthiness and sub-project eligibility criteria. To ensure that as many of
the municipalities as possible participate in the municipal reform and institutional
development components the Bank loan and the state counterpart will fully finance these
two project interventions on a grant basis. Poverty-targeted urban upgrading would be
financed by a combination of grants and local contributions (para 4.10).
5.2   While CAR would handle all day-to-day activities of PRODLUR, program policy
would be handled by a Board of Directors. The Board would be chaired by the State
Secretariat of Planning, and membership would include representatives from the
Secretariat of Finance, other government agencies, and the Association of Municipalities.
CAR would serve as the Executive Secretariat of the Board. The organization chart for
PRODUR is presented in Annex 5A. Institutional and implementation arrangements for
the proposed project are detailed in Annex 5B.
5.3   Operational arrangements, based on those developed under similar ongoing
programs in the states of Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Ceara, are set out
in the Program's Operational Manual (OM). The OM volumes include:
(a)   Orientation Manual;
(b)   Publicity Flier;
(c)   Guidelines for Evaluation of sub-borrowers,
(d)   Procurement Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents,
(e)   Sub-Project Evaluation;
(f)    Disbursement Manual; and
(g)   Monitoring and Evaluation.



23
Final versions were presented for review at Negotiations at which it was ageed that the
PRODVR program would be carried out in accordance with the Operational Manual
(OM). After initial testing the OM would be further simplified and summarized in small
leaflets which would be used in the future marketing of the program. The OM is
described further in Annex 5C.
B. THE PRODUR MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT F UND
5.4   The PRODUR Municipal Development Fund (FUNDURBANO) would be
established by State law (para. 5. 18). As noted, CAR, would perform all sub-project and
sub-borrower evaluations, and has experience in this type of review (paras. 4.17-4.20).
Loan administration and management of the fund would be undertaken by the state
development bank of Bahia, DESENBANCO. About US$84.0 million equivalent of the
Bank loan would capitalize the FUNDURBANO, together with State resources, in a two-
to-one proportion. This is equal to the full amount less about US$16.0 million, which,
together with State counterpart would finance the municipal reform and institutional
development as well as the low-income urban upgrading component, which would be
financed separately from the FUNDURBANO . The FUNDURBANO would on-lend to
municipalities and up to 85% of the cost of eligible infrastructure sub-projects. The
remaining counterpart (minimum 15%) would be provided by sub-borrowers, through
payment of invoices (or in-kind labor contributions, in the case of smaller municipalities).
5.5   Terms and Conditions. Sub-loans would be made to sub-borrowers in three
categories, with terms of up to five, 10 and 15 years (including grace periods of one to
three years), depending on the cost-recovery profile of the investments. Sub-loans would
carry an interest rate equal to the rates of the World Bank loan to Bahia plus a "spread"
of 3% yielding an estimated project average rate on the order of 10%). All sub-loan
balances, disbursements and repayments would be denominated in local currency. It was
agreed that local currency sub-loan amounts and balances would be adjusted for inflation
using the prevailing rate of inflation in Brazil as measured by the IGP-M or any other
adjustment index satisfactory to the Bank and Bahia. Table 6 presents sub-loan terms and
conditions for each type of investment.7

5.6  It was agreed during Negotiations that sub-loans would be guaranteed by
municipalities' value-added tax (ICMS) revenues (or, in cases where this is insufficient, by
the municipal participation fund (FPM). If a case of non-payment occurs, requiring the
invoking of a guarantee, PRODUR would not re-lend to that sub-borrower until the
situation is satisfactorily resolved. In order to ensure a wide distribution of project
benefits, it was agreed during Negotiations that no single sub-borrower would be able to
borrow annually more than US$15 million, without prior consultation between the
Borrower and the Bank.
5.7   Flow of Funds. The Borrower has provided a diagram showing the projected flow
of funds from the various financing sources to CAR, the financial agent and sub-borrowers
(Annex SD); and a model which simulates funds flows on basis of the terms, estimated
lending, and returns to the FUNDURBANO over a 20-year period (available in the Project
File.) If the project is implemented according to schedule, the revolving nature of the
Fund would enable it to continue lending funds of roughly the same order of magnitude in
the five-year period following project completion as was lent during the peak of project
execution.
C. CAR's APPRAISAL PROCESS
5.8   CAR's Urban Department (DU) would handle all aspects of management and
operation of the PRODUR Program, including preparation of all sub-borrower and sub-
project appraisals according to selection criteria set out in the Operational Manual.
During appraisal, CAR presented the Bank with evidence of satisfactory increased staffing



25
and computerization of the DU. Annex 5E sets out in detail CAR's appraisal process,
which is summarized below.
Sub-Borrower Eligibility Criteria
5.9    Given PRODUR's essentially reform and urban infrastructure objectives, it will
focus its activities principally in those municipalities with significant urban characteristics.
In addition to meeting the creditworthiness criteria (see Chapter 6) municipalities wishing
to participate in PRODUR would have to meet one of the following criteria: (i) have an
urban population of at least 15,000 in 1991 according to the census of the Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics-
IBGE); or (ii) be one of the 33 strategic urban centers as defined in Bahia's Urban
Development Strategy.8 In addition, municipalitites with a debt capacity of US$1 million
are eligible independently of their population. It is expected that about 77 municipalities
will be eligible to participate in PRODUR. Full sub-borrower eligibility criteria are
detailed in the Program's Operational Manual. Key steps for entry are as follows:
(a)    signature of a Participation Agreement (Convenio de Adesao) which
formalizes municipal interest in PRODUR and commitment to its
principles;
(b)    completion of an assessment of the potential for municipal reform as well
as an institutional and financial diagnosis, according to the rapid
assessment methodology developed and tested under similar programs in
other states;
(c)    establishment of an agreed set of institution-building actions, with clearly-
defined performance targets;
5.10   To undertake infrastructure sub-loans, municipalities and water agencies would
have to meet the following additional creditworthiness criteria:
(a)    demonstrated compliance with Federal legislation on payment of taxes and
other obligations;
(b)    a clear demonstration that either:
(i)    the municipality's primary surplus during the preceding year is at
least 15% of its total revenues (excluding credit); or
s   These cities are highlighted in the State's current Urban Development Strategy because of their
potential for economic development related to major industrial or infrastructure projects or tourism.
Thirty strategic cities (with urban population of less than 15,000) are included: Conde, Jandaira,
Cachoeira, Sao Felix, Camamu, Ubaitaba, Alcobaca, Caravelas, Mucuri, Nova Vicosa, Prado, Santa
Cruz de Cabralia, Araci, Jeremoaba, Monte Santo, Tucano, Riachao do Jacuipe, Curaca, Andarai,
Boquira, Lencois, Macaubas, Mucuge, Rio de Contas, Riacho de Santana, Correntina, Formoso do
Rio Preto, Riachao das Neves, Santana, Livramento do Brumado, Santo Se, Capim Grosso and Sao
Desiderio.



26
(ii)   total outstanding and proposed debt and guarantees do not exceed
total municipal revenues (excluding credit) of the previous year,
adjusted for inflation;
(c)    demonstrate that it has adequate counterpart funds (minimum 15 % of the
cost of the sub-project);
(d)    show adequate mechanisms for cost recovery; and
(e)    provide a state or national transfer as subloan guarantee.
Sub-Project Eligibility Criteria
5.11   Sub-project eligibility criteria are set out in the OM. During Negotiations it was
agreed that all sub-projects would undergo technical, economic, financial and
environmental evaluation by a team of CAR staff.
5.12   Technical evaluation involves analysis of demand for the service, and
demonstration that the chosen alternative is the least-cost means of meeting demand. This
evaluation would be performed by CAR's technical unit, which would be comprised of
urban engineers, with the assistance of specialized consultants as necessary (for example
for solid waste disposal, or alternative sewage treatment). Proposals will be returned to
municipalities for revision if necessary. In the case of sewage treatment and solid waste
disposal sub-projects, low-cost, well-tested9 alternative technologies such as anaerobic
sewage treatment should be encouraged, where appropriate.
5.13   Economic cost-benefit analysis would be carried out to determine project viability.
The minimum criteria for sub-projects would be that they provide an internal economic
rate of return (IERR) which meets or exceeds the opportunity cost of capital, estimated at
12%. In the case of revenue-earning services, such as water, sewerage and public lighting,
economic benefits would be calculated on the basis of tariff revenues as a proxy for
willingness to pay. In the case of non-revenue earning services, such as drainage and
paving, economic benefits would be based on increased land values as a result of the
infrastructure improvements. For those sub-projects estimated to cost less than
US$500,000, estimation of per capita benefits would be sufficient, providing the technical
solution is least-cost and benefits are shown to be largely within the municipality. Health
benefits would also be quantified using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as a measure
for sewerage treatment and macro drainage sub-projects (para. 7.6).
5.14   Financial cost-benefit analysis would provide the basis for determining cost-
recovery. All infrastructure sub-projects (with the exception of some sewage treatment
and solid waste disposal), are expected to achieve full cost recovery. Sub-project
investments would be linked to specific targets to increase user fees and taxes, to be
Several Brazilian States and localities (i.e. the State of Parana) have developed simple low-cost
primary sewage treatment, for example, which have been well-tested, with favorable results.

agreed with municipalities in the PRIM and reflected in the terms and conditions of sub-
loans for infrastructure investments.
5.15  Environmental Screening. All necessary environmental evaluation and assessment
would be part of required documentation (para. 5.20 and Annex 5F). Environmental
assessments, where required, would be completed by private consultants, evaluated by
CRA and submitted to CAR prior to signature of sub-loan contracts.
5.16  Infrastructure investments would be linked to specific institutional development
and/or municipal reform interventions. For example, investments in solid waste collection
and disposal, if determined to be a municipal priority and economically viable, could be
accompanied by appropriate increases in the relevant user charges and/or taxes, technical
assistance in zoning and land-use, in the improved enforcement of local environmental
regulations and training for involved staff at the local level. In this way, the institutional
development and infrastructure components would be fully complementary. For each sub-
borrower, a team of one engineer, one economist/financial analyst and one institutional
specialist will be assigned to work together with local authorities, from diagnosis and
PRIM to evaluation and supervision of the infrastructure investments.
Review Procedure
5.17   Given the large number of small and medium-sized sub-projects expected during
this project, CAR would undertake the evaluation of municipal sub-components beyond
those evaluated during appraisal according to agreed criteria set out in the program's
Operational Manual10 Below these amounts ex-post reviews, on the basis of spot-
checking, would be undertaken during supervision. Sub-projects would be considered for
review until three months before the project's Closing Date.
D. LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS
5.18  Implementation arrangements for the project would be formalized in the following
legal documents and other minutes of understanding:
(a)    State law authorizing the State to borrow from the Bank'
(b)    State law establishing the FUNDURBANO;
(c)    State decree regulating the FUNDURBANO;
(d)   Contract(s) between the State of Bahia, CAR and the financial agent(s);
(e)   Model participation agreement (conWvnio de adesdo) between the State,
CAR and municipality;
0  It should be noted that this review is separate from the prior review thresholds for procurement
(para. 5.25) and disbursement (para. 5.27).



28
(f)    Model negotiation agreement (minute of understanding) between CAR and
municipality (for the municipal reform and/or institutional development
component);
(g)   Model Sub-Loan Contract between the financial agent, CAR and
municipality for on-lending fund in support of a sub-project;
(h)   Model Grant Agreement between the State and the municipality for
retransmitting funds to support a municipal reform and/or institutional
development, or to partially support an urban upgrading component; and
(i)    Model municipal law authorizing a municipality to participate in PRODUR.
5.19  Drafts of all of these documents have been prepared. Agreement on the final
version of the model Sub-Loan Contracts and Grant Agreements was reached at
Negotiations. It was further agreed that all conditions present in the legal agreements
between the Bank and CAR, the State and the Federal Government, would be reflected in
the sub-agreements, as necessary.
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
5.20   Specific guidelines for evaluation of municipal projects with environmental impact
have been established by the State environmental agency, Centro de Recursos Ambientais
(CRA) for the purposes of the project. The new rules establish guidelines for
environmental screening by project size and expected impact (on the basis of physical
measures, such as pipe size for water and sewerage). These guidelines are roughly
comparable to similar ones in other states, and are compatible with both federal
government law and Bank guidelines. There are three categories: the first, for projects of
significant size and impact, would be a full environmental impact assessment and report
(EIA/RIMA); the second category, for projects of smaller size and impact, would be a
simplified environmental assessment, or environmental control report (RCA). The third
category of investments would require only licensing. Environmental assessments under
the project will be prepared by private consultants and reviewed by CRA. The
Operational Manual would stipulate that environmental assessment would be conducted as
needed, consistent with Brazilian law and Bank guidelines, prior to signature of sub-loan
contracts. It was agreed that EIA/RIMAs and RCAs would have been completed for sub-
projects with environmental impact," consistent with Brazilian and State laws and Bank
guidelines, prior to any disbursement on the relevant component. It was also agreed that
the Bank would have prior review of any resettlement plans. Furthermore, the state
government would prepare and adopt an acceptable framework for resettlement plans by
August 31, 1997. None of the 14 sub-projects to be implemented during the first year
involves resettlement. CAR would provide technical assistance to municipalities and
oversee the environmental screening process, from selection of consultants (for which it
will maintain an open data base of firms) to subsequent evaluation by CRA. CAR will also
l Although not foreseen under the project, this would include any impact and plans for resettlement, if
necessary.



29
maintain an agreed model terms of reference for environmental assessments, prepared in
conjunction with CRA and the Bank (Annex 5F). CRA is being strengthened to perform
its role under the recently-approved Pollution Control Project for the Bahia de Todos os
Santos, financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Significant involuntary
resettlement (more than 100-200 individuals) is not foreseen under this project. In the
even that any such resettlement is proposed in the course of project implementation,
however, the state and CAR agreed that any sub-project involving such resettlement
would be subject to the prior review and appraisal of the Bank prior to disbursement, and
that resettlement plans satisfactory to the Bank would be prepared.
F. PROCUREMENT
5.21   All procurement of goods and works would be carried out following the World
Bank's Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (published in
January 1995 and revised in January 1996). Civil works under the proposed project
would represent about US$ 124.0 million, or 56% of total project costs; equipment and
materials about US$77.7 million, or 35%; and consultant services, including technical
assistance, training, studies, engineering design and works supervision, about US$20.4
million, or 9% of costs. Proposed procurement arrangements for the project are
summarized in Table 8. Annex 5G provides estimated profiles for sub-project contracts
5.22   Civil Works. The estimated value for civil works contracts is US$124.0 million.
Due to the nature of the project, there will be a number of small contracts as well as larger
ones. Most contracts will be scattered throughout municipalities in the State and average
US$100,000 - US$3.0 million in value, with a few exceptions of works for larger projects,
expected to cost over US$5.0 million. It is expected that the smaller, dispersed contracts
will not be attractive to foreign bidders. It was agreed that all contracts for civil works
estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$5.0 million, and up to an aggregate value
of US$15 rnillion per beneficiary, will be procured on the basis of national competitive
bidding (NCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Procurement under NCB will use the
standard bidding documents for Brazil agreed with the Bank. Foreign firms will be
allowed to participate in the bidding. Above these limits, procurement would be carried
out on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB), using standard bidding
documents issued by the Bank. For small works costing US$350,000 or less, all contracts
would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written
invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic
specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the
Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the
contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the
experience and resources to successfully complete the contract

5.23  Goods. Purchase of equipment and materials is expected to total about US$77.7
million under the project. The majority of these purchases will be small machinery,
equipment and materials necessary for the installation of infrastructure services, and pipes,
connections, water meters and other equipment associated with domestic water and
sewerage connections. While a large number of contracts are estimated to range between
US$50,000 and US$250,000, there will be some scope for economy-of-scale purchasing
of equipment, and a special effort will be made to identify ICB packages above these
limits. It was agreed that all contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost less
than the equivalent of US$250,000, and not exceeding an aggregate value per beneficiary
of US$3 million, would be procured on the basis of NCB procedures satisfactory to the
Bank, with foreign firms allowed to participate in the bidding. Above these limits,
procurement will be carried out on the basis of ICB using standard bidding documents
issued by the Bank. ICB documents would indicate that domestic preference would apply
in bid evaluation. National shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank would be
allowable for small equipment purchases estimated to cost the equivalent of less than
US$50,000, up to an aggregate of US$250.000 per beneficiary.
5.24  Consultant Services. All technical assistance, studies, training, detailed
engineering design and construction supervision contracts, amounting in total to about
US$20.4 million, will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the UJse of
Consultants (August 198]), including proposals from foreign and local firms.



31
5.25  The GOB's procurement regulations and procedures have been revised through a
new procurement law (No. 8,666 of June 21, 1993). The new law improves a number of
procedures, and it specifically authorizes executing agencies to procure goods and services
financed by multilateral institutions in accordance with the norms and procedures of the
institutions. But it also includes some provisions which are or can be interpreted as
diverging from Bank procurement policy. However, standard bidding documents for NCB
for goods and works have been recently agreed with GOB (April 1995), and most of these
differences have been resolved. Special provisions applicable to NCB procedures were
agreed during Negotiations and incorporated into the Loan Agreement. Procurement
under the project would be overseen by CAR's urban department, and managed by
individual municipalities.
5.26  Standard bidding documents and contracts for civil works and services under NCB
and local quotation methods have been prepared and are set out in the Operational
Manual. A model letter of invitation and standard contract for consultant services is also
be included in the Operational Manual. All procurement under ICB (about 22% of total
project costs) will be subject to prior Bank review of advertising, bidding documents, bid
evaluation and contract awards. In the interest of expediting project execution, all
procurement under NCB would be reviewed by CAR. However, NCB procurement for
works expected to cost US$2.0 million and above, and totaling US$63.8 million, would be
subject to the Bank's prior review. The proposed arrangements would provide prior-
review coverage of about 56% of the total cost of Bank-financed goods and works
(Annex 5G). This coverage is considered appropriate. A general announcement of the
types and sizes of contracts to be awarded during the subsequent one-to-two year period
would be published at the start of each year in the journal Development Business and in
newspapers of wide national circulation in Brazil. Agreement was reached on these
procurement arrangements at Negotiations.
G. DISBURSEMENT
5.27  The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed according to the following
categories and percentages:
(i)   for sub-loans or grants for infrastructure investments, 53% of the
applicable disbursement under the sub-loan or grant, and 100% of
the sub-loan or grant amounts in the case of foreign expenditures,
excluding taxes;
(ii)  for grants for institutional development or municipal reform sub-
projects, 45% of amounts disbursed from the grant of 100% of the
amount of the grant in case of foreign expenditures;
(iii)  for goods purchased in connection with the institutional
strengthening of CAR, 50%; and
(iv)  for consultant services to strengthen CAR and for the studies to be
undertaken by CAR, 100% of total expenditures.



32
5.28  Disbursements are expected to be completed over a six-year period, as reflected in
Annex 5H. A disbursement schedule somewhat shorter than the regional profile of seven
years is justified by the experience and competence of the executing agency and the
project's timing within the local electoral cycle. The Project's expected Completion Date
is September 30, 2001, and Closing Date is March 31, 2002.
5.29  In order to ensure efficient and timely implementation of the project, it was agreed
during Negotiations that a Special Account with an authorized allocation of US$7.0
million equivalent would be established in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank and
the Borrower. The initial allocation for the Special Account will be US$5 million until
disbursements reach US$30 million. Because the project would involve a substantial
number of small contracts, disbursement for civil works contracts amounting to less than
US$2.0 million, for purchase of goods amounting to less than $350,000 and for consultant
services from firms amounting to less than US$100,000 and for consultant services from
individuals for less than US$50,000, would not require the Bank's prior review and would
be made under the Statement of Expenditures (SOE), as well as subloans and grants,
procedure, prepared and certified by CAR, which has adequate accounting controls for
this purpose. Expenditures for contracts above these limits would be documented. All
documentation would be retained by the DU for inspection during Bank supervision and
be subject to review of external auditors. Because several sub-projects are well-advanced,
retroactive financing of up to 5% of the loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred not
more than twelve months prior to Loan Signature, would be made. During Negotiations,
agreement was reached on these disbursement arrangements.
H. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING ARRANGEMENTS
5.30  The accounts of CAR, the project's executing agency, are examined annually by
private external auditors, as well as State-level government auditing bodies. Accounting
practices and procedures, including the chart of accounts, have been reviewed and found
satisfactory. During Negotiations agreement was reached on the following accounting and
audit arrangements: (a) that the financial agent would maintain a separate, consolidated
project account of sub-project expenditures for monitoring and audit purposes, to be
audited along with CAR corporate accounts by private external auditors acceptable to the
Bank; and (b) that the project accounts of participating municipalities be maintained
separately, and be subject to annual audits by the State's Tribunal de Clonias, or
Accounting Tribunal, provided it continues to meet adequate standards of independence,
capacity, and timeliness. The Tribunal de Contas of Bahia has been evaluated by the Bank
as having the necessary independence. The reports under (a) would be furnished to the
Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year. Agreement would also be sought
that a summary of key issues noted in individual municipal audits would be prepared
annually by qualified consultants and furnished to the Bank no later than eight months
after the end of the fiscal year. This annual report would be financed under the
Institutional Development component.



33
I. MONITORING, MID-TERM REVIEW AND EVALUATION
5.31  In addition to CAR's site visits, sub-borrowers would be expected to present periodic
progress reports on project implementation (with periodicity established in sub-loan contracts),
on the basis of which CAR would furnish concise quarterly progress reports to the Bank. These
reports would compare actual and forecast progress. The detailed range of project monitoring
indicators is provided in the OM. These include standard agreed performance indicators
monitoring physical, financial and operational progress of individual sub-projects, and
aggregated project performance for all sub-projects. A set of "key impact indicators" and
targets, selected from among the group of indicators to be monitored during the project, would
be agreed, including inter alia: (a) number of Participation Agreements signed; (b) number of
PRIMs completed; (c) overall project completion, measured in expenditures; (d) discretionary
transfers as a percent of total State transfers to municipalities; and (e) average property tax per
capita in the State (see Annex 5I). These indicators, among others, would be monitored in
quarterly reports. Agreement was reached during Negotiations that quarterly reports be
furnished no later than 30 days after the end of each of the following quarters: March 31, June
30 and September 30, and an annual report would be prepared for the December 31 period, to
be furnished within two months of year-end. These reports would include, inter alia, the
monitoring indicators set out in the OM, as well as a forecast investment plan. Reporting
requirements would begin with the first full quarter following Loan Effectiveness.
5.32  In order to review project progress, and if necessary reorient implementation, agreement
would be sought during Negotiations that a Mid-Term Review would be scheduled
approximately three years after Loan Effectiveness. Agreement was reached that the Borrower,
through CAR, would prepare and furnish to the Bank an Implementation Completion Report
within six months after the Closing Date. The supervision plan for the project (Annex 5K)
includes key specific objectives of the mid-term review.
J. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
5.33   Annex 5J presents the proposed project's agreed implementation schedule, which
outlines key actions in project execution for smooth implementation. This will be further
detailed through the use of project management software, to be established and programmed
during the project's inception mission. Of primary importance are targets for Participation
Agreements with municipalities, procurement of major works, and progress on technical
assistance interventions. This schedule is to be prepared on a rolling quarterly basis.
Arrangements for project supervision are outlined in the supervision plan in Annex 5K Physical
project supervision will be carried out by the regional offices of CAR, the DU and its
consultants on the basis of site checks.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. STATE FINANCES
6.1    A detailed review of the financial situation and creditworthiness of the State of
Bahia was carried out using the methodology developed in sector work on Brazilian State
Debt12 This review showed that the previous State administration embarked on a policy of
sound financial management which placed the State of Bahia in a relatively stable financial
condition, despite macroeconomic difficulties at the national level. Beginning in 1991,
State officials designed a plan to put the State's financial house in order. A Federal law of
November 1993 (No. 8,727) gave the States a window of opportunity to reschedule
certain debts, an opportunity fully exploited by Bahia. Approximately US$1.5 billion of
State debt was rescheduled. In addition, virtually all of the debt owed by the State
treasury to BANEB, and thence by BANEB to federal financial institutions, was
transformed into a loan owed directly by the State treasury to the Federal treasury, thus
ending the conflict inherent in the State's borrowing from its own bank. Previous to this,
the State's financial management could be characterized as poor, with persistent current
account deficits until 1987. Beginning in 1990, however, the current account surpluses
have been significant. Since 1989, revenues have increased in real terms by 45% following
the fiscal reforms of the 1988 Constitution,
6.2   The finances of the state have improved remarkably as a result of the above
measures. Further efforts to streamline administrative management, monitor costs more
closely and strengthen personnel management could result in even more improvements.
For instance, while there is a freeze on hiring, personnel expenses continue to be high with
no mechanism for dismissing staff or for re-allocating staff with specific skills to areas of
their comparative advantage. Likewise the budgetary process, specifically with respect to
internally financed capital investments, could benefit from a more rational allocation
system.
6.3   The State's financial situation is set out in the tables in Annex 6A. In 1995, the
creditworthiness study showed the following results:
(a)   total current revenues = US$2.8 billion.
(b)   current account surplus = S$427 million.
(c)   primary surplus = US$185 million
(d)   primary surplus/ revenue = 6.6%.

14, 1995.



35
6.4   The State is promoting greater municipal financial independence and autonomy,
and considers the proposed project a key instrument for achieving greater municipal fiscal
responsibility.
B. MUNICIPAL FINANCES
6.5   Following the decentralization in 1988, resources and expenditures of Brazilian
municipalities both increased substantially. Municipal revenues rose from about 11% of
the country's total disposition of final revenue (average over the last two decades) to
about 17% in 1990. Expenditures increased from about 11% of final disposition to about
14% of the total. While these data indicate the relative importance municipalities have
assumed in the overall economy, the specific effects are not yet fully clear. Larger
municipalities seem to have benefited disproportionately more than smaller municipalities,
as did those with a larger industrial base over those with weaker economies. Most
municipalities, however, are much better off financially following the reforms. This can
have a perverse impact on own resources, however, with those cities receiving the highest
valued-added tax transfers from the State, for example, allowing own revenue collection
to decrease during the period.
6.6   Data for selected municipalities in Bahia reveal their considerable dependence on
federal and State government transfers, as is the case in most of the rest of Brazil. The
most significant municipal transfer components are: (a) the municipal participation fund
(FPM); and (b) the State value-added tax (ICMS). On average, Federal transfers of FPM
and State transfers of ICMS made up 85% of total municipal revenues in Bahia in 1992.
While FPM was significant in poorer municipalities, ICMS was more important in the
Salvador metropolitan region, which accounts for about 70% of Bahia industrial output.
Both the FPM and the ICMS are dependent on the level of economic activity. When
economic activity is slow, transfers are adversely affected; the narrower the municipal tax
collection base, the more serious the impact. This situation highlights the importance of
own collection capacity, which in turn depends on both the incentive structure and on
municipalities' restructuring of their administrative and financial framework so as to be
able to better exploit their tax potential.
6.7   Table 9 below indicates municipal revenue sources on the basis of a sample of 66
municipalities. As shown, own-source revenues, primarily represented by IPTU and ISS,
represented on average about 10% of total revenues in 1992. The project would generate
increased own revenue through criteria that would ensure cost-recovery through user
charges, betterment fees, and property and other taxes.

6.8   Debt Capacity. Most of the smaller municipalities borrowed relatively little before
the advent of the Plano Real. In fact, most of the 44 municipalities had no contracted debt
in 1993. Most "financing" was done by arrears in the hyperinflationary period. There was
however, some borrowing through infrastructure lines of credit operated by the GOB
through CEF, especially by the larger municipalities. PRODUR will be the first chance for
large-scale municipal borrowing in the State. Municipalities in general are creditworthy,
since they have not previously borrowed and are now better off than previously.
However, there are several large municipalities which are significantly leveraged, and must
borrow with extreme caution.
6.9   Estimates of total existing debt capacity for 202 municipalities eligible to
participate in PRODUR were prepared with 1993 data from a representative sample of 44
municipalities These estimates show a total existing debt capacity of nearly US$214
million for the municipalities (Annex 6B). The data show that about 70 municipalities
would have a limit greater than US$1 million per year, while the remainder would have
annual capacity between about US$500,000 and US$1 million.
C. COST RECOVERY POLICY
6.10  Subprojects would have to demonstrate significant direct cost or indirect cost
recovery. Services which are revenue-earning (water supply, sewerage, solid waste
collection) would recover costs directly from final beneficiaries through tariffs and user
charges, while services which are non-revenue earning (paving and drainage, for example)
would be recovered through increases in property valuation and subsequent property and



37
betterment taxes. Revenue-earning services constitute 47 % of the total infrastructure
program, while non-revenue-earning account for the rest. Annex 6C contains a breakdown of
the direct and indirect cost-recovery instruments for all components.
D. DIMENSIONING OF PRODUR
6.11  In order to dimension investments for the PRODUR program, the State and CAR
evaluated several key areas: demand for resources; municipal and State capacity to borrow
and repay loan funds; and State and municipal technical, institutional and financial absorptive
capacity. First, as part of project preparation, in 1994, CAR undertook a survey of 66 of the
State's larger cities, representing about six million inhabitants, or about 50% of the population.
The study confirmed that the most widely demanded investments were water supply, sewage
collection and treatment, solid waste collection and disposal, street paving and drainage, and
identified potential investments on the order of US$250.0 million. Second, CAR prepared an
evaluation of the credit limits of a sample of 44 of the State's municipalities, which indicates a
State-wide limit on the order of US$500 million. Finally, the State Government demonstrated
in its historic financial statements that for the past several years it has been spending on the
order of US$600.0 million on annual capital investments, largely in urban infrastructure. It is
the equivalent of these funds which would go into the FUNDURBANO as State counterpart.
The proposed project size of US$222.0 million for infrastructure and institutional
development investments over a six-year period (or about US$37.0 million per year) was
based on these findings. With State counterpart of about US$72.0 million (about US$12.0
million per year) and about US$50.0 million from municipalities (about US$8.0 million per
year) to be provided each year, the project is conservatively dimensioned. Simulations
indicate that about 77 of the State's municipalities (those with population greater than
15,000) will participate in the project.
E. SUSTAINABILITY
6.12  Cost recovery at the sub-project level, and the fact that the Bank loan would be repaid
by the State (making Bank funds a permanent capitalization of the FUNDURBANO) increase
the project's chances of putting the financing of municipal investments on a more sustainable
basis through this fund. Furthermore, the project's reform components are expected to lead
to strengthened municipal management thus allowing the municipalities to cover their current
expenditures, service their debt and generate surpluses for future infrastructure investments.
The commitment of the government of the State of Bahia to project objectives is a primary
factor contributing to the likely sustainability of the project's impact on municipal finance.
The effective mobilization of community involvement in the definition of local investment
priorities by an experienced executing agency is an important factor in assuring that the
project's impact will be obtained initially and sustained after project completion. In addition,
the proposed project is designed to benefit from the lessons of experience of seven successful
municipal management projects in other states in Brazil.

7. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
7.1   The expected benefit of the project will be to endow the State of Bahia with model
municipalities in terms of efficient urban service delivery and sound finances whose
institutional arrangements can be emulated elsewhere. These model municipalities would
pursue a combined policy of privatization of these services where possible and of
increased public sector efficiency at the local level through pilot programs of municipal
reform. Strengthened municipal finances should result from applying the project's rigorous
eligibility criteria for sub-project financing itself, in addition to specific municipal reform
and institutional actions directly supported by the project.
7.2   Through the experience of these model municipalities, it is also expected that the
project will demonstrate that the improvement of the living conditions of the urban poor in
the State of Bahia--through the efficient provision of infrastructure and services--can be
compatible with municipal reform. As a priority, project funding will finance cost-effective
sub-projects with high rates of return in municipalities whose administrations are
committed to reform. The urban poor will benefit most from the low-cost solutions to
urban infrastructure and service delivery favored by the project. For being sanitation-
related, the positive impacts of these investments upon the urban environment throughout
the State of Bahia should lead to significant public health improvements for the urban
poor.
7.3   PRODLJR's sub-project screening and evaluation procedures--involving technical,
economic, financial and environmental assessments--would help ensure that the expected
benefits are achieved.
A. FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT AND MUNICIPAL REFORM
7.4   The proposed project would strengthen the financial management of local
governments, enabling them to better provide the services for which they are responsible
under Brazil's Constitution, thus putting into effect the federal and state governments'
decentralization objectives. To become eligible for sub-project financing under PRODUR,
municipalities will have to meet rigorous creditworthiness criteria, itself an important
incentive to increasing revenues and savings at the local level. Specific project
components, such as the cadastre, will help broaden the fiscal base of municipalities. The
project will also encourage user charges to be levied at the local level for urban services
financed through PRODUR. Through focusing more upon economically and financially
viable investment projects, municipalities will have more opportunities to increase own-
source revenues through appropriate taxes and user charges based on economic costs, and
improved collection practices.
7.5   The project's pilot municipal reform program would also strengthen local
governments institutionally through a pilot program of municipal reform. Through
PRODUR, municipalities will be encouraged to privatize revenue-generating services
through the sale of assets or the granting of concessions to private operators. Participating
municipalities would enjoy more efficient public administration through implementing



39
reform measures agreed under PRODUR. In this way the proposed project would also
support the federal government's overall macro economics objectives of achieving leaner,
more efficient public sector management at all levels.
B. ECONOMIC BENEFITS
7.6   The weighted-average internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the
infrastructure component is expected to be on the order of 20%. Calculation of the
project IERR is be based on the individual IERRs for a range of sub-projects for one
municipality with the most advanced first year program of investments. Estimates of the
ERRs of sub-projects of the remaining cities' first year programs would be prepared by
Loan Effectiveness. During project implementation, such cost-benefit analysis would be
prepared for all infrastructure sub-projects, accounting for about 84% of the total value of
PRODUR investments. On the basis of the experience other similar programs in Brazil, the
range of returns for individual sub-projects is expected to be on the order of 12% to 50%.
Sub-project selection criteria ensure a minimum 12% economic rate of return for all sub-
projects, with the exception of sewage treatment and macro drainage, for which health
benefits would also be calculated with the use of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs:
details Annex 7). Detailed economic cost-benefit and sensitivity analyses are presented in
Annex 7. Through guiding local governments to make efficient investments in urban
infrastructure and services, the project can contribute to improvements that will make
cities more attractive for investment by the private sector.
C. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH BENEFITS
7.7   Because its infrastructure component is focused on the basic sanitation sectors, the
project is expected to have positive environmental impacts primarily derived from
improvements to solid waste collection and disposal, storm drainage, sewage collection
and treatment, water supply systems through reduced leakage and increased coverage, and
from a more integrated approach to management of sanitation services at the municipal
level. The technical assistance component may finance, among other things, the drafting of
municipal environmental legislation and strengthening of municipal environmental
councils. The project has been rated environmental category "B." Environmental aspects
of the project are treated in greater detail in Annex 5F.
7.8   Basic sanitation improvements financed by the project are expected to lead to
better public health conditions among the communities directly affected. According to
Bahia State health officials, introducing sewage collection into a low income area for the
first time can more than halve the incidence of waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and
worm infections that affect communities without basic sanitation. Children are particularly
vulnerable to these diseases which are responsible for 17. 1% of all cases of infant
mortality in Bahia. To assess public health impacts, sub-project evaluation includes an
assessment of the number of DALYs (disability-adjusted life-years) in the community
affected by the investment. Focusing upon the reduction of diarrhea and worm infections,
the project assessment uses parameters of DALY loss by diarrhea and worm infection in



40
Latin America reported by the 1993 World Development Report, and estimates the cost
effectiveness of the expected impact (details: Annex 7).
D. POVERTY INEPACT
7.9   The project is expected to have an important impact on the overall situation of the
poor in the State. The preliminary indications from the draft Brazil Poverty Assessment
demonstrate that a key distinguishing feature of the poor from the non-poor is lack of
access to basic urban infrastructure. By their nature and design standards, infrastructure
investments under the project would benefit the urban poor. Furthermore, the institutional
strengthening and changes in service provision which should come about as a result of the
project is likely to have a proportional impact on the poor (below the poverty line),
estimated to be about one-third of total population in the State. The low-income
upgrading component will be a poverty-targeted program benefiting households with
incomes of less than three minimum salaries. Poverty mapping at the State level will also
be an important instrument in ensuring that investments are appropriately targeted and
have the desired impact.
E. RisKs
7.10   Since municipal reform envisioned by PRODUR has not previously been attempted
in the State of Bahia, there are risks that the zeal of municipalities to pursue tough reform
measures may wane, especially in the face of eventual political opposition. Stimulating
competition among municipalities for PRODUIR funding, rewarding those making most
progress with reforms, is a key feature of the project design aimed at mitigating this risk.
The voluntary participation in the project of new mayors that have taken office in January
1997 should ensure continuity of political commitment to the agreed reforms.
Furthermore, increasing fiscal tightness in the public sector allied to macro economic
factors, should provide incentives for municipalities to continue to pursue these reforms.
7.11  There is an additional risk that PRODUR's ID component may not be fully
implemented owing to the challenges posed by a complex intervention in many
municipalities spread across a territory as large as France's. For this reason, agreed
technical assistance and training programs and targets for municipalities to enter the
project's first-year program have already been prepared, and a team of experienced
consultants will assist CAR with implementation and train CAR staff in these functions.
Furthermore, progress on the institutional development component, where necessary, will
be linked explicitly to the infrastructure component. The risk to the ID program is also
somewhat mitigated through CAR's ready access to the experience of other states with
similar projects. There are few technical risks associated with the project, since most
infrastructure investments are of a routine nature applying well-tried solutions adopted
elsewhere.

ANNEX IA
BAHIA
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT- PRODUR
DECENTRALIZATION AND IMPROVED MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT
1.    The Case for Decentralization. There are several arguments in favor of federalism
or decentralization. Economists argue that because some public services have nationwide
benefits (e.g., defense and research) while others are geographically limited (eg., public
lighting), allocative efficiency calls for public services to be provided (and their costs shared)
in line with the preferences of the residents of the relevant benefit region. That is, services
with nationwide benefits should be provided for nationally, services with local benefits
should be provided for locally. Decentralization is also justified for political reasons. It is
believed that decentralization is needed in order to limit the power of one individual over
another and that it provides a training ground for democratic government. On the
institutional front, decentralization appears to facilitate the local coordination necessary in
the case of multiple local services (i.e., street paving, water and sewerage services).
2.    The Brazilian Context. Brazil's 1988 Constitution is the most recent attempt of the
country to promote decentralization and federalism. Commitment to enhance the role of
states and municipalities in the conduct of public policy is a clear characteristic of the
Constitutional text. The Constitution has increased municipal responsibilities, so that they
now cover, inter alia, urban public transport, pre-school and elementary education,
preventive health care and land-use. At the revenue level the number of municipal taxes has
doubled from two -- a tax on property and a tax on services -- to four: the urban property
tax (IPTU); the excise tax on services in a number of tertiary activities (IS S), a tax on
property sales (ITBI) and a fuel tax (IVVCLG). As a result of these changes, the share of
municipalities in total government revenues has more than doubled. However, in absolute
terms the effect has not been as large as expected, due primarily to the recessive economic
environment.
3.    Recession and fiscal adjustment have also motivated both the federal and state
governments to accelerate the implementation of the responsibilities assigned by the
Constitution to the municipalities. However, it is uncertain whether municipalities will have
the capacity to assume these new responsibilities and to manage their new resources
efficiently and equitably. In several sectors, for instance health and environment,
municipalities' experience is very limited.
4.    Findings of Economic and Sector Work. Recent Bank economic and sector work
-- in particular, the study Brazil: The Challenge of Municipal Sector Development ini the
1990s' -- has identified several issues in municipal management, one of the key areas of
_/ IBRD Report No. 10616-BR, February 1992.



44
reform recommended in the report. On the expenditure side, municipalities demonstrate
insufficient investment levels and an oversized administration which has tended to consume
most of the increase in revenues through current expenditures. On the revenue side, there is
a clear lack of incentive to maximize own-revenues and to be accountable for financial
management. User fees and property taxes are not used efficiently, so negotiated transfers
continue to be major items in municipal budgets in selected cases. The need for
transparency and sustainability require that negotiated transfers be replaced by formula-
driven transfers and that extra-budgetary accounts (another non-transparent way of
receiving and spending resources) be included in the ordinary budget.
5.    The PRODUR Project and Decentralization. The proposed Bahia Municipal
Infrastructure Development and Management (PRODUR) Project fits into the above
context by explicitly addressing the major issues in municipal management identified in the
sector work. Its main objective is to assist the municipalities of the State of Bahia in
carrying out their new responsibilities as efficiently as possible. It does that in several ways:
(a)    The project provides financial incentives to local governments to enlarge
their investment capacity and to provide public services in a sustainable
fashion -- the use of full cost-recovery through tariffs and taxes is the only
way to ensure that those public services will be provided even after the life
of the project.
(b)    It strengthens local institutional capacity, with particular emphasis on
financial management and the basic sanitation and environmental
infrastructure sectors, traditionally municipal responsibilities. The
institutional content will emphasize the following activities:
(i)    providing training and technical assistance for financial
management;
(ii)   presenting simple, realistic guidelines, performance indicators and
information structures to assist proper management;
(iii)  identifying activities than can be fully privatized;
(iv)   designing appropriate incentives to keep expenditures under tight
control;
(v)    strengthening local environmental management councils and
legislation;
(vi)   ensuring the strengthening of municipal tax administration capacity
primarily through upgrading and renovating property tax cadastres
and appropriate training; and
(vii)  improving targeting in poverty alleviation.



45
(c)   In addition, through computerization of its financial and institutional
databases, the proposed project will begin to move the State and
municipalities towards a Municipal Management Information System
(FMIS) that could help monitor macroeconomic policy, provide consistent
reporting at all levels and form an analytical base to improve
intergovernmental fiscal transfers.
(d)    Local Government Performance: Normative Criteria. Decentralization
needs to be assessed in terms of how local governments are delivering the
services for which they are responsible. The above-referenced sector
work, using basic precepts from economic literature, provides guidance in
this respect. It argues that performance of the public sector in general and
of the municipalities in particular can be assessed in terms of: (i)
accountability; (ii) production efficiency; (iii) demand efficiency; (iv)
equity; and (v) sustainability, explained in greater detail as follows:
(i)    Accountability is a direct requirement of increased responsibility.
Accountability to the electorate is required as a guarantee that the
conduct of the elected officials is in line with the voters' wishes.
Accountability to the higher levels of the government is required
when municipalities act as agents (or as spenders) of federal or state
grant funds. Reliable financial data are probably the single most
important requirement for accountability.
(ii)   Production efficiency stipulates that services provided by the
municipality should correspond to the minimum cost provision.
This can be measured directly, observing whether a municipality has
chosen the least-cost solution to provide a given service, or
indirectly by looking at how employment has evolved or how
significant is the participation of the private sector.
(iii)   Demand efficiency relates to the level at which consumer demand is
matched by provision of public services at an economic cost.
Demand efficiency is measured by the degree to which public
services are financed by cost recovery applied along the lines of the
benefit principle -- those who benefit from the good or service
should be those who pay.
(iv)   Equity goals include assessing the degree to which actions increase
or diminish interpersonal or inter-regional income disparities. It is
generally accepted that equity concerns should be pursued by
higher levels of government. Local governments trying to promote
income distribution with their own resources run into financial
problems as higher-income taxpayers tend to leave the community.
The realm of the local government should be limited to the
provision of services for which cross-subsidies are feasible -- for



46
example water supply financed by high-income groups and made
available to low-income households through life-line rates.
(v)     Sustainability provides that imbalances between expenditures and
revenues be minimized, and implies that revenue authority be as
close as possible to expenditure authority.
Table I A-I indicates the areas of analysis and indicators which can be used to assess the
adequacy of municipal policymaking according to these five criteria.

ANNEX lB
BAHIA
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT- PRODUR
LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS PROJECTS
1.    In the first part of this annex, the focus is on the historical experience of nearly two
decades of Bank lending to Brazil in the urban and water supply sectors. Many of these
lessons, combined with the incentives created by the political and fiscal decentralization of
1988, contributed to the emergence of a new generation of municipal development projects
focusing on strengthening the capacity of local governments to manage and provide basic
services. Lessons learned from these more recent experiences are discussed in the second part
of this annex.
A. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
2.    Since 1978 the Bank has made 20 loans for urban development and transport projects
in Brazil, totalling about US$2 billion. In addition, 18 loans totalling about US$2 billion have
been made for basic sanitation projects since 1971, also largely in urban areas. With this long
history of Bank involvement in the sector, many important lessons have been drawn. The
proposed project would build on lessons learned over these decades in the urban sector. The
recent OED review of urban sector lending, Twenty Years of Urban Lending. 1972-1992,
June 14, 1994 (IBRD No. 13117), cites several features of best practice, among them
demonstrated borrower ownership, emphasis on institution building, secure tenure for
beneficiaries, well-designed environmental components, and explicit poverty reduction aims.
Constraints to successful implementation are excessive focus on physical outcomes (at the
expense of institutional outcomes), poor design of environmental components, mechanisms
which favor high-standard infrastructure, and inadequate assessment of effective demand. The
report argues for a more comprehensive approach to design of urban projects which secures
project ownership, relies on institutional development and policy reform, taps potential
macroeconomic linkages, strengthens the congruence of objectives and design, and provides
for well-defined monitoring and evaluation.
3.    Consistent with these recommendations and Brazil's decentralization reforms, the
Bank's project objectives have shifted towards improving the capacity of states and
municipalities to effectively assume increased responsibilities for efficient management of
resources and services under a series of projects which focus on the strengthening of local
governmental capacity for service provision on the basis of permanent municipal development
funds at the State level. These funds are designed to provide a reliable source of financing for
urban infrastructure investment, under appropriate technical, economic and financial selection
criteria which aim at the greatest efficiency in use of funds. Investments are complemented by
technical assistance and training towards improved financial management. The first of these
projects was the Parand Market Towns Project - PRAM (2343-BR), followed by the Santa



48
Catarina Small Towns Development Project - PROURB (2623-BR -- closed December 3 1,
1993) and more recently Municipal Development Projects in the States of Parana - PEDU
(3100-BR); and in the State of Rio Grande do Sul - PIMES (3129-BR); the Minas Gerais
Municipal Management and Environmental Infrastructure Project - SOMMA (3639-BR); and
the Ceara Water Resource Management and Urban Development Project - PROURB (3789-
BR). These projects set the framework for further policy formulation for the sector, based on
the experience of the past two decades. The projects and their current status are shown in

B. RECENT EXPERIENCE
4.     Some clear lessons have emerged from the PCR of the Parana Market Towns Project -
PRAM (completed in 1990), the PCR of the Santa Catarina Small Towns Project (PROURB,
completed in 1993), and from mid-term reviews conducted more recently for other projects.
The lessons learned from such projects can be divided into three broad categories: (a) factors
of comparative success, or those which contributed to smooth and rapid achievement of
objectives and which support the sustainability of the basic project design; (b) factors of
comparative difficulty which affected projects in the past and which, however, have now been
largely resolved; and (c) factors which continue to contribute to delays, complications or
problems, and which are not yet fully resolved. The latter should be explicitly considered in
the design of subsequent operations. The first two are explained in summary form, and the
third in a matrix format which demonstrates how the specific issues have been addressed in the
design of the proposed project.
Success Factors
(a)    Demand for Resources. The forecast demand for resources has in fact
materialized, as reflected in the complete commitment of loan funds under
PRAM and PROURB (SC).
(b)    Community Response. Community/constituent response has been extremely
positive to reforming local administrations, as expressed in: willingness to pay
through tariffs and taxes for services efficiently provided; reelection of many
mayors who participated in these projects; and wide coverage in all states:
PRAM achieved coverage of about 90% of all municipalities in the State;
PEDU has reached 99%; PIMES about 50%; PROURB 99%; and SOMMA



49
has active projects underway or under preparation in about 100 of the State's
nearly 800 municipalities.
(c)   Institutional Consistency. Projects are most successful when implemented
under the institutional structure of a pre-existing program. For example, a
large part of the success of the PEDU program has to do with the earlier work
done under the PRAM project. PROURB (CE) also built on existing State
programs. Many of the same systems (for disbursements, monitoring, channels
for discussions with mayors, etc.) are still in place and have simply been
upgraded. Conversely, PIMES and SOMMA have had start-up difficulties
partially due to lack of this prior experience.
(d)   Repayment of Funds. The PRAM and PROURB projects, and initial results
from the PIMES and PEDU projects have demonstrated municipal ability and
willingness to repay loan funds. The guarantees are firm and credible, and
have not been called in any of the programs.
(e)   -Increase in Municipal Own Resources. There is evidence from all four
projects that municipal financial management has improved. This is most
evident in Parana, where the second project has benefited from the existence of
the first PEDU municipal finance study.
(f)    Timing of Start-up. Both PEDU and PIMFS began near the beginning of the
mayoral term. This undoubtedly has helped in the projects' implementation.
Conversely SOMMA suffered the consequences of the shift in municipal
administrations. During the reelection cycle a lag can be expected.
5.    These factors demonstrate sustainability of the overall project concept, and justify
consideration of follow-up operations.
Past Implementation Issues
6.    Three important external factors have in the past hindered project implementation.
However (due to in part to collaboration between the GOB and the Bank), measures have
been taken to reduce or change the impact of these factors. These areas are related to:
procurement; sub-loan approvals, and disbursement.
(a)   First, procurement arrangements under all projects in Brazil have suffered the
consequences of Brazilian procurement legislation's inconsistency with the
Bank's procurement guidelines. In June 1993 a new federal procurement law
was passed, effectively eliminating most of the serious inconsistencies. This
new law, together with use of the Bank's standard bidding documents, should
effectively eliminate many procurement problems which led to significant
delays in other programs. Standard bidding documents for National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) for goods and works were agreed upon in 1995
between the Bank and the government, and are now in widespread use.



50
(b)    Second, the Senate Resolution (Resolution No. 69 of 1995) setting out
guidelines for public sector indebtedness in the past stipulated that all
municipalities should be reviewed individually. Conditioned on the fact that
municipal projects adopt federal creditworthiness criteria, each State will
approve its municipal borrowing program at the same time as the State's
borrowing and the Federal Government's guarantee is approved. While not
perfect, this will reduce the executing agency's sub-project processing time,
and save staff time previously spent lobbying the Senate committee.
(c)    Third, regarding disbursements, there is no longer a Brazil-wide requirement to
hold all Special Accounts in the Central Bank in Brasilia. In the past this has
created some confusion and lag time in disbursement processes. Special
Accounts are now held in a commnercial bank mutually agreeable to the parties.
This will also minimize processing delays.
Current Complicating or Delaying Factors
7.    The matrix shown as Table 1B-2 below indicates the key, unresolved factors of project
complication or delay, and outlines how the design of the proposed project incorporates
measures which will mitigate the risk of such factors.

ANNEX IC
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
URBAN POVERTY STRATEGY IN BRAZIL
1.    Brazil's poverty indices and other social indicators suggest that on average Brazilians
have a lower quality of life than citizens of other countries with similar levels of per capita
GDP. However, Brazil has such extreme regional disparities, and income is distributed so
unequally among the population, that national averages reveal little. The standard of living
experienced by most Northeasterners versus most Southeasterners, and within the
macroregions by low income versus high income households, is very different. Poverty tends
to be more prevalent and severe in rural areas. Nonetheless, metropolitan and other urban
areas account for a large, and growing, share of the poor.
2.     Brazil's level of public spending in the social sectors has been comparable to that of
other middle income countries. While Brazil has made clear progress since the 1970s on a
number of fronts, dramatically increasing access to electricity, water and sewage systems,
health services and schooling, and lowering the incidence of child malnutrition, improvements
in social indicators have not been commensurate with the magnitude of public social spending.
Macroeconomic instability, low economic growth and increasing income inequality have
played a role in keeping social conditions from progressing more rapidly over the past decade
and a half In addition, inefficient use of public funds has been widely recognized as part of
the problem.
3.     Poverty in the Northeast. The Northeast has the highest incidence of poverty of any
region in Brazil.' Whether one lives in a metropolitan area, a non-metropolitan urban area, or
a rural location, poverty is most prevalent in the Northeast.2 Although poverty is most
common in Brazil's rural areas and least common in its metropolitan regions, the Northeast is
so disadvantaged relative to the rest of the country that poverty is more prevalent in the
Northeast's metropolitan areas (Recife, Salvador and Fortaleza) than it is in the rural areas of
other macroregions. Over one-third of all metropolitan poor, half of the poor living in non-
metropolitan urban areas, and 70% of the rural poor live in the Northeast..
The incidence of poverty is the share of the population having per capita household incomes below the
poverty line. The analysis presented here is drawn from Brazil: A Poverty Assessment. The data
source used to conduct the poverty analysis in that report was the 1990 PNAD household survey. The
poverty line used was based on the cost of a food basket meeting recommended nutritional
requirements, adjusted for cost of living differences.
2 Metropolitan areas include the nine officially designated metropolitan regions and Brasilia. Other
urban areas encompass all areas considered urban in the PNAD, but not included in the metropolitan
regions. All county seats are categorized as urban, regardless of their population.



53
4.     Not only is poverty more prevalent in the Northeast, but the conditions under which
the poor live are worse there than in the rest of Brazil. Life expectancy at birth for a person in
the lowest income group (family income up to 1 minimum wage) is 15 years shorter in the
urban Northeast than in the urban Southeast. Poor Northeasterners are more likely than other
poor Brazilians to live in dwellings without internal plumbing, electricity, adequate sewerage
services, and garbage collection. This is so even when the degree of urbanization is similar.
Even non-poor residents of the Northeast have worse indicators than other Brazilians,
including at times, those with much lower incomes. Average life expectancy at birth is
actually higher for urban Southeasterners with family incomes up to I minimum wage than it
is for urban Northeasterners with family incomes between 3 and 5 minimum salaries. Like
their poor neighbors, the non-poor living in the Northeast tend to have lower access to
services and poorer housing conditions than the non-poor, and even the poor, from other
regions.
5.    The Urbanization of Poverty in Brazil. Brazil's population has become
concentrated in urban areas over the last three decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, the promise
of employment opportunities fueled the large-scale migration of rural Northeasterners to
urban areas, particularly to economically vibrant metropolises of the Southeast such as Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo. In the 1 980s, economic stagnation rendered these cities less capable
of absorbing the influx of rural Northeasterners seeking to improve their welfare. However,
the lack of opportunities and extreme poverty of the rural Northeast continued to stimulate
out-migration. The populations of medium-sized cities and Northeastern metropolitan areas
has expanded as intra-state migration from rural to urban areas has accelerated.
6.    By the early 1990s, three-quarters of all Brazilians were living in urban areas. With
more of the population residing in cities and towns, the share of urban poor relative to rural
poor has grown. Over 50% of Brazil's poor are now urban. In more urbanized regions such
as the Southeast, the vast majority of the poor live in cities and towns. Even in the Northeast,
urban areas already contain around 45% of the region's poor. Assuming that the process of
urbanization continues, poverty will become an increasingly urban phenomenon in Brazil.
Strategies designed to address the specific characteristics and problems of urban poverty will
be more urgently needed.
7.    The Nature of Urban Poverty. In the Northeast, poverty rates and social indicators
tend to be worse in medium-sized and smaller urban areas while the metropolitan areas are
comparatively better-off. In the Southeast, the relative position of the large metropolitan
areas and smaller urban centers is reversed, and poverty indices tend to be higher in the
metropolitan areas.
8.    Cities have been unable to keep up with the demand for low-income housing and
utility services created by rapid urbanization. Squatter settlements, orfavelas, and other
informal communities have sprung up in nearly every city and many towns. The urban poor
are concentrated in these settlements, which are often located on the peripheries of urban
centers in flood-prone areas. Although manyfavela houses are made of brick (particularly in
more established favelas), homes are also constructed of less durable materials. Lack of
access to basic services--especially piped water from the public system, sewage and garbage



54
collection--is a problem for many poor households, especially in the cities of the Northeast.
Higher-income households generally have better access to basic services.
9.    In the crowded conditions of the poorer urban communities, the lack of services
creates an unhealthy living environment. Waterborne diseases and respiratory infections tend
to be more common and more severe among the poor, and are more frequently a cause of
death among poor urban infants and toddlers than among better-off children. Similarly,
malnutrition is more prevalent among poor children. It is a particularly serious problem
among urban children in the Northeast, where over one-fifth of all children under the age of
five are physically stunted. Children in the urban Southeast are much less likely to be
malnourished. Income differences only partly explain the much higher rates of child
malnutrition in the urban Northeast. Access to basic utilities also seems to be a factor.
10.    Another characteristic of urban poverty is more limited access to quality educational
opportunities. Low-income children have much less access to pre-school and day care
facilities than the better-off. Similarly, poor urban children aged 10 to 14 are less likely than
the non-poor to attend school. On average the education that poor children receive is of
lower quality than that received by the non-poor, both because better-off children are more
likely to attend private school and because poorer states and municipalities tend to spend
much less per public school student.
11.    The relationship between poverty and child labor is complex. While children in all
income classes work, child labor is more common in the urban and metropolitan Northeast
than in the Southeast. Poor children who work (particularly those in female-headed
households) tend to work longer hours. Children working in urban areas face multiple threats
to their physical and moral well-being. The problem of"street children" is a unique feature of
urban poverty, and appears to be intimately linked with the need for poor children to
contribute to household income.
12.    Characteristics of the Urban Poor3. Roughly one-third of the urban poor live in
female-headed households. Poor households are more likely than non-poor households to be
headed by a woman, by an adult below the age of thirty, and by an illiterate. In the
Northeast, one-third to one-half of all poor household heads in urban areas are illiterate. Poor
household heads also tend to have fewer years of schooling than the non-poor Poor
3 The comparisons of the urban poor and nonpoor made in this annex hold region and residence in a
metropolitan area versus "another" urban area constant. That is, the poor in Northeastern
metropolitan areas are compared and contrasted with the nonpoor in Northeastern metropolitan areas,
the poor in non-metropolitan urban areas of the Southeast are compared to the non-poor living in the
urban Southeast, and so on. All comparisons are based on calculations made by Sonia Rocha using
the 1990 PNAD household survey data, as reported in Brazil: A Poverty Profile, a background paper
prepared for the World Bank (June 27, 1995).



55
households are somewhat larger than non-poor households, and have more young children on
average.
13.   Employment patterns differ among the urban poor and non-poor. Compared to better-
off workers, the poor are more likely to be employees or self-employed, and less likely to be
employers. Poor householders are more likely than the nonpoor to work in the service sector,
agriculture, and construction, and less likely to work in manufacturinrg, trade or the civil
service. In addition, informal employment is more common among the poor. Working
without a labor card is especially prevalent among poor workers in non-metropolitan urban
areas of the Northeast. Labor force participation rates--both overall and for women
separately -- are higher in nonpoor households. The combination of more children and lower
labor force participation rates among adults of working age results in much higher dependency
ratios in poor households.4
14.   The Government's Poverty Strategy. President Cardoso has identified social justice
and poverty reduction as priorities for his administration. The Government views the battle
against poverty as a long-term task that will require continued economic development,
redistribution of income, reform of government and efficient implementation of significant
public sector programs in the areas of health and education. The Government also recognizes
the importance of implementing and managing effective social programs of immediate benefit
to low-income Brazilians.
15.   The Community Solidarity Program (PCS), a Government of Brazil initiative, aims to
mobilize all levels of Brazilian government and society to address the basic needs of the poor.
Like the earlier Fight Against Hunger program, the Programa de Comunidade Solidaria is
grounded in the principles of decentralization and community participation, and promotes
partnership between the federal government and the states, municipalities and Brazilian
society as a whole. Its main objectives include:
(a)   improving the management of selected, high priority social programs through
the promotion of community participation;
(b)    supporting the implementation of Government projects and initiatives in areas
with high concentrations of poverty; and
(c)   identifying new priorities and developing action plans for Government and civil
society.
16.   Poverty in the State of Bahia. Roughly 30% of Bahia's population have per capita
incomes below the poverty line. Infant mortality rates are high: around 96 out of every 1,000
children born in Bahia do not live to their first birthday. Sixty-three percent of the state's
children under the age of seven live in households with inadequate access to water; 58% of
the zero to six year-olds live in households where the head earns one minimum salary or less.
Service coverage is particularly low in medium and small cities and towns and rural areas.
However, even in the capital, Salvador, one-fifth of the zero to six year-olds live in
4 The dependency ratio is the number of non-working household members per working adult.



56
households not connected to the general water system. Only 5% of Bahia's population have
sewage collection. Water and sanitation system coverage in Bahia is thus low even relative to
the rest of the Northeast.
17.   Policy Implications of the Causes, Characteristics and Profile of Urban Poverty. Urban
poverty has multiple causes and dimensions. Macroeconomic instability and economic
stagnation are the environment in which urban poverty thrives best. Inadequate access to
productive employment and other income generating opportunities, lower quality and quantity
of schooling, and limited availability of basic sanitation and other urban infrastructure are both
causes and consequences of urban poverty. The linkages among these factors are
considerable.
18.   Poor households are more likely than better-off households to lack access to clean
water, sewage systems and garbage collection. Lack of basic sanitation exacerbates
malnutrition, by subjecting young children to diarrheal diseases that hinder their body's ability
to convert food into energy and good health. This can lead to stunting and other chronic
conditions which have negative implications for future productivity. In the short run, by
making childhood illnesses more likely, lack of access to basic sanitation can hamper a
fiamily's ability to generate income by diverting parents from work in order to care for sick
children.
19.   Poor children are much less likely than better-off children to graduate from primary
school (let alone secondary school). This perpetuates the cycle of poverty through the link
between wages in adulthood and educational attainment, and contributes to the inter-
generational transfer of poverty. The importance of enhancing the quality of public schools
attended by poor children for urban poverty reduction can hardly be over-emphasized.
20.   When a household's adults lack access to employment that generates sufficient income
to support the family, children are often required to prematurely take on income-earning
responsibilities. This exposes children to many risks, hinders schooling and rarely leads to job
opportunities that will allow them to break the cycle of poverty in adulthood.
21.   These are just a few examples of the linkages among urban poverty, education, basic
urban infrastructure, and employment. The policy implications of these linkages are that
synergies exist and policy interventions on several fronts can multiply their impact.
22.   Another clear implication of the profile of urban poverty is that urban areas in the
Northeast ghould receive priority in the allocation of resources and implementation of
programs to address urban poverty. However, effective policy interventions require effective
public institutions. The share of public resources controlled by municipalities has grown
rapidly since 1988, increasing the importance of skilled public management at the local level.
The Northeast lacks a strong cadre of local public administrators. With some exceptions, the
provision of social services in the Northeast has traditionally been characterized by uneven
administration, inefficient use of resources and paternalism. To overcome these tendencies,
investments must be made in the training of middle- and senior-level urban administrators in
relevant skills, in the adoption of rational planning methodologies, and in the regular
reinforcement and upgrading of these skills.

STATE OF BAHIA CREDITWORTHINESS ASSESSMENT
1.    A creditworthiness assessment of the state of Bahia is carried out here using the
guidelines developed in Assessing State Creditworthiness in Brazil. No.8. Economic
Notes. Country Department 1. LAC, 1996.
Backsround
2.    Over the 1993-95 period, the Government of Bahia's budgetary accounts
registered primary surpluses every year with an average primary surplus of R$130 million
(constant prices of January 1996). The state suffered a large overall deficit in only one
year 1994, but the average overall deficit for the period was only R$40 mnillion, or only 1.5
percent of average net revenues over the period (net of municipal transfers).
Financial Projections
3.    Table 3G-1 below presents financial projections for the state for the period 1995-
2000. The data for 1995 are actuals, with some minor estimated items.

4.    The item " Residuo Divida" refers to the excess of accrued debt service and
amortization on certain categories of debt. There is a limit of 11% of net revenues on this
debt service. This limit has been negotiated between the states and the Federal Senate
according to Senate Resolution No. 69 in order to avoid undue pressure on essential
categories of expenditure. The excess is capitalized into the existing debt stock and repaid
beyond the horizon presented here, when debt service and amortization would fall below
this limit.
5.    Assumptions. The assumptions underlying the projections are conservative. They
are: (1) Revenue growth. It is assumed that revenue grows at a rate of 3.5 % in 1995,
4.5% in 1996 and 5 % per annum thereafter. These rates are close to the projected growth
of the state economy and also represent a modest degree of additional tax effort. (2)
Personnel expenditures. It is assumed that personnel expenditure growth is 0 % in 1996
because of an adjustment effort on the part of the state with no increase in nominal wages
granted this year. There is positive growth at a rate of 4.5 % thereafter. (3) Debt service.
Debt service is projected according to actual contracts, except for debt in the form of
bonds. It is assumed that bonds are amortized over 50 years. The state, however, services
the interest and there is no debt forgiveness. (4) New Borrowing: No new borrowing is
allowed. (5) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are held constant at the 1995
level. However, because budgetary surpluses are generated, there is a margin for
increasing capital expenditure.
6.    Results. A number of accounting concepts are monitored and presented in Table
3G-2 below. The CurrentAccountBalance. This indicator is monitored to see if the state
government is generating public savings to finance part or all of its annual investment
program. Primary Balance (overall deficit excluding interest payments). This indicator
is monitored to see if the primary surplus will be adequate for meeting future interest
payments, and perhaps some portion of amortization's. Overall Balance. This is
monitored to see if it is at least shrinking as a share of revenues. The Ratio of the Stock of
Debt to Net Revenue. This indicator should be declining over time. We see in the table
below that the current and primary balances are in surplus and growing over the projection
period. The overall balance is positive and large enough to result in a rapidly declining
debt-to-revenue ratio over the projected period.

Oualitative Management Issues
7.    The state has been consistently fiscally conservative in recent years. Bahia is one
of the few in Brazil to already be in near compliance with the Lei Camata target of limiting
personnel expenditures to 60% of net current revenues. In addition, the state passed a law
earlier this year which authorizes a special "voluntary dismissal" program to further
control expenditures in this area. A sign of the administration's forward-looking approach
is a plan, currently being designed, to use privatization revenues and property sales to
create a fund for financing an anticipated future increase in the pension payroll.
Conclusion
8.    Based on the above criteria, Bahia can be considered creditworthy. The state has a
current account surplus. The margin of the surplus is above 10%, even with "Residuo
Divida" being considered part of expenditure. The primary surplus is growing. There is
an overall deficit in the base year of the projections, but a surplus in the remaining years
that is growing. The stock of debt to revenue ratio remains very high; however, the debt
service to expenditure ratio is below 10 percent because the bulk of Bahia' s debt is long
term contractual debt with Federal financial institutions on favorable terms or, with
multilateral external creditors. The projections assume that all short term arrears are paid
off by the end of 1998--the end of the term of the present government. The projections
are not unusually sensitive to parameters such as the wage level or interest rates, and the
wage to revenue ratio is close to the " Lei Camata" guideline of 60% of net current
revenues.

ANNEX 4A
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.    Outlined below is a detailed description of the project components: Municipal
Reform (Part A); Institutional Development, including a Poverty Mapping Study (Part B),
Urban Infrastructure (Part C); and Poverty-Targeted Urban Upgrading (Part D).
Operational arrangements which set out selection criteria and link the technical assistance
and infrastructure sub-projects are described in Annex 5E.
A. Municipal Reform (MR) Component
(US$ 10.0 million, 4.5% of project costs)
2.    The primary objective of the Municipal Reform component of the project is to
increase the efficiency and sustainability of the delivery of infrastructure and social
services in Bahia's municipalities..
3.    This is to be accomplished through encouraging the municipalities to enter into
partnership with the private sector to provide municipal services wherever this can be
more efficiently done. In this manner the role of the municipal public sector would be
reduced to those critical administrative, social, and other operational functions that cannot
be provided efficiently by others.
4.    Together with CAR, the municipalities seeking to participate in PORDUR would
undertake an analysis of the range of services provided by the municipality. Services
currently being provided which could be privatized and/or farmed out to private
concessions would be identified. Consultants would be engaged to assist CAR and the
municipalities in this exercise as necessary. An implementation plan would be drawn up.
5.    Funds from the loan would be made available, on a grant basis, to finance the costs
of consultants in the diagnosis as well as the implementation of the privatization or
concession program. In addition the funds could finance the incremental cost of the
transfer on a declining basis.



74
B. Institutional Development (I1D) Component
(US$10.0 million, 4.5% of project costs)
(a) Objective
6.    Should the initial diagnosis judge them to be necessary the MR component the ID
component will provide entry into the program. The specific objectives of the ID for the
municipalities are to:
(i)   improve local government financial management, particularly
increasing own as a portion of total revenues and efficiency in
current expenditures;
(ii)   reinforce municipal capacity to plan. prioritize, select and
implement efficient infrastructure investments on the basis of
appropriate selection criteria; and
(iii)  strengthen municipal government professional staff in the above
areas through training
(b) Implementation
7.    Eligibility criteria will ensure that all municipalities entering the program develop
an acceptable institutional and financial development plan. The institutional development
plan will be consolidated with the municipal reform program to the negotiating agreement
(accordo de negocia,ao)
8.    Once a program of institutional development actions is agreed, including both
training and technical assistance, the municipality will determine sources of assistance on
the basis of a short list. For training, municipalities will choose among independent
consultants. It is planned that most technical assistance interventions will be executed by
independent consultants according to standards and guidelines prepared by CAR and
agreed with the CAR and the Bank. For technical assistance, municipalities will choose on
the basis of terms of reference and short lists as stipulated under the Program's guidelines
and consistent with Bank procurement guidelines (see Chapter 5).
9.    Sample terms of reference for standard technical assistance irvestments, such as
upgrading of property cadastres, will be agreed with the Bank for tllis purpose. CAR will
also maintain a database of consulting firms interested in providing technical assistance to
municipalities in these areas, to be advertised annually. This list will in no way be
restrictive, and will be available to municipalities simply as a resource.
10.   Because of its fundamental goal of increasing local government own-resource
mobilization and improved efficiency in both current and capital expenditures, the
institutional development component is directly linked to progress on infrastructure
investments. This linkage will be established in each municipality through the PRIM and
sub-loan contracts, and closely monitored through agreed indicators.



75
(c) Technical Assistance Investments (US$4. 1 million)
(i)    The technical assistance sub-component would focus on
interventions in two main areas:
(ii)   fiscal and administrative: upgrading property tax cadastres
(including reevaluating existing property, inclusion of un-registered
property); improving procedures, policies and physical
infrastructure for billing and collection of property and other taxes
and tariffs; improving procurement procedures; and
(iii)   planning: preparing and updating of master plans; updating real
property mapping; works and construction codes and technical
standards.
11.   Technical assistance costs have been estimated on the basis of current market costs of
similar technical assistance interventions in Bahia and other states, estimated by CAR.
Technical assistance investments averaging about US$50,000 per municipality for about 220
municipalities have been budgeted.
(d) Training Investments (US$3.6 million)
12.   The training program is designed to complement the technical assistance component
and would be largely oriented towards on-the-job training, rather than classroom lectures. It
would include, inter alia, the following areas: municipal accounting and budgeting,
procurement methods, land-use planning and usage of master plans, environmental protection
and enforcement instruments, financial and administrative management; project evaluation.
13.   Local training unit costs (costs per participant per day) would be estimated on the
basis of on-going programs implemented by other Brazilian agencies, averaged from
aggregate costs per event per day. Costs include rental of training facilities, trainers' fees and
honoraria, and travel and subsistence costs for both trainers and participants. It is estimated
that about 1200-1500 municipal staff will be trained under the project.
(e) Equipment (US$1.2 million)
14.   PRODLJR will also finance limited and well-justified office equipment purchases,
largely computers, printers, and other office technology upgrades which will improve the
efficiency of processes and information flow in municipalities.
(f) State Technical Assistance and Studies (US$ 1. 1 million)
15    Technical assistance for the CAR would also be provided under this component. The
project would finance training and technical assistance to prepare CAR to discharge the role
of executing agency. This would include hiring of an internationally-recognized urban
advisor. Under this component would also be included the Statewide poverty mapping study,



76
details of which would be discussed during appraisal and agreed during Negotiations (terms of
reference would also be included as Annex 4C).
C. Infrastructure Component
(US$186.5 million, 84% of project costs)
(a) Focus and Dimensioning of PRODUR
16.   Upon taking office in 1995, the new State government identified the basic
sanitation sectors, including water, sewerage, drainage and solid waste as among its key
priorities. As is set out in its Policy Statement on Urban Development, the State's
intention is that the PRODUJR program will be one of its primary vehicle for such
investments in the State.
17.   In order to dimension investments for the PRODUR program, the State and CAR
evaluated several key areas: demand for resources; municipal and State capacity to borrow
and repay loan funds; and State and municipal technical, institutional and financial
absorptive capacity. First, as part of project preparation, in 1994, CAR undertook a
survey of 66 of the State's larger cities, representing about 924,000 inhabitants, or about
8% of the population. The study confirmed that the most widely demanded investments
were water supply, sewerage collection and treatment, solid waste collection and disposal,
street paving and drainage. Second, CAR prepared an evaluation of the credit limits of a
sample of 36 of the State's municipalities, which indicate an annual State-wide debt limit
of on the order of US$200 million. Finally, the State Government demonstrated in its
historic financial statements that for the past several years it has been spending on the
order of US$630 million on annual capital investments, largely in urban infrastructure. It
is the equivalent of these funds which would go into the FUNDURBANO as State
counterpart. The proposed project scope of about US$220 million for infrastructure and
institutional development investments over a six-year period (or about US$37 million per
year) was based on these findings. With State counterpart of about US$72 million (about
US$15 million per year) and about US$33 million from municipalities (about US$5.5
million per year) to be provided each year, the project is conservatively dimensioned.
Simulations indicate that about 77 of the State's municipalities will participate in the
project. While municipalities which have access to loan funds under the Bank-supported
NRPA program would not be eligible, municipal eligibility for sub-loans would depend on
fulfillment of the criteria for selection, eg., acceptable debt capacity and adequate financial
and institutional capacity.
(b) First-Year Program
18.   The proposed Bank loan will finance, together with State and municipal
counterpart resources, a time slice of municipal investments. The investment programs of
subsequent years are likely to mirror that of the first year, although the exact mix of sub-
projects cannot be determined in advance and will be subject to change depending on the
priorities of the sub-borrowers. Thus the physical targets, established on the basis of the
first year program, should be seen as indicative only and will be reviewed throughout
project implementation.



77
(c) Terms and Conditions
19.   The infrastructure component would be subject to the following guidelines: No
municipality will receive more than 10% of total funds lent in any given year, without prior
Bank agreement. This arrangement would be reviewed at the project's mid-term. All
infrastructure sub-projects will be bid and executed by the sub-borrowers. All investments
expected to cost more than US$5 million would require the prior review of the Bank.
20.   As explained elsewhere, infrastructure investments would be financed through sub-
loans for up to 85% of the sub-project costs from the PRODUR Fund and the remaining 15%
(minimum) provided by the municipality as counterpart, in the form of payment of receipts for
expenditures. The form of counterpart contribution would be agreed prior to contracting the
loan, and stipulated in the sub-loan contract between the financial agent, CAR and the
municipality. Each sub-loan would have a grace period and maturity corresponding with the
sub-project's implementation and pay-back periods, respectively.
21.   Municipal governments and local water companies would bid and implement
investments in various water and sewerage investments. Low-cost and alternative
technologies for sewerage treatment would be prioritized. Sewerage treatment investments
would be eligible when, in addition to other selection criteria, technical analysis demonstrates
their benefits to be primarily "on-site," or within the municipality. Those "off-site"
investments, for which benefits may be more broadly spread to other surrounding
municipalities in a water-basin area require formation of a water basin consortium and a
detailed feasibility study, for which grant financing would be available.
(d) Water and Sewerage Investments (US$75.5 million)
22.   Eligible investments under this component would be: (i) water distribution connections
and limited production and treatment; (ii) sewage collection and limited, primarily low-cost
technology, treatment; and (iii) operational improvements such as metering. Water and
sewerage components will be executed by municipalities in cases where they operate the
systems, or by municipal companies, in cases where they operate municipal systems.
Sewerage treatment investments over US$2 million would be subject to Bank prior review.
(e)   Drainage, Paving and Erosion Control Investments (US$75.6 million)
23.   Micro- and macro-drainage and erosion/flood control investments would include
construction and in some cases rehabilitation of drainage networks. Because lands subject to
flooding are generally less valuable, these at-risk areas are often the sites of informal low-
income settlements. Diagnosis of at-risk areas is part of the technical assistance component in
affected municipalities and would be identified in the institutional evaluation process. Paving
investments would include local roads, minor rehabilitation repairs and related retaining walls
and drainage. Most municipalities expected to participate in the program have public works
departments which are capable of designing and supervising these relatively simple works. If
during project implementation the Bank and CAR determine that this is not the case, the State
Roads Department (Departamento de Estradas e Rodagem -DER), or other qualified



78
consultants, could be contracted to operate as a technical agent for works administration and
supervision.
(f) Solid Waste Investments (US$8.9 million)
24.   This component would consist of construction of sanitary landfills, limited alternative
disposal technologies such as recycling and composting plants, and purchase of solid waste
collection and disposal equipment. The component would also include construction of
designated hazardous waste disposal sites. Technical assistance for evaluation and supervision
of sub-projects would be provided by university and local specialized consultants. Solid waste
disposal investments over US$2 million would be subject to Bank prior review.
(g) Complementary Investments (US$15.5 million)
25.   It is expected that other, smaller investments related to the above larger investments
would also be undertaken, such as street-lighting, sidewalks, traffic management, and planting
of trees.
(h) Regional Investments (US$11.1 million)
26.   Regional cooperative investments in large shared infrastructure among several
municipalities, such as landfills. These sub-projects, along with the participating sub-
borrowers, must meet all of the eligibility criteria established in the project. Other project
component include the construction of municipal markets and slaughterhouses and the
construction and/or expansion of air, road and water transport passenger shelters and tourist
bureaus.
D. Urban Uparadini
(US$15.5 million, 7% of costs)
27.   The urban upgrading component would be targeted to areas with average
household income below two minimum wages per month. The objective of the
component would be to provide a package of integrated urban infrastructure investments
to low-income residents in the peripheral areas of cities and towns, where the bulk of the
urban poor are located. The component would be based on standardized designs and unit
costs and would be managed by a special unit within CAR. Eligibility criteria would
include that: (a) beneficiary areas must be within a maximum threshold income level (for
example, three minimum salaries per month per household); (b) the investments would be
limited by a maximum project cost per capita; (b) investments should be integrated; (c)
community participation and organization would need to be demonstrated; (d) residents
would need to have possession of land title, or the area would be able to be converted, or
residents would need to have lived in the area for equal to or more than the amount of
time stipulated by law before titling becomes automatic. Since this was a new approach to
infrastructure service delivery in the State, the overall scope should be limited to US$15.5
million, and it should start small in the first year (limited to US$2 million). Publicity for
the program should include reference to the limited funds available under this component
for the first year, in order to stimulate demand.

ANNEX 4C
BAHIA M UNICIPAL NIFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Outline - Terms of Reference
MAPPING OF POVERTY
(Translation of the Terms of Reference (TORs) agreed at Negotiations)
Justification:
1.    Brazil's efforts to modernize and develop its economy has been comprehensive.
While Brazil is building one of the largest economies in the modern world, its statistics on
the quality of life are alarming. Brazil's complex society requires the implementation of
more efficient policies to overcome its basic problems.
2.    The concern with analyzing poverty conditions, particularly urban poverty, is
worldwide. Efforts in the area have accelerated since the 1970s with emphasis being put
on the dynamics between urban development and economic development. The research
done, so far, shows that the traditional indicators of economic development, such as
GNP, do not capture the full extent of relative or absolute poverty and the miserable
conditions under which those social groups living below the poverty line are subjected.
3.    Poverty indicators used worldwide began to be based more heavily on vital
statistics, such as the Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI), which essentially considers
indicators such as birthrates, infant mortality rates, longevity and education. National
level poverty indicators also use variables such as the percentage of the population with
access to health services, housing, education, income level, access to formal employment,
access to appliances such as stoves, radios and televisions, and access to water, sewage
and electricity services.
4.    The results of such analyses offer a "quality" input for regional urban planning;
moreover, the existence of such studies at the State level can lead to the development of
various policies, especially compensatory policies, which represent an important new role
of the State.
5.    With the support of international institutions, the Federal Government has
undertaken several studies that use variables recognized worldwide to measure the quality
of life of the population. The result has been some conclusions about topics such as
survival rates for children ages 0-6 years, a hunger map, and human development
indicators.



81
6.    These results facilitated interstate and inter-municipal comparisons on the basis of
which a system evolved that explicitly ranks the different States. This, in turn, led to the
establishment of a corresponding national data base on poverty and quality of life. While
the above studies used distinct points of reference, invariably the primary data gathered
were the same; that is, infant mortality rate, mortality rate, life expectancy, percentage of
the population served by sewage services, level of education, etc. By comparing the
results of the different studies, there was little difference found in the ranking of the
municipalities. Hence, the classification of municipalities is consolidated in terms of
poverty level and quality of life.
7.    The global results found for municipalities are easily transposed to the urban area,
as there is little difference in the averages for socio-economic status, with the exception of
medium and large cities. The latter show an imbalance between supply and demand for
urban services due to large migration flows, and normally involve a socially destructive
process characterized by deterioration of the urban environment in the form of slums,
problems with criminality, a reduction in the provision of health services, education,
sewage, etc.--all of which make the quality of life very difficult, especially for the poor.
8.     The number of medium and large cities is relatively small in the State of Bahia. The
classification of municipalities by their urban poverty level is available through the above-
mentioned studies. If adjustments need to be made due to special circumstances, a review
of such studies would be made to gather the needed supplementary information.
9.    While extensive studies make it possible to elaborate on interurban ranking, a
study locating and researching inter-urban poverty in each city is needed to prioritize
Government actions affecting the poor.
Objective:
10.   The objective is to provide to the State the urban planning tools capable of
measuring the level of poverty in each municipality; to create the possibility of making
comparisons between inter- and intra-urban areas; and to make it viable to develop social
policies based on social equity.
11.   To achieve this goal the participation of the municipalities from the planning stage
through the final phase is a priority to obtain results to address the State's actual
circumstances.
Scope and Methodology - The Inter-Urban Poverty Map:
12.   This study would select variables and parameters that facilitate the measurement of
poverty levels and consequently the quality of life in each municipal center, and which
make it possible to identify the intra-urban areas and to classify them by level of need.
13.   To design this "zoning," a very simple methodology is planned that requires the
participation of the municipalities for the input and design of the map.



82
14.   Utilizing maps of the designated city, three or four representatives from each
municipality-- municipal government, board of representatives, and social personalities
chosen according to the local situation--would map the urban location using their
knowledge and experience, and, taking into consideration the quality of life of their
respective populations, would demarcate the different zoning borders.
15.   To verify this initial mapping, the study would consider the following aspects in
each zone: total number of houses; resident population; percentage of households served
by water, electricity, and sewage; urban maintenance; population served by health services
and public education; total number of registered illnesses; family income levels;
predominant types of jobs; household patterns; and other information that would be
relevant for classifying the areas according to their poverty level.
16.   The above-mentioned data are generally available to the municipalities in aggregate
terms. Moreover, the municipal governments have tools that allow the required
information to be provided more precisely. In some cases, it will be necessary to estimate
the data or to gather it in the field.
17.   CAR will participate in the work of compiling the data, with the result being the
design of a map showing the final zoning from the indicators and parameters used in the
study.
Final Product:
18.   The study will present as its final product:
a)    Mapping of regional areas of the urban space to facilitate planning policies
and subsequent actions;
b)    Technology to implement a data base of municipal information.
Consultants Profile:
19.   As the study is multi sectoral it will require a team of professionals with varied
specialties. Ideally, the firm to be chosen would have the following competencies:
experience in developing similar studies; and the individuals to participate
in the study must themselves have experience in similar studies.
successful implementation of similar studies.
Deadline:
20.   90 to 120 days from the date of the signed contract.

ANNEX 4D
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
OUTLINE-DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANCY
Justification:
1.    The State Development and Regional Action Company (CAR) plans to embark on
an ambitious program of urban development that is designed to assist in strengthening
urban infrastructure and services in the State's cities so as to provide better living
conditions for their inhabitants, especially low-income people and the poorest segment of
the urban populations.
2.    In order to carry out this role, CAR needs to develop a strategy and prepare for
the implementation of the Bahia Municipal Infrastructure Development and Management
Project. This strategy would involve a clear vision of the kinds of projects to be financed
and how best to implement them. To work successfully in poor urban areas, CAR will
need to develop techniques or community outreach to tap existing community resources
and to create new leadership structures where these are inadequate. The strategy will
involve three main activities: (1) development of a comprehensive strategy; (2)
development of an appropriate structure and operational procedures; (3) recruitment and
training of staff.
Objectives:
(a)   Conduct a strategic planning exercise that identifies the primary mission of
CAR in urban development and sets priorities for actions, and a timetable
for implementation;
(b)   Identify CAR's information needs, the best sources of such information and
the best ways to collect, store and retrieve data necessary for the
management of the project. This would include data and analyses of
population, migration, morbidity and mortality, income, living levels, urban
services available.
(c)   Modify the structure of CAR so as to carry out the major functions
foreseen. These include planning and budgeting, project evaluation,
community outreach, institutional relations (including contracts), staff and
beneficiary training, financial operations, procurement advising, project
monitoring, evaluation.



84
(d)   Develop appropriate training procedures for CAR staff, prepare specific
training activities, including in-service training, and training of municipal
staff in community mobilization.
(e)    To achieve these objectives, CAR will hire an experienced consultant or
group of consultants that will assist CAR in achieving these goals.
Methodoloty:
3.    The consultant will first prepare a detailed timetable of activities in consultation
with CAR's management. Once agreed, the first strategic planning activity will be planned
and held. Following this activity, the consultant will assist CAR management in
implementing the necessary changes in CAR's structure and procedures. At this time.
CAR will begin receiving and evaluating subproject proposals for year 2 of the project.
The consultant will provide necessary technical assistance for carrying out each of the
functions listed in para. B-3. In conjunction with CAR management, the consultant will
organize and coordinate appropriate training events in each of the activities specified.
Finally, the consultant will participate in the monitoring and evaluation of CAR activities.
Deliverables:
(a)    Agenda for strategic planning exercise.
(b)    A comprehensive list of data sources and a strategy for collecting and using such
data as is necessary for the management of the project.
(c)    A comprehensive database of institutions and individuals in the State and beyond
capable of assisting with each necessary activity including academic and other researchers,
public officials, information sources, a consultant roster, community organization
specialist, relevant NGO's throughout the State, domestic and international sources of
technical assistance, libraries and other documentary resources.
(d)    Detailed terms of reference for each function in para. B-3 including job description
for each professional position.
(e)    Detailed plans for training activities including terms of reference for individuals or
institutions to conduct the training, course descriptions including agendas, training
materials (documents, video materials, etc.), and a schedule for training events. Tentative
suggested list of events:
(i)    The development of the urban network in Bahia (2 days);
(ii)    Economic conditions and the causes of poverty in Bahian cities (3
days);
(iii)  Identification of Poverty Pockets in Bahian Cities (2 days);



85
(iv)   Strategic interventions in Urban Areas (basic sanitation, health
project, education, community mobilization, food and nutrition
programs, employment generation, economic development (5 days);
Urban Management Skills:
(a) Public Administration;
(b)   Planning and Budgeting;
(c)    Scheduling and Monitoring;
(d)   Sanitation in poor neighborhoods.
(v)   solid waste disposal and recycling
(vi)  sewerage and septic systems;
(vii)  water supply
(e)    Community mobilization and public participation in project;

ANNEX 4E
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
CAR: THE EXECUTING AGENCY
1. The State's Companhia de Desenvolvimento e Aqao Regional (CAR) would be the project's
executing agency. CAR would have primary responsibility for all aspects of project implementation,
including evaluation of sub-borrowers' financial and institutional capacity, diagnosis of institutional
requirements and formulation of technical assistance and training packages, evaluation of technical,
economic and financial feasibility of sub-projects, and all general aspects of management, operation
and monitoring of the project. These procedures would all be undertaken on the basis of an agreed
Operational Manuals.
2. CAR was created by State Law in 1983 as a public "autarky," and later transformed into a public
company in order to provide more flexibility in implementation of its responsibilities. CAR's shares
are wholly owned by the State. CAR's Executive Director is appointed by the Governor. The
Secretary of Planning serves as Chairman of the its Board of Directors. CAR is headquartered in the
State's capital, Salvador, and has regional offices in seven medium-sized cities around the State. CAR
has historically acted primarily in the rural sector, and in this capacity has significant experience
implementing decentralized programs, including the World Bank-financed Northeast Rural
Development Program The implementation of the NRDP in Bahia was in fact one of the most
successful of these state-based programs. As of 1991, CAR has also been given responsibility for
execution of the State's programs in urban areas. This is a significant challenge for CAR, which has
an excellent history and experience in the rural sectors but which has relatively little experience in
urban areas. A further challenge stems from CAR's recent (1995) assumption of the responsibilities
of technical assistance to municipalities, a role previously performed by a now-defunct State
company, CEMUR.
3. Detailed discussions have been held with the State and CAR regarding the institutional capacity of
the latter, and plans for strengthening capabilities in the urban area. Plans include restructuring CAR
into three Departments: (a) Regional Development (for rural-oriented programs); (b) Urban
Development; and (c) Municipal Action (for support to institutional strengthening of local
governments). While the management and infrastructure aspects of PRODUR would fall under the
Urban Development Department, the Municipal Action Department would handle the institutional
development component. The ongoing NRDP and its successor, the Northeast Rural Poverty
Alleviation Program (NRPA) now under preparation, would be handled by CAR's Regional
Development division. CAR also has plans to establish about twelve additional regional offices, in the
context of the PRODUR and NRPA projects.
4. Regarding specific project tasks, CAR has established a financial nucleus in the Urban
Development division, which has been trained in public financial analysis. It was also agreed that in
light of CAR's previous rural focus, that both the Urban Development Department, and the project
itself, would benefit from an urban planning and development specialist adviser who could be hired on
a part-time contractual basis as part of the program in order to advise CAR on its role in the
development and implementation of State urban development policy, establishment of an urban
development department within CAR, and help to establish priorities and guide the department in
project execution questions.

ANNEX 5E
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
CAR's APPRAISAL PROCESS
1.    PRODUR is open to all municipalities in the State of Bahia, providing the
municipality adheres to its objectives and meets the basic eligibility criteria for the
program. Steps on the critical path to entry in the Program are presented in detail in the
Program's Operational Manual (OM), and explained below.
(a)   The first step for entry into the program is the signature of a Participation
Agreement between the municipality and the State, indicating municipal
interest in and adherence to Program objectives.
(b)   The second step is completion of a diagnostic form the objective of which
is to gather data related to municipal financial, fiscal, planning,
environmental management and infrastructure service provision.
Depending on municipal capability and preference, this form is completed
prepared by the municipality alone or in conjunction with technical
assistance from private consultants. This diagnostic tool was refined
during appraisal. It is available in the Project File.
(c)   The third step, on the basis of this diagnosis, the municipality agrees with
CAR on a program of priority institutional investments (comprised of
technical assistance and training) for a medium-term period.
(d)   Fourth, the municipality must demonstrate compliance with Federal
legislation regarding payment of intergovernmental taxes and other
obligations.
2.    On the basis of this analysis, a set of standard performance targets are agreed with
the municipality for improved financial and institutional management and formalized the
accordo de negocia,ao. Completion of these steps enables municipalities to begin training
investments.
3.    CAR will play the role of Executive Secretariat (Secretario Executivo, or SE) of
the Program's Board of Directors (Conselho Diretor). In this role, CAR will assist in
filling out the Institutional and Financial Diagnosis Forms, and advice and technical
assistance to ensure that all applications are complete and data is presented correctly and
in a timely way. The assistance of the CAR will be critical in this phase of analysis, as
many other programs have suffered significant set-backs in implementation as a result of
poorly completed applications.



92
4.    To be eligible for infrastructure investments, municipalities will have to
demonstrate creditworthiness, provide a feasibility study (as a minimum) of the proposed
investment, and demonstrate that the investment is: (a) the least cost technical solution
(details of the analysis are shown below); (b) a high-priority investment (compared with
other infrastructure investments) by evaluation of its economic benefits; and (c) that it is
demonstrates cost recovery. Furthermore, in addition to the standard performance targets
to be agreed in the accordo de negociagao, specific cost-recovery targets will be agreed
for infrastructure investments with financing under the Program. As mentioned, the
institutional diagnosis, project feasibility studies (for successfully evaluated projects) and
detailed designs will be eligible as municipal counterpart.
5.    The Urban Department (DU) within CAR will prepare all sub-project appraisals,
with the assistance of technical agents as needed, and according to agreed criteria set out
in operational manuals. DU staff will undertake three main areas of analysis: (a)
creditworthiness/financial evaluation of sub-borrowers; (b) institutional evaluation of sub-
borrowers; and (c) technical, economic and financial evaluation of sub-projects. All
eva.luations will be done by a team of analysts (one engineer, one economist/financial
analyst and one institutional specialist) assigned to each sub-borrower for the full sub-
project cycle, from evaluation through implementation, supervision and monitoring.
A. Creditworthiness and Financial Evaluation of Sub-Borrowers
6.    Upon completion of the initial Participation Agreement, CAR prepares a
creditworthiness evaluation and financial analysis of the municipality or water authority.
Financial evaluation will be done by CAR financial analysts, who are experienced in this
type of analysis.
7.    Creditworthiness is determined on the basis of the criteria set out in Brazilian
Federal Senate Resolution #69 of 1995 on debt limits for the public sector, which are
stringent. The legal limit is determined to be the higher of the following:
(a)   the global amount of performed operations in a financial exercise should
not exceed the value of the loan repayment due or overdue during the year,
or 20% of real net revenues, whichever is higher;
(b)   the maximum annual expenditures, including repayment of principal of all
operations, will not exceed the real savings margin.
8.    Evaluation of financial performance and management is based on review of the
previous three years' financial data, including breakdowns of revenue and expenditures,
trend and ratio analysis, and review of financial management and accounting practices.
9.    Because one of the project's primary objectives will be to improve local financial
management, the aim will be to: (a) improve the relationship between own and transfer
resources in the State; (b) provide adequate cost recovery for all services; (c) improve
current expenditure policies and management practices; and (d) stimulate efficient, cost-
effective investments on the basis of appropriate technical, economic and financial



93
evaluation. Thus, evaluation emphasizes the indicators to be monitored in the program:
proportion of own to transfer revenues, and per capita current and capital expenditures.
10.   The financial evaluation under the project will provide the initial base-line data
required to begin to achieve these objectives. It will also provide complementary
recommendations for improvements in financial management, accounting and auditing
which will tie into the institutional evaluation in the PRIM (see below). Furthermore, this
data will provide the basis for a municipal financial information system (FMIS) in the
State, an important deficit in the sector country-wide as identified in sector work.
11.   The summary creditworthiness evaluation for the approximately 45-50
municipalities were evaluated during appraisal, of which seven to ten would be included in
the Program's first year.
B. Institutional Evaluation of Sub-Borrowers
12.   Following completion of the institutional diagnostic forin, evaluation of municipal
institutional strengths and weaknesses is done by CAR. CAR is in the process of
establishing a group of 4-6 specialists in the area of municipal management and training
who will be dedicated full-time to PRODUR. Guidelines for this analysis are set out in the
Program's OM. The evaluation identifies areas for improvement within two primary
categories:
(a)   administrative and fiscal, to be done in conjunction with the financial
evaluation done by CAR (cadastre, taxes, tax collection performance); and
(b)   municipal planning (zoning legislation, master plans).
13.   The recommended actions would be prioritized (high, medium and low priority)
according to the following criteria:
High:    Those actions which have overall highest impact on improved municipal
financial management, particularly on own resource mobilization; contribute
directly to the economic and financial feasibility of the proposed sub-projects;
and/or strengthen municipal environmental management capacity.
Medium: Those actions which increase municipal resource management in areas other
that the focus of the project.
Low:    Those actions which are desirable but not essential to the project's objectives.
14.   Estimates for implementation time and costing are then determined. Community
participation will be an important factor in determining priorities, and both community
meetings and approval of local representative assemblies will be required prior to the
municipal government's approval of any accordo de negocia,ao. Targets of these
minimum agreed goals would be: (a) own resources as a percent of total; (b) IPTU per
capita; (c) current expenses as a percent of total.



94
15.   Once a municipality has agreed to the accordo de negociaCao, and then
demonstrates sufficient creditworthiness, a feasibility study for investments, this may be
submitted for technical, economic and financial evaluation.
C. Technical, Economic, Financial and Environmental Evaluation of Sub-Projects
16.   The technical, economic and financial evaluation of sub-projects will be performed
according to guidelines set out in the Program's Operational Manual (Volume 2). All
evaluation procedures will employ sensitivity analysis, particularly in cases where risks are
perceived to be high, or when alternatives present similar costs and benefits.
17.   The initial technical evaluation will generally be done on the basis of feasibility
studies. The evaluation will be made by CAR engineers, with the assistance of specialized
consultants as necessary, depending on the required expertise. Engineers will ensure,
through comparative analysis, that the least-cost technical solution has been chosen and
will verify demand for services, dimensioning of proposed investments, design standards
and cost estimates, recommending changes and revisions as necessary. Under the
program, priority will be given to rehabilitation over new systems, and to low-cost
alternative technologies -- where sufficiently well-tested and risk-free, such as anaerobic
stabilization ponds for sewage treatment.
18.   For those infrastructure sub-projects with quantifiable economic benefits,
economic evaluation will be done by CAR economists, on the basis of a model prepared
with the assistance of a consultant experienced in cost-benefit analysis and familiar with
evaluation of similar types of sub-projects. A simple methodology has been selected, in
order to be widely accessible to a wide range of municipalities expected to participate in
PRODUR, since training in cost-benefit analysis for municipal authorities is among one of
the project benefits. For revenue-earning services, user charges will be considered a proxy
for willingness-to-pay (although this does not capture full benefits). For non-revenue
earning services, benefits will be determined on the basis of a Hedonic model, which
employs increased property values as a result of investments as a primary benefit
determinant. Economic costs are net of taxes, debt service payments, depreciation, etc
and represent incremental costs associated with the project. Using a discount rate which
approximates the social opportunity cost of capital, estimated to 12%, individual
investments are evaluated and ranked. A discount period of 15 years is used. If sub-
projects do not achieve the minimum hurdle of 12% economic rate of return, the project is
not accepted and is sent back to the municipal authorities with a recommendation for
measures which would improve the sub-project's viability, such as reviewing project costs
(including reviewing the technical solution proposed, if not shown to be least cost),
increasing user charges and taxes (concurrent tariff study to be recommended as part of
technical assistance). For water and sewerage investments for municipalities or municipal
companies, a marginal cost study will be recommended as part of the technical assistance
package, and results should be explicitly incorporated into the analysis. Details are set out
in Annex 7.
19.   The financial evaluation of sub-projects is designed to ensure that rates of return
meet the cost of borrowing (about 12%), to determine the payback period of the



95
investment, and determine cost recovery instruments, once the investment has been shown
to be technically viable and economically justifiable. This evaluation will be done by CAR
financial analysts, and will be linked to the financial evaluation of the municipality (which
provides the base data for the analysis of cost-recovery potential) and the financial
recommendations in the PRIM with which it must be consistent.
20.   To participate in PRODUR, sub-projects must not have environmentally-negative
impact (most in fact are estimated to have positive impacts). Thus, all proposed sub-
projects must undergo a rigorous environmental evaluation, on the basis of guidelines
established for municipal sub-projects of this nature by the State environment protection
agency (CRA). The CRA guidelines present a clear indication for municipalities of the
type of environmental screening required for municipal and project size, scope and
expected impact, whether full environmental assessment (EIA/RIMA), limited assessment
(RCA) or simple licensing. When EIA/RIMA or RCA are required, private consultants
will be contracted by the sub-borrower, and CRA will review and grant eventual licensing
for acceptable projects. Details are set out in Annex 5H.
21.   Sub-Loan Agreement. The culmination of these evaluations would be a
recommendation which leads to refinement exact priorities and agree on terms of sub-loan
agreements. The summary form makes specific recommendation on the actions to be
taken, loan amounts and conditions of lending, including targets for the three-four
standard indicators, and targets. Specifically, it would include actions and agreements to
achieve the cost-recovery targets for proposed investments and targets for the institutional
interventions. The recommendation is discussed with municipal authorities, and on the
basis of the discussion a financing contract would be signed. This recommendation form
is also used to monitor progress. The sub-loan agreement would be executed through the
financial agent.
22.   Bidding and Implementation of Investments. Municipalities would bid all
infrastructure works, with technical assistance and oversight from CAR, according to the
Program's OM, which is based on Brazilian law and the Bank's guidelines for
procurement. To the extent feasible, the cost of technical agents for sub-project
evaluation and supervision would be included in the interest rate "spread," and
municipalities would be able to choose among qualified agencies.
23.   Monitoring and Evaluation. CAR would monitor and evaluate progress according
to indicators to be agreed at negations and set out in the Program's OM. In addition to
the detailed physical, financial and operational indicators set out in Annex 51, there would
be a group of "key impact indicators" for the purpose of overall evaluation and steering of
the program, both during implementation and at mid-course. The evaluation,
recommendation and monitoring of the project will be computerized, and automated in an
integrated management information system. CAR computer technicians developed a draft
proposal for doing this work was reviewed during appraisal.

ANNEX 5F
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS
I. Environmental Screening and Review Procedures Under PRODUR
1.    PRODUR will finance infrastructure and urban services at the municipal level, for
which the details of the majority of sub-projects were not known at the time of project
appraisal, PRODUR is characterized as a sectoral investment program. Because of this
progranmmatic sectoral nature, and the fact that local governments are the executors of
proposed works, it is necessary to set out specific guidelines for environmental reviews
required for each type of sub-project, in order to be consistent with Brazilian legislation
and World Bank norms. During pre-appraisal an initial version of this typology was
prepared and discussed, and is outlined in Section II below. This was refined during
appraisal (however is not expected to change significantly), and all arrangements were
agreed during Negotiations. These guidelines will become part of the Operational Manual
which orients the program.
2.    The first step in environmental review of sub-projects would be preparation of a
preliminary evaluation or "screening" of each sub-project to determine the extension,
nature and seriousness of its potential environmental impacts, and the type of analysis
which would be required. On the basis of this preliminary evaluation, each sub-project
would be classified in one of three review categories:
(a)   sub-projects whose potential environmental impacts are sufficiently large or
serious and should be subjected to a broad environmental evaluation
(Study/Report on Environmental Impact - EIA/RIMA);
(b)   sub-projects whose potential environmental impacts are less significant and
should be subject to an environmental analysis that is less broad, but
however includes at least an identification of mitigatory measures and
environmental monitoring (Environmental Control Report/Plan -
RCA/PCA); and
(c)   sub-projects which will not have negative environmental impacts and which
will not require a specific environmental evaluation.
3.    Establishment of these guidelines and their enforcement is the function of the
State's environmental protection agency, the Centro de Recursos Ambientais (CRA), with
the approval of the State environmental council Conselho Estadual do Meio Ambiente
(CEPRAM; see Section III). Environmental licensing is the responsibility of CEPRAM.
This licensing is done in three stages: licensing of location (before preparation of
engineering designs, considering principally alternatives of location); (ii) license for
installation (before construction of the project, when alternatives designs are considered);
and (iii) licensing of operation (after construction and before operation).



97
4.    Once the category of each sub-project is determined, the environmental evaluation
would be done on the basis of detailed engineering designs and/or feasibility studies, as
required. Considering the scale and probable location of sub-projects to be financed by
PRODUR, it is anticipated that the great majority of cases where some type of
environmental evaluation or analysis will be necessary will consist of preparation of
Environmental Control Reports and Plans (RCA/PCA; see para. 10).
5.    If it is necessary to undertake a full environmental assessment (EIA/RIMA) for any
given sub-project, the preparation of the EIA/RIMA would be the responsibility of the
sub-project proponent (municipality) through contracting of specialized consultant
services, and on the basis of terms of reference prepared by CRA, previously approved by
CEPRAM and consistent the Bank's guidelines, as set out in OD 4.01. A standardized
draft version of such terms of reference has been prepared by the Borrower. The analysis
of the EIA/RIMA would be done by CRA, which would issue a specific technical opinion
for consideration and approval of CEPRAM, including the conditionalities (mitigatory and
control measures and environmental monitoring) for the concession of licenses to install
and operate the sub-project
6.    Per the Bank's guidelines, the following would be essential elements of any
EIA/RIMA:
(a)   that consultation with the population affected by the sub-project and with
local NGOs is held during the process of preparing the terms of reference
for the EIA/RIMA and once draft versions of the preliminary EIA/RIMA
are available;
(b)   that; the RIMA is accessible to the public in a form which can be easily
understood; and
(c)   that an executive summary of the EAJIMJMA be prepared, describing
succinctly: (i) the legal, administrative and policy framework under which
the EIAJRIMA was prepared; (ii) the sub-project; (iii) the environmental
and socio-economic baseline data; (iv) the environmental impacts expected;
(v) the analysis of alternatives from an environmental standpoint; (vi) the
plan of mitigatory measures; (vii) environmental management and training
actions; and (viii) the environmental monitoring plan.
7.    Both for sub-projects classified in the first (EIA/RIMA) and in the second
(RCA/PCA) categories, mitigatory, compensatory and control and monitoring measures
would be recommended. The technical opinion from CRA would also include
recommendations (with costs, schedule for execution and respective institutional
responsibilities) which would become an integral part of the detailed designs for the sub-
projects. The implementation of these measures during construction and operation would
also be accompanied by the municipality and by CAR, as part of supervision.
8.    Significant involuntary resettlement (more than 100-200 individuals) is not
foreseen under this project. In cases where it may necessary to involuntarily relocate a



98
population larger than 100-200 persons in connection with any sub-project to be
considered for financing under PRODUR, a detailed resettlement plan, acceptable to the
Bank and consistent with OD 4.30, would also be required prior to approval. It was
agreed during Negotiations that any sub-project involving such resettlement would be
subject to the prior-review and appraisal of the Bank prior to disbursement. If a smaller
number of person were to be involuntarily relocated, the following would be the minimum
requirements: (i) adequate compensation; (ii) logistical support in their move; and (iii)
financial assistance in grant form for relocation. The first year program reviewed during
appraisal was found, on the basis of engineering designs and site visits, not to involve any
resettlement.
H. PRODUR Sub-Project Categories and Probable First-Year Investments
9.    CRA has prepared a draft version of a State-wide classification system for
environmental screening and review, based on practice within the State and on the
experience of other states, such as Parana, Minas Gerais, and Ceara which already have
such regulations established. The draft guidelines proposed by CRA break sup-projects
into groups by type and by size (determined by design standards, such as diameter of pipe,
or measures of impact, such as number of hectares affected).
10.   As noted earlier, given the types of proposed sub-projects to be financed under
PRODUR, many investments will not require review and where review will be required, it
will usually be in the form of a PCA/RCA. It is expected that the requirement for
EIA/RIMAs will be rare, and likely to be only for large sewage treatment and solid waste
disposition sub-projects, or larger integrated urbanization sub-projects. The types of sub-
projects actually proposed by CAR that would be subject to analysis or evaluation and
licensing are:
Table 5F-1: PRODUR Sub-Projects and Environmental Reviews
Type of Sub-Project                       Type of Environmental Review Proposed*
Urban upgrading in low-income areas       Licensing or PCA
Water supply systems                      Licensing or PCA
Sewerage networks                         Licensing or PCA
Treatment of sewerage                     PCA or EIA/RIMA
Collection and disposition of solid waste  PCA or EIA/RIMA
Macrodrainage                             Licensing or PCA
Microdrainage, paving, streetlighting,    Licensing
arborization
* Where "or" is indicated, type of review would depend on size and impact of the
proposed sub-project. Detailed criteria are set out in the Project File.



99
11.   It should be noted that integrated sub-projects, for example sewerage trunk
infrastructure, macrodrainage, and paving together, would likely require either a PCA or a
full EIA/RIMA (depending on size and impact), and if involving resettlement would also
require a resettlement plan. Thus in addition to the guidelines above, in order to
adequately screen for such integrated multi-sectoral sub-projects it would be agreed that
any sub-project expected to cost more than US$5 million, and any sewage treatment or
solid waste disposal sub-project expected to cost more than US$2 million, would be
appraised by the Bank prior to approval of the sub-project. This would be monitored in
the project's quarterly reports. Further, it would be a condition of disbursement that all
EIA/RIMAs required under the agreed guidelines, and including mitigatory plans and
resettlement plans, be satisfactory to the Bank.
12.   Sub-projects in the project's first year will be located in seven municipalities. All
of the municipalities have populations in the 65,000 to 200,000 range, and so are on the
large side of the potential universe of borrowing municipalities. It should be noted that
the seven municipalities of the first year are all larger, regional poles. It is more likely that
environmental review would be required for investments in these cities, while the pattern
of investments in subsequent years is likely to involve smaller municipalities and smaller
sub-projects, and thus likely less requirement for full environmental reviews. The
investments proposed, and the likely environmental screening category, are shown below:

]I. Environmental Institutions and Policies in Bahia
13.   Environmental policy in the State of Bahia is guided by State law No. 3,858
(1980), and by regulation t1Orough State decree no. 28,687 (1982), which provide for the
requirement of environmental licensing for certain urban infrastructure and related
investments, particularly sewerage or solid waste treatment or final disposition, water
resource investments and housing development. The federal government's environmental
council (CONAMA) also stipulates licensing for sanitation-related investments, through
resolutions no. 001 (1986) and no. 05 (1988) which note that the detailing of specific
criteria and standards would be left to the States.
14.   The State environmental agency, Centro de Recursos Ambientais, or CRA, was
established in 1980, with the same state law which established State environmental policy.
At the same time, the State's environmental council, Conselho Estadual do Meio
Ambiente, or CEPRAM, which authorizes environment-related decisions and policies, was
established.
15.   CRA is responsible for elaborating the State's Environmental Plan and for the
following activities: coordinating and executing State environmental recuperation policy,
identifying activities of the public power and private initiative which could potentially
cause environmental impact, establishing norms for environmental control according to
directives established by CEPRAM, environmental education, maintaining information
systems related to environment and pollution, evaluating environmental quality and
impacts, preparing inventories of environmental resources, proposing to CEPRAM
standards for quality and criteria for sustainable management, and issuing technical
opinions related to concession of licensing for location, construction and operation which
may cause environmental impact, based on the previous analysis specified.
16.   An organization chart for CRA is shown below. Although once based largely in
the metropolitan region of Salvador, as a result of much of the State's industry being
centralized there, CRA has established regional offices in Ilheus, Jequie, Barreiras, Feira
de Santana and Juazeiro, as well as a dedicated office in the petrochemical pole of
Camacari in the RMS. This regionalization has accompanied the industrial, mining and
agricultural growth in the State.

17.    CAR's ability to review environmental assessments is currently being strengthened
under a recently-approved IDB-financed project for Pollution Control of the Bahia dos
Todos os Santos. If funds are not provided in a timely way under this project for such
strengthening, it would be possible to reallocate funding under the proposed project for
this purpose.

SELECTED KEY MONITORING INDICATORS
1.    A detailed set of monitoring indicators, and methodology for calculation, source of
data, standards for measurement and levels (where applicable) would be set out in the
project's Operational Manual. These indicators would include standard physical
measurements of works completed, unit costs per sub-project, number of training and
technical assistance interventions, etc., as well as financial/economic measures such as
disbursement rates and unit costs per sub-project.
2.    In order to measure the impact of the project, as well as physical and financial
progress, a group of key monitoring indicators would also be selected from the larger
group of monitoring indicators. A sample of likely indicators are set out below, and
divided into five categories: (a) a group of selected "key impact indicator" (which have
established targets that attempt to demonstrate the expected impact of the project): (b)
infrastructure investments; (c) institutional development; (d) financial/fiscal; and (e)
project implementation. Because of the difficulty in establishing reliable base data for the
whole State, preliminary estimates of status for the indicators below would be part of the
first year's quarterly reports, and would be monitored (and adjusted) thereafter as a
normal part of project reporting, along with the physical and financial measurements of
project progress.

ANNEX 5J
BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The Project
1.    Project Description and Objectives - The Bahia Municipal Infrastructure
Development and Management Project (PRODUR) is designed to be the first phase in a
long-term State program to support development of local financial management capacity
and priority infrastructure investments, the former through direct financing, and the latter
through an urban development fund. Through the proposed project, the Bank loan and
State counterpart funds would capitalize the PRODUR Municipal Development Fund
(FUNDUTRBANO) which would on-lend resources to municipalities for economically-
viable urban infrastructure investments on the basis of well-defined sub-borrower
creditworthiness and sub-project eligibility criteria. Poverty-targeted urban upgrading
would be financed by a combination of loan, grant and local contributions.
2.    The objectives of the proposed project would be to: (a) strengthen the
institutional and financial management of urban municipalities so as to enable them to
better manage their resources in support of the State's decentralization and economic
growth strategies; and (b) improve the living conditions of the State's urban residents,
primarily the urban poor, through: (i) establishing a mechanism for sustainable long-term
financing of priority urban infrastructure for local governments; (ii) development of
detailed, reliable systems for mapping of urban poverty in the State to guide State and
local investment strategies; and (iii) a poverty-targeted program of urban upgrading in
critically poor urban areas.
3.    The proposed project would consist of (i) an institutional development component
to upgrade municipal financial administration, in particular property tax records and
collection; (ii) a basic urban infrastructure component to improve water, sewerage,
drainage, solid waste, street paving and lighting in the municipalities of Bahia; and (iii) an
urban upgrading component, consisting of about 20% of the funds for infrastructure which
would be targeted to very poor urban areas. Poverty mapping at the State level would
also be undertaken.
4.    Economic and Financial Analysis - Economic cost-benefit analysis would be
done to determine project viability. The minimum criteria for sub-projects would be that
they provide an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) which meets or exceeds the
opportunity cost of capital, for which the rate of 12% serves as a proxy. In the case of
revenue-earning services, such as water, sewerage and public lighting, economic benefits
would be calculated on the basis of tariff revenues as a proxy for willingness to pay. In
the case of non-revenue earning services, such as drainage and paving, economic benefits
would be based on increased land values as a result of the infrastructure improvements.



107
For those sub-projects estimated to cost less than US$500,000 per capita benefits would
be sufficient, providing the technical solution is least-cost and benefits are shown to be
largely within the municipality. Financial cost-benefit analysis would provide the basis for
determining cost-recovery. All infrastructure sub-projects (with the exception of some
sewage treatment and solid waste disposal), are expected to achieve full cost recovery.
Sub-project investments would be linked to specific targets to increase user fees and taxes,
to be agreed with municipalities in the PRIM and reflected in the terms and conditions of
sub-loans for infrastructure investments.
5.     Project Risks - The major project risk is implementation of the institutional
development program, which is a challenging component requiring significant advance
planning, in particular in a state with varied municipal institutional capacities. For this
reason, agreed technical assistance and training programs and targets for municipalities to
enter the project's first-year program have been prepared and progress on the institutional
development component will be linked explicitly to the infrastructure component for all
sub-borrowers. This risk is also somewhat mitigated through the executing agency's
access to the experience of other states with similar projects. There are few technical risks
associated with the project, since most infrastructure investments are of a routine nature,
with the exception of certain sewerage treatment sub-projects which may employ low-cost
alternative technologies still somewhat innovative and less-well tested. Amounts allocated
to this type of sub-project are limited, and Bank prior-review of sub-project proposals
minimizes this risk. There is a risk that municipal elections in 1996 may be disruptive to
the project, however the fact that the State government recently took office (January
1995) for a four-year term which coincides with the project implementation period,
diminishes this risk somewhat by ensuring continuity at the State level. The executing
agency is an experienced State agency with a good record in implementing projects
financed by multilateral agencies.

6.    Municipal Development Fund (FUNDURBANO) - The PRODUR
FUNDUJRBANO would be established by the State and loan administration and
management of the fund would be undertaken by DESENBANCO. About US$84.0
million equivalent of the Bank loan would capitalize the FUNDURBANO, together with
about US$75 million of State resources. This is equal to the full amount less about
US$16.0 million, which, together with State counterpart would finance the institutional
development, municipal reform and the low-income urban upgrading component, which
would be financed separately from the FUNDURBANO. The FUNDURBANO would
on-lend to municipalities for up to 85% of the cost of eligible infrastructure sub-projects.
The remaining counterpart (minimum 15%) would be provided by sub-borrowers, through
payment of invoices (or in-kind labor contributions, in the case of smaller municipalities).
Sub-loans would be made to sub-borrowers in three categories, with terms of up to five,
ten and fifteen years (including grace periods of one to three years), depending on the
cost-recovery profile of the investments
2. Implementation Arrangements
7.    Institutional Arrangements - The Borrower would be the State of Bahia. The
State would use the proceeds of the Bank loan and its own counterpart funds to capitalize
a municipal development fund (FUNDURBANO), to be managed by a commercial bank
to be selected under procedures to be agreed. The State's Companhia de
Desenvolvimento e Afiao Regional (CAR) would be the project's executing agency. CAR
would execute Parts A-D of the project. CAR would have primary responsibility for all
aspects of project implementation, including evaluation of sub-borrowers' financial and
institutional capacity, diagnosis of institutional requirements and formulation of technical
assistance and training packages, evaluation of technical, economic and financial feasibility
of sub-projects, and all general aspects of management, operation and monitoring of the
project. These procedures would all be undertaken on the basis of an agreed Operational
Manuals (para. 2.4 below). Environmental evaluations would be done through the State's
Centro de Recursos Ambientais (CRA; see Annex 5H). While CAR would handle all day-
to-day activities of PRODUR, program management would be handled by a Board of
Directors. The Board would be chaired by the State Secretariat of Planning, and
membership would include representatives from the Secretariat of Finance, other
government agencies, and the Association of Municipalities. CAR would serve as the
Executive Secretariat of the Board. The organization chart for PRODUR is presented in
Annex 5A. Institutional arrangements for the proposed project are detailed in Annex SB.
8.    The State will strengthen the capabilities of CAR in the area of providing technical
assistance to municipalities. Plans include restructuring CAR into three Departments: (a)
Regional Development (for rural-oriented programs); (b) Urban Development; and (c)
Municipal Action (for support to institutional strengthening of local governments). While
the management and infrastructure aspects of PRODUR would fall under the Urban
Development Department, the Municipal Action Department would handle the
institutional development component. CAR also has plans to establish about twelve
additional regional offices.



109
9.    Regarding specific project tasks, CAR has established a financial nucleus in the
Urban Development division, which has been trained in public financial analysis, as well as
similar groups for economic and technical evaluation of sub-projects. CAR would hire
consultants when and as necessary to assist with project implementation.
10.   Operational Arrangements - Operational arrangements are set out in the
Program's Operational Manual (OM). Final versions of each of the volumes would be
agreed during Negotiations and the PRODllR program would be operated in accordance
with the OM. The OM would be simplified and summarized in small leaflets which would
be used in the marketing of the program. The OM is described further in Annex SC.
11.   Eligible Sub-borrowers - The PRODUR program would be open to almost all
municipalities in the State which meet the Program's eligibility criteria, with the exception
of those localities eligible for the NRPA program and its planned successor. While there
are approximately 400 municipalities in the target group of eligible municipalities, it was
agreed that the probable beneficiary group would be those municipalities with populations
over 15,000 (approximately 220 in the State, representing about 80% of the total
population). Full sub-borrower eligibility criteria are detailed in the Program's Orientation
Operational Manual referenced above. Key steps for entry are as follows:
(a)   signature of a Participation Agreement (Convenio de Adhesdo) which
formalizes municipal interest in PRODUR and commitment to its
principles;
(b)   completion of an institutional and financial diagnosis, according to rapid
assessment methodology developed and tested under similar programs in
other states;
(c)   establishment of an agreed set of institution-building actions, with clearly-
defined performance targets, outlined in a Municipal Reform and
Institutional Development Plan (PRIM);
12.   To undertake infrastructure sub-loans, municipalities and water agencies would
demonstrate:
(a)   demonstrated compliance with Federal legislation on payment of taxes and
other obligations;
(b)   demonstrated debt capacity according to federal guidelines for public
sector borrowing (set out in Senate Resolution #69, 1995);
(c)   availability of required counterpart funds (minimum 25% of proposed
project costs); and
(d)   ability to provide a guarantee (typically ICMS contribution).
13.   Legal Arrangements - Implementation arrangements for the project would be
formalized in the following legal documents:
a)    State law authorizing the State to borrow from the Bank and establishing
the FUNTDURBANO;
State decree regulating the FUNDURBANO;



110
b)    Regulations of FUNDURBANO;
c)    Contract between the State of Bahia, CAR and the financial agent to
implement the program;
d)    Model participation agreement between the State, CAR and municipality;
e)    Model negotiation agreement between CAR and municipality (for the
institutional development component);
f)    Model contract between CAR and municipality for implementation of a
sub-project; and
g)    Model municipal law authorizing a municipality to participate in PRODUR.
14.   Draft versions of all of these documents have been prepared and were reviewed
during Appraisal. Agreement on the final version of the model Participation Agreements
and Sub-Loan Contracts were reached during negotiations. Agreement was reached that
all conditions present in the legal agreements between the Bank and CAR, the State and
the Federal Government, would be reflected in the sub-agreements, as necessary.
15.   Bank's Role During Implementation - The Bank would ensure that: (i) project
objectives are being achieved; (ii) legal covenants are being fulfilled; (iii) the Bank's
procurement guidelines are being applied; (iv) cost recovery measures were being
achieved; (v) sub-borrower and sub-project selection processes are transparent and that
criteria agreed in the Operational Manuals are being applied; and (vi) provide technical
assistance in selected areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage (i.e. regional and
sectoral best practices, environmental assessment, resettlement, economic and financial
evaluation). This would be done through periodic supervision missions (about two per
year), frequent communication with the Borrower, principally through electronic mail, and
review of periodic reports and studies. The Bank would review procurement processes on
a ex-ante basis, all procurement of goods, works, and consultant services over the limits
established as follows: (i) all contracts for civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$5.0 million or more; (ii) all contracts for goods estimated to cost US$300,000 or
more; (iii) all consultant contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or more for individuals
and US$100,000 or more for firms; and (iv) terms of reference for all consultant services,
regardless of value. In addition, the Bank would review all sub-projects expected to cost
the equivalent of US$5 rmillion or more (US$2 million in the case of the first three sewage
treatment and solid waste disposition sub-projects) would be subject to specific review
and appraisal of all technical, economic, financial and environmental aspects by the Bank.
Given the large number of small and medium-sized sub-projects expected during this
project, ex-post reviews on the basis of spot-checking would be undertaken below these
amounts during supervision. Sub-projects would be considered for review until three
months before the project's Closing Date. A Mid-Term Review will be carried-out by the
Bank and the Borrower approximately three years after Effectiveness to assess the
project's progress and its achievement of objectives, and to reorient implementation if
deemed necessary

3. Implementation Schedule
16.   The project's implementation schedule, which outlines key actions in project
execution for smooth implementation is attached and will be finalized during negotiations.
This will be further detailed through the use of project management software, to be
established and programmed during the project's inception mission. Of primary
importance are targets for Participation Agreements with municipalities, procurement of
major works, and progress on technical assistance interventions. This schedule is to be
prepared on a rolling quarterly basis. Arrangements for project supervision are outlined in
the supervision plan in Annex 5K. Physical project supervision will be carried out by the,
regional offices of CAR, the DU and its consultants on the basis of site checks.
4. Monitoring and Evaluation
17.   In addition to CAR's site visits, sub-borrowers would be expected to present
periodic progress reports on project implementation (with periodicity established in sub-
loan contracts), on the basis of which CAR would furnish concise quarterly progress
reports to the Bank. These reports would compare actual and forecast progress. The
detailed range of project monitoring indicators is provided in the OM (Volume 5). These
include standard agreed performance indicators monitoring physical, financial and
operational progress of individual sub-projects, and aggregated project performance for all
sub-projects. A set of "key impact indicators" and targets, selected from among the group
of indicators to be monitored during the project, would be agreed, including inter alia: (a)
number of Participation Agreements signed; (b) number of PIMs completed; (c) overall
project completion, measured in expenditures; (d) discretionary as a percent of total State
transfers to municipalities; and (e) average property tax per capita in the State (see Annex
5K). These indicators, among others, would be monitored in quarterly reports.
Agreement was reached during Negotiations that quarterly reports be furnished no later
than 30 days after the end of each of the following quarters: March 31, June 30 and
September 30, and an annual report would be prepared for the December 31 period, to be
furnished within two months of year-end. These reports would include, inter alia, the
monitoring indicators set out in the OM, as well as a forecast investment plan. Reporting
requirements would begin with the first full quarter following Effectiveness.

BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURF, DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
SUPFRVISION PLAN
1.    A supervision strategy has been tentatively formulated, emphasizing: (i) a thorough
and detailed project inception or launch mission, the aim of which will be to test the
soundness of the basic project planning, implementation and monitoring tools; (ii) periodic
shorter missions of local consultants, in addition to at least two full supervision missions
per year; and (iii) establishment of electronic mail communication between the Bank
headquarters in Washington and ihe project office in Salvador.
2.    To launch the project, an inception mission is planned for the third quarter of
FY97 (February 1997). The mission would be scheduled for about one and a half weeks,
and would comprise a sanitary engineer, an environmental specialist, institutional
development specialist, economist and operations assistant in addition to the task manager
(and brief visits from procurement and disbursement staff, as needed). Following project
inception two additional supervision missions would be held during the fiscal year, in order
to build on the momentum of project inception and to iron-out any implementation
difficulties. Local consultants would make periodic visits to bolster implementation
between missions during this critical first year. For FY97 and FY98, a minimum of two
full-scale supervision mission would be scheduled per year consisting of a four-person
core team (engineer, institutional development specialist, environmental specialist and task
manager), complete with site visits, along with one to two shorter, skeleton-staffed
supervision visits during the year, also utilizing local consultants for between-mission
consultative visits.
3.    During project preparation, standardized reporting arrangements were discussed
and would be agreed during project launch, in order to streamline supervision. A mid-
term review would be scheduled for approximately the fourth quarter of FY2000, for
about one and a half weeks, and including an engineer, and environmental specialist, an
economist, institutional development specialist and operations assistant in addition to the
task manager. The objectives of the mnid-term review would include, inter alia:
(a)   review of progress and achievements on the institutional development
component;
(b)   review the beneficiary population in the context of poverty mapping and
make any mid-term adjustments required;
(c)   review of key performance indicators (i.e., ex-post rate of return
evaluation; increase in own-source revenue collections);



115
(d)   review of the allocation of resources among sub-components and proposed
re-allocation, as necessary, depending on project progress and consistency
with project objectives;
(e)   effectiveness of institutional and implementation arrangements, and degree
to which these could be simplified and/or adjusted to improve project
implementation efficiency and effectiveness;
(f)   review the success of the poverty targeted urban upgrading component and
make mnid-course adjustments as required;
(g)   determine the appropriateness of use of simplified economic evaluation of
smaller sub-projects (US$500,000 or less) using indicators monitored
during the first years of project implementation; and
(h)   assess CRA's effectiveness in environmental review of sub-projects.

BRAZIL
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
EVALUATION OF SUB-PROJECTS
1.    Methodology. Most Sub-projects proposed by municipalities for financing under
PRODUR will be subject to five stages of evaluation: (i) technical; (ii) economic; (iii)
financial; (iv) environmental; and (v) public health. Subprojects such as water and
sewerage network eytensions, water system improvements, drainage, paving and street
lighting investments, have readily quantifiable benefits. These sub-projects will undergo
economic and financial evaluation according to agreed selection criteria and
methodologies which are set out in the project's OM. A simple methodology has been
followed, in order to be widely accessible to a wide range of municipalities expected to
participate in PRODUR.
2.    Technical Evaluation. Through in-house engineering expertise and external
consultations where necessary, CAR will examine the appropriateness of the specifications
of each proposed subproject, ensuring that least cost solutions are applied, as well as
verifying that a demand exists for the proposed services.
3.    Economic Evaluation. This will use cost: benefit analysis to estimate economic
rates of return (ERRs) of proposed investments which must exceed the long term
opportunity cost of capital in Brazil, currently estimated at 12%. For non-revenue
generating services--notably paving and drainage--increased land values resulting from the
improvements would be used to measure benefits. For revenue generating services--such
as water, sewerage and solid waste collection--financial flows from payments made by
users, less taxes, would be used as a proxy for economic benefits.
4.    Since the proposed project takes a programmatic approach to financing municipal
investments, an exact forecast of investments for the project implementation period is not
possible. Based on estimated project costs and performance of similar projects, some 75%
of investments should have readily quantifiable benefits under the selected methodologies.
Project components without quantifiable benefits, such as institutional development,
would not be subject to economic evaluation. The financial benefits from technical
assistance investments in the area of fiscal and financial modernization would be evaluated
and closely monitored, however.
5.    Economic benefits measured for PRODUR's economic evaluation would be as
follows. For revenue-earning services, such as water supply and sewerage, user charges
would be used as a proxy for willingness-to-pay benefits (although this does not capture
full benefits such as consumer surplus). For non-revenue earning services, such as paving
and drainage, benefits would be determined through increased property values--expressed
as a fifteen year benefit stream--resulting from the improved living conditions provided by



120
the investments. Estimates of property value changes would be made empirically for each
proposed subproject by the municipalities and verified by CAR, by comparing with-project
and without-project scenarios. This would involve observing the difference between the
value of the unimproved area slated for investment, and the value of a similar area already
served by urban infrastructure of the kind proposed. Local real estate agents and residents
would be the primary source of this market information, which would be cross-checked
with data from similar projects elsewhere in Brazil and consolidated into a PRODUR
project cost and benefit data base. As more and more sub-projects are evaluated, this data
base would serve as a basic reference for verifying the accuracy of subproject information
contained in applications for PRODUR financing. Experience from Bank financed projects
in other states of Brazil has shown that, through the stronger demand for environmentally
improved areas, land values can increase significantly after infrastructure and urban service
improvements in low income neighborhoods.
6.    Economic evaluation will take the economic costs of sub-projects to be all capital
expenditures and all necessary re-investment, plus recurrent expenditures for operation
and maintenance. All economic costs and benefits are assumed to be net of taxes and
duties. Subproject selection criteria would ensure that least cost technical solutions are
selected. As a priority, the proposed project would first optimize the use of existing
facilities. A fifteen year discount period would be used as a standardized economic life of
the investments. A model for each type of sub-project has been developed by the
Borrower for use in sub-project screening and evaluation.
7.    Economic evaluation for selected sub-projects in a number of cities and sectors
were reviewed during appraisal. Based on the sample of sub-projects reviewed--paving
and water supply sub-projects--it is expected that economic rates of return for this type of
investment will be of the order of 12%-35%. Ex-post economic evaluation conducted for
such investments undertaken in other states (with similar programs) indicate rates of
return in the range of 12-90%. For Loan Negotiations, the Borrower provided finalized
cost-benefit analyses of the first year program of the municipality whose investments are in
the most advanced stage of preparation. Subproject evaluation of the remainder of the first
year program for other cities would be a condition of Loan Effectiveness.
8.    During the first half of project implementation, responsibility for undertaking the
subproject cost-benefit analyses will rest primarily with the PRODUR evaluation team in
CAR, who will build up a data base of subproject cost and benefit information. At the
same time, it is expected that CAR will be able to fully build-up an in-house capability in
these evaluation tasks. Thereafter, during the second half of project implementation, CAR
will provide technical assistance to participating municipalities in subproject evaluation so
that each participating city may be able to train its own staff and develop its own capacity
to assess the performance of investments and determine priorities for their own municipal
investment program based upon efficiency criteria implied by the cost-benefit analysis.
9.    Financial Evaluation and Cost Recovery. Where financial costs are benefits are
clearly discernible in the case of revenue generating services, PRODUR would estimate
the internal financial rates of return (FRR) of proposed sub-projects. This estimate would
help determine cost-recovery requirements and establish guidelines for sub-loan terms and



121
conditions. Benefits would be the same as for the economic evaluation. Costs would
include all taxes, debt service and other charges. The financial evaluation would use
financial rates of return (FRRs) as the basis for determining cost recovery. All revenue
generating investments are expected to achieve a FRR for the municipality of at least 6%.
10.   Environmental screening. This would be ensured through the compliance, where
appropriate, of all sub-projects with the State's own rigorous environmental requirements
(details: Annex 5F).
11.   Evaluation of Public Health Impacts. Because of their high up-front capital cost
and relatively small financial returns, sewerage sub-projects rarely generate sufficient
measurable benefits to justify the investment in purely financial or economic terms. For
example, recent experience in the state of Minas Gerais has shown that using tariffs paid
by beneficiaries as a proxy for such benefits, estimated internal rates of return seldom
exceeded 6%. In spite of this, sewerage systems are believed to generate large health
benefits over long periods, especially to a low income communities which formerly may
have had no basic sanitation service. These benefits are not captured by the tariffs that
beneficiaries typically pay, or even those they may be willing to pay.
12.   For this reason, the health benefits likely to accrue from sewerage investments
proposed by the project would be examined separately by PRODUR. Introducing this kind
of basic sanitation into an area of a city which previously had none can significantly reduce
the incidence of diarrhea and waterborne intestinal diseases among the beneficiary
population. According to Bahia State health officials, at least 50% of cases of these
diseases can be eliminated through basic sanitation improvements of the kind envisioned
under the project. In Bahia, waterborne intestinal diseases are responsible for 4.0% of
deaths among the population as a whole, three times as much as mortality resulting from
traffic accidents. Children are particularly vulnerable to these diseases, which account for
17.1% of infant mortality in the State of Bahia.3
13.   This method involves estimating DALYs (disability adjusted life years) lost
through specific diseases. The DALY measures healthy life years (DALYs) lost per group
of 1,000 persons affected by a combination of mortality and disability caused by each of a
series of specific diseases. DALYs are expressed as the present value of the weighted
averages of the estimated years equivalent lost among different age groups. The 1993
WDR tabulates observed DALY values for 1990 by disease and by region of the world.4
14.   For the purposes of the project, the estimate of DALYs saved in Bahia was based
upon three important premises:
*     The number of DALYs per disease and 1,000 people in the urban areas of Bahia
have the same value as the 1993 WDR estimates for Latin America as a whole.
3Bahia, Centro de Informacoes da Secretaria de Saude Anuario Estatistico: Informac6es de Saude, Salvador 1994.
4As proposed in the World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health (WDR-93).



122
*     Only DALYs resulting from two disease groups are susceptible to reduction
through sewerage systems: (i) diarrhea, and (ii) worm infections. According to the
1993 WDR, these two groups together account for 8.2% of all DALYs in LAC, or
19.1 DALYs per annum per 1,000 people in the region.
*     Sewerage projects will reduce the incidence of these diseases among the people
directly served by 50%, thereby eliminating half the respective DALYs lost per
annum.
*     To establish a methodology to be used under the proposed project, first the total
number of DALYs saved through the project we examined, and then the cost
effectiveness of the project investment with respect to each DALY saved, was
estimated. The latter was measured by the investment cost per DALY.
15.   Preliminary results indicate that a sewerage scheme benefiting 3,600 people in the
city of Amargosa could save 34 DALYs annually among the community over the life of
the investment at an initial cost of R$5,355 per DALY saved. Additional results for other
cities will be forthcoming by Loan Effectiveness.
