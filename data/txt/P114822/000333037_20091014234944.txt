Main policy areas    The proposed Development Policy Loan supports strengthened
                     budget management, improved governance and accountability
                     in public procurement, creation o f a more efficient civil service
                     and public administration, establishment o f a targeted social
                     safety net to protect the poorest, and reduction in the role o f
                    the state in the economy.
Key outcome              Primary balance rises from -2.0 percent o f GDP in 2008 to
indicators               exceed the original 6.2 percent o f GDP primary surplus
                         target for 2009 envisaged in the program.

                         Overall subsidies o f the government to parastatals fall.
Program development The objective o f the proposed operation i s to help the
objectives and      Seychelles establish a stable macroeconomic environment and
contribution to     sustainable fiscal framework. This will be achieved through
Interim Strategy    fiscal adjustment underpinned by public administration and
                    civil service reforms and a reduction o f the role o f the state in
                    commercial activities.          The operation also supports
                    establishment o f a targeted social safety net. By providing
                    foreign exchange in a timely manner, the operation will
                    directly contribute to stabilization o f the economy during a
                    period o f global slowdown and will help i n building public
                    support for the reform process.
R i s k s and risk  The operation faces five main risks. The first source o f risk
mitigation          arises from external shocks generally and in particular that o f
                    the global economic slowdown which could make sound
                    macro and fiscal management more challenging. The second
                    risk i s that the government's commitment to reforms may
                    weaken if reform outcomes do not deliver results. Related to
                    both these risks. i s the risk that external arrears will
                    subsequently build-up if the fiscal and macroeconomic reform
                    program goes o f f track. However, the results o f reforms are
                    showing that the immediate effects o f the shock have been
                    absorbed and are n o w starting to stabilize (although there i s
                    still a significant shock to the real sector this year, with
                    unemployment levels remaining below 5 percent).
                    Nonetheless, government commitment to the program remains
                    firm and, it i s highly unlikely that there will be serious policy
                    reform reversals. T o some extent the risk i s also being
                    mitigated by the government's strategy to work closely with
                    development partners that have made technical and financial
                    commitments to support the government as these reform
                    policies are implemented. The recent Paris Club debt relief
                    agreement has also yielded tangible results that the
                    government i s able to demonstrate to the public, and this has
                    added to the credibility o f the reform process. This risk i s
                    limited by the focus o f the proposed operation o n fiscal and
                    public sector reforms, where the main policy actions have
                    already been implemented and reform reversal risk i s minimal.
                    The measures supported by the operation help achieve fiscal
                    sustainability, including debt sustainability. The third risk is
                    the fiduciary risks related to auditing capacity weaknesses,
                    which i s being mitigated by closely working with the IMF
                    technical capacity team o n the issues. The fourth risk i s the
                    sporadic piracy attacks o n tuna fishing vessels using
                    Seychelles' territorial waters.      This reduced tuna exports
                    earlier in the year. This risk is being mitigated by working
                    closely with other countries (such as the United States and
                    France) that are providing enhanced protection and assistance
                    to Seychelles' coast guard.

                                   1. INTRODUCTION

 1.     This program document describes a development policy loan (DPL) designed
to support the adjustment and reform strategy o f the Government of the Seychelles.
The proposed operation involves a single tranche o f 6.4 million (US$9 million
equivalent) and i s conceived as a one-time operation supporting structural reforms to put
the Seychelles on a sustainable development path. The objective o f the proposed
operation i s to help the Seychelles establish a stable macroeconomic environment and
sustainable fiscal framework.          This will be achieved through fiscal adjustment
underpinned by public administration and civil service reforms and a reduction o f the role
o f the state in commercial activities. The operation also supports establishment o f a
targeted social safety net. By providing foreign exchange in a timely manner, the
operation will directly contribute to stabilization o f the economy during a period o f
global slowdown and will help in building public support for the reform process. The
proposed DPL i s expected to achieve substantial measurable outcomes during 2009 and
2010 and to contribute to the achievement o f restoring internal and external balances with
the assistance o f the international financial institutions and development partners.

2.      I n late 2008, after many years of pursuing an unsustainablefiscal policy and
managing a distorted and overvalued foreign exchange regime, the Government of
the Seychelles embarked upon a fundamental economic reform program. This
program aims to put the economy on a path toward macroeconomic stability, and to
redefine the role o f the state in the economy to give the private sector the major role in
operating commercial enterprises. The Seychelles faced acute economic difficulties in
2008 as a result o f past economic mismanagement exacerbated by high global o i l and
food prices and the downturn in the global economy. This resulted in missed debt-
service payments in mid-2008 and the subsequent downgrading o f i t s credit rating by
Standard & Poor's. Faced with these difficulties and the fact that Seychelles would not
achieve external debt sustainability without a sizeable reduction in the present value o f i t s
debt, the authorities responded quickly by adopting in November 2008 a comprehensive
reform program supported under a two-year Stand-By Arrangement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). At the same time the authorities initiated debt restructuring
negotiations with the Paris Club creditors and other private and official creditors.
Following the successful completion o f the first review o f the Stand-By Arrangement, the
Paris Club in mid-April 2009 granted exceptional debt relief to the Seychelles, providing
an opportunity for the country to attain fiscal and external debt sustainability. The IMF
in June completed its second review o f the Stand-By Arrangement, noting that all
quantitative performance criteria were observed and that the structural reform program
was on track. A further disbursement o f SDR 0.88 million (about US$1.4 million) was


                                               3
approved by the IMF Board on 25 September. An IMF team plans to travel to the
Seychelles in late October to discuss a follow-up arrangement under the Extended Fund
Facility.

3.       The proposed DPL i s based on the government's reform program as
articulated in the detailed policy statements of the Ministry of Finance to the
parliament for the 2008 and 2009 budgets and in the president's speech to the
nation in late February 2009. Both the 2008 and 2009 budgets aimed at achieving
upfront strong fiscal adjustment with sizeable primary surpluses in both years despite the
global crisis. Policy statements for 2008 and 2009 presented to the parliament specify
how these targets would be achieved (for details see section 3 o f this document). Policy
measures supported by this operation directly focus on these areas. The current reform
program i s in line with the government's commitments under the IMF supported Stand
By Arrangement. The long t e r m vision for development in Seychelles ("Strategy 2017")
i s currently under review to reflect the current realities and the economic reform program.
To support the development o f a fully articulated medium-term plan, the Bank prepared a
Public Expenditure Review (PER).' The PER helped the government to identify key
fiscal reforms and develop a public sector reform roadmap, and the government has
already implemented many o f its recommendations. The PER i s also providing the Bank
and other donors with the analytical basis for potential financial support.

4.      The Seychelles reform package includes measures to protect vulnerable
groups and to expand employment in the private sector to cushion expected job
losses due to downsizing o f the public sector. As the foreign exchange depreciation has
passed through to domestic inflation prices, real incomes and household consumption
have been adversely affected. Although this effect has proved to be a one-off adjustment,
the government introduced a new social welfare system to protect the most vulnerable. A
new Social Welfare Agency Act was enacted in October 2008, establishing a new Social
Welfare Agency and a new means-tested social welfare benefit. By August 2009, some
3,000 households were receiving benefits from the new agency. The new system
replaces a system based on universal subsidies, which was both costly and inefficient.
The authorities have also been implementing policy reforms to support the creation of
new jobs in the fishing, tourism, and banking sectors. This is particularly important since
the .on-going public administration reforms are leading to staff reductions in the public
sector. Flotation o f the Seychelles Rupee, liberalization o f domestic prices, and
elimination o f state monopolies are expected to boost private sector activities and hence
generate new employment. The government expects these reforms will foster dynamic
private sector led growth over the next decade.

 5.       The Seychelles i s a remote, small island-state with middle-income country
 characteristics. The estimated population o f the Seychelles is 86,000 (2008). The per
 capita income o f US$10,290 (2008) i s among the highest o f the middle-income countries
 group.* As with other island-states, the overall size o f the economy is small (US$833
 million GDP in 2008) and i s predominantly service based, with tourism and
 transportation and the fishing industry important contributors to economic output. The
 Seychelles enjoys an exclusive economic zone o f almost 1.4 million square kilometers in
 one o f the world's major tuna fishing grounds. However, the limited land, capital, and
 human resources restrict the country's ability to benefit from economies o f scale in
 production and economic diver~ification.~    Unemployment has been l o w over the years,
 estimated at 5.5 percent in 2007. The Seychelles also has good quality-of-life indicators
 with l i f e expectancy at Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
 (OECD) levels o f 73 years (see Table l).4   An open economy, with trade accounting for
 250 percent o f GDP, the Seychelles i s naturally vulnerable to global shocks and terms-of-
 trade shocks, particularly those which affect tourist arrivals (notably from Europe).
 Furthermore, the Seychelles relies on imports for almost all raw materials, products, and
 specialized service^.^

       The Seychelles comprises 115 tropical islands spread over 1.374 million square kilometers in the western Indian
 Ocean, covering 455.3 square kilometers in land area. Only 2.2 percent o f the land area i s arable, and about 10 percent
 o f the 60 square kilometers o f potential agricultural land i s in use. The mountainous terrain and low soil fertility are an
 impediment to agricultural productivity. Some 87 percent o f the country i s forested, and 50 percent i s a forest preserve.
 About 90 percent o f the population o f the Seychelles lives on the largest island, MahC, where the capital, Victoria, and
 the main fishing port are located.
      Data in this paragraph are from the World Development Indicators database.
      The Seychelles belongs to the Common Market o f Eastern and Southern Africa, the Indian Ocean Commission,
 and the Southern African Development Community regional groups, and i t s major trading partners are the China,
 France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, United
 Kingdom, and the United States .

6.       The Seychelles i s a multiparty democracy and has had seven presidential
 elections since independence from the United Kingdom in 1976. A year after
 independence, a coup d'etat established a one-party socialist state which lasted until
 December 1991, when President France Albert Rene o f the Seychelles People's
 Progressive Front announced a shift to multi-party pluralism. President Rene won the
 first multiparty presidential elections in 1993 after the adoption o f a new constitution. H e
`governed Seychelles until April 2004 when he stepped down and appointed James Alix
 Michel as the interim president. President appointee Michel was elected in 2006 for a
 five-year t e r m in a close race with majority opposition leader Wave1 Ramkalawan o f the
  Seychelles National Party. Since his election, President Michel has taken a robust
 approach towards good governance in the management o f the country's political
 economy. The main thrust o f the economic reform was to redefine the role o f the
 government in the economy and society in a paradigm shift, which recognizes the need
 for political, economic, and social reforms. Under his leadership, the government i s
 pursuing a sound policy framework which encourages entrepreneurship, proposes to
 dismantle an inefficient regulatory framework and make appropriate infrastructure
 investments, and attempts to attract new foreign direct investment. In this pursuit,
 President Michel has additionally accepted to engage in open and active discussions with
 the opposition parties, civil society organizations and the public in general, and has
 appeared regularly o n television and in public addresses to demonstrate his commitment
 to the reform program.

7. The Seychelles has two principal natural endowments, which are its comparative
advantage. The f i r s t is a physical environment that i s largely pristine, with a tropical and
hurricane-free climate. The second i s an extensive maritime environment. As a result,
the economy i s predominantly service based and largely depends on tourism, and to a
lesser extent fisheries, and off-shore services. Tourism accounts for 26 percent o f GDP.6
The relatively small agricultural sector has continued to decline. The Seychelles has the
second-largest tuna cannery in the world; which a recent report estimated contributed 3.5
percent o f GDP. However, its share o f employment, GDP and foreign exchange
generation has declined in recent years.' Bunkering, (the re-export o f fuel) and the
storage o f fuel are profitable activities taking advantage o f Seychelles geographic
position in the middle o f the Indian Ocean. Also a Seychelles parastatal company runs a
successful international freighter service enterprise. Offshore business and financial
services had been developing in the years prior to the onset o f the global economic crisis.

A.    Recent Economic Developments

8.       During the 1990s, the Seychelles managed an unsustainable fiscal situation,
which was funded by domestic and external borrowing. The emphasis on state-led
development policies emphasized rapid capital accumulation, economic self-sufficiency,
and the establishment o f a generous welfare system to improve the well-being o f the
country's small population. The government sought to achieve these economic and
social goals through central planning and public ownership o f productive resources. N o t

only did the government play a dominant role in the economy through extensive controls
and regulations, but it also intervened directly in manufacturing, distribution, trade, and
other economic activities through parastatals. Although this strategy resulted in
impressive achievements in the social sectors, and the economy grew by an average o f 5
                            it also led to an accumulation o f unsustainable domestic and
percent during the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~
external imbalances. Current account deficits were high throughout the 1990s and
reached 23 percent o f GDP by 2001.

9.       The government attempted to bring high public spending and
unsustainable deficits under control in 2003, but these efforts were short-lived.
Fiscal deficits remained high and reached almost 18 percent o f GDP in 2002, before the
government responded with a fiscal consolidation program. Public debt stock
accumulated over the period, and reached about 150 percent o f GDP by 2008/9. GDP
declined by 5.3 percent in 2003, and it was clear that the state-led development strategy
pursued for more than a quarter century had reached i t s limits and become unsustainable.
Although the government introduced a macroeconomic reform program in mid-2003,
implementation was short-lived and significant internal and external imbalances persisted
well into 2007. Despite the stop-go fiscal policy, economic growth during this period
was strong, with real GDP growth averaging 8.5 percent between 2005 and 2007 (see
Table 2).

10.      Funded by new external borrowing, fiscal deficits widened to 8.7 percent of
GDP in 2007, and both the fiscal and external debt sustainability situation
worsened. In 2007, the overall fiscal deficit was about 8.7 percent o f GDP, compared
with the start o f the year's target o f a fiscal surplus o f 5 percent, as expenditures were not


                                                                      8
contained. Despite the efforts with fiscal reforms at the beginning o f the decade, public
spending remained high and above that o f other small island comparator countries.
Already relatively high, spending for social services and safety nets increased further
between 2005 and 2007. Social security spending-which averaged 29.8 percent o f
expenditures, or 8 percent o f GDP, during 2000-05-is       on a par with that o f European
countries, and at the top end o f middle-income countries, as well as higher than a
comparator group o f small island-states' averages. As shown by the 2009 PER, average
spending between 2000 and 2005 remained 6.6 percentage points o f GDP above
comparator countries. In fact, average primary spending in the Seychelles during 2000-
05 was higher than that o f two-thirds o f OECD nations.' Wages and salaries accounted
for more than 10 percent o f GDP-high by international standards-and reforming the
public sector had not (until recently) been on the agenda. N e t transfers to public
enterprises, which account for 30 percent o f GDP and employ 41 percent o f the labor
force, steadily increased and reached 5.5 percent o f GDP in 2007. With limited recourse
to other finances, largely non-concessional external borrowing funded these deficits. In
2006, Seychelles borrowed US$230 million and in 2007, an additional 54.7 million and
US$30 million bringing i t s total external debt stock to about 64 percent o f GDP (up from
44.6 percent o f GDP in 2004), and total public sector debt to 130 percent o f GDP by the
end o f 2007.

 11.      These growing imbalances proved unmanageable and in 2008 Seychelles
defaulted on its debt and faced a severe foreign debt and balance-of-payments crisis.
After many years o f managing an unsustainable fiscal and external debt situation, the
Seychelles faced a foreign exchange shortage, which disrupted output in real sectors.
The situation was aggravated by the oil and food crises which brought the unsustainable
debt situation to a head. As a result, economic growth dropped sharply from 9.7 percent
o f GDP in 2007 to -0.9 percent in 2008. Inflation also was considerably higher in 2008,
particularly after flotation o f the Seychelles Rupee. At the end o f 2008, annual average
inflation was about 37 percent and end-of-period inflation about 63 percent compared
with 5.3 percent in 2007. (though the official consumer price index may have
understated true inflation in 2007 because o f controls on prices that s t i l l existed then).
Exacerbated by rising food and particularly energy prices, current account deficits
widened considerably in 2008 and reached about -45.6 percent o f GDP, from -20.8
percent in 2007. As a result reserves declined rapidly, and by mid 2008 the Seychelles
was practically out o f reserves as import coverage f e l l to less than one month. External
transactions were increasingly financed by arrears accumulation.                 The external
environment continued to deteriorate as the global credit crisis impacted tourism in the
last quarter o f 2008. In September 2008, the authorities announced that they would not
be able to make a coupon payment on the US$230 million bond. The government
approached the IMF and in November 2008 successfully negotiated a two year Stand-By
Arrangement. Soon thereafter, the authorities initiated debt restructuring discussions
with the Paris Club and other official and private creditors. The Paris Club creditors in
April 2009 granted a face value reduction o f 45 percent.

comparator group and found that in 2007 primary spending in the Seychelles was 20 percent of GDP higher than the
average. IMF 2008. "Strategy for Strengthening Budget management," Fiscal Affairs Department, IMF, 2008.

12.       The government's decisive implementation o f the macro stabilization
program and swift introduction o f structural reforms successfully stabilized the
economy by the end o f first quarter o f 2009. Critically, the Government moved to
float the Rupee in November 2008. The Rupee immediately depreciated by about 50
percent against the U dollar, where it broadly stabilized by early 2009. The currency
                       S
has appreciated since April and it appears that the market i s now fully functioning, with
regular transactions taking place in the newly created inter-bank foreign exchange
market. Notably, the parallel foreign exchange market has disappeared. Interest rate
controls were also lifted and while rates initially rose sharply to 30 percent, by May they
were back down to 15 percent, in line with falling inflation. The initial depreciation in
November was passed through to prices, and inflation jumped by 24 percent in that
month and finished the year at 63 percent on a year-on-year basis, but this proved to be a
one-off adjustment, as expected and inflation i s n o w expected to stay in the l o w single
digits. With the tightening o f monetary policy since the floatation o f the Rupee and fiscal
adjustment efforts as described below, inflation declined sharply to the l o w single digits,
where it i s expected to remain, in line with major trading partners' inflation. This
indicates that the current macroeconomic framework is appropriate.

13.       Strong fiscal adjustment underpinned by structural reforms has been the
main factor in stabilizing the economy. The Government initiated several far reaching
fiscal policy reforms in late 2008. I t reduced current and capital expenditures sharply,
including 3.8 percent reduction o f public investment spending, mostly on new housing
construction as well as wage restraint and tighter controls on spending. It enacted a new
Procurement A c t and tightened financial controls, which helped contain outlays on goods
and services. The elimination o f direct and indirect subsidies reduced expenditures by
1.5 percentage points. The wage bill reduction due to public administration and civil
service reforms generated additional savings o f about 1.5-2.0 percent o f GDP in 2009.
The downsizing o f the civil service i s greater than initially targeted, and some 2,500 staff
had left the public service by April 2009, representing15 percent o f the April 2008 public
sector workforce. Subsidies to state enterprises were cut from 5.5 percent o f GDP in
2007 to 2.1 percent in 2008 and onlending to the sector was eliminated in 2009. The
non-use o f the contingency fund (about 1 percent o f GDP) for possible bank
recapitalizations has also helped contain expenditures.                Revenue performance
mobilization o f external grants at about 3 percent o f GDP (Abu Dhabi, China, and South
Africa for a total o f US$19.9 million) has helped to soften adjustment. These measures
have led to projections o f a primary surplus o f 11.4 percent o f GDP in 2009.

B.   Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

 14.     The global recession has hit the Seychelles hard and GDP i s expected to
decline by around 10 percent in 2009 and to recover to only 3.5 percent growth in
2010. The global slowdown began to affect tourism revenues in the fourth quarter o f
2008. Although tourism arrivals recovered in the second quarter o f 2009, there i s a 15
percent fall in tourism revenues anticipated for the year as a whole. Given the share o f
tourism in the economy, this will contribute to an expected real GDP decline o f around
10.7 percent, the largest in the history o f the Seychelles since independence. The initial
rebound will depend upon the recovery in the tourism sector, which has been a traditional


                                             10
driver o f growth. In the medium term, a positive reaction from the private sector i s
expected as the government's role in commercial activities is reduced and the playing
field i s leveled between the public and private sectors. Given the stable macroeconomic
outlook with l o w projected inflation the rebound will also depend on the speed with
which service based small and medium-sized enterprises respond to the improved
fundamentals. Provided that tourism sector goes back to i t s traditional performance and
with improved global economic conditions attaining average economic growth rates o f 5
percent would seem to be within reach.

 15.       External accounts are expected to improve in the next couple o f years, but
only gradually, on account o f the global crisis. The current account situation has
deteriorated in 2009 as the global downturn and piracy are expected to constrain exports
and tourism earnings in 2009 and 2010. Based on the first six months o f 2009, growth in
the tourism sector i s expected to decline by 15 percent, while tuna exports are projected
to decline by about 20.5 percent in 2009 over 2008 and by a further 6.9 percent in 2010.
Over the medium term, tourism growth i s expected to recover and register around 10-1 1
percent annual growth by 2012, but projections depend on the rate and extent o f recovery
in the global economic environment. Tuna exports are expected to grow by about 4.5
percent between 2010 and 2011. Imports are projected to have contracted by about 40
percent in 2009 and are expected to recover slowly, with 11 percent growth in 2010.
Over the medium term, net foreign direct investment i s projected to stabilize at around 25
percent o f GDP over 201 1-14. Reserve build-up i s expected to continue in 2009 reaching
2 months o f import cover by 201 1. Given these projections, the current account deficit i s
projected to reach 30 percent o f GDP in 2009 depending on reaching an agreement with
private creditors as interest payments will be large if a deal cannot be reached. Even if a
deal i s reached, current account deficits are not likely to fall below 25 percent during the
2009- 12,

 16.       The restructuring agreement o f Paris Club debt was an important step in
the achievement o f debt sustainability. O n April 16, 2009 Paris Club creditors granted
Seychelles exceptional treatment under the Evian approach, recognizing the strong
commitment o f the government to reforms and the limited debt repayment capacity o f the
country.' A total o f US$140 million o f arrears were normalized. Under the agreement
nominal claims are reduced by 45 percent in two tranches (July 2009 and 2010) following
the second review o f the current Stand-By Arrangement and the first review o f the
successor arrangement in June 2010. The remainder i s rescheduled over 18 years with
five years grace, with graduated payments. The Paris Club agreement i s not tenable on
i t s own, since a formal requirement for the effectiveness o f the agreement i s securing
comparability o f treatment from other creditors. The government i s in advanced
negotiations with non-Paris Club bilateral and private creditors (the majority o f which are
the holders o f a US$230 million bond and a 55 million (face value) amortizing note) and
it i s expected that most agreements will be reached by end December 2009.



     The agreement covered all debt to Paris Club. South Africa, a significant non-Paris Club creditor participated in
the meeting and was a signatory o f the minutes.

 17.      The debt sustainability analysis, based on the Paris Club deal results in a
significant reduction in debt ratios, but without further restructuring from other
creditors on comparable terms, public debt remains unsustainable. Based on
macroeconomic projections related to the main indicators, a debt sustainability analysis
has been completed by the Fund (Annex 5). The first scenario assumes Paris Club
restructuring for Paris Club debt and no restructuring for private debt, with the additional
assumption that this non-restructured debt (including arrears) i s serviced and the
financing gaps are closed by a flow rescheduling on market terms. The result is that by
2017 the external debt ratio would increase steadily to 259.9 percent o f GDP (Figure 1)
and to 326.2 percent o f GDP by 2019. Despite strong fiscal adjustment, the analysis also
shows that overall public sector debt would also rise, and reach 278.7 percent o f GDP by
2017. The second scenario assumes that public external debt (using debt stock at end
2008) i s restructured o n comparable cash-flow terms. External debt would then decline
steadily to 48.9 percent o f GDP by 2017 (Figure 2) and remain under 50 percent o f GDP
through 2019. Total public debt, including domestic debt, would decline to 62.5 percent
o f GDP over the same period. The analysis also shows that Seychelles's public debt i s
particularly exposed to current account and interest rate shocks, which put a premium on
prudent economic management.

18.       Negotiations with non-Paris Club bilateral and commercial creditors for
debt to be restructured on comparable terms are well advanced. Before the end o f
2009 the government i s expected to make a formal tender offer to bondholders to
exchange outstanding bonds for a new bond on restructured terms. Successfully
completing the tender will raise the country's creditworthiness, and allow it to potentially
benefit from a proposed second World Bank-financed Development Policy Loan in the
second half o f 2010.

        3. GOVERNMENT'S P R O G R A M AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

19.      The government's program i s based on a strong political consensus for a new
development strategy that emerged in mid 2008, i s heavily frontloaded and deals
with the underlying causes o f the crisis. President James Michel's popular mandate
and endorsement o f reforms by the opposition and civil society, including labor unions,
have given the government the support needed to break with the past. An initial
assessment o f the effects o f reforms was made by the government during the Seychelles
Forum in May 2009, which brought together development partners, multilateral
institutions, civil society members, and the opposition. There was a broad endorsement
o f the new development strategy and results achieved so far, and the president asked for
continued donor support, noting that debt relief provided by the Paris Club enhanced the
credibility o f reforms. The IMF and the government had successfully concluded the
second review o f the Stand-By Arrangement prior to the forum. During the event, the



lo External financing gap i s assumed to be closed by external borrowing at LIBOR plus 1300bps, with 3 year maturity.
Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one standard deviation shocks (two standard

Bank presented the main elements o f i t s Interim Strategy Note, which i s being submitted
to the Bank's Board along with this operation.

20.    The government i s consulting widely with the public on the reform program
with meetings held in all 25 electoral districts. The president, all ministers present in the
country, numerous principal secretaries, member o f parliament and chief executive
officers o f parastatals, travel to district administration offices to explain the objectives o f
the program and the measures that the government i s taking to ease its short-term impact.
The president and ministers answer questions. The principal secretaries and parastatal
chiefs are expected to follow up o n issues raised and to meet with citizens after the
meetings. The meetings generally last 90-1 50 minutes. The story is regularly broadcast
o n local media, two or three days after the event and is reported in The Nation newspaper
the following day. State House also issues a monthly newsletter which summarizes the
government's priority reforms and outcomes so far. The newsletter also presents the
main issues discussed by the cabinet during the month. The newsletter is distributed to
all government ministries and agencies and i s available o n the state house website. These
measures are proving effective in building consensus among citizens for reform, as
demonstrated by the lack o f organized public resistance to the changes.

21.      The reform program, as presented to parliament for the 2008 and 2009
budgets, aimed at stabilizing the economy, and contained well-sequenced structural
reform measures to foster a market-oriented economy. The Government i s o n track
to achieving i t s goal to create a stable macroeconomic environment and transform the
role o f the state to a provider o f public goods, thereby allowing the private sector to take
the lead role in commercial production activities. By liberalizing the foreign exchange
market fully and by eliminating price controls and some o f the most obvious constraints
on economic activity, the authorities aimed to boost employment in the private sector-
particularly in tourism, banking, and the fishing industry-and to enhance real incomes.
The reform program included the following elements:

0      Liberalization o f the exchange rate regime, elimination o f all restrictions, and
       flotation o f the Rupee, tight fiscal policy backed by public employment reforms
       and a reduction o f direct and indirect subsidies;

0       Social sector reforms and improved targeting o f the social safety net;

0      Reduction o f the state in the economy through further privatization and
       improvement o f the investment climate;

0      Review o f the tax regime and elimination o f exemptions; and

e      Reform o f the monetary policy framework to focus o n liquidity management
       based o n indirect instruments.

22.     Many o f these reforms were initiated in 2008, others were undertaken in
2009, and others are s t i l l under way. Starting with the formulation o f the 2009 budget,
fiscal consolidation measures that began in 2008 continued. Actual outturn o f the 2008



                                               14
 budget shows that the government was able to maintain fiscal discipline, following two
 years o f budget overruns. Public enterprises are now required to operate with limited or
 no direct subsidies. Downsizing in the core public sector will continue as the reform
 program i s being implemented. The government has already initiated welfare reform and
 established a better targeted safety net and a reduction in abuse o f the current system.
 The government has also reformed the monetary policy framework and laid the
 foundation to create a financial system in which policies are implemented with indirect
 instruments.

 23.    During 2008, the government initiated several efforts to reduce the number
 of employees on i t s payroll, such as an early retirement scheme, a voluntary
 departure scheme, and a new hiring freeze. The Bank's PER indicated potential to
 achieve a wage-bill target o f 6.5 percent o f GDP in 2010 without undermining proper
 public sector management. The implementation o f the first phase o f reforms has been
 impressive and has demonstrated government's commitment to reform the public sector.

 24.      Recent fiscal reforms also included revenue-raising measures and removed
 distortionary exemptions. To boost its fiscal position, the government announced a
 number o f measures, which are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5. Given the global
 environment, tax revenues are expected to be affected by the growth slowdown, and
 lower tourism revenues. Reviewing tax policy options and ensuring a tax regime that i s
 both consistent with fiscal targets and supportive o f business climate reforms to help the
 private sector during the transition and downturn in global economic activity have
 become even more urgent. The authorities launched a fundamental tax reform in June.
 The medium-term strategy involves a modernization o f the tax regime to eliminate
 sectoral preferences and exemptions, harmonize tax rates, and remove distortions and
 inefficiencies. A new business tax code and a personal income tax will be introduced in
 2010, followed by a VAT by 2012. Major upgrades to tax administration are also in
 process, supported by continued technical assistance from the IMF. The IMF will be
 assisting the authorities by undertaking a detailed review o f key issues and proposing

implementation o f all fiscal measures as documented in the IMF's first and second
reviews o f the Stand-By Arrangements.

A.   Public Financial Management Reforms

25.     Because budget credibility has been weak in the past, the government i s
strengthening the public financial management framework. Budget outturns have
tended to exceed the approved appropriation at the start o f the fiscal year by an average
o f 22 percent per year during 2005-07. With the exception o f spending on wages and
salaries in very recent years, the budget was exceeded across the board. A key reason
was that the macroeconomic assumptions underpinning fiscal policy analysis and budget




                                                       16
preparation are not prepared systematically or used consistently.''    A s a result, the
macroeconomic framework and budget framework are internally inconsistent, and
various revenue and expenditure items are not prepared using consistent macroeconomic
assumptions. Another major reason has been that past budgets did not include sector
ceilings, and ministries often exceeded their allocations.

26.      I n addition to changing i t s budgetary processes, the government has created
a new unit that will b e responsible for producing internally consistent projections o f
main macroeconomic aggregates for budget preparation. Previously, no unit had
central responsibility for preparing projections o f relevant macroeconomic variables, such
as GDP growth, inflation rates, exchange rate, interest rates, or unemployment. The new
unit i s responsible for providing binding inputs to the 2010 budget formulation process.
The 2009 budget has been consistent with the macroeconomic program and includes
binding sector ceilings to ensure that the country's fiscal consolidation will be sustained.
The government i s continuing to consolidate the budget consistent with the definitions in
the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual and the recommendations o f the IMF.

 B. Public Sector Reforms

27.     Public sector reforms aim to transform in an efficient manner the role o f the
state to one o f provider o f public services and goods and to improve governance.
Public sector reforms underpin the economic reform program and are critical in achieving
fiscal stability. O f priority is the reform o f public administration and c i v i l service. Given
the nature o f the adjustment needed, a two-pronged approach i s being followed: (a)
transition from across-the-board retrenchment programs to a more strategic approach that
takes into account the functions undertaken by the state and the way in which these
functions are provided, and (b) wage system reform to ensure the public sector retains
qualified and competent staff. The second component i s the reduction o f the role o f the
state in the economy. This goal will be achieved by first o f all improving the
government's oversight o f the parastatals and by privatizing government's holdings in
commercially-oriented enterprises to enable the private sector to assume the lead role in
the economy. Reforms in this area are necessary to achieve fiscal sustainability and limit
contingent liabilities from the public sector. They include policies to better exercise the
ownership o f the state. The third component i s the improvement o f overall governance.
Although the country's overall ratings based o n Transparency International Corruption
Perceptions Index are at levels comparable to Greece and Italy, a recent assessment by
the United Nations and the IMF's Safeguards Assessment found some important
weaknesses. The government i s now addressing these (for details, see paragraph 41,
below).

28.    T h e government recognizes the need to safeguard the impressive
development outcomes that the Seychelles has already achieved; and to ensure that
the most vulnerable are protected during the transition. A targeted social safety net
has therefore been established. The policies to balance out any short-term adverse

''  The first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment assigned a "D' rating for
Seychelles' budget execution patterns. The Bank's 2009 PER identify additional reasons for this outcome.



                                                   17
impacts o f the public sector reform program and how to improve delivery o f services in
health and education within a sustainable fiscal envelope are discussed in Section C.

29.     The government is. committed to gradually reducing the size o f the public
administration in line with fiscal consolidation targets. As shown by the PER, the
public sector in the Seychelles i s large even by small-state standards (about 40 percent o f
total employment), and government involvement in economic activity has crowded out
the private sector. In collaboration with the private sector, the authorities have started a
retraining initiative, actively seeking to identify jobs where former public sector
employees could be hired. O f those employed in the private sector, about 26 percent
work in the hotel and restaurant industry, 21 percent in construction, and 16.5 percent in
manufacturing. The fishing and financial sectors are currently not significant employers,
with 0.9 percent and 2.0 percent o f total employment, respectively. The Seychelles also
imports labor, predominantly in the private sector-in           the hotel and construction
industries and in the tuna-canning factory. Hence, these sectors have considerable
capacity to employ local Seychellois. Indeed, private sector employment has increased
from 24,000 in April 2008 to 27,000 in April 2009.12

30.     Public service reforms initiated in 2008 have already brought about wage-bill
savings. As an initial step to curb projected wage-bill growth, a manpower budgeting
exercise was conducted at the end o f the first quarter o f 2008. The exercise included a
cross-comparison o f payroll and nominal roll data, including a review o f supplements and
allowances, self-assessments conducted by public sector organizations, and projected
establishments o f new posts. The objective o f the exercise was to reduce the projected
wage-bill "overrun" o f SR 17.8 million (3 percent o f the 2008 budgeted wage bill).
                                                        R
Following the exercise, a projected "deficit" o f only S 4 million, or 0.62 percent o f the
wage bill, remained.13 In 2009, the manpower budgeting exercise will be replaced with a
strategic review o f functions, which the Department o f Public Administration will lead.
The review is expected to generate additional savings in 2009 to 201 1.

31.     The early retirement and voluntary departure schemes were introduced to
bring about a more efficient public sector. The early retirement scheme was
introduced at the beginning o f 2008 for civil servants over 55 years o f age and will
remain open until December 2009. Those eligible can apply for the scheme, which pays
40 percent o f salary until the official retirement age o f 63 years. The voluntary departure
scheme offered a voluntary redundancy payout in two installments, the first at the end o f
December 2008 and the second in mid-2009. In total, the early retirement and voluntary
departure schemes have reduced the number o f staff members in post by more than the
targeted 12.5 percent - the total number o f public sector employees f e l l from 16,615 to
14,075 from April 2008 to April 2009, a reduction o f 15 percent from 2008 levels. A
preliminary review by the Department o f Public Administration, estimated potential total
wage-bill savings from the early retirement and voluntary departure schemes at
                 R
approximately S 100 million for 2009, or approximately 14.7 percent o f the total wage

     This figure compares to an execution ratio o f 99 percent in 2007 and 110 percent in 2006.

bill (2008 budget). The longer-term effect o f the voluntary departure scheme in
particular will be higher because part o f the redundancy payout for staff members who
accepted the offer in 2008 i s paid from the 2009 budget. Current estimates project the
wage bill to fall from 10.2 percent o f GDP to 7.5 percent o f GDP from 2007 to 2009.

32.    The government, with the assistance of the Bank, i s developing a framework
to achieve the medium-term rationalization objectives so that the Seychelles will be
able to modernize its public administration without compromising its quality. This
framework includes taking measures to rationalize the structure o f line ministries,
outsourcing certain service functions (and stimulating the development o f the private
sector to take over those functions), and considering alternative service provision
methods. In addition, reforms to the public sector wage system are planned to enhance
transparency and to better integrate performance elements in the wage system. Initial
reviews o f eight ministries were undertaken from October to December 2008 to (a)
identify potential efficiency gains and (b) identify functions that could be transferred to
the private sector or to nongovernmental organizations. The methodology and results o f
these reviews are documented in the 2009 PER. In a summary report, the Department o f
Public Administration highlighted that the government has begun implementing a
significant number o f the proposed PER recommendations. Where organizational
changes have already been made, staff members have generally taken the voluntary
departure option. Table 6 reflects the cumulative effect o f the rationalization efforts so
far. Continuing the implementation o f organizational reforms i s important, including
effectively changing the status o f organizations that will fall under alternative service
delivery arrangements. As noted, although several key changes have been introduced,
status changes o f other organizations will require additional time and effort.

33.     I n this context, the government has issued a clear policy document on further
public administrationreforms. The Memorandum o f Action Public Administration and
Public Sector Reforms outlines the principles o f review o f functions, the rationale for
seeking alternative service delivery mechanisms, and the way in which these mechanisms
will be managed, as well as what type o f functions will be considered for private
provision. In the latter case, this effort relates both to internal service functions
(cleaning, cooking, security guard services, and the like) and to service delivery


                                                          19
functions. These reforms would ensure the reform process goes beyond a one-time set o f
measures and instills a new way o f management in the public sector. It would also allow
the Department o f Public Administration and the Ministry o f Finance to manage and
track reforms more easily and effectively.

34.      Fundamental reforms o f public sector pay are planned. To ensure that the
remaining posts in the public sector can attract and retain qualified staff, the government
i s developing policies to reform the current system, which lacks transparency in wage
setting because multiple allowance schemes are used, such as periodic allowances and
public service supplements. A s a result, the wage system i s neither efficient nor
transparent. It i s not a competitive wage system that attracts and retains qualified senior
staff. In short, these features arise from (a) including a large number o f categories o f
staff; (b) setting artificially l o w base-wage levels for senior staff members, usually to
give the impression o f egalitarianism; and (c) fragmenting pay composition. Such wage
systems typically lack transparency, are costly to administer (because payroll needs to
take into account 10 or more components), are open to abuse, and make pay levels
unpredictable for staff members. The compression ratio for current real salary levels
(lowest paid staff to the average permanent secretary) i s approximately 1:6, which i s at
the lower end o f what would constitute an acceptable compression ratio in international
comparative terms. The government i s revising the wage grid following a fiscal impact
assessment to ensure that this ratio i s feasible in the near future. The current plan i s to
redesign the wage grid and other allowances and benefits in 2009.

35.     The Seychelles i s taking measures to increase the market orientation of the
economy and to support private sector development. Although the Seychelles
undertook some reforms in the mid-1990s to increase the market orientation o f the
economy, government controls continued to be widespread and parastatals dominated a
number o f sectors. The government i s n o w moving in two main areas to reduce the
state's role and t o enable the private sector to take the lead in the economy. First, the
government i s accelerating i t s privatization program. Second, the government i s taking
measures to move from direct controls t o transparent regulation and to improve the
business environment. Considerable progress has occurred in privatization o f parastatals,
and the government in 2009 will continue executing its privatization program. Although
some measures have already been implemented to improve the investment climate, fully
achieving this objective i s possible only in the medium term, pending the determination
o f key constraints to private sector development. The government has requested
assistance, and the Bank in mid-2009 prepared the "Administrative Barriers to Private
Sector Development and Business Environment in the Seychelles."

                            Box 1: Former Seychelles Marketing Board
An act o f parliament founded the Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB) in 1984 to assure a steady supply o f
essential commodities at stable prices. I t s chairman was the president o f Seychelles. Until recently, i t s
managing director doubled as the economic advisor to the president. Over the years, the SMB acquired
growing monopoly powers and branched into other activities. SMB was a conglomerate with more than
1800 employees and consisted of:

    Import and distribution o f "essential commodities" under a monopoly concession from the
    government. The definition o f "essential commodities" encompasses some 48 goods including
    different categories o f rice, edible oils, sugar, flour, meat and vegetables. Most o f them had not been
    changed since the mid 1980s. SMB has developed long term relationships with a number o f producers
    including Unilever, Gillate, Nestld, and Smith Klein. To fulfill i t s mission o f providing secure long
    term supplies o f essential goods, SMB had priority access to foreign exchange from the central bank.

    Imports and distribution o f commodities in competition with the private sector, such as imports o f
    building materials, retail outlets and franchises.

    SMB's manufactured product lines included consumers goods (liquid long-life milk, h i t juices, h i t
    yogurt, tomato and other sauces, orange squash, jams and honey, processed meats, broiled chicken,
    prawns, and tea and coffee products); and producer goods (livestock feeds, shrimp feeds, and day- old
    chicks). The manufacturing division had six separate units: (1) poultry hatchery (broiler and layer day-
    old chicks); (2) Animal feed factory; (3) abattoirs (poultry and red meat), (4) Foodpro (processed
    meat); (5) Agro industries (long-life packaging and bottling); (6) Bois de Rose factory (water, snacks,
    soap, pasta). In addition the division had a quality assurance supporting unit and a joint venture,
    Kreolor, that manufactures gold jewelry and crafts) with an Italian entrepreneur. The criteria for
    deciding to manufacture in the Seychelles through SMB include (1) food security; (2) quality; (3)
    foreign exchange saving^;'^ (4) value adding; (5) introduction o f new technology in the country; (6)
    skills that can easily be mastered; and (7) job creation.

    Exports, in particular export o f prawns.

    SMB had an agricultural division that produced hydroponic vegetables and flowers and imported and
    repackaged coffee. It exported some tea.

    SMB had a management unit, a finance division, a marketing division, and a human resources division
    and a support services section for the entire group. SMB had two large warehouses with 18 chillers o f
    different size.

Well before the introduction o f the IMF-supported reforms, the government decided to dismantle SMB. As
a first step, assets formerly belonging to SMB were transferred to four separate new companies: Coetivy
Prawns Limited, Seychelles Agro Industries Limited, Seychelles Hatcheries and Feeds Limited, Seychelles
Trading Company Limited (STC). The liabilities o f SMB were absorbed by the government.

The second phase o f this process involved the sale or liquidation o f the new entities. Coetivy Prawns
Limited was liquidated in November 2008. Seychelles Agro Industries Limited was sold to local investors
                                                                                                        n
in early 2009, whilst Seychelles Hatcheries and Feeds Limited were sold to a farmers' cooperative, also i
late 2008. STC has taken over a reduced role in the importation of food, and remains in state hands.



l4 If foreign exchange savings were achieved by importing the parts rather than the manufactured product,
notwithstanding the Rupee costs associated with manufacturing in the Seychelles, the decision was made to
manufacture it locally.



                                                     21
36.      Governance o f public enterprises i s being improved, and a medium-term
plan f o r the sale o f remaining large enterprises i s being developed. The Bank will be
supporting the government with analytical work and technical assistance in identifying
solutions. Initial reviews found a complex group o f 44 enterprises with varying degrees
o f government involvement, exposure, and oversight. The sector has received increasing
transfers from the budget in recent years (about 4 percent o f GDP), while dividends back
to the government have decreased over the same period. In line with the Bank's
recommendations, the government i s adopting a standardized approach to governance
and accountability relations. This would mean one body for agency-type institutions
(regulatory and inspection functions), one for non-commercial state enterprises, one for
commercial state enterprises with over 50 percent government ownership, and one for
commercial state enterprises where the government has a minority shareholding, until
government shares in these enterprises were divested. These reforms would significantly
reduce government exposure to risks and contingent liabilities and facilitate a more
systematic approach to reforming the sector. The government plans to establish this
framework by mid-2009. Audits now being carried out o n the largest f i r m s including
those o f several state-owned enterprises that will strengthen the Ministry o f Finance's
ability to address concerns.

37.     The privatization o f parastatals and publicly-owned banks accelerated in
2007 and 2008. The government initially started transferring public assets to the private
sector in 2005 with the sale o f State Assurance Corporation o f Seychelles in June 2006 to
a strategic investor and to the public. In 2007, the Government began a public
information campaign and made efforts to build consensus for privatizing large public
enterprises. Current government plans give priority to those state-owned enterprises that
have a distortionary effect on the economy and those that are causing a net fiscal drain.
One such parastatal is the former Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB), a state trading
conglomerate and supplier o f basic consumer goods, which was restructured in March
2008 by discontinuing some o f the operations and separating the rest o f the activities into
separate entities. Eight profitable business units o f the former SMB were privatized and
all loss-making units were liquidated in 2008. The government still owns the Seychelles
Trading Company, which operates eight business units on fully commercial basis. The
government i s committed to privatizing these units in 2009.

38.       The Seychelles has made significant progress on governance-related
matters in 2008 and in early 2009. In August 2008, the government adopted the Public
Officers Ethics Act, which provides for a code o f conduct and ethics for all civil servants,
requiring financial declarations and prohibiting conflicts o f interest. In November, the
president and each member o f the cabinet signed and submitted declarations o f their
assets to the ethics commission as required by the newly enacted law. Based on Bank
advice, the government prepared the Public Procurement Act modeled on the COMESA
standard, which is a major reform supported by this operation. Parliament approved the
act in December 2008. The law standardizes procurement procedures within the
government by modernizing and harmonizing regulations and procedures. Transparency,
competitiveness, and efficiency have been enhanced, and tender procedures now ensure



                                            22
competitive bidding through strict and uniform requirements regarding minimum number
o f bidders and public disclosure o f all bills. In December 2008, a new Public Debt A c t
established procedures and defined roles and responsibilities o f agencies involved in debt
contracting and management. The law authorizes the Ministry o f Finance as the only
body to contract debt. The deficiency in the previous law contributed to building debt to
unsustainable levels.

C.     Social Sectors and Social Protection Policies

39.     A key reform objective o f the government in the health and education sectors
i s improving efficiency without undermining the achievements o f the past. Reviews
undertaken by government agencies and the Bank's PER show considerable potential to
improve efficiency in both health and education. This improvement can be achieved by
reducing spending o n service delivery areas that are underused and by reducing
expenditures on cash transfers that are not well targeted.           However, achieving
expenditure savings within the sector would not automatically imply a reduction in
overall sector spending because a healthy and well-educated labor force i s critical for
long-run growth. The authorities are aware that low value for money o f investments in
these sectors, particularly in education, must be addressed for the Seychelles to develop
and achieve its developmental aspirations. The government i s planning, therefore, to
invest any savings beyond the wage bill savings generated by reforms in improving
outcomes in both o f these sectors.

40.     Reforms are being introduced to substantially reduce the health sector wage
bill by identifying and releasing staff members in areas o f low productivity. H a l f o f
government health spending is for wages and salaries, which i s high, especially
considering that expensive tertiary-level care (with highly paid medical staff) i s not
provided in the country. The number o f health sector employees has been increasing, as
has the share o f ancillary staff members (which i s also high compared to other countries).
Additionally, average monthly incomes for public workers in the health sector are high
compared with those o f workers in the rest o f the public sector. In some cases, the
medical staff i s not working at full capacity; for example, physicians in public hospitals
see on average four hospitalized patients per week. The government i s planning to both
(a) contract out core services and (b) reduce staff in unproductive positions. Preliminary
analysis conducted for the PER suggests staff reductions could reduce the health sector
wage bill by almost SR 13 million per year, reflecting 6.4 percent o f 2007 total
government health spending.

41.     Low use rates, comparable to European levels, characterize the health sector,
and new measures are being adopted to rationalize facilities. The share o f the total
health budget spent o n hospital care (46 percent) i s very high, especially when compared
with that o f European countries with more sophisticated hospital care. The Seychelles
has an oversupply o f health care facilities and more hospitals and beds per capita than
other middle-income countries. I t has more hospital beds than needed, as evidenced by
extremely l o w occupancy rates in hospitals o f f M h Island and in wards within the main
                                                    ae
hospital in Victoria. T o increase the average acute care occupancy rate in hospitals to 80
percent, the government i s advised to close about 50 beds initially. In addition, the


                                            23
government plans to contract specialized secondary and tertiary care in the country,
including open heart surgery, renal transplantation, hemodialysis, and cosmetic surgery,
thereby reducing spending on overseas treatment. The Ministry o f Health and the
Department o f Public Administration are undertaking a review o f facilities and staffing
needed.

42.     Reforms in education aim to reallocate resources to generate savings that will
be used to improve quality and results without cutting the overall spending
envelope. Recent reviews o f the education sector have raised concerns about quality and
examination results. Many candidates do not pass and are particularly unsuccessful in
mathematics.      Given the relatively modest-and           recently declining-government
expenditures on education, government spending on education will not be cut. Instead,
expenditure improvements will be largely reinvested in sector reforms aimed at
increasing quality o f education and education outcomes. As i s typical, public education
spending i s principally on personal emoluments for school-based staff members. This
area i s also where there is the most potential to improve efficiency o f spending by
removing unproductive posts. Strategic staffing reductions will be introduced, and core
and non-core services will be contracted out. The government has already reduced office
staff in the Ministry o f Education, and by contracting out school cleaning and meal
provision, it has been able to reach the target o f a 12.5 percent reduction o f the wage bill.
Savings generated from these reforms will be spent on measures to improve the quality o f
education, and the Ministry o f Education will focus on results. I t i s in the process o f
developing a new strategy.

43.     A well-targeted social safety net i s replacing the costly and inefficient direct
and indirect product subsidies. Over the past 20 years, the government has provided a
generous and broad-based social safety net through universal subsidies that proved to be
inefficient. Such subsidies also have been a disincentive to sustainable employment in
the private sector. Because the initial effects o f reforms and exchange rate adjustment
resulted in higher prices, real incomes are expected to decline on a one-time basis. To
protect the poor, the government has designed a new, targeted social protection system.
A new Social Welfare Agency A c t was enacted in October 2008, and the government has
                                                           R
issued the eligibility criteria. It will provide about S 1,300 per month, or about
US$3.40 per day per single individual. For households with children, a formula-based
system is being used. The approach i s to protect the most vulnerable with monetary
assistance and to go beyond financial transfers to also provide assistance in the form o f
incentive-to-work schemes. The agency i s already assisting people who l e f t the public
sector. Applicants receive a response within ten days.

          4. BANK SUPPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A.     Linkages to the Interim Country Assistance Strategy

44.    The proposed DPL i s a key component o f the two-year Interim Strategy Note
that covers the World Bank's program in the Seychelles for fiscal 2009-11. The
Interim Strategy Note aims to support the government's macroeconomic stabilization
program in the short run and to initiate the structural reform process in line with the


                                             24
Seychelles longer-term economic recovery strategy. The proposed D P L i s fully
consistent with this objective and is the first Bank lending operation after 2002, when the
Seychelles fell to suspension status because o f payment arrears to the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). All payment arrears were cleared in
October 2006. By initiating policy dialogue on main reform issues, the D P L will
contribute to development o f a longer-term World Bank engagement, perhaps through a
four-year Country Assistance Strategy.

B.     Collaborationwith the IMF and Other Donors

45.     The World Bank has been working very closely with the IMF. A Joint
Management Action Plan guides the joint collaboration o f the Bank and the IMF and
seeks to prevent duplication o f efforts, but it also points to the Bank's independent view
o f macroeconomic and fiscal policy issues emerging from i t s own analytic work.
Evidence o f successful IMF program reviews will be used to judge and determine
developments in the reform program. The Bank has been participating in IMF missions,
and close cooperation exists at all levels o f the two institutions. A joint World Bank IMF
mission will take place at the end o f October 2009 as the intension i s to put in place a
three year Extended Fund Facility program in late 2009.

46.     A number of donors operate in the Seychelles, and they have capacity-
building programs. Because o f the external debt arrears situation, the European Union
(EU) engagement has been limited. The only EU member states with a diplomatic
presence in the Seychelles are France and the United Kingdom. The French government
cooperates in the environmental, educational, and cultural fields and provides long-term
technical assistance, particularly in the fisheries sector. The Seychelles signed a regional
cooperation agreement with Reunion Island (France) that will allow sharing o f a wide
range o f technical expertise in areas such as health, training, environment, and natural
disaster management. UmeA University in Sweden has signed a memorandum o f
understanding with the Seychelles to enable students, teachers, and in-service personnel
from the Seychelles to benefit from studies and training in Sweden, while Germany,
Greece, the Netherlands, and Spain have been providing scholarships to Seychelles
citizens. Other donors are involved in grants and soft loans in housing finance. The
Bank team has had discussions with the EU representatives in the Seychelles and briefed
them about the DPL. China has a number o f capacity-building programs. A fisheries
agreement with China was signed in June 2006. India has had longstanding technical and
financial cooperation with the Seychelles, and the Seychelles has a number o f
scholarships and exchanges with Indian universities. Through the Pan African Network
System, India i s establishing a satellite terminal station to facilitate telemedicine. Cuba
and Nigeria have bilateral cooperation agreements, and Australia and Japan provided
assistance in the context o f the 2004 tsunami. There has been an increase in Australian
technical assistance provided in the last few months in support o f the economic reform
program.

47.    The African Development Bank (AfDB) i s an important partner. The AfDB
approved a 1 5 million economic governance reform program loan, signed into effect on
August 25, 2009. The AfDB began operating in Seychelles in 1978 and has since


                                            25
approved 19 operations comprising 14 projects, one study, three lines o f credit, and one
emergency assistance operation, amounting to 85.6 million units o f a c c o ~ n t . ' ~N o
approvals occurred between 2001 and November 2006, when the country was under
sanctions, except for an emergency assistance operation worth US$500,000 that was
granted in January 2005 to deal with the tsunami. Cumulative approvals net o f
cancellations as at March 13, 2008, amounted to unit o f account 65.23 million, o f which
67 percent was from the AfDB window, 16 percent from the Nigeria Trust Fund window,
and the remaining 14 percent from the African Development Fund window. The D P L
team has been working closely with the AfDB, and there i s discussion o f developing a
joint reform program.

C.       Lessons Learned

48.      This first DPL benefits from the lessons captured by past evaluations of the
Bank's development policy lending experience by its International Evaluation
Group. In particular, (a) multi-tranching contributes to slow program implementation,
particularly if it makes the operation overly complex; (b) classic ex-post conditionality
weakens reform ownership; and (c) rapidly changing policy environments are difficult to
anticipate in loan design. These lessons, as well as the latest thinking on DPLs for well-
performing middle-income countries, have influenced the design o f this operation.
Hence, particular attention has been paid to two main factors. The first is up-front action
instead o f ex-post conditionality. This D P L i s based on prior actions, and the government
has demonstrated its commitment to reform by fulfilling policy reforms supported by this
operation. The second i s the provision o f support to a reform program instead o f specific
conditionality. This D P L supports the government's reform program that was presented
to parliament for the 2008 and 2009 budgets.

49.      Useful lessons also arise from the AfDB Group interventions in the country.
Although operations, particularly in the social sectors, had made important contributions
in helping the government to achieve the impressive results registered in education and
health, a 1998 Country Portfolio Review revealed that macroeconomic imbalances
adversely affected the AfDB's operations in the country, mainly because o f the shortage
o f foreign exchange. As a result, some AfDB-financed projects had difficulties obtaining
imported inputs. Moreover, some projects incurred cost overruns because o f delays in
obtaining foreign exchange approvals from the central bank. The major lesson emerging
from this experience i s that a stable macroeconomic environment i s crucial for the
success o f project implementation. In addition, the review highlighted the problem o f the
country's. capacity to timely execute projects. Several projects had been adversely
affected by the shortage o f adequately trained personnel in the country. Another issue
was the need for better coordination o f AfDB projects among the Ministry o f Foreign
Affairs, technical line ministries, and executing agencies, which was further compounded
by the shared oversight responsibility for AfDB projects between the ministries o f foreign
affairs and finance.

                         Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The proposed operation i s based o n the Government's aspirations t o resolve the unsustainable
macroeconomic imbalances o f the 1990s and create an environment for a private sector led economy.
Moreover, the president's consultation campaign being carried out throughout the country demonstrates
clear commitment o f the Government t o the reforms. The successful implementation o f the IMF-supported
Stand-By Arrangement and interest o f the government in a follow-on program under the Extended Fund
Facility i s h r t h e r evidence o f commitment t o the reform agenda.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The D P L program is summarized in an agreed policy matrix in annex 2 . The matrix contains both policy
actions and indicators o f expected outcomes. The Ministry o f Finance i s responsible for monitoring
progress with the agreed reform program and for coordinating the actions o f the other agencies and
ministries involved. The Bank consults regularly with other development partners in the Seychelles to
ensure that aid is as effective as possible.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities o f Bank support to country
circumstances
The accountability framework is based o n the 2009 Bank Public Expenditure Review, a report by IMF's
Fiscal Affairs Department o n budget management, and the I M F ' s staff reports related t o the Stand-By
Arrangement, and the central bank's safeguards assessment. The accountability framework has also been
influenced by the 2008 PEFA assessment.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The proposed DPL operation contains only six agreed prior actions and 8 milestones. All are focused o n
achieving critical improvements in fiscal management and policy.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
Progress reviews o f the policy actions in specific areas and o f the operation as a whole are held regularly
with government officials from ministries and agencies participating in the project. These reviews allow
the Bank t o update the matrix o n the basis o f actual and expected performance and t o communicate to the
government what i s essential t o enable the approval o f the operation. As a one-off single tranche operation,
there will be a review o f performance presented in the Implementation Completion and Results Report.
Monitoring indicators and outcomes were discussed and agreed with the government and draw o n the
government's o w n monitoring and evaluation efforts.

D.    Analytical Underpinnings

50.    A number o f recently produced studies supported this operation. The Bank
prepared an initial PER in 2009 on the basis o f fieldwork in 2008 and 2009. The Bank
also benefited from the EU-funded PEFA assessment which was prepared in 2008. The
Bank produced a policy note "Administrative Barriers to Private Sector Development and
Business Environment in the Seychelles" in 2009. This updated the 2006 Investment
Climate Review prepared by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service. The Cabinet has
endorsed the document and a high level task force has been established to ensure the
implementation o f the recommendations o f the policy note. The Bank team also
benefited from the IMF's work, including staff reports related to the Stand-By
Arrangement, the first and second reviews o f the arrangement, the central bank's
safeguards assessment, and a report by IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department on budget


                                                     27
management. The Bank and Fund staffs have regularly updated debt sustainability
analyses during 2008 and 2009 as the debt situation evolved.

                               5. PROPOSED OPERATION

A.     Description of the Operation

5 1.    The proposed DPL i s a one-tranche operation supporting the implementation
of the initial phase o f the Seychelles government's comprehensive stabilization and
structural reform program. This loan i s conceived as a one-time operation, based on
passage and implementation o f fiscal stabilization and public financial management
reforms that will achieve substantial measurable outcomes by the end o f 2009. It i s also
designed to facilitate policy dialogue with the Seychelles authorities and establish a
framework that may eventually be followed up by future DPLs under a programmatic
framework. The borrower would be the Government o f the Seychelles, and the total
proposed amount o f the loan is US$9.0 million equivalent, to be made available when the
loan becomes effective.

B.     Objectives, Themes, and Policy Areas

52.     The objective of the proposed operation i s to help the Seychelles establish a
stable macroeconomic environment and sustainable fiscal framework. This will be
achieved through fiscal adjustment underpinned by public administration and civil
service reforms and a reduction o f the role o f the state in commercial activities. The
operation also supports establishment o f a targeted social safety net. By providing
foreign exchange in a timely manner, the operation will directly contribute to
stabilization o f the economy during a period o f global slowdown and will help in building
public support for the reform process. These measures are integral to ensuring
sustainable private sector employment and broad-based growth in the Seychelles. Table
7 presents the specific measures undertaken as prior actions for presenting the DPL to the
IBRD Board o f Directors. Annex 2 presents the development policy loan matrix with
expected operation outcomes.

53.     The measures supported in this operation represent important steps toward
achieving the medium-term program objectives that the government has defined for
itself. These are summarized in the Statement o f Development Policies submitted to the
Bank in support o f this DPL and are explained in more detail in the government's
economic policy frameworks and policy submissions to parliament in support o f the 2008
and 2009 budgets. Policy reforms supported by this D P L are expected to contribute to


                                                    29
achieving macroeconomic stabilization in the short run by ensuring that fiscal policies are
consistent with the IMF program. Additional measures are likely to be needed to reach
those objectives over the medium term, and obtaining debt relief from the private
creditors at similar terms to the recent Paris Club deal will be critical for debt
sustainability. In the near term, success o f the reforms supported by this loan will be
evaluated o n the basis o f outcomes measurable at the end o f 2009 and 2010.

54.     Strengthening budget management involves introducing principles of sound
fiscal management and bringing fiscal budgeting and accounting in line with
international best practices. The Government faces a number o f challenges, namely: (i)
strengthening adherence to the existing legislative requirements within a traditionally
weak financial management framework; and (ii)improving budget management
practices. To date the government has strengthened budget credibility by adopting
standard Government Finance Statistics (GFS) classification for preparing and monitoring
budget performance. Timely, quarterly reports are now being prepared t o allow the government
to monitor budgetary outcomes and ensure consistency with the macroeconomic
framework. Nascent macroeconomic modeling has started with a team from the Ministry
o f Finance, the Revenue Commission and the central bank.

55.     Further work i s planned to improve consolidation o f extra-budgetary funds
with the Social Security Fund expected to be brought into the 2010 budget. Next
steps also include better coordination between capital budget plans and recurrent cost
implications. In budget execution progress has been made with improved cash
management and the setting up o f a Treasury Single Account. Anticipated results from
improved public financial management are achieving the primary fiscal surpluses set out
in the Government's reform program, consistent with improving the macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability objectives.

56.      I n the area o f public administration and civil service reform, the
government's objective i s to bring about a modern and efficient administration
without undermining the capabilities of the state and without causing sharp
increases in the overall unemployment situation. To improve efficiency in the public
sector, the government has implemented several programs to deal with excess staff such
as the voluntary departure and early retirement schemes. These programs have already
achieved 12.5 percent targeted public service staff reductions. Non-core state functions
such as provision o f school cleaning and maintenance services have already been
outsourced to the private sector and standard bidding documents to roll-out the
contracting-out approach have been developed. The government has undertaken a review
o f core State functions, and as per the prior policy action approved an action plan for
implementing the results o f these functional reviews.

57.     Next steps include contracting out all cleaning and security services and
school meal provision in 2010. There have also been on-going reform efforts to develop
a revised wage grid. This would ensure greater transparency in public sector wages and
result in a compression ratio consistent with attracting and retaining qualified staff at
senior levels o f the civil service. The government has developed several active-labor
market policies aimed at assisting former public sector workers with retraining and


                                             30
redeployment in the private sector, especially the tourism sector. T o date 115 people
have applied and 85 attended such training courses. Policy reforms launched to date are
expected to lead to rapid growth o f the private sector and hence employment
opportunities for those who have left the public sector. To date an additional 3,000 jobs
in the private sector have been registered in April 2009 over April 2008.

58.      The privatization program aims at reducing government's contingent
liabilities, rolling back the State from commercial activities and increasing the role
o f the private sector to lead economic growth. To date reforms have largely centered
around improving governance and monitoring o f the public enterprise sector through
more effective oversight mechanisms and effective Board membership. The principle o f
removing the State from commercial activity i s accepted, and to this end the government
has restructured the Seychelles Marketing Board into 16 commercial units. Eight
commercially viable units have already been sold, and all non-viable units have been
liquidated. The remaining units have been combined in an umbrella company s t i l l with
government ownership called Seychelles Trading Corporation. Since the beginning o f
2009 STC has been successfully, commercially managed without government subsidy.

59.    M o r e broadly, the government i s developing a strategy for dealing with the
public enterprise sector including commercial and regulatory bodies in which
government has full o r partial ownership. The Public Enterprise Monitoring Unit has
already been established and has developed a strategic plan.       The next steps for
SMB/STC are to transfer the remaining commercial entities o f STC to the private sector.
The government proposes to assess the effectiveness o f the public enterprise reform
program by measuring the size o f the private sector in GDP; and the reduction in
subventions to the broader public sector. Furthermore, the elimination o f subsidies and
privileges to the government-owned commercial interests was creating a distortion and
hampering private sector activity. The reduction o f government subsidies has helped to
level the playing field for the private sector. Anticipated results are a more vibrant
private sector as indicated by the private sector contribution to GDP referred to above.

60.      I n the social protection area, the government has already established a new
Social Welfare Agency, which has been fully operational since January 2009. From an
initial 900 households receiving welfare payments, there are as o f June 2009 3150
households receiving the targeted cash assistance. Already, the Agency has developed
robust verification systems to check claimant's information and has access to a variety o f
other government department databases for validation purposes. The Agency adopted a
formula-based means test that is simple and transparent. The average household on
                         R
welfare i s receiving S 1,300 per month. Next steps are to review the efficiency and
effectiveness o f the new welfare program. While the impressive ability to verify
claimant's information gives policy-makers little concern that there are fraudulent cases,
there i s some concern to ensure that all eligible households are indeed receiving their
entitlements. The World Bank under the second PER i s proposing to assist with this
analytical work.

61.     The government i s committed to implementing the next steps in the reforms
o f the policy areas supported by the DPL. Maintaining momentum on reforms in four


                                            31
key policy areas would be important: (a) public financial management; (b) public
administration; (c) public enterprise reform and privatization and (d) administrative
barriers that hamper the investment climate.

62.     All these policy areas are under consideration by the government who are
planning next steps in the reforms, and are areas where both the World Bank and
the IMF have planned to provide analytical support. In public financial management,
the necessary next steps are based on analysis developed by the IMF's Fiscal Affairs
Department and include strengthening the process by which the sector ceilings are
developed based on existing and new policies, rather than current year's actual spending.
In public administration reform, implementation o f the Memorandum o f Action will be
key, including the important step o f contracting out non-core government functions. In
public enterprise reform, steps continue to be taken to strengthen the governance and
monitoring o f the government's state-owned enterprises and parastatals and further work
                                                                            1
to assist the authorities i s planned under the Public Expenditure Review 1 . Furthermore,
the PER I1 is also expected to assist with a review o f the effectiveness o f the new social
protection system to ensure that all eligible households are receiving support. N e w
policies targeting improvements in the business climate are also needed and are on the
government's radar. World Bank and Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)
advice on next steps i s planned for October 2009.

                         6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.     Poverty and Social Impact

63.     The impact on real incomes and hence household consumption are likely to
be negative in the very short run, although the stabilization o f the Rupee and
rapidly falling inflation has begun to mitigate such effects. Real wages have fallen
between October 2008 and June 2009 due to high inflation caused by the devaluation,
and as households cope with the immediate foreign exchange adjustment resulting in
higher food costs. As noted this impact has been a one-time adjustment because
households initially have Rupee-denominated incomes and predominantly import-related
expenditures. The appreciation o f the Rupee since April 2009 and the fall in inflation to
single digits during 2009 are both indications that the initial impact o f the reforms is now
behind the Seychellois. C i v i l society members and other development partners attending
the Seychelles Forum held in May 2009 welcomed this development. Official data
however do show that there has been an increase in the number o f private sector jobs
from 24,000 to 27,000 between April 2008 and April 2009.

64.     The welfare impact on households in the near term i s being mitigated with a
well-targeted social safety net, government assistance to place the unemployed, and
retraining. A s previously noted, the government has designed a new means-tested
welfare system to mitigate the impact o f the reforms o n the poorest. Social security
contributions will continue to fund statutory benefit schemes detailed in the Social
Security Act. About h a l f o f the former staff o f the public service has found new
employment. The government i s actively involved in placing people, and a task force
headed by the Minister o f Employment and including the principal secretary o f the


                                            32
Ministry o f Employment, the principal secretary o f the Department o f Public
Administration, and the chief executive officer o f the National Human Resources
Development Council reports to the cabinet weekly and briefs the minister o f
employment about the employment situation.             The Ministry o f Employment i s
coordinating this work. It has contacted most o f the people who became unemployed and
explained h o w they may apply to the new welfare agency. Along with the National
Human Resources Development Council, the ministry is coordinating the retraining
program currently run by the Seychelles Institute o f Management and the Seychelles
Tourism Academy. As o f the end o f M a y 2009, the program had more than 250 trainees.
The ministry i s also planning to work with the Seychelles Investment Bureau to train
people for attracting foreign investments and for the financial services industry.

65.      The most recent draft report on the household income/expenditure survey
for 2007 indicate that less than 1 percent of the population lives on less than US$2
per day and less than 7 percent live on less than US$3.5 per day. However, when
using the national thresholds for the share o f population able to afford a balanced diet or
the national food poverty line, the 2007 household budget survey shows that 18 percent
o f the population i s estimated to be living below the national food poverty line o f SR 38.9
per adult per day. This estimate i s roughly equivalent to US$6.00 per day. When
factoring food and non-food basics (including shelter and non-replaceable utilities) into
what i s called the national basic needs poverty line, the survey shows that an adult needed
SR 50 per day or around US$7.5 per day. These are very high thresholds for
international standards. The latest poverty assessment done on Seychelles, the 1994
World Bank report entitled "Poverty in Paradise" (Report No. 12423 SEY), characterized
the poor in four groups: (a) single women-headed households, (b) households headed by
a school drop-out; (c) households headed by people without marketable skills, and (d)
households headed by retired people on limited pensions. The distribution o f income i s
also unequal with a Gini Coefficient o f 0.40 in 2007, roughly similar to Mauritius and
Ghana, both with Gini o f 0.39. The Gini, however, has declined overtime from 0.47 in
 1984. The government may consider a new household survey with support from the
World Bank given the new price structure and evolving earnings situation. Findings are
expected to be compiled in an updated poverty assessment report which will allow the
authorities to better assess the impact o f reforms and contribute to possible improvements
to the social-safety net.

66.     Although the downturn in economic growth and civil service reform are
likely to affect employment, one of the positive features of the current situation i s
the very low rate of unemployment in the country. The total number o f employees in
the formal sector increased by 5.2 percent from 2006 to 2007, and by a further 3.7
percent in the first quarter o f 2008. Employment increased in the private, parastatal, and
government sectors from 2006 to 2007 but f e l l in government and parastatal sectors
during the first quarter o f 2008. Although the private sector accounts for about two thirds
o f GDP, it employs only 59 percent o f employees; 15 percent are in the parastatal sector
and 27 percent in the government. The labor force profile in the private sector also
includes a large number o f non-Seychellois, which could adjust to absorb increased
Seychellois participation.       Stimulating private sector employment i s one o f the
dimensions covered in the Bank's investment climate work.

B.     EnvironmentalAspects

67.    Policy actions supported by this D P L are not expected to have significant impacts
the environment, forests, or other natural resources.

C.     Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation

68.    Executing agency. The Ministry o f Finance i s the executing agency. Other line
agencies and decentralized institutions will support the ministry. The Ministry o f
Finance and the Bank have agreed to monitor progress in the program supported by the
D P L in the context o f the Implementation Completion Report for this loan and
preparations o f a new country assistance strategy (programmed for fiscal 2012). The
Ministry o f Finance i s charged with collecting from the appropriate sources the data
necessary to assess implementation progress. Reviews by the Ministry o f Finance and
the Bank team will aim to identify the main strengths and weaknesses o f the reform
program, to identify possible assistance needs to sustain the forward momentum toward
the government's planned medium-term outcomes, and to address possible downside
risks.

69.     Monitoring and evaluation. Bank staff has regularly monitored implementation
o f the policy reform program laid out in table 7. Country capacity for monitoring i s
strengthened through a grant from the Bank-managed Statistical Capacity Building Trust
Fund. An implementation completion report will be issued within six months following
the closing date o f the operation.

D.     Fiduciary Aspects

70.     The government i s addressing identified fiduciary issues. A s noted earlier, the
Bank has recently prepared a PER, and a PEFA assessment has been supported by the
EU. The IMF has prepared a safeguards report and considered the adequacy o f central
bank's financial management practices. The report found a number o f deficiencies
pointing to risks in the central bank's safeguards framework. The authorities have
already taken remedial measures with respect to some o f the issues raised by the IMF.
These measures included signing a new contract with external auditors in 2008 and
bringing accounts in compliance with international accounting standards. The Ministry
o f Finance and the Central Bank o f Seychelles signed a memorandum o f understanding in
December 2008 to strengthen and formalize the terms and conditions under which the
central bank transacts o n behalf o f the government. The government will be
implementing measures to deal with the rest o f the deficiencies identified in the
safeguards assessment during 2009. The new Central Bank o f Seychelles Act was
approved by the National Assembly April 28, 2009 and came into effect in early May.
The new financial institutions law was signed by the President on July 9, 2009. This was
a condition for completion o f the first Stand-By Arrangement review. A s noted already,
the Seychelles enacted a modern procurement law in December 2008, which was a
structural benchmark under the IMF standby program.

E.     Disbursement and Auditing

71.    The Bank would make the single loan disbursement to a Designated Account
in the Central Bank of Seychelles denominated in Euros. The central bank will
credit the Seychelles Rupee equivalent amount to the Ministry of Finance's
Treasury Single Account. The Treasury Single Account centralizes government
expenditures and revenues for financing o f public spending. Upon its deposit the D P L
disbursement will become available to finance budgeted expenditures. The funds will be
audited to confirm that they have been received into the Treasury Single Account. The
audit will be undertaken by an independent auditor using international auditing standards.
The audit report will be submitted to the Bank as soon as available but no later than four
months after the date o f the Bank's request for the audit through a letter submitted to the
Minister o f Finance.

F.     Risks and Risk Mitigation

72.     External shock vulnerability and the global economic slowdown continue to
threaten macroeconomic performance, which may delay the reform program should
Government waiver in putting in place a program that can be supported with
international financial assistance. The global economic slowdown could be worse than
anticipated, with adverse effects on tourism, growth prospects, and-to a lesser extent-
solvency o f the banking sector. External financing availability may prove more difficult
to mobilize than has been anticipated, and the global financial turbulence may increase
the risk o f protracted discussions with private creditors, thus compromising IMF, AmB,
and IBRD program financing and debt sustainability (Annex 5). Moreover Paris Club
creditors have made the full implementation o f their o w n treatment conditional on the
respect o f the comparability o f treatment with non Paris Club creditors. The risk to the
stabilization and reform program i s limited in the proposed operation by the focus on
fiscal and public sector reforms, where the main policy actions have already been
implemented and reform reversal risk i s minimal. The measures supported by the
operation help achieve fiscal sustainability, including external debt sustainability. The
authorities have shown strong commitment to implementing the stabilization program, as
demonstrated by the up-front measures already taken and measures outlined in the
president's 2009 budget speech. Meanwhile, the risks o f debt unsustainability related to
delays or unsatisfactory negotiations with non Paris Club creditors are addressed through
the ongoing efforts o f the authorities to secure debt restructurings with their external
creditors and progress already made with some non Paris Club creditors. The two DPLs
envisaged under the Interim Strategy Note are linked to the IMF quarterly and yearly
reviews and the second D P L will also require evidence o f an agreement with private
creditors, including bondholders, on a debt restructuring program. This will also provide
some assurances o f program commitment and debt sustainability before extending further
IBRD financing.

73.     Erosion o f political support and delayed policy reforms caused by social
dissatisfaction may occur. The government's stabilization program supported by the
IMF will adversely affect some groups and may result in social tensions if not managed
carefully. Although the government has made a major effort to inform the public about


                                            35
 the necessity and possible effects o f reforms, delayed positive outcomes may affect the
 process o f transforming the economy o f the Seychelles. In particular, policy reforms may
 halt or even reverse, leading to slower economic recovery and failure to lift the reform
`process beyond the first year and into the medium term. The government i s addressing
 potential income disparities and intends to target the most vulnerable populations through
 a social safety net, a comprehensive communications strategy, and interventions in key
 islands and communities. In parallel, the government i s taking complementary measures
 to remove constraints to private sector growth and employment, which are critical to
 mitigating social tensions. The Bank will assist the government with technical capacity
 on the design o f a medium-term economic reform program to ensure greater inter-
 ministerial coordination on the reform program as well as support private sector
 development from the overall World Bank Group.

74.        Associated with the first two risks, i s the possibility o f external arrears
building up once again if the macroeconomic program goes off-track. The Bank i s
engaging with Seychelles only now that a determined reform effort over the last 12
months has been implemented, which through fiscal consolidation has improved the debt
sustainability outlook considerably. After four years in suspension status, Seychelles
repaid both loans to the IBRD in full and currently has no outstanding obligations to
IBRD. Seychelles went into non-accrual status in August 2002 for violating the negative
pledge clause and not meeting its debt payment obligations to IBRD. Seychelles cleared
all payment arrears (US$770,000) in October 2006. Seychelles subsequently prepaid in
full i t s small outstanding balance to IBRD and cleared remaining issues with the negative
pledge clause. Mitigation measures include working very closely with other development
partners who are supporting .the reform efforts such as the IMF, the European
Commission and the AfDB. This enables active supervision and monitoring o f the
reform efforts and ensures a consistent message to the authorities to assist them in staying
on track with the reform program. Timely, and predictable financial support through
adjustment operations will also assist the authorities manage the challenges o f an adverse
external environment; and at the same time a possible second IBRD D P L will only be
prepared following progress with debt restructuring negotiations with non-Paris Club
bilateral and private creditors.

75,     Fiduciary risks could delay program implementation. There are several
weaknesses in the fiduciary framework that are being addressed. Given the lack o f Bank
engagement for many years, analysis o f the country's public financial management i s
planned to take place during the implementation o f the Interim Strategy Note 2009-1 1. A
financial management assessment in 2008 concluded that capacity constraints faced by
the internal audit department related to insufficient staff in the Ministry o f Finance to
monitor compliance with internal control systems and procedures in ministries. The
Auditor General's Office also faces staffing constraints in conducting project audits; and
does not have the legal mandate to audit all government institutions. The IMF's most
recent safeguards assessment o f the Central Bank o f Seychelles, also found some
weaknesses o f accounting and auditing and these risks are being mitigated with technical
support o f the IMF. The first and second review o f the IMF's Standby Arrangement has
shown that the central bank has made good progress toward dealing with the deficiencies
identified earlier.

76.    Finally, piracy activities in Seychelles territorial waters may require
additional fiscal resources, and may lower economic growth prospects. During the
second quarter o f 2009 there was a threat o f piracy attacks o n tuna fishing vessels and the
Government has had to request a supplementary budgetary allocation from the Parliament
to support the operations o f its coast guard. While such expenses are not yet likely to
undermine fiscal adjustment efforts o f the government piracy attacks may have an impact
o n export revenues. The Government has n o w negotiated assistance programs from a
number o f countries (including the United States and France) who are providing
personnel and equipment to bolster the resources o f the Seychelles coast guard.

 I       In mid 2008. the global slowdown and knock-oncffccts o f the sharp food and fuel
price increases o f ZOO? k d cmly 2008 brought longstanding wlnembilities in Seychelles
to a head. Although wc had sought to gradually address imbalances from the 199Os, o w
cfforts were insufficient: reliance an external b o n ~ w i n gto fvnd infiastnrcture
investments progressively weakened public finances; govcmment intervention in key
sectors limited #e adjwtment o f tlie ccorvomy to new global conditions; foreign exchange
restrictions only accelerated our loss of competitiveness and capital flight. With reserves
n w rock bottom, arrears spreading across all categories of creditors, and financing
impossible to abtilin. we launched a truly dramatic refom program. On 33 October I
announced the reforms in an address to the nation, on 1 Novlembx we allowed the
cwrency to flea W l y (it losa half its value in the day), and in November and December
we reduced ow public sector workforce by 17%. We also cut subsidies to our bloated
state enterprises, and instead began providing targeted subsidies to those who needed
help afttr the devOI1ua~ion most.

                             year defeml o f maturities-an exceptional treatment for a middle income country. The
                             Club's willingness to h n t lotad. assistance was due in part to the ste;ldi"ast prise we have
                             received h r n the h t e m t i o n d Monetary Fund, which has provided us our first ever
                             borrowing probpm, a SElR 17.6 million Stand By Arrangcrncnt.

                             3.        Early SUCC~SSES of refom implementation are becoming apparent though
                             Seychelles has not been spared the deterioratjon in the global economy. Supported by
                             tigbt f j s d and monetary policies, the nominal exchange rate stabilized in late 2008 and
                             has slowly appreciatcd against the US dollar since Ql     2009. As o f thc end o f August,
                             priccs have actually declined since the beginnhg o f the year-a remarkablerevenal from
                             last year's average inflation o f 37%. External rescmc accumulation has been well abave
                             targct throughout our IMF program, while reserve money was contained by over
                             performance on the fiscal side. Yet our economy depends on tourism, and the global
                             downturn has brought a startling slowdown. Afler contracting by 0.9% in 2008, our
                             economy i s expected to decline by 11.7% this y e a due in large part to a decline in
                             tourism spcnding of 25%.

                            4.      A key component o f our reform program is placing our public sector debt on a
                            sustaimble footing, Since late 2008 we have engaged our external creditors in
                            &dliscussio~lsabout h e nature of` the problems in the economy and public fimnces as well
                            as thc severe financing ~hortfklls face over the next decade. Although the Pais Club

                            stock that must be restructured. We anticipate that holders o f capital market instruments
                            will be asked to provide relief through an cxchangc for new bonds in Q4; cornniercinl
                            banks arid nun-Paris Club bilateral creditors me cxpcctcd ta sign bilateral loan
                            stnenchncnts in Q4 or early 2010, Although the mtnicturing discussions haw been
                            challenging given the rnabailude o f relief required to achieve sustninability, we are
                            encouraged by the long temi view takcn by many o f our creditors. Assuming. we obtain
                            comparable treatment Ersm them we expect that OUT remailling fmancing gaps wouId be
                            closed.

Nations Development Program H m n Development index, a level campamble ta many
                                    u a
 OECD countries. Howcvcr, since the mid-1990s these achievements haw been put
increasingly at risk due to persistent macroeconomic imbalances, cxtenial shocks and
 long-standing structural problems. C m n t C ~ C C Q U ~ ~ deficits were: high throughout the
 1990s m reached 23 pcrcent by 2001. Fiscal deficits also rcrnlxined high and reached
          d
about 20 pcrcent o f CDP in 2002; the external debt stock reached alrnost 85 percent of
CDP and Seychelles fell into arrears with some of its creditors. GDP declined by 5.3
percent in 20103 signaling that domestic and external imbalances were having a negative
impact on the economy and welfare,

7.       Recopking these challenges, in 2003 we beyan a rcfonn and modmiration
dhrt and introduced a Macro Economic ReSorm P m p m (MEW) in June 2003. W P          ,R
emphasizcd w. large irnmediatc tiscal adjuslment through a combination o f mvenue
increases and expenditure reducing rneasurrss. I t also included liberalization measures
such as a privalizition program. As a result the economy started to recover in the Iattcr
half o f 2005 driven by a sharp increasc in tourist anivais, a construction sector boom
financcd by record-high foreign direct investment inflows as well as short-term high
public spending (during the 2006 election year and in 2007 as election promises were
implernonted). Red GDP gmw by 6.3 percent in 2007. However, the fiscal adjustment
was not sustained, and significmrort intern& and external imbalances remained. AAer a
brief period o f a near-bdmwd budget between 2003 and 2005, fiscal pcrfommce
deteriorated in 2006 and 2007, partly as a result OF spending associated with the
presidential and pwliamentmy elections. While then were step devaluations and the
                               R
exchange rate moved from S 5.5 la SR 8 per US$l, in the absence o f fmdamcntal
liberalkation of the regirnc pmlPel markets continucd to flourish with rates o f SR 12 or

hindered private sector growth.

8.      The maintenance o f a pegged exchange rate, which was not compatible with fiscal
and monetary policy, together with pervasive forcign cxctzimgc restrictions has led to an
overvaluation of the Seychelles rupee, a g ~ ~ i pmaJle1 market, and persistent foreign
                                                    n g
exchange shortagcs. This in turn hers increasingly hampered competitiveness and
economic growth. hi 2007-08, the global oil and fond fice shack hit the Seychelles
economy particularly hard given its dependence on basic imports, with inflation rising
sharply to 38percent (year-on-year) by August 2008. Notwithstandixlg gradual

and official external rcserves were virtually exhutitid. These imbalances Came to a head
in July 2008 when we missed B payment duc on a privately-placed extcmal dcbt issue. In
Octobcr 2008, wc were unable to make a coupon payment on our outstanding Eurobond.
As of the end of June 2009, Seychelies' public sector debt had risen to roughly 150% o f
CDP, a levcl that i s clearly not sustainable.

11.     Strong fiscal adjustment has been and is central to the achieverncut nf debt
sustainability and sound public finances. We are committed to implementing a large and
sustained fiscal adjustment that Will help both anchor the move to a floating exchange
rate regime and allow For a gradual reduction in public debt. In 2008 our primary surplus
\vas over 9 percent o f GDP-well        over the program target OF 6.2 percent. These
objectives have been achieved through a cofnbinatian o f expenditure restraint, including
h e elimination o f subsidies and a reduction o f the wage bill in real terms [from about 9.1
pcrcent o f GDP in 2008 to 6.4 percent o f GDP in 20 10) as part of our plan to reduce h e
size o f the public sector, tax policy measures including the removal o f exemptions,
strengthened lax administration and public financial management, public scctor reform,
and furlher privatizatil~n f public enterprises. To consolidate reform, exceptionally high
                          o
primary surpluses of about 20 percent of icDP will be mahtahed in 2009-10, easing
gradually over the medium term.

 12.    Wc have introduced m w m s to reinforce fiscal rcvenue and results to date have
been encouraging. We havc applied the goods and services tax (GS'I') ta dl IocaUy-
mmmufacturcd and imported goods, except for E3 basic food itcms, and removed
discretinnary powers to grant exemptions. The followiuing rcvenue mcasclres have h e n

As part of the 2009 budget, we have introduced lhe following revenue meaures:




13.     More frequent adjustments toward cost-recovery levels for watm and electricity
prices arc reducing government subsidies to the public utility company, and petrolcum
product prices &I% now adjusted monthly to reflect international prices. Despite

idlathnary pressures, primary spending has dso been contained due to low public sector
wage rises and tighter spending controls. Increasedtruc on fuel and a new i m p r l levy on
automobiles have more than made up for a shortfall OR goods and scrviccs tax (GST) due
to the elimination o f GS'I' on 13 basic food items and cooking gas (LPG).



ET. 3 Budget Credibility and Public Financial Management Reforms

14.     Strengthening the public financial managcment framework and the budgetary
process; i s one of our key objectives. hi the past the credibility of our budget has been
low as budget outcomes have tended to exceed thc approved appropriations approved by
the Parliament at thc beginning o f the fiscal by a large margin, BS much as 22 percent on
average between 20052007. This was in part due to the fact that ow budgetary process
and budget classification systems were outdated and international standards wcrc not
wed. In order to deal with this issue we have strenb$hened the budget fomuiation and
exccution process by adopting the IMPS GFS classification system and esabiished
spending limits for line ministries. We have also strengthened the budget preparation,
implementation and monitoring processes, including through the preparation o f a
comistent medium-term macroeconomic fnmcwork by creaking a aew unil within the
Ministry of Finance. These refoms enabled us to better monitor fiscal outturns and
improved our budget execution rate which in turn allowed us and to achieve our primary
surplus targets as indicated above.

11. 4 Public Sector Reforms and Reforming the Role o f the State

15.     Our main objective in this area i s to transform the role o f the State to one of
provider o f ef'ficient public administration and public goods and services. This required
action in three areas. First, Seychelles needcd to rcdum the size o f its public
administration and our analysis o f the situation h s sbowi that this was critical for
                                                      a
attaining fiscal sustainability. Prior to reforms public administration accounted fir over
40 percent o f total employmcnt, a large figure by small island standards. The Manpower

Budgeting Exercisc ( M E ) we carried out in 2008 h s shown that there was considerable
                                                     a
scope for public sector employment rationdimtion. We Rimed to r d w x the number of
government employees by 12.5 percent by early 2009 and by mid 2009 this target was
more than achieved. This objective was achieved through three %hemes. First, under the
W E we reduced the projected wage bill overrun from S 17.8 million to 4 million.
                                                             R
Second, an early retirement scheme was dso introduced at the beginning of2008 for civil
servants over the age of 55. The scheme has remained open for the remainder o f 2001).
Third, a voluntary departure scheme has been conducted in Uctobrhlovcmber 2008, and
this was followed by a fteeze in non-essential vacancies. Reductions in public
employment cut the wage bill from 9.8 percent of GDP to 6.8 percent in 2009 thus
generating the budgetary savings in part to attain our primary surplus targets. Those who
left government have been provided with a separation package and have bccn eligible to
seek assistance from the newly cremd Sacid Wclfarc Agency as explained in paragraph
19 below. A strategic plan to modernize our public administration was endorsed by
cabinet in August and implemcntatian i s aiready underway.

16.      Privatizing conunercially oriented enterprises with a view to enable the private
sector i o wsme the lead role in the economy i s the second iey of our broader public
sector reforms. Reforms in this particular area also include polices to better exercise the
ownership o f the State and me necessary to achieve fixd sustclinability. Wc have
initially started our privatization program by sclling the State Assumce Corporation of
Seychelles (SAGOS) in June 2006 to a strategic investor and to the public. In 2008 we
have focused state owned enterprises that have a distortionary impact on the economy
and &me that are causing a net fiscal drain. One such parastatal was the former State
Marketing Board, a State trading conglomerate and supplier o f basic collsumer goods,
which was closed in Fobmary 2008. The former SMI3 was unbundled in March 2008 and
five new different companies were created and some ofthc assets have been sold in 2008
and the government i s committed to complete the sale o f former SMB in 2001). Our
privatization progrmi will continue over the next year with the divestiture of the
Seychdlm Savings Bank and Nouvobmq Going forward we intend to avoid &ning
minority stakes in the tirrns we privatize.

17.     We are committed to enforce the highest standards o f msparency and
           ility in the public and private sectors. A new Public Dc6t Mumgment Act wm
encated in Decemhcr 2008 establishing procedures and defining roles and responsibilitics
o f agencies involved in debt contracting and management. T&c Law authorizes the
Ministry oFFirrance us the only body to contract debt. T h e deficiency in the previous law
                                                                n
contributed to the build-up in debt to unsustainabla levels. I August 2008 wc enacted
the Public OlJicr?rs 8 M c . ~Act, which provides for a code of conduct and ethics far civil
servants, requiring financial declarations and prohibiting conflicts o f interest. The Public
Pracurem&ni Acr, modeled 011       the C O M M A standard, was enacted in December 2008.
The objectivc o f the act i s to standardize procurement proccdures within the govemmcnt
by modernizing and harmonizing regulations and procedwcs.                      Transparency,

comptitiveness, and efficiency will be e n h c c d as tender procedures Will cnsure

1 . 5 Rcforaning Social Sectors and Improving Health and Education

18.      Our main objective in health and education sectors i s to improve efflfficiency and
maintain the standards we attained since independence. We have undertaken reviews in
both Sectors With the ssistance of the Bank and found that there w s and there i s stiZl
                                                                      a
considerable potential to make considerable improvements to efficiency in both health
and education. This can be achieved by reducing spcndhng on service delivery areas that
are underutilized and reducing expenditures on cash transfers that are not well targeted.
In the health sector reforms have been introduced to substantially reduce the h d t h sector
wage bill by identifying and rcleasing staff in areas o f low productivity. The health
sector i s characterized by low utilization rates comparable to Europertn fevcls and new
measures are being adopted to rationalize facilities. A facilities and staffing review i s
being undertaken by hfOH and Department o f Public Administration and based on this
review we will begin to mtiodixe our hcaltb facilities,

19.      Improving eFficiency and generating savings without reducing overall education
spending is one of the mdn goals o f our government. Recent reviews, both by the
government a d our development partners have shown that quality and examinations
results are issucs as many candidates do not pass exams. Wc will not reduce budgetary
allocation to this sector but instead expenditure     rovements will be largely re-invested
k~ sector reforms aimed at hxeasing quality o f educalion and education outcomes. Most
public education spending is pn'ncipdly on wages and solarics and this is also where most
potential to impmvc efficiency of spending by removing unproductive posts. Wc hive
carried out strategic stafing reductions and reduced office staff in MOE and by
contracting out school cleaning and mcal provkiun has been able to reach the target of
12.5 percent reduction of the wage bill. Savings generated from these reforms i s being
spent on measures to improve the quality of education and the MUE Will focus on results
and i s in the process o f developing a new strategy.


20.     We have replaced costly and inefficient direct and indirect product subsidies with
a well-targeted social safety nct. The universal subsidy scheme our government provided
over the past two decades was too generous and it proved to be ineficient. We have

Cnnclusion

As the abave indicate, the government o f the Republic o f Seychcllcs i s strongly
committed to undertaking necessary reforms actions to promote economic growth and
niodcrnize our cowtry. In this context, the support o f the. World Bank through approval
o f Ehu Second Programmatic Development Policy Finance would be important to
succcssful implcnicntationof the govcrnnent's rcfonn agenda.

Accordingly, the givernment o f the Republic of Seychelles requests that this first

IMF Executive B o a r d Completes the Second Review U n d e r Seychelles' Stand-By
Arrangement and Approves US$1.4 M i l l i o n Disbursement

Press Release No.09/246
June 30,2009

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review o f Seychelles' economic performance under its two-year Stand-by Arrangement, and
completed the latest quarterly financing assurances review. The Board's decision enables
Seychelles to receive a disbursement in an amount equivalent to SDR 0.88 million (about
US$1.4 million).
The Executive Board also approved the modification o f quarterly quantitative performance
criteria, and agreed to establish a schedule o f semi-annual program reviews, while
maintaining quarterly quantitative performance criteria, and financing assurances reviews.
The two-year SDR 17.6 million (about US$27.3 million) Stand-By Arrangement for
Seychelles was approved on November 14,2008 (see Press Release N o . 08/282).
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
"Seychelles' commitment to reform and prudent financial policies has brought about rapid
progress o n macroeconomic stabilization. The significant fiscal consolidation effort, backed
by the new market-based monetary policy, has restored confidence in the Rupee and helped
bring inflation down rapidly.
"Economic policies are geared toward consolidating this progress. The fiscal stance aims to
support the disinflation objective and contribute to public debt sustainability, while
preserving priority social spending. The market-based floating exchange rate regime i s
serving the economy well, and monetary policy should aim to maintain interest rates positive
in real terms in order to anchor price stability. Efforts should continue to expand monetary
policy instruments and modernize the legal and institutional framework for the financial
sector.
"Structural reforms are needed to lay a firm foundation for sustained recovery. The
authorities have strengthened tax administration and launched a fundamental tax policy
reform, which are key to improving the investment climate, reducing economic distortions,
and securing fiscal sustainability. Progress has also been made in strengthening public
financial management and expenditure control. Further efforts in this direction, including to
reinforce financial discipline and accountability in public enterprises, will be essential to
ensuring fiscal sustainability and raising productivity.
"Good progress i s being made with public external debt restructuring. Following the
favorable agreement with the Paris Club, the authorities have shown good faith efforts to
normalize relations with all creditor groups. In view o f the high public debt level, the
authorities are pursuing a debt restructuring with non-Paris Club creditors that i s consistent
with Seychelles' limited payments capacity. The authorities should reinforce their debt
management capacity, supported by Fund technical assistance," said Mr. Kato.

                              Annex 5: Debt Sustainability Analysis

The debt sustainability analysis confirms that public debt in Seychelles remains unsustainable even
after restructuring o Paris Club debt in April 2009. The highly concessional restructuring
                      f
agreement with Paris Club creditors in mid-April 2009, which recognized Seychelles' limited
payments capacity, was an important step toward achieving sustainability. However, even with the
strong and sustained fiscal adjustment assumed under the program, a further signijkant reduction
 f
o the external debt burden is required to restore longer-term sustainability. Against this
background, engagement in good-faith discussions with all external creditors to achieve a
restructuring on comparable terms is critical.

Macroeconomic assumptions

The debt sustainability analysis is based on the macroeconomic framework presented in the present
staff report:

   Near-term economic growth outlook has been revised downwards on account o f the global
   recession, with real GDP expected to s h r i n k by about 10.7 percent in 2009. Growth i s expected
   to recover only gradually from 2010 onwards, supported by resumption o f foreign direct
   investment-financed projects and recovery o f tourism, and stabilize at around 5 percent a year in
   the long term.

   Supported by tight fiscal and monetary policy, inflation has declined sharply and i s expected to
   remain in the l o w single digits for the remainder o f 2009, aided by sharp declines in world food
   and fuel prices. It i s assumed to remain at around 3 percent going forward in line with major
   trading partners' inflation.

   The near-term current account outlook has worsened from the previous analysis (done at the
   time o f the first review) as piracy and the global economic crisis are expected to restrain exports
   and tourism earnings in 2009-10. The tourism forecasts for 2009 have been revised to a 22
   percent drop, from the originally projected 25 percent decline, while tuna exports are expected
   decline by 21 percent and by a further 6 percent in 2010. Nevertheless, over the medium-term,
   tourism growth i s expected to recover, peaking at 10.6 percent in 2013 and moderating to a
   long-run steady rate o f around 8 percent a year. Given i t s comparative advantage, tuna exports
   are expected to revive by 4.5 percent in 201 1.

   Net foreign direct investment inflows are expected to decline sharply in 2009 to 27 percent o f
   GDP, as a number o f large hotel projects have been postponed or slowed. This reflects tighter
   credit conditions and lower near-term outlook for tourism inflows. Foreign direct investment
   flows are expected to recover from 2010 and stabilize at 26 percent o f GDP over the long-run.

   Official foreign exchange reserves are targeted to build-up gradually to about 3.8 months o f
   imports by 2019, a necessary recovery from the depleted levels o f 2008.




                                                 52
Evolution of the debt stock and debt burden

    Public external debt is estimated at US$802.2 million (87.1 percent o f GDP) at end-2008 (table
    1). About 60 percent o f the debt was owed to commercial creditors, while the Paris Club
    countries account for about 19 percent o f the total. Seychelles has no arrears with multilateral
    creditors. At end-2008 some 42 percent o f the debt stock was in arrears (US$333.5 million).

0   In April 2009, Paris Club creditors granted exceptional treatment to Seychelles under the Evian
    approach.' US$140 million o f arrears were normalized (including South Africa). The
    restructuring o f Seychelles debt will involve both flow and stock rescheduling with the debt
    stock reduced by 45 percent in two tranches and the remaining amounts rescheduled over 18
    years including a five-year grace. N o repayments will be made in 2009 other than a "goodwill"
    payment o f US$1 million by end-June, with very limited payments due in the next few years as
    moratorium interest i s partially deferred.

    Despite the Paris Club debt restructuring, the stock o f public external debt i s expected to rise to
    108 percent o f GDP by end 2009, primarily reflecting disbursements from multilateral agencies
    and the depreciation o f the Rupee.

Baseline Scenario

The Paris Club agreement leads to a significant reduction in the debt ratios but without
further restructuring from other creditors on a comparable basis public debt remains
unsustainable(Tables 2, 2a). However, the Paris Club agreement i s not tenable on i t s own, since a
formal requirement for the effectiveness o f the agreement is securing comparability o f treatment
from other creditors. This scenario assumes that the non-restructured debt (including arrears) is
serviced and that the financing gaps are closed, as assumed in earlier analyses, by a flow
rescheduling on market terms at L I B O R plus 1300 basis points and with a three-year maturity.2
Over the next ten years, the public external debt ratio would rise steadily to around 326 percent o f
GDP (310.5 percent o f exports) in 2019. Furthermore, the bound tests highlight that the external
debt i s extremely sensitive to the underlying assumptions, with even moderate shocks triggering
dramatic explosive dynamics (Figure 1a). Notwithstanding the strong fiscal adjustment (Table 2b
and Figure lb), the analysis indicates a similar unsustainable profile for overall public sector debt
over the medium run, at 342.7 percent o f GDP, driven by dynamics o f external debt.




  The agreement covered all the debt to Paris Club. South Africa, a significant non-Paris Club creditor, participated in
the meeting and was a signatory of the minute.

 The assumed risk premium i s designed to mimic the current level o f EMBI spreads on sovereign external debt o f other
highly indebted countries with significant vulnerabilities, for which trading o f debt securities i s more active.

                                                          53
Alternative Scenario

Under this scenario, public external debt at end-2008 i s restructured on comparable cash flow
terms with the Paris Club agreement (the agreement with Paris Club creditors requires Seychelles
to seek promptly from all other external commercial and bilateral creditors debt restructuring on
comparable terms). Public external debt would decline steadily to 60.4 percent in 2014 and remain
under 60 percent through 2019 (Table 3a and Figure 2a). Total public debt (including domestic
debt) would decline to 62.5 percent o f GDP by 2019 (Table 3b, Figure 2b). However, assuming key
variables are at their historical averages the external debt ratio would rise steadily to 104.9 percent
o f GDP, pointing to the vulnerability o f the outlook.

Standardized bound tests show that Seychelles's public debt i s particularly exposed to current
account shocks and interest rate shocks. Assuming a h a l f standard deviation shocks to the
current account (8.3 percent increase in the deficit); the debt stock would increase to 493.2 percent
(baseline scenario) in 20 19 and 118.7 percent (alternative scenario).
