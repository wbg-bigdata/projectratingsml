                        (CAPIBARIBE MELHOR)
                               P089013

                                   Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for the “Brazil: Recife Urban Development and Social Inclusion
   Project (Capibaribe Melhor)?, Loan 7497, P089013, will be extended from the current
   June 30, 2013 until October 31, 2013.

2. The proposed extension responds to requests from the Municipality of Recife dated
   August 20, 2012 and June 5, 2013, and previously endorsed by the Guarantor on
   November 5, 2012 (COFIEX Recommendation No. 696, from September 12, 2012,
   and letter from PGFN/COF/No. 2224/2012, from November 5, 2012).

3. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the well-being of the low-
   income population living in the Capibaribe River Basin area of the city and the fiscal,
   urban and environmental management capacity of the Recife Municipal Government.
   The Project was approved by the Board on December 20, 2007 in the amount of
   US$32.76 million. The Loan Agreement was signed on September 3, 2009 and the
   Project became effective on October 14, 2009. After overcoming initial delays
   (including in the signing of the Loan Agreement), the Project encountered additional
   implementation setbacks related to the change in the municipal administration, which
   affected the Project’s Implementation Unit (PIU) and the Project’s overall progress.
   This accordingly warranted a downgrade of the overall performance of the Project to
   Moderately Unsatisfactorily.

4. The proposed four month extension of the closing date integrates the first step of a
   twofold restructuring process. The new municipal administration has adjusted the
   scope of the proposed restructuring, necessitating further endorsement from the
   Guarantor. The proposed four month closing date extension would provide the
   necessary time for the Borrower to attain this additional endorsement from the
   Guarantor. We would then proceed with the second step of this twofold restructuring,
   which would entail a level one restructuring including changes to the Project scope,
   overall costs and disbursement arrangements and an 18 month extension of closing
   date.

5. Risks involved in such approach were carefully identified, evaluated and addressed:
   (i) during the proposed four month extension period, PIU will recuperate its
   operational routines, as well as improve the implementation performance of the
   Project; (ii) the content of the next-round level one restructuring was already
   discussed between the Borrower and the Bank, plus informally presented to the
   Guarantor; (iii) there are no safeguards or fiduciary compliance issues to date; (iv)
   there are no overdue or pending audits for the Project; and (v) the Bank’s engagement
   with the recently elected Municipal administration and the Borrower’s institutional
   commitment to Project implementation were recently reassured.

6. This will be the first extension of the Project.
