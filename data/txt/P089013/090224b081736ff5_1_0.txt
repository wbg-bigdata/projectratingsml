                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project disbursements have reached 31% of the total loan amount. Most of the investments from the “Integrated Urban Territorial Development? Component are already contracted
                         (and are on progress) or to be nearly contracted. Resettlement and social outreach activities under the “Environmental, Social and Economic Development Component? have also
                         been contracted, and are supposed to be performed from now on.

                         The loan is currently scheduled to close on June 30, 2013. Given that some key works contracts with associated social development, housing and resettlement activities are expected
                         to still be under implementation by then, an extension of the loan closing date will be conside

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Borrower (Recife Municipality) has officially submitted to the Federal Government’s approval a request for a Loan Amendment. Among others, the proposed Amendment
                         involves: (i) Project scope, including a minor review of the PDO, given there are no investments able to result in improvements of the municipal fiscal management capacity; (ii)
                         Project’s results framework, to reflect the proposed scope and timeframe; (iii) Project’s eligible categories, amounts allocated and percentage of disbursement; (iv) total Project costs,

                         due to a significant rise of the counterpart allocated resources; (v) eligible procurement methods and thresholds; and (vi) a 22 month extension of the Closing Date (until April 30,
                         2015): 12 months in the first stage, and additional 10 months extension, subject to the achievement of agreed intermediate targets / milestones. This proposed extension is aimed at
                         enabling the Project activities to be concluded, especially the resettlement and housing development, which are linked to the infrastructure investments. Upon Federal Government’s
                         approval, the Bank will internally process the restructuring and LA amendment
