MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRSSIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK POR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BARBADOS
FOR THE SECOND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$21.2 million equivalent to Barbados is submitted for your approval. The
proposed loan would be repayable over fifteen years, including five years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would help finance the
Second Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project.
2.        Sector Backaround:  Barbados is a relatively small island with a
population of 244,000 and a total area of about 430 square kilometers.  It
enjoys, however, an extensive paved road network of 1,550 km. The paved road
density, at 3.6 km per square kilometers, is high in comparison with other
islands of a similar size.   The relatively flat terrain (except for the
northeastern part of the island) and the higher standard of living contribute to
the increased size of the road network. Most roads are in fair condition but
about 10% of the primary and secondary roads are classified in bad condition and
there is also a backlog in periodic maintenance. Furthermore, there are three
factors which lower the efficiency of the transport system in Barbados:  (a)
there has not been systematic programming of maintenance activities and roads
have been maintained to the same standard regardless of traffic level, thus
increasing unnecessarily the cost of providing the road infrastructure; (b) a
substantial amount of capital works has been carried out by force-account which
tended to raise investment cost; and (c) passenger transport services provided
by the publicly-owned bus company (the Transport Board) have resulted in heavy
financial losses. Some of these inefficiencies have been tolerated as long as
economic growth enabled the Government to allocate sufficient resources to cover
the costs of these activities. The overall economic decline in recent years,
which reached a crisis point in 1991, has made the resolution of the system's
inefficiencies a high-priority issue.
3.        In the context of the Stand-By-Arrangement with the IMP, approved in
February 1992, the Government has laid off 1,200 employees of the Ministry of
Works, Communications and Transport, (MCW), thus bringing down MCW' s staff level
from 2,500 to about 1,300 with maintenance personnel reduced from 1,400 to less
than 800. The Government also reduced its budgetary allocation to MCW in FY91/92
for both investment and current expenditures in its bid to reduce the public
sector deficit to 12 of GDP and eliminate it in subsequent years. The reduced
level of staff and expenditures requires that special attention be given to the
design of adequate capital budgets and road maintenance plans if the road
infrastructure is to be kept at an acceptable standard and maximum benefits are
toL be derived out of the available resources.
4.        The Government's strategy for the sector now calls for a minimum
investment in new construction and reconstruction works, which would be limited
to a few high-priority projects, a shift in focus to efficient management of the
existing network, especially adequate road maintenance policies, and an increase
in the role of the private sector in carrying out this strategy.   Such
privatization, however, has to be approached carefully because of the limited
competition and the small size of the market. The Government also decided to
embark on a strategy aiming at privatizing most or all operations of the



-2-
publicly-owned bus company, the Transport Board, which has incurred large losses
since 1976177, and reduce to a minima n its subsidy to the company (which amounted
to over US$6 million in FY91/92). Given that private operators have been able
to provide efficient and profitable passenger transport services in competition
with the bus company, the Government is embarking on a study, with financing of
the European Development Fund, to examine the option of reducing substantially
the role of the Transport Board (e.g. serving only uneconomic routes required for
social purposes) or eliminating it altogether.
5.        The Ministry of Public Works, Communications and Transportation (MCW)
is responsible for highway construction and snpervision as well as road
maintenance. The organization is capable of handling the task. Quality of
engineering designs (done partly by consultants) is satisfactory, as are the
professional qualifications of the management and engineering staff. Supervision
of works is being well handled, with major works supervised by consultants.
However, some weaknesses remasin: the Planning Unit is not exercising its full
potential because of lack of coordination with the operating departments and
implementation of the new road and equipment management systems,started under the
first Bank project,  is still pending;  additional training ani1 technical
assistance and some organizational changes are required in these areas.
6.        Gasoline and diesel prices in Barbados are very hi3h: US$2.62 per US
gallon for gasoline and US$2.32 for diesel (border prices are US$0.74 and
US$0.65, respectively).   The level of user charges (taxes on fuel, vehicle
registration fees, import duties, etc.) has been above total expenditures for
road maintenance and investments in recent years. In particular, in FY91192 user
charges are estimated to be more than twice the level of road costs.   In
addition, the Transport Levy Fund, which is non-user related and financed by a
percentage charge on salaries of all employees, is earmarked to defraying the
costs of improvement of public transport and construction and rehabilitation of
public roads.  The level of revenues from the Transport Levy is above the
expected needs of the sector in the coming years given the change in Government
investment strategy and the expected privatization of the Transport Board. The
Government intends to phase out this tax a part of a new fiscal reform being
prepared in cooperation with the IMF.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement:  The Bank has approved so far one
operation for the road sector (Loan 2432-BRk of 1984, US$11.0 million, which
closed on December 31, 1991). The loan financed urgent rehabilitation works and
concentrated on strengthening key institutional areas without which more
sophisticated planning systems and technical methods could not be introduced.
This included the establishment of a Soils and Materials Laboratory, creation
within MCW of a Planning Unit, Internal Auditor Office, a Project Accounting
Unit, a Traffic Division and a Maintenance Management Unit. Also, first steps
were taken to design an equipment and road maintenance system.  With this
foundation now in place, the first priority in terms of institutional improvement
is the implementation of comprehensive road maintenance and equipment management
systme and a concomitant computerized accounting system. The proposed project
provides technlcal assistance for these tasks.   Furthermore, in terms of
investment planning, MCW has been moving toward network-wide management and away
from concentration on a few road links with intensive capital requirement. The
proposed project is based on an analysis of the whole network and involves a
substantially larger part of the primary and secondary road networks (about 170
km compared to only 30 km included in the first project) at a reduced cost per



-3-
km. With the benefit of the Bank's presence and monitoring, the project Will
result in eliminating the backlog of periodic maintenance and a 6astainable road
management system, providing road users with an adequate standard of service at
the minimum feasible cost.
8.        The  shift  in the  investment  focus  away  froce  construction  and
reconstruction to periodif overlays will masimize savings in vehicle operating
costs, most of which are in foreign exchange. The project will also bring about
a reduction in the size of the road network and agreement on optimal maintenance
policies for all roads based on their condition and traffic levels. This, in
turn, would further assist in bringing down the cost of providing the transport
infrastructure.    Second, Bank's participation in the project will  allow
monitoring of an action plan to reduce to a minimum the Government's subsidy for
passenger transport services and transfer most or all of the functions of the
publicly-owned Transport Board to the private sector. Third, the project will
also result in improving planning procedures, including regular updating of the
Five-Year Investment Plan and the Four-Year Maintenance Plan in line with
available resources. Finally, the project will provide the technictl assistance
required to improve remaining weak areas in the organization such as the
accounting system and investment planning.
9.        Proiect Obiectives:  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) install and implement sound maintenance policies and procedures on the road
network; (b) preserve the capital base of road infrastructure within the
constraints on capital and current expenditures; (c) assist in the transfer of
all capital works to the private sector and explore the relative merits of
private sector participation in carrying out routine road maintenance activities;
{d) improve road safety; and (e) help the Government in its efforts to privatize
passenger transport services.
10.       Project Descrigtion:   MCW has prepared, with the assistance of
consultants, an acceptable Five-Year (1992/91-1996197) Investment Plan, which
takes into account the recently-imposed constraints on investment and is designed
to derive maximum benefits from the limited available resources. The Bank, in
parallel with the CDB, will finance the large road investments in the period
1992-96, except for a Traffic Management Project, developed by the IDB, which is
expected to start in FY94/95. Appraisal of the investment: program has been
conducted  jointly with  the  CDB  and  project  conditionality  is  similar.
Disbursements of funds from the CDB loan have been made conditional on the Bank's
loan becoming effective. CDBIs loan is to finance the reconstruct4on of a 7.7
km section of Highway 2A and two related roads.
11.       The proposed project includes:  (a) rehabilitation of two sections of
Highway 6 (101 of total costs); (b) a safety program consisting of improvement
to five road intersections with a poor accident record (82 of total); (c) an
overlay program involving about 160 km. of high-priority roads (601 of total);
(d) rehabilitation of bridges and culverts (22 of total); (e) a pilot program of
routine maintenance by contract (21 of total); (f) equipment rehabilitation and
some acquisition in line with the requirements of the Road Maintenance Plan (102
of total); and (g) institutional improvements, including: technical assistance
for road maintenance, workshop operations and transport planning; a training
program for MCW staff and a retraining program for laid-off employees of both MCW
and the Transport Board; and studies t- rationalize the road network and to
privatize passenger transport operations (81 of total). The Bank will finance



-4-
the foreign exchange component of the project. However, while Bank financing of
overlays works (the largest component) will average 65S throughout the project,
the loan will finance 80X of the works in the first two years and 502 in the last
two years in order to help the Government overcome the current acute shortage of
foreign exchange.  Retroactive financing, up to a total of US$200,000 for
equipment and US$150,000 for consultants, is proposed to enable an early start
on the programs to reduce the operating losses of the Transport Board and
expedite the introduction of the road maintenance system.
12.       Imylement_tion Arran2esents:   The implementation agency for the
proposed loan would be MW,, which will carry out the project through its
Technical Department; the latter has adequate capacity to handle the task. The
highway and bridge rehabilitation, overlay work. and the safety program will be
carried out by private contractors under the supervision of the Projects Division
within the Technical Department. The Workshop Manager will be responsible for
carrying out the equipment purchase and rehabilitation program and the technical
assistance will be supervised by the Chief Technical Officer, Workshop Manager
and Chief Ftnancial Officer in the areas of road maintenance, workshops, and
accounting systems, respectively. The Transport Board Study and the Road Network
Rationalization Study will be monitored by the Chief Planning Officer under the
overall supervision of the Permanent Secretary.
13.         Environmertal Imoacts   The project will not have any adverse
environmental impact, as most of the civil works involve only overlays over
existing roads. The two road sections to be rehabilitated do not involve a major
change in alignment or relocation. On the other hand, the project will reduce
traffic congestion in and around Bridgetown and increase road safety.
Furthermore, all civil works contracts signed by MCW already include provisions
for cleaning up of construction sites and removal of debris. However, MCW does
not hav any staff assigned on a permanent basis to monitor compliance with these
provisions.  An Environmental Officer will be nominated under the project.  In
addition, the operation of quarries is governed by the Quarries Act of 1967,
wbich provides for substantial safeguards to ensure their safe operation, but
does not provide for similar safeguards against soil erosion, contamination of
underground water, or any other environmental hazard. The Quarry Act will be
amended under the proposed project to correct these shortcomings.
14.         Afreed Actions:  The main issues discussed and agreed wi-:h the
Government during negotiations ares (i) confirmation of the Five-Year (1992/93-
1996197) Investment Plan and the Four-Year (1992/93-1995/96) Road Maintenance
Plan, their annual updating and a commitment to carry out the maintenance plan
as agreed with the Bank; (ii) Government annual budgetary allocations for the
project and for road maintenance materials; (iii) limiting road maintenance staff
to no more than 800 employees; (iv) incorporation of the Planring Unit of MCW
into the Technical Department; (v) implementation of a detailed plan to reduce
the Transport Doard's cash deficit for FY92193 to less than US$2 million; (vi)
submission by the Government,  by July 31,  1993,  of an action plan  to
substantially privatize passenger transport services and its implementation;
(vii) submission by MCW, by December 31, 1993, of an action plan related to the
Road Network Rationalization Study and its implementation; (viii) submission by
MCW, by December 31, 1994, - a strategy for private sector participation in road
maintenance; (ix) eubmission by the Government to the Parliament, by June 30,
1993, of an amendment to the Quarries Act to include environmental
considerations; and (x) submission by the Government to the Parliament of an



- 5 -
amendment to the Transport Levy Act, allowing its revenues to be used for general
purposes or abolisl'ing it by March 31, 1994. As zonditions of effectiveness of
the proposed loan, MCW will: (a) appoint an environmental officer under terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank; and (b) appoint an equipment manager and a
workshop accountant. In addition, agreement was reached on the time schedules
of all technical assistance tasks and proposed studies as well as preparation of
final engineering for overlay works and compliance with a list of quantitative
indicators related to operational officiencies. A mid-term project review will
be conducted in the first quarter of 1994, and will cover progress in the
physical execution of the project, compliance with the quantitative efficiency
indicators and the advance made in carrying out the various technical assistance
tasks  and  studies  and  their resulting recommndations.   In particular,
disbursements against overlay works in FY94195 and subsequent years will depend
on satisfactory progress in implementation of the action plan to privatize
passenger tv-nsport services.   The project review will also include an
examination of the relative cost and quality of periodic and routine road
maintenance works carried out by private contractors and by MECW's work force.
15.         Project Benefits: The project will result in upgrading the condition
of about 30S of the primary and secondary road systems and a signif'2cant
reduction in transport cost, traffic congestion and accidents. The project will
assist in the transfer of all capital works to private contractors, increase
efficiency of road maintenance operations and improve equipment availability.
The project will allow MCW to restructure its road maintenance operations and
preserve its capital base under drastically lower budgetary allocations.
Finally, the project will support the privatization of passenger transport
services, thus reducing Government subsidies to the sector.
16.         Proiect Risks: The project carries little risk from the technical
point of view. Nowever, the agreed road maintenance and investment programs
represent the minimum levels needed to preserve the road network; any further
budget reductions vill endanger the level of service provided by the road
infrastructure. We expect that the agreement with the 1IF will maks further
budgetary cuts unnecessary. In the event, however, that such added cuts are
needed, the project will ensure that they are made on the basis of economic
ranking, so that the negative impact on infrastructure assets and transport cost
will be kept to a minimum. Also, although the Government is fully committed to
the privatization of bus passenger transport services, political factors could
delay it. The project is designed to help avoid such delays by conditioning the
overlay works in FY94195 and subsequent years on satisfactory progress of this
privatization program.
17.         Recomendation: I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Artiless of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
