                         The current ISR is based on two missions in March and June 2013. The project is composed of (i) a mining sector component and (ii) a petroleum sector component. The mining
                         component is financed through an original credit (which was closed in October 2012 with a disbursement rate exceeding 98% and having achieved all but one of the original target
                         indicators) and an additional credit (signed in July, 2011). The petroleum component was introduced in 2006 after signing of an additional credit. Both components show a good pace
                         of progress although full disbursement of the credits before project closing continue to pose a challenge. In terms of meeting project development objectives, 16 of 23 indicators have

                         been achieved while the remaining seven are partially achieved most of which on track for completion by project closure. The rate of achievements of indicators is a testament to the
                         efficacy of the project. In light of these favorable indicators, it is recommended to maintain the ratings for Progress towards PDO and Overall Implementation Progress at
                         "Satisfactory".

                         The Bank's support to extractive industries remains highly relevant in light of rapidly expanding mining operations as well as advanced negotiations on gas exploitation for power
                         generation. These conclusions are also reconfirmed in the recent CAS retrospective review. It is also projected that the extractive industries will have a prominent role in the Country
                         Partnership Strategy 2013-16. In line with the growth of the mining and petroleum sectors, the project activities have gradually progressed from investment promotion to a stronger
                         emphasis on managing the impacts and benefits of extractive industries and responding to consumer and community needs.

                         In concrete terms, this means that the petroleum component is including not only up-stream sector support (exploration and production) but also mid-stream operations (storage and
                         fuel transportation) as demand is growing and critical physical and regulatory bottle-necks have appeared. The mining sector component has reinforced its focus on local community
                         and business development as well as inspection capacities. All of these activities are solidly grounded in the project development objective.

                         Direct project achievements to date include: (i) computerized management systems have been installed and operationalized for award and tracking of exploration and mine titles. (ii)
                         Geological data has been collected and analyzed (though widespread dissemination is still pending). (iii) Local economic development activities have exceeded the end of project
                         targets in terms of community-driven micro projects and an impact assessment has confirmed results on the ground. (iv) The School of Mines opened doors in 2011 and is now
                         entering into third year teaching with approximately 25 students for each year. (v) In the petroleum sector, a computerized database management system has been designed for
                         concession management. The Hydrocarbon Law has also been modernized together with the standard Production Sharing Agreement. In sum, five computerized databases and
                         monitoring systems have been put in place under the project together with physical investments in mining communities and support to the School of Mines. In light of the total credit
                         amount of some USD30 million, the use of funds is considered to be efficient although the long total duration of the project has increased operational expenditure compared to
                         original estimates.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation

                         (ii) Follow-on activities are being discussed with particular emphasis on capacity building for enhanced management of revenue from the extractive industries as well as continued
                         support to the School of Mines and gradual upgrades of supervision and monitoring systems.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
