                         The current ISR is based on one petroleum sector mission in November and two mining sector missions in January and March. The project is composed of (i) a mining sector
                         component and (ii) a petroleum sector component. The mining component is financed through the original credit and an additional credit (signed in July, 2011). The petroleum
                         component was introduced in 2006 after signing of an additional credit. The original credit closed by the end of December, 2011, with an expected disbursement rate of 98% and
                         having achieved all but one of the original target indicators. The additional credit for the mining component has continued the good pace of project implementation. On the other hand,

                         implementation of the petroleum sector component has lost momentum. In response, the planned activities have been reoriented towards areas which government has confirmed as
                         high priority issues during the latest supervision mission.

                         The Bank's support remains highly relevant in light of recent developments in the mining as well petroleum sector. The mining sector is experiencing a surge in investments initiated
                         by a number of large-scale international mining corporations which are in the process of new developments as well as expansion of existing operations. These investments will
                         significantly increase the national output. As such, the additional credit will scale up successful activities of the original credit and will equip the mining sector agencies to meet the
                         rapidly increasing demands resulting from the ramp-up of investments and production.

                         The petroleum sector is shifting focus from oil production, which has proved less successful than expected, to gas production where reserves have been confirmed to meet the rapidly
                         increasing energy demand from the mining industry as well as residential consumers. As a consequence of the rapid demand increases, mid-stream operations (storage and fuel
                         transportation) have become critical bottle-necks. The petroleum component will support these areas while maintaining a focus on sector regulation and industry promotion.

                         Progress towards achievement of results indicators is satisfactory for the original solid minerals project component with all indicators being achieved. Petroleum sector indicators are
                         less advanced, but progressing on track for achievement by credit closure in November 2013. Direct project achievements to date include: (i) computerized management systems
                         have been installed and operationalized for award and tracking of exploration and mine titles. (ii) Geological data has been collected and analyzed (though widespread dissemination
                         is still pending). (iii) Local economic development activities have exceeded the end of project targets in terms of community-driven micro projects and an impact assessment has
                         confirmed results on the ground. (iv) In the petroleum sector, a computerized database management system has been designed for concession management. The Hydrocarbon Law
                         has also been modernized together with the standard Production Sharing Agreement.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i) The Second Additional Credit was approved by the National Assembly in October, 2011.
                         (ii) A School of Mines opened its doors in November 2011 for 25 students who will pursue a graduate degree in mine engineering or geology.
                         (iii) A joint steering committee including mine developers, the power utility and government has launched an FS for a gas-to-power facility which will be operated as Public-Private
                         Partnership
                         (iv) Government will collaborate with mine operators to define common principles and procedures for execution of local economic development activities. Such activities are currently
                         promoted by different operators and government schemes.

                         Restructuring History
