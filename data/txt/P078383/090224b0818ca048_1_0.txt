                         The current ISR is based on two missions in July and October 2012. The project is composed of (i) a mining sector component and (ii) a petroleum sector component. The mining
                         component is financed through an original credit (which was closed in October 2012 with a disbursement rate exceeding 98% and having achieved all but one of the original target
                         indicators) and an additional credit (signed in July, 2011). The petroleum component was introduced in 2006 after signing of an additional credit. Both components show a good pace
                         of progress although full disbursement of the credits before project closing will pose a challenge. In terms of meeting project development objectives, all indicators are on track for

                         achieving targets. In light of the resumption of project activities, it is recommended to up-grade Overall Implementation Progress from "Moderately Satisfactory" to "Satisfactory".

                         The Bank's support to extractive industries remains highly relevant in light of rapidly expanding mining operations as well as advanced negotiations on gas exploitation for power
                         generation. These developments will significantly increase the national output of iron ore and gold production. Moreover, gas-to-power development will provide much-needed
                         generation capacity while reducing the cost of supply. In line with the positive sector development, the project activities have gradually progressed from investment promotion to a
                         stronger emphasis on managing the impacts and benefits of extractive industries and responding to consumer and community needs.

                         In concrete terms, this means that the petroleum component is including not only down-stream sector support (exploration and production) but also mid-stream operations (storage
                         and fuel transportation) as demand is growing and critical physical and regulatory bottle-necks have appeared. The mining sector component has reinforced its focus on local
                         community and business development as well as inspection capacities. All of these activities are solidly grounded in the project development objective.

                         Progress towards achievement of results indicators is satisfactory for the original solid minerals project component with all indicators being achieved. Petroleum sector indicators are
                         less advanced, but progressing on track for achievement by credit closure in November 2013. Direct project achievements to date include: (i) computerized management systems
                         have been installed and operationalized for award and tracking of exploration and mine titles. (ii) Geological data has been collected and analyzed (though widespread dissemination
                         is still pending). (iii) Local economic development activities have exceeded the end of project targets in terms of community-driven micro projects and an impact assessment has
                         confirmed results on the ground. (iv) In the petroleum sector, a computerized database management system has been designed for concession management. The Hydrocarbon Law
                         has also been modernized together with the standard Production Sharing Agreement.
