From October 1975 to May 1981, the Uganda shilling was tied to the Special
Drawing Right (SDR) of the IMF (SDR 1.00 = USh 9.66). However, the Ugandan
shilling was devalued by 90% in June 1981 and has subsequently been float-
ing in relation to a basket of currencies. Since August 1982, the Bank of
Uganda has operated a dual exchange rate system, including a second window
at which foreign exchange is traded more freely. The first and second
window exchange rates are expected to approach each other and merge in the
near future.

THIRD RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:        Republic of Uganda
Amount:          A Credit of SDR 47.2 million (US$50 million equivalent)
Terms:           Standard
Project          The proposed credit would (a) provide financing for the
Objectives and  importation of essential raw materials, intermediate goods,
Description:    spare parts, minor capital equipment and drugs for high
priority sectors in line with the Government's Revised
Recovery Programme (b) support urgent policy and
institutional reforms and (c) generate counterpart
resources for the government budget. A list of
beneficiaries requiring government loans or guarantees
which would account for not more than 20% of the credit
has been agreed upon at negotiations. The remainder of the
credit would be sold through foreign exchange auction
procedures currently applied at the second window, to
finance specified imports. The program supported by the
credit comprises actions in the areas of economic
management and planning, foreign exchange and debt
management, parastatal reform and public administration.
Risks:           The principal risks are that the security condition in
Uganda could again deteriorate or that shortfalls in
financing could further reduce import levels and delay
recovery. In 1984 and 1985, shortfalls in foreign exchange
could jeopardize Uganda's progress in rationalizing its
exchange policies and given the sensitivity of economic
performance to the availability of recurrent imports,
seriously threaten the momentum of economic recovery.
These risks have been reduced by the Government's clear
commitment to improving law and order and to its economic
and financial programs. The Government has continued to
respond positively to the concerns of the principal donors,
as evident at the recent Consultative Group meeting in
January 1984.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT FOR A THIRD RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit for a third reconstruction program for the equivalent of SDR 47.2
million (US$50 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms, to the Republic
of Uganda.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Uganda from May 23 to June 5, 1983
and its report, entitled "Uganda - Country Economic Memorandum" (Report
No. 4733-UG) dated December 9, 1983, has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. A summary of social and economic data is given in Annex I.
Background
3.        Uganda achieved independence in 1962 with a number of important
advantages:
(a)  a favorable climate, fertile soils and a rich mineral base for
economic development;
(b)  an established indigenous smallholder sector providing a widening
range of export crops and an ample domestic food supply;
(c)  a small but rapidly growing industrial sector, contributing
exports of copper and textiles;
(d)  a well-developed transport system, including facilities shared
with Kenya and Tanzania under the East African Community (EAC);
(e)  an exportable surplus of hydroelectricity, with substantial scope
for further development on the Victoria Nile; and
(f)  one of the most advanced education systems in East Africa.
The initial years after independence clearly demonstrated the economic
potential of the country. Real GDP grew by 4.8% per annum from 1963 to
1970, implying an increase in per capita terms of at least 2% per annum.
The country was also able to maintain a reasonable savings rate (averaging
13%) which permitted implementation of an ambitious investment program



without undue pressure on domestic prices or the balance of payments.
Although Uganda's export volumes grew slowly, export earnings were more
than, adequate to cover import requirements and the country maintained a
current account surplus in most years. The Government's budgetary position
was also sound~: revenue increased faster than recurrent expenditure during
the latter half of the 1960s and, together with non-bank domestic borrow-
ing, helped finance a significant proportion o. development outlays.
4.         However, after the coup in 1971, the situation quickly deterio-
rated. Under the military regime, many skilled personnel left the country,
the parastatal sector became bloated with the addition of many abandoned or
confiscated industries, and professional standards within the administra-
tion were eroded. On top of these largely self-imposed problems, the
Ugandan economy was shaken by a series of shocks: the sharp rise in
petroleum prices after 1973, the breakup of the EAC in 1977, and the damage
and looting which occurred during the 1978-79 war. As a result, real GDP
stagnated through 1977 and then fell over the next three years. Import
levels had to be cut by 50% from 1970 to 1979, due to lower export volumes,
worsening terms of trade (except during the coffee boom years of 1977-79)
and dwindling aid receipts. The Government's budgetary position also
became increasingly untenable, as the revenue base was undermined and
expenditure control collapsed, The resultant deficit was financed
increasingly by bank borrowing, leading to monetary expansion and price
inflation (averaging 74% per annum from 1977 to 1979). Not surprisingly,
critical shortages developed and a large share of economic activity was
diverted to the pervasive parallel market system called "magendo".
Recent Economic Performance
5.         By April 1979, when the military regime was overthrown, the
Ugandan economy was in ruins. Initial efforts to promote recovery were
constrained by an unstable political situation, administrative weaknesses
and a severe shortage of foreign exchange. As a result, many of the
adverse trends evident during the 1970s continued through 1980.  In partic-
ular, real GDP continued to decline while the inflation rate rose above
100% per annum. Then, in mid 1981, the Government made a dramatic break
with the past by announcing a major devaluation of the Ugandan shilling and
related price adjustments. Through a series of financial programs, sup-
ported by assistance from the IMF and other donors, further policy reforms
have been introduced over the past two years (see paragraphs 7 to 9).  As a
result, there has been a marked improvement in economic performance,
despite the negative impact of internal security problems and adverse
conditions in the world economy. The difficult security situation results
from the disintegration of law and order during the 1970s and the need to
rebuild the security forces after the 1978-79 war. Although most of the
country is now at peace, periodic incidents have occurred, especially in
the areas surrounding Kampala, disrupting production and transport activi-
ties amd diverting budgetary resources for security-related activities. As
regards the world economy, although Uganda's terms of trade have improved
sincea 1981, the index remains at less than half the peaks achieved during
the coffee boom years of 1978-79, and only 65% of the level in 1970.
Equally important, Uganda's export earnings are now constrained by the
quotas on coffee sales imposed under the International Coffee Agreement



(ICA). During 1982/83, for example, Uganda's estimated coffee production
was 40% higher than the quota limit; the balance was either stocked or sold
on non-quota markets at discounts of up to 50%. The combination of
economic recession and tighter fiscal policies in developed countries has
also affected the availability of external assistance. For Uganda, aid
mobilization has been made particularly difficult by the legacy of inter-
national isolation imposed during the 1970s and continuing concern overseas
about the security situation in the country.
6.        Despite these difficulties, an economic recovery is now evident:
(a)  GDP grew on average by 5% per annum during 1981 and 1982, and
this growth rate was probably sustained into 1983 (Table 1). The
recovery was initially concentrated in subsistence agriculture
but has been more generalized over the past two years;
(b) Export volumes rose by an estimated 45% from 1980 to 1983, and
would have recovered even more without the coffee quota con-
straint. This export growth, together with improved aid utiliza-
tion during 1983, has helped to finance a much-needed expansion
of import volumes since 1981;
(c)  Government revenue has increased more than fourteenfold over the
past two years, from 0.8% to 6.3% of GDP. Expenditure growth on
the other hand has been less rapid, because the Government has
restricted cash releases to ministries in order to remain within
the IMF ceilings. Consequently, the budget deficit was held to
about 2% of GDP during 1982/83;
(d) The resultant restraint on bank borrowing by the Government has
reduced the rate of monetarv expansion. This, together with
falling import prices, has helped to control general inflation,
which is down from an estimated 100% per annum in 1980-81 to 45%
in 1982 and about 30% in 1983.
Despite this progress, overall levels of economic activity and trade remain
substantially below the peak levels achieved in the early 1970s. As a
result, per capita GNP is still only two thirds of the 1970 level. The
burden of this income loss falls most heavily on wage and salary earners,
especially in the civil service, who often have to resort to secondary
employment or unofficial activities in order to survive.
PART II - GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Policy Measures
7.        The Government's primary goal is to restore law and order, a
basic prerequisite for future economic progress. Second only to this,
however, is the goal of rehabilitating the productive sectors. The first
step towards rehabilitation was the introduction of the financial program
for 1981/82, which has been followed by similar programs during 1982/83 and

1983/84. These programs have been supported by three stand-by arrangements
with the IMF (for a total of SDR 320 million), drawings from the First and
Second IDA Reconstruction Credits (providing US$145 million after June
1981) and assistance from other donors. Major actions taken by the
Government are summarized below.
(a) The official exchange rate was devalued from under USh 8 to USh
78 per US dollar in June 1981, and has subsequently been steadily
depreciated further to USh 240 per US dollar in January 1984.
Since August 1982, the Government has also opened a second window
where foreign exchange is more freely traded in an auction
system. The rate established at the second window has fluctuated
between USh 230 and USh 330 per US dollar over the past year.
These exchange rate adjustments have led to a substantial reduc-
tion in the premium and importance of the unofficial market for
foreign exchange.
(b) The initial devaluation in June 1981 was accompanied by the
removal of most price controls. The major exceptions were for
producer prices of traditional export crops, retail prices of
petroleum products and utility tariffs. For these controlled
items, significant price increases have been introduced over the
past year. Petroleum prices have increased more than twentyfold
since December 1980 to reflect fully the impact of window-one
exchange rate changes. Producer price adjustments have been more
moderate, with increases of about tenfold for most major export
crops. However, these increases are still substantially higher
than general inflation and net returns from the production of all
major export crops are now positive.  The most serious lags in
price adjustments have been for utility tariffs. Although all
major tariffs have been increased by at least 100% since 1980,
further large adjustments will be required in most cases to
reflect present costs of supply, to provide resources for future
development and to encourage efficient utilization of services.
(c) Various measures have been introduced to improve monetary and
fiscal discipline. To help control the demand for money and
allocate credit, most interest rates have been nearly doubled
over the past two years (although they still remain negative in
real terms).  As part of its obligations under the IMF stand-by
arrangements, the Government has agreed to and met ceilings on
the growth of net domestic credit and net credit to the Govern-
ment.  On the fiscal side, a number of measures were taken in mid
1981 to streamline and improve the elasticity of the taxation
structure.  Strict control has also been maintained over cash
releases to ministries, although this has sometimes been at the
cost of underfunding critical functions and the accumulation of
domestic arrears.
The Revised Recovery Programme
8.        During the latter part of 1981, it became apparent that the
availability of foreign exchange would be substantially less than required



- 6 -
to effect a rapid rehabilitation of the economy and hence a rapid recovery
to early 1970s living standards.  The Government, therefore significantly
scaled down its earlier investment plans, and, in April 1982, with assis-
tance from the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation, produced its
Recovery Programme 1982-84. This program constituted a project-specific
rehabilitation plan for .1982/83 and 1983/84, the resource requirements for
which (US$736.5 million including a "tail" of expenditures overlapping into
1984/85) were held within a realistic assessment of Uganda's export and
external assistance prospects. The strategy was to concentrate resources
on the sectors producing tradeables, especially export agriculture, and on
activities likely to increase production and foreign exchange earnings
rapidly, by mobilizing underutilized capacity and by rehabilitation. The
highest priority sector iis, therefore, export crop production, supported by
transport and communications infrastructure, and the production of basic
consumer goods, building materials and agricultural inputs by the
industrial sector. The REecovery Programme also included commitments to
policy and institutional reforms. This program was presented to, and
received commendation from, the May 1982 meeting of the Consultative Group.
9.        In October 1983, following a progress review, the Government
published a Revised Recovery Programme (RRP), which was presented to a
further meeting of the Consultative Group in January 25 and 26, 1984. The
review concluded that implementation of the original program had fallen
short of targets: actual expenditure during 1982/83 was only US$152
million, less than two thirds the level proposed. There are several
reasons for this shortfall: (a) the Recovery Program was not properly
integrated into the foreign exchange or government budgets, and the
Government had not established the machinery to keep track of aid flows and
expenditures. Monitoring and hence management of the program were
therefore weak; (b) many of the projects were loosely defined in terms of
implementation responsibility and costs; (c) in terms of the lead time
required for preparation and financial mobilization the program was
probably optimistic; and (d) while external aid commitments averaged US$415
million in 1982 and 1983, only marginally short of the requirements
estimated by the World Bank at the 1982 Consultative Group meeting (US$425
million average for those two years), not all these commitments supported
the Recovery Programme; the Government estimates external resources secured
for the original program at US$623 million, US$114 million less than
required. Except for this mismatch of donor commitments and Recovery
Programme requirements, these factors reflect a general weakness in the
Government's administrative capacity, particularly in aid administration
which is now being addressed and supported by various donors, includingIDA
(paras. 44-48).
10.       The RRP attempts to take account of these resource constraints
and implementation problems, while maintaining the same broad objectives
and strategy. The essent:Lal change is a one year extension of programmed
expenditures (see Table 2). The focus on the short-term revival of the
productive sectors remains, and priority in all sectors is given to
rehabilitation and improved utilization of existing capacity. Although
provision has now been made for preparatory7 work on a number of new
projects, most of these dci not involve large expenditures before the end of
1985 and are essential to maintain momentum in later years.  The foreign
exchange and budgetary requirements of the program, which are based on
projections consistent with those presented below (paragraphs 19 and 21),



- 7 -
are realistic, provided the coffee export quota can be increased by about
13% in 1985 and new external assistance commitments can be increased by
about 10% over the next two years. Resources have been reallocated
somewhat towards industry and social infrastructure, partly reflecting
experience during 1982/83, partLy donor sector and project ?references and
partly the allocation of US$80 million of balance of payments support to
the industry sector. The RRP does, however, give greater strategic
emphasis to rebuilding the industrial sector, especially large-scale
industries, and to improving social services.

Sectoral Programs
11.       Agriculture dominates the Ugandan economy, providing livelihood
to 90% of the population and supplying almost all Uganda's exports in
recent years. Ugandan agriculture is largely dependent on small- and
medium-scale peasant farms; no attempt was ever made to encourage expatri-
iate settlements, and even today, large-scale estates are only significant
in tea and sugar production. With its favorable natural conditions, Uganda
produces an overall food surplus in most years, though areas like Karamoja
in the north-east, which are vulnerable to drought and which depend on a
traditional trade of cattle for grain, have suffered periodic food



-8-
shortages as a result of low rainf all and insecurity.  The rehabilitation
of agriculture is the top priority for UgarLda's economic recovery. Coffee,
cotton, tea and tobacco exports could all continue to grow rapidly over the
next three years (although the previous peak levels are not likely to be
reached until later in the 1980s and coffee exports will probably remain
subject to ICA quota constraints).  In addition, scope exists for expanding
non-traditional exports (e.g., hides and skins, foodstuffs and fertilizers)
t:o neighboring countries. The revival of cotton and other agricultural
production would also supply some domestic industrial needs.  During the
rehabilitation phase, the Government has decided to give top priority to
improving incentives, including changes in producer prices and the market-
:Lng system.  Closely related to this is the supply of inputs, implements,
spares for processing and transport, and consumer goods to stimulate the
production of surpluses. Over the longer term, agricultural services,
Lncluding research and extension, will also need more attention,
1L2.      Although Uganda's industrial sector has always been relatively
small, it did in the past make a valuable c.ontribution towards supplying
'he domestic market with basic goods and, in some instances (e.g., textiles
and copper), produced a surplus for export. However, the sector largely
collapsed during the 1970s. Although industrial production did begin to
recover during 1982, performance of the sector remains very uneven, with
maay enterprises still closed down and average capacity utilization of only
about 30%.  At present, the most obvious arnd generally binding constraint
is still the severe shortage of foreign exchange.  However, the longer-term
decline in the sector reflects more fundamental constraints which are
:reemerging as the foreign exchange situation improves. These include:
shortages of qualified managerial and technical expertise, problems of
creditworthiness (resulting from ownership uncertainty, financial indisci-
pline and, more recently, the impact of devaluation on costs), over-
expansion and political interference in the management of the parastatal
sector, and significantly more deteriorated. plant and machinery than had
been realized.  The Government has now declared its intention to follow a
''mixed economy" strategy, with only essential public services reserved
exclusively for the public sector. In othetr areas, domestic and foreign
private enterprise is to be encouraged, either wholly privately owned or in
joint ventures with the Government. The Government expects to close down
or sell off a number of the existing industrial enterprises, while the
financial viability of the remaining parastatals is to be restored through
;increased tariffs, asset revaluation and injections of new capital. The
modalities for restructuring the parastatal. sector are spelled out further
'below (paragraphs 53-55).
13.       Uganda's transport system, formerly one of Africa's best, deteri-
orated rapidly during the 1970s for the same general reasons outlined ear-
lier:  the departure of skilled personnel, political interference, and in-
adequate provision of resources for essenti.al functions like maintenance.
In addition, the breakup of the East African Community (EAC) in 1977 had a
serious effect, especially on Uganda's access to international trade
routes. As a result Uganda lost virtually all railway rolling stock and
aircraft and her part-ownership of railways and port facilities in Kenya
and Tanzania.  This both necessitated heavy new investments by Uganda, and
seriously disrupted international traffic rovements while increasing their



- 9 -
cost. Transport was moreover the sector possibly most seriously affected
by the war and the widespread looting which followed. The vehicle fleet in
particular was decimated. Rehabilitation of the transport system and
sector institutions thus becomes a key requirement for economic recovery.
14.       The World Bank recently completed an assessment of Uganda's
energy sector. Energy use is primarily based on electricity, petroleum and
woodfuels. At the present time, Uganda's electric generating capacity is
underutilized. However, the surplus could be quickly absorbed as the
economy recovers and the opportunities are taken to substitute for more
expensive fuels (such as petroleum products) and to secure long-term export
agreements with neighboring countries. As a result, the Government has
initiated two studies on the power subsector, one on the rehabilitation of
the Owen Falls Station and the other to help prepare a least-cost power
development program. As regards petroleum, the Government has succeeded in
reducing the cost of imports over the past two years, through the impact of
higher retail prices on domestic consumption and smuggling as well as
improvements in supply arrangements. Preliminary work to ascertain the
extent and economic viability of petroleum resources in the Lake Albert
area has also been started, although local oil production remains very much
a longer-term and uncertain prospect. Woodfuels are estimated to account
for 95% of total energy and 71% of commercial energy consumption in
Uganda. There is, therefore, mounting concern that uncontrolled cutting
will eventually deplete the most accessible forest resources and lead to
further soil erosion problems.
15.       In the social sectors, the RRP emphasizes equipment, materials
(including drugs) and essential repairs for schools, hospitals and clinics,
and the rehabilitation of water and sewerage facilities, limited recon-
struction of war-damaged towns and routine repair and maintenance.
Following nearly a decade in which public education and health services
deteriorated, and the gap was filled increasingly by spontaneous private
and community-based initiatives, the Government's strategy is to encourage
further innovation of this kind as well as to develop government programs,
such as primary health care and immunization, that are able to use
resources efficiently. The findings of a Bank Group PHN sector assessment,
under preparation strongly support the health sector programs outlined in
the RRP.
16.       A number of steps are envisaged to improve implementation and
monitoring of the program.  First, the design, costing and phasing of the
projects is more realistic, though further changes and improvements must be
expected as detailed preparation of individual projects proceed.  Secondly,
implementation responsiblity is clearly identified, as are the financing
already secured and balances required for each project. The only major gap
is a complete review of foreign exchange costs and recurrent import
requirements, which had been included in the original program.
Improvements in monitoring of the program and of recurrent foreign exchange
requirements are envisaged under the program for the proposed Third
Reconstruction Credit.
17.       The RRP represents a significant advance in the Government's
efforts to provide a framework for its own decision making and for



- 10 -
mobilizing external assistance.  The priority now is to strengthen the
a,lministrative framework for implementing thie Government's programs, for
carrying them forward and making them more effective. The administrative
weaknesses faced by Uganda (and many other Sub-Saharan African countries)
are inherently difficult to, tackle and progress will be slow. The steps
already undertaken and envisaged to address these weaknesses are outlined
below (paragraphs 40-57). Not surprisingly, given the severe erosion of
the country's productive base and infrastructure during the 1970s, much
remains to be done before Uganda's recovery can be considered complete.
But the Government's RRP and evolving policies are headed in the right
d:irection, and, combined with the financial programs undertaken since
mLd-1981, merit support from the international community.
Assistance needs
13.       While Uganda's economy has startecl to recover, the recovery is
still a fragile one, and even on optimistic assumptions, the prospects for
the remainder of the decade are for a continuing tight foreign exchange
situation. In 1983, petroleum imports, scheduled debt repayments, the
reduction of payments arrears and interest, and repayments to the IMF
accounted for US$284 million, or 86% of export earnings.  All other imports
are being financed by capital inflows, largely aid and debt relief. Of
these, only government imports which absorbed over US$100 million in 1983,
could be reduced in the future without detriment to growth prospects.
i).       We expect Uganda's GDP to grow by 4.7% per annum through 1985 and
3.6% per annum over the subsequent five years provided there is a steady
improvement in the internal security situation, continued progress on
economic reforms, and sufficient foreign exchange to finance recurrent
imports and priority rehabilitation projects. The recent recovery in
export performance is expected to continue, provided Uganda's coffee quota
can be increased from 2.3 million bags in 1983 and 1984 to 2.5 million bags
in 1985. These assumptions imply that the current account deficit, in real
terms, will rise in 1984 and then decline steadily over the remainder of
the decade (Table 3). Scheduled debt repayments will fall to about half
the 1983 level, and there is only limited scope for future debt relief.
Even if Uganda continues to receive IMF support after mid-1984, (the end of
the current program), IMF resources available will be much reduced.
Therefore, the financing situation will be particularly difficult over the
next two years. Among the risks to the scenario described above, the most
im1portant concerns the coffee quota.  Over the longer-term, sustained
export growth is dependent upon a diversification of exports but over the
short-term, an increase in the coffee quota along the lines mentioned
above, is crucial. Yet, as of now, and despite Uganda's strong case for an
increase, based on historical production levels and recent performance,
there is no guarantee that this will materialize.  There is also a risk
thal: import growth may not be restrained by reduced government imports as
assumed in the Drojections. Should the internal security situation
deteriorate, this reduction will be difficult to achieve. Uganda will
therefore continue to depend on external assistance, commitments of which
musl amount to US$444 million in 1984 and then continue at around that
level if required import levels are to be met.

20.       The composition and phasing of commitments is at least as
:Lmportant as the amounts; increased levels of balance of payments support,
-Ln particular, will continue to be essential at least during 1984 and 1985.
given that debt service and petroleum imports are expected to absorb mSre
t:han two thirds of merchandise exports and given that only program-type
assistance can be disbursed quickly enough to fill the 1985 gap of $53
million.  It is particularly important to have enough assistarnce to man-age
t:he expected reunification of the exchange rate without pressure to resort
t:o controls. Project aid has a role to play in the short term, provZded it-
is consistent with the rehabilitation priorities in the RRP,and will become
increasingly important during the second half of the decade. Technica'
asSistance, while not as large in dollar terms, is important for impro'rFiqg
public administration and making other forms of aid effective. The net
benefit to Uganda of higher commitments could soon be eroded if they are
not provided on concessional terms. This does not preclude the possibility
of utilizing some commercial bank loans or suppliers' credits in
association with concessional assistance, but only for selected projects
which generate additional net foreign exchange earnings to cover fully the
related debt obligations.
21.       The pressure on the Government's budget will also be consider-
able. The 1982/83 expenditure targets were met by dint of strong
restrictions which squeezecl operating ministries and local counterpart
financing of the development budget severely.  On the other hand, revenue
performance was good in 1982/83.  Revenue growth in subsequent years Wi_i
depend on maintaining a rapid recovery and on improving tax administrat-
ion.   If, however, the present high rates of coffee export taxation are to
be reduced and if the two exchange rates are to be merged some time dur.ng
1984, as at present envisaged by the Government and the IMF, the revenaue
position will remain highly constrained.  To the extent that Uganda can
generate counterpart funds from the use of external assistance by applying
those funds to uses which generate quick returns and repayment of local
funds to the government, these budgetary pressures can be eased.
2.2.      These conclusions regarding aid requirements were endorsed by the
Consultative Group meeting on January 25 and 26, 1984, at which the
strategy and priorities of the RRP were again welcomed. While indications
oi- external assistance still fell somewhat short of these requirements,
this reflected tighter bilateral donor budgets rather than misgivings over
Uganda's performance. In view of the difficult external financing
situation which Uganda faces over the next few years, and particlarly in
1985, every effort should be made to encourage bilateral donors to provide
more program assistance to the country.
Debt
23.       Uganda's external debt outstanding and disbursed had reached an
estimated US$713 million by the end of 1982. Of this amount, 3.5% was due
to IBRD (for Uganda's notional share of EAC loans) and 13.5% to IDA.
Fortunately for Uganda, the terms of new aid commitments since 1979 have
been highly concessional, wiLth about half being grants and the balance of
loans having a grant element of 60%, However, other debt obligations, such
as war-related assistance and IMF purchases, have helped to raise the
overall debt service ratio l:o around 50% during 1981-83.  Under the



- 13 -
base-case scenario in the Country Economic Memorandum, the debt service
ratio is projected to fall back to 46% in 1984 and 31% by 1990. This,
however, is still high. Further, the down-side risks are very real:
Uganda's export structure is still heavily dependent on coffee, earnings
from which could be constrained by an even tighter quota and unfavorable
price movements; the Government may find it difficult to reduce the import
requirements of security-related activities; and adequate amounts of
assistance, on concessional terms, may not be forthcoming to support the
recovery effort. This outlook reinforces the importance of improved aid
and external debt management (paragraphs 47 and 48).
PART III - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
24.       Bank Group operations in Uganda began with an IBRD loan of US$8.4
million for hydroelectric power development in 1961. Between 1967 and 1971
Uganda received seven IDA credits totalling US$48.0 million for projects in
education, roads and agriculture (tea, tobacco and beef ranching). In
addition, Uganda benefitted from 10 loans totalling US$224.8 million which
were extended for the development of the common services and the East
African Development Bank operated jointly by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
through their association in the former East African Community (EAC).
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations, IFC's first
investment in Uganda, in a textile company, was sold to the Government in
1970. The second, to help finance two lodges in the national parks was
cancelled in 1972 before construction began. In FY83 and 84, IFC approved
new investments in the Toro and Mityana Tea Company, the Uganda Tea
Corporation and the Lugazi Sugar Factory.
25.       There was a hiatus in Bank Group operations from 1971 until
February 1980, when a First Reconstruction Credit of US$72.5 million
(including a participation of US$17.5 million by the Netherlands) and an
EEC Special Action Credit of US$20.0 million were approved (Nos.
983/983-1-UG and 54-UG). The Association also acted as Administrator of a
Can$3.0 million grant from the Government of Canada and of a US$5.0 million
program loan from the OPEC Fund. In addition, the Association has provided
US$323.0 million through the First Technical Assistance Credit (No.
1077-UG), a Water Supply Engineering Credit (No. 1110-UG), a Phosphate
Engineering Credit (No. 1228-UG), an Industrial Rehabilitation Credit (No.
1248-UG), a Second Reconstruction Credit (No. 1252-UG), an Agricultural
Rehabilitation Credit (No. 1328-UG), a Third Education Credit (No.
1329-UG), a Posts and Telecommunications Rehabilitation Credit (No.
1367-UG), a Second Technical Assistance Credit (No. 1434-UG), and a Third
Highways Credit (No. 1445-UG).
26.       A comparison with other portfolios in the Eastern Africa Region
indicates that the disbursement rate in Uganda has been higher than
average, ranging as a proportion of outstanding commitments from 43% in
FY80 to 30% in FY83 (compared with 19% and 26% in the same years for the
Region as a whole). Performance under the First and Second Reconstruction
Credits is described below (paragraphs 28-35). Disbursements under the



- 14 -
Water Supply Engineering Credit are continuing and have started satis-
factorily under the Phosphate Engineering Credit. There are no disburse-
ments yet from the Industrial Rehabilitation Credit due to the time needed
to appraise sub-projects; in detail. Progress under the Agricultural
Rehabilitation Project is good and after some initial delays disbursements
have begun to improve. Disbursements have recently commenced under the
Third Education and the Posts and Telecommunications Projects. The Bank
Group administers an Agricultural Reconstruction Program (No. 80-UG) of
US$20 million equivalent financed by the International Fund for
Agricultural Development and has appraised a second. It also administers a
[JNDP--financed Planning Assistance Project. Bank strategy and expected
future operations are described below (paragraph 37).
27,       Developments affecting the East African Community (EAC) were
outlined to the Executive Directors in a memorandum dated December 29, 1977
(R77-312) and in a statement made on May 6, 1980 (SecM80-364).
Negotiations based on the Mediator's proposals, which started in December
1981 and continued through 1982 and 1983, culminated in a meeting of the
three Heads of State in Arusha on November 15 and 16, 1983 at which full
agreement was reached on all outstanding issues. The agreement provides
equity shares of 42% for Kenya, 32% for Tanzania, and 26% for Uganda. As a
result of this formula, Kenya and Tanzania have excess assets over their
equity shares, while Uganda has a shortfall. The Presidents agreed
there!fore that Kenya and Tanzania will pay compensation to Uganda. The
miethod of payment of this compensation is being worked out at the
ministerial level and an agreement formalizing the arrangements is expected
to be signed by the three Presidents in May.
PART IV - THE THIRD RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM CREDIT
The First Reconstruction Credit
28.       The First Reconstruction Credit (US$100 million equivalent
including cofinancing) was approved in February 1980 and fully disbursed by
June 30, 1983. It financed a variety of recurrent imports, including spare
parts, packing materials, agricultural tools, educational materials and
telecommunications equipment. These resources were a sizeable proportion
of Uganda's foreign exchange inflow, having financed 8.4% of Uganda's
non--fuel imports in 1981 and 13.7% in 1982 while accounting for 16.6% of
all loan and grant disbursements in 1981 and 29.7% in 1982. The only major
policy condition of the Credit was devaluation, which was seen as the key
first step to eliminatingr "magendo" (paragraph 4). This was finally
fulfilled in June 1981 with the introduction of the financial program.
29.       The principal categories of beneficiaries were the food-
processing, beverage, clothing, wood and paper, construction and metal
industries and government ministries. A report on the impact of the Credit
prepared by the MPED estimated that IDA-financed imports accounted for
about 64% of the total imports utilized by these beneficiaries during
1981-82.  Since these beneficiaries are a majority of Uganda's operating
enterprises, they account for the improved performance of the whole
industrial sector (see Table 1).  A major determinant of increased
production appears to have been creditworthiness.  In a survey, carried out



- 15 -
by Bank staff in October 1983, of' a representative sample of 17 more
creditworthy firms, average capacity utilization had increased from 17% in
1981 to 30% in 1982, mostly as a result of IDA-financed foreign exchange.
On the other hand, 19 financially weak beneficiaries of IDA funds with a
10% average capacity utilization in 1981 were, for reasons outlined below,
only able to maintain output levels and performed no better than a third
group of 14 larger firms that didi not receive IDA support. Some firms,
such as Nyanza Textiles Limited, have operated at levels in excess of 55%
during the past four years.  Without the support of the reconstruction
credits, their production would almost certainly have declined.
30.       It is evident that the First Reconstruction Credit had a positive
impact on industrial production.  This impact would have been greater had
it not been for several implementation difficulties. Disbursement was slow
due initially to political disruptions, then to delays in releasing the
second tranche and finally to delays in allocation ani -. weak government
machinery, unfamiliar with Bank Group procurement guidelines and other
procedures. The Credit was spread too thinly and benefitted a number of
users that later turned out not to be creditworthy.  In some instances, the
amounts allocated to beneficiaries were used to purchase inappropriate
capital equipment or were insufficient to raise production to break-even
level. Some beneficiaries were unable to raise local credit, while some
overexpanded in relation to the market. Several beneficiaries unfamiliar
with tendering procedures experienced slow procurement. Finally, the full
extent of the deterioration in productive capacity in many enterprises only
became apparent in the course of resuming manufacture. Under the
conditions prevailing when these allocation decisions were taken -- rapidly
changing prices, exchange rate and market conditions, new management in
many enterprises and the inexperience of the inter-ministerial committee --
such difficulties were inevitable.
31.       The net foreign exchange impact and the linkage effects of the
Credit cannot be assessed for lack of reliable data.  Information on the
management, financial, and marketing constraints on industrial enterprises
in Uganda also remains inadequate. Thus detailed recommendations for
improvement in these aspects at the enterprise level are still not
possible. To improve the basic information in this regard, the Government
plans to undertake an industrial sector survey (which will form the basis
for a Bank Group Industrial Sector Memorandum during 1984/85), as well as
a parastatal accounting study. The fiscal benefit of the Credit has been
moderated by the failure of firms to pay local counterpart funds of
approximately US$38 million equivalent as of March 31, 1984. Most of these
arrears are owed by financially weak parastatals, reflecting the problems
described above. Long-term solutions to these problems must be found in
the context of an action program for the parastatals generally. Meanwhile
loan repayments by these delinquent borrowers have been rescheduled and
government has concluded an agency agreement with the Uganda Commercial
Bank to manage these loans.
The Second Reconstruction Credit
32.       A Second Reconstructiorn Credit of US$70 million was approved in
May 1982.  The Dutch and Canadiarn Governments also provided grants of
US$4.9 million and US$4 million equivalent, respectively, in January 1984,
which are being administered by the Bank Group. The Credit supported the



- 16 -
financial program and the Recovery Programmee but many of the weaknesses ;n
administration and policy formulation described earlier hiad also become
evident.  In addition to financing high priority recurrent imports, the
Government's capacity to perform these functions in a number of areas
critical for economic recovery was supported.  Particular attention was
given to programs aimed at improving the pricing and marketing of export
crops; administration, plainning and foreign exchange allocatlon; parastat.:al
organizations; and external debt management. Thnese programs are proceeding
successfully, and although progress was ini,:ially slow, implementation ls
now accelerating (see paragrapns 40-57 below,).
33.       Recognizing the problems of credit: allocation under the First
Credit, a preliminary allocation of credit proceeds among a broader range
of imports was agreed at negotiations, and criteria for allocations to
inidividual enterprises were established.  Technical assistance was provCded
to the Central Tender Board (CTB) to improve implementation. Despite t,lesa
efforts, improvements were not as rapid as anticipated. First, technical
assistance to the CTB was delayed. Secondly, beneficiaries were not
notified of allocation decisions until late 1982 and thirdly, it provred
difficult to reconcile the need to support high priority indulstrial and
irnfrastructural enterprises with financial viability.
34.       During 1983, a number of measures were taken to improve
implementation. These incluided reallocation of credit funds from poor
performers and financially weak beneficiaries to better performers and
strengthening the coordinating unit in the B.ank of Uganda. The CTB was
provided with additional technical assistance personnel to expedite the
tendering process and potential beneficiaries were required to demonstrate
their creditworthiness.  With these improvements in place, the Bank Group
agreed to extend the closing date for the Credit to December 31, 1984 and
to establish a special. revolving account of US$5.0 million to expedite dis
bursements.  Much progress has since been macle in all of the above key
areas and implementation has improved significantly: as of March 31, 1984
approximately US$25.0 million equivalent has been disbursed under the
Second Credit, and an additional US$35.0 million equivalent has been
committed. Tenders equivalent to the total amount of the IDA credit and
the supplemental grants have been awarded by the CTB and it is expected
that all funds will be fully committed by the end of May 1984. The
Government will therefore need further commitment authority if the support
provided by the first two reconstruction credits is to be sustained and
their impact on the economy consolidated.
35.       Since implementaiton is still a little behind schedule, it is
premature to assess its impact.  However, allocations to financially weak
parastatals have been reduced, and the technical assistance to CTB has not
only strengthened its procurement control, but also provided valuable
procurement advice and guidance to many Ugandan enterprises, both public
and private. Given the evidence now available demonstrating the positive
impact of the First Credit, it is likely that the impact of the Second will
be at least as great.
Backcground to the Third Reconstruction Credit
36.       Anticipating further needs for fast--disbursing assistance, the
Government requested a third reconstruction credit during the annual



- 17 -
meetings in September 1983. A pre-appraisal mission which visited Uganda
in October/November 1983 concluded that, provided execution of the Second
Reconstruction Credit accelerated and an action program for further reforms
was agreed, the Board should be asked to consider a third credit as early
as possible. A mission visited Uganda again in January 1984 to discuss the
government'- Memorandum of Understanding (Annex IV) and conclude
arrangements for execution of the proposed credit. Negotiations were held
in Washington in April 1984 with a government delegation headed by
Hon. E.R. Kamuntu, Ambassador in the Office of the President.   There is no
separate staff appraisal report for this credit. A credit and project
summary is at the front of this report and supplemental data are contained
in Annex III.
37.       The Bank Group's strategy in Uganda is to continue to finance an
adequate share of the immediate import needs of the economy through 1985
and to support the Government's efforts to reform economic policies and
institutions. Some investments in new capacity (e.g. hydro-electricity)
are planned to relieve bottlenecks that might otherwise inhibit development
after the preliminary rehabilitation phase is complete. These aside
however, project lending will for the time being emphasize rehabilitation
and fast disbursing assistance, including related recurrent import
requirements, in the context of institutional development. The emphasis
will gradually shift to projects, with agriculture, industry, transport and
energy as priority sectors. Technical assistance will continue to
complement these operations, either through projects or as part of our own
economic and sector work. At the last Consultative Group meeting, it was
also evident that cofinancing with bilateral donors will require increasing
emphasis if the projected gap in Uganda's foreign exchange requirement over
the short-term is to be met. We intend to actively pursue this objective
through our dialogue with bilateral donors, and through seeking out
cofinancing of our own assistance. It is important that donors continue to
support Uganda's efforts towards recovery with adequate balance of payments
assistance and project lending in priority sectors. We therefore plan to
review our own strategy in this context during September and, if
appropriate, prepare a follow-up program credit. Besides the Third Highway
Project, which was approved on March 13, projects are currently under
preparation in the power, water supply, tea and sugar sectors.
Objectives and Description
38.       The proposed credit is central to this strategy.  To consolidate
the economic gains and the policy reforms achieved under the first two
reconstruction credits, this credit would have the following principal
objectives: (a) to provide financing for the importation of essential raw
materials, intermediate goods, spare parts, minor capital equipment and
drugs for high priority sectors in line with the RRP; (b) to continue the
support for policy and institutional reforms initiated under the second
reconstruction credit; and (c) to generate counterpart resources for the
government budget. There are also prospects that, as with the first two
reconstruction credits, this proposed operation will prove a useful
catalyst for cofinancing. In the Memorandum of Understanding, the Ugandan
Government has expressed its commitment to these objectives. During
implementation of the program, the Government and the Bank will exchange
views, on the basis of a report prepared by the Government, on progress
achieved in implementating the program (Development Credit Agreement,



- 18 -
Section 4.03). The complete program supported by the proposed credit is
summarized in Table 4, p. 24.
Coordination with the IMF
39.       Uganda has received three stand-by credits from the IMF starting
in June 1981. The last review of stand-by was in November 1983, following
which a program for the remainder of the fiscal year 1983/84 was agreed.
Following agricultural producer price, public utility and petroleum price
adjustments, the IMF Board approved this program in February 1984. Uganda
has consistently met IMF performance criteria to date.  The roles of the
Bank and the Fund have complemented each other; the IMF programs have
stressed exchange rate marnagement, short-term fiscal policy and foreign
exchange management, pricing policy and domestic credit control.  The
Bank's involvement has emphasized strengthening of core institutions,
especially the process of Recovery and Revised Recovery Programme
preparation, the development of capacity to analyze and decide on key
sectoral policies, (e.g. agricultural prices), sectoral advice, especially
in energy, and database improvement.  At the same time, there have been
aireas of overlap which have been mutually reinforcing:  on the parastatal
study, on strengthening the MF and external debt management, and on
agricultural price policy recommendations.
Policies and Institutional Reforms
(a) Exchange rate, taxation and pricing policy
40.       The dual exchange rate system has been a useful transitional
arrangement which has helped determine an appropriate value for the Uganda
Shilling, control the parallel market and provide a more competitive
environment for allocating foreign exchange. It has, however, introduced a
number of distortions which, if allowed to persist, would misallocate
resources and slow down recovery. In particular, (i) market prices tend to
reflect the window two exchange rate, giving rise to windfall profits for
those with access to window one (mainly ministries and parastatals), while
squeezing the returns to those whose prices are related to window one rates
(niotably coffee and cotton producers); and (ii) the rapid depreciation at
window one, combined with lengthy procedures for importation (see paragraph
30 above for the experience of importers supported by IDA reconstruction
credits) has created uncertainties and led to unanticipated increases in
domestic credit requirements. A unified market-clearing exchange rate in a
less inflationary environment is less likely to cause such problems.
41.       The Government intends to reunify the exchange rate at an early
date and has an understanding with the IMF about the schedule for doing
so. In the Memorandum of Understanding (Annex IV) for the proposed third
reconstruction credit, the Government has stated its desire to minimize,
as far as possible, administrative allocation of foreign exchange after the
ex:pected merger of the two windows. The Government intends to maintain a
flexible and market-responsive exchange regime, using an auction system and
to depend mainly on fiscal and monetary policy to contain foreign exchange
dermand. Indirect tax adjustments will also be required to offset the
revenue loss from merging the exchange rate, while avoiding an excessive



- 19 -
burden falling on those industries, like the breweries, which are already
taxed heavily. An IMF tax study has recently been prepared and its
recommendations will provide the basis for these adjustments. The
Government expects to decide the details of the exchange regime and tax
revisions in consultation with the IMF in the context of a possible
stand-by credit for 1984/85.
42.       Export crop producer prices, which were increased substantially
in June 1983 and January 1984, are now at levels which ensure at least
positive net returns. Further adjustments will be required in due course
to reflect changes in the exchange regime, world prices, comparative
returns among export crops, quality premia and improvements in the
efficiency and capacity of the marketing system. Under the programs
supported by the Second Reconstruction and Agricultural Rehabilitation
Credits, the Government established an Agricultural Policy Committee,
assisted by an IDA-supported Agricultural Secretariat, to review and
recommend on agricultural pricing policy. Export crop sub-sector studies
supported under the Agricultural Rehabilitation Credit, which will provide
essential data and recommendations for agricultural pricing policy, are
nearing completion. Under the Agricultural Rehabilitation Credit, the
Government is committed to annual consultation with IDA on agricultural
producer prices. The first such consultation is expected in April 1984 in
preparation for the 1984/85 crop season and financial program.
43.       In the context of the current financial program, supported by an
IMF stand-by credit, the Government has adjusted retail petroleum prices so
as to reflect import parity at the window two rate, and has eliminated
cross-subsidization among petroleuim products. Interest rates have been
raised substantially, but remain negative in real terms. However the
Government has requested IMF assistance to study debt instruments and
rediscounting facilities. The Government has also made interim adjustments
in electricity, telephone, water, railway and airline charges, but in all
cases, further study is needed to determine costs and management strength-
ening is required to improve bill collection. Tariff studies are being
programmed in the context of IDA-supported or proposed projects for power,
telecommunications and water supply while tariff issues will be considered
for the railways and airlines under the parastatal accounting study
(paragraph 54).
(b) Strengthening Economic Management and Planning
44.       The RRP places strong emphasis on the need to strengthen
Government administration generally, but particularly the machinery for
economic and financial control and for project implementation. Economic
management involves principally the Ministries of Finance (MF) and of
Planning and Economic Development (MPED) and the Bank of Uganda (BOU). The
BOU is the most effective of these organizations at present, and is being
reinforced by IMF technical assistance.
Ministry of Finance
45,       The MF is responsible for preparation and implementation of the
Government budget, external assistance agreements and loan approvals,
Government accounts, parastatal financial control and revenue collection.



- 20 -
Its effectiveness has improved over the past two years, most evidently n
the areas of expenditure control, by the rigorous enforcement of cash
limits under the financial program; revenue collection, the result of
stronger administration, and budgetary formulation -- budget formats are
now more meaningful, the budget cycle has been initiated earlier, and
budgetary policy has been outlined more clearly.  The MF receives tec!hLnical
assistance from the IMF, the Commonwealth Fund for Technical  Cooperatien
and the EEC. The UK has been providing training in accouriting and
financial management.  However, several weaknesses remain, most notably in.
(a)  the monitoring and control of government finances,
(b)  aid administration, (for which MF now has the lead
responsibility), foreign exchange and external debt mannagement9
(c)  budgetary formulation, and
(d) parastatal financial control.
Strengthening of ME's capacity to perform these tasks wTas the subject oi a
program elaborated by the (Government as a condition for releasing the
second tranche of the Second Reconstruction Credit.  The next steps umd2r
this program are outlined lelow.
46.       The fundamental financial control problem has been the wathor-JLty
and responsibility for incurring expenditure, theoretically well defined
under existing regulations, but often undermained in practice.  This
reflects the carry-over from the years of the military regime of poor
salaries, interference and the breakdown of procedures which wi11 only 1be
brought under better control slowly. The ministry's authority has been
strengthened by the establishment of a financial program monitoring
committee and an expenditure committee. These committees have succeeded! in
ensuring adherence to financial program  targets, reducing governmen: demand
for foreign exchange and in rejecting excessively burdensome external
loans.  Authority has been centralized by th:e closure of a large number o
government accounts and by strict limitation on the use of the Treasu 'y
Main Clearance Account, which had been used for extra-budgetary
expenditures. Steps are being taken to eliminate domestic arrears.
F:Lnally, efforts are now underway to reintroduce the basic routines of
fiinancial control, including vote books and commitment registers, control
of signatories and checking of payment vouchers. To support this, the
Government, with UK assistance, is training staff at the Treasury Office of
Accounts. Technical assistance, essential equipment and, in due course,
the re-design of budgeting and control systems are to be provided by IDA
assistance to the Treasury Office of Accounts, under the First Technical
Assistance Credit. The Government is making efforts to expedite the
recruitment of two experts for the Office by September 30, 1984; however i.t
is required that at least one must be in place before credit effeCtive-
ness. Thereafter, the positions must remain filled by qualified persono-el
until the closing date of the Project (Development Credit Agreement,
Sections 4.06 and 6.01(a)).
47.       The weakness in aid coordination reflects uncertainty about where
that responsibility lies, poor staff work and lack of attention to project
selection and monitoring. The Government has recently clarified that the



- 21 -
lead responsibility lies with the MF, and has established a department in
the ministry headed by a former Bank of Uganda Governor. The department
has begun to document the procedures, reporting formats and strengthening
programs required for aid administration, and to ensure that these are well
understood and supported both by donors and sector ministries. As a
condition of credit effectiveness, the department would have established a
satisfactory system, for monitoring the commitment, utilization and
disbursement of all external assistance (Development Credit Agreement,
Section 6.01(b)).
48,        Significant progress has been made in the past two years towards
improving foreign exchange management. An annual foreign exchange budget
was introduced for 1982/83, while monthly budgets for cash resources have
been in use since August 1982. A number of administrative improvements
have also been introduced, removing advance import deposits, reducing
import license fees and limiting the time required for issuing import
licenses. The character of foreign exchange management will however change
after the merger of the exchange rates. This emphasizes the importance of
adopting a longer term and more comprehensive framework for planning
foreign exchange priorities. The main gap in the present system -- the
effective monitoring of aid -- will be addressed as indicated above. At a
minimum, the ability to plan and monitor all foreign exchange sources and
uses, will be ensured by these means. In compliance with a condition of
release of the second tranche of the Second Reconstruction Credit, the
Government has established an External Debt Management Office (EDMO) at the
Bank of Uganda, with responsibility for monitoring external debt and
advising on external debt policy. This has been further strengthened by
the appointment of a director under IMF technical assistance. To further
ensure a more careful appraisal of external borrowing proposals the
Government proposes to establish by June 30, 1984, an external borrowing
committee which would be responsible for recommending approval of all
external loans to the Minister of Finance. Not later than September 30,
1984, the Government will devise and implement appropriate criteria and
guidelines, satisfactory to the Association and the IMF, for external
medium and long-term borrowing, (Development Credit Agreement, Section
4.04).
Budgetary formulation
49.       While the Government has stayed within the expenditure targets of
the successive financial programs since 1981/82, this has been accomplished
by strict limits on cash releases to ministries, rather than by control
over commitments. As a result, the operations of ministries have been at
times severely disrupted and inadequate attention has been paid to the
relative priority of spending units, the appropriate relative magnitudes of
expenditure on overheads in the recurrent budget, like salaries and fuel
costs, and to the recurrent/development expenditure balance. The
development budget has, moreover, included expenditures not reflected in
the Recovery Programme. The next steps in improving the budgeting process
will be: (a) the modification of the development budget format for 1984/85
to ensure that the programs included relate to the RRP, and (b) closer
consultation between MF and MPED in budgetary review through the estimates
committee and MPED approval of the draft ministerial submissions of the
development budget. The review of appropriate salary and establishment



- 22 -
levels will be a task of the program to strengthen public administration
(see paragraph 57 below).
50.       Parastatal financial control is the responsibility of the MF
Department of Economic Affairs.  A technical expert is required to assist
this division, terms of reference and recruitment proposals for which will
be prepared by May 31, 1984. This department also services the steering
committee for the parastatal accounting study (see paragraph 54 below),
which will also make recomnmendations on the appropriate machinery for
broader control of parastatal policies and programs.
Ministry of Planning and Economic Development
51.       MPED's performanice also has improved over the past two years.
It reviewed the implementation of the Recovery Programme and chaired the
task force which prepared the RRP. Although outside consultants assisted
in both tasks, the MPED staff role in both exercises was significantly
greater than in preparation of the original Recovery Programme. MPED also
recently prepared a comprehensive report oil the impact of the First
Reconstruction Credit (932-UG).  The nucleus of a competent and experienced
planning team now exists.  The strengthening program prepared as a
ccndition for release of the second tranche of the Second Reconstruction
Credit is built round a redesign of the IBRD-executed UNDP planning
assistance project, which provides both technical assistance personnel and
traininga
52.       As redesigned, the principal tasks of MPED are now (a) the
management of the RRP, particularly the monitoring of implementation and
the elaboration of project design in consu:ltation with implementing
agencies, (b) technical assistance coordination, (c) statistics collection
and (d) manpower planning, Proposals for imonitoring the RRP will be
formrulated by June 30, 1984 (paragraph 47) as part of the detailed program
for improving aid administration, and the Government will, before September
1984, start preparation of a program to succeed or roll over the RRP.
Under the Second Technical. Assistance Credit, approved by the Board on
December 22, 1983, improved procedures for the submission, review and
approval of technical assistance proposals were agreed, and terms of
referen.ce for a technical assistance coordinator were decided. Further
strengithening of MPED depends critically on adequately staffing the UNDP
planning assistance project, which is executed by the Bank Group, a process
inhibited up to now by recruitment difficulties.  Further efforts to find
and recruit qualified staff are underway and we expect results in the near
future. The Government would furnish to the Association an action program
for the rationalization and restructuring of departments in MPED, including
proposals for the creation and staffing of the post of professional head of
the economic planning staff, and would implement by not later than
September 30, 1984, agreed recommendations of the action program
(Bevelopment Credit Agreement, Section 4.09).
(c) Parastatals and Expropriated Properties
53,       The Government is committed to the development of a mixed
economy, in which only essential public services will be reserved
exclusively for the parastatal sector; in other areas, the public and
prrivate sectors (both local and foreign) would compete, to the extent
possible, in free and open markets.  As a first step to reviving the



- 23 -
private sector in commerce and industry, the Government passed the
Expropriated Properties Act in 1982, under which all properties
expropriated by the military regime have been transferred to the MF,
pending the resolution of ownership claims. Former owners had until
May 21, 1983 to lodge claims for restitution, provided they were prepared
to return to Uganda and effectively manage their propertie  or participate
in joint ventures with the government. Some 1800 repossession claims have
been received to date, as well as a considerably larger number of
compensation claims. The majority of these however concern residential and
commercial property of less critical importance to recovery. On January
17, 1984, the Government announced the appointment of a chairman and
members of the verification committee which will process these claims.
During negotiations, the Government stated that except for three
enterprises whose future status is under review, the Government has decided
upon those enterprises it would retain in the publiK sector, those it
expects to be taken over by the private sector and :Those for which it would
seek joint venture arrangements (Annexes lA-lE of the Memorandum of
Understanding). Further, as a condition of credit effectiveness, the
Government has agreed to prepare and furnish the Association for its review
and comments a program (including technical assistance proposals) and
timetable for the resolution of ownership issues relating to large and
medium-scale industrial and agricultural enterprises critical to recovery
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 6.01(d)).
54,       In order to provide basic data for negotiations and to generate
recommendations on policy and organizational matters, the Government,
suipported by the IDA Technical Assistance Credits, is hiring consultants to
carry out a parastatal accounting study. Selection and approval of the
consultants had taken longer than expected. This process has now been
finalized and the first phase of the study is expected to be completed by
June 30, 1984.  The Government has agreed to consult the Association within
three months of receiving the consultant's recommendations on any
parastatal or group of parastatals under the first phase and subsequently
implement the program agreed with the Association.The Government would also
conduct the second phase of the study on the basis of a work program
satisfactory to the Association (Development Credit Agreement, Section
4.05). While the emphasis of the study is on generating the data necessary
for management and policy analysis, the study will also recommend action on
financial, organizational, managerial and policy matters. The study will
give priority to those parastatals which may receive assistance under the
third reconstruction credit (paragraph 59) and to the public utilities.
55.       Finally, the Government has decided that the Uganda Development
Corporation which, in the 1960s was an effective instrument for industrial
promotion and government participation, would be restored to its former
role and reorganized. The reorganization will restore a number of
viable enterprises to UDC, thus reducing the dispersion of parastatals
among ministries unable to supervise them adequately.
(d) Public administration
56.       The difficulties in project implementation and decision making
highlighted earlier reflect a broader set of institutional problems.
Despite increasingly constrained resources, the size of government, in
terms of the number of ministries and employees, has continued to expand.

In addition, Uganda's civil service, once a good model of efficiency, now
suffers from weak management, organizational problems, a breakdown in
standard procedures, low staff morale, inadequate training, and manpower
and financial contraints. A symptom of the crisis now afflicting the civil
service is low salaries. After the many upward price adjustments since
1981, salaries provide only a fraction of what is required to survive, with
obvious implications for morale, productivity and the need to resort to
secondary employment or unofficial activities.
57,       The Bank is concluding a public acdministration study which will
produce recommendations on many of these issues. It is evident, meanwhile,
that these problems will take long to resolve, and that a critical element
will be the initiation of a reform process, designed to mobilize resources
and commitment, both among political and administrative circles.  Any major
restructuring will take time. A start on the process will be made through
technical assistance to the Ministry of Public Service and Cabinet Affairs
(MPSCA) and the Institute of Public Administration (IPA), proposals for
which are now being concluded, and which will be supported under the IDA
Second Technical Assistance Credit. Meanwhile, the Government proposes to
(:L) start a detailed review of the functions of government ministries,
concentrating resources on essential ministries, and rationalizing their
functions, (ii) maintain a selective freeze on declared vacancies and only
fill vacancies by declaring savings within the same establishment, and
(iii) concentrate salary adjustments on those with specific skill
reqluirements.
Credit Execution
58.       The evidence now available on the experience of the First
Reconstruction Credit indicates that the more creditworthy companies were
a]so more successful at increasing production. Under the Second Credit, it
is also evident that normal commercial banking criteria, especially in an
environment where price and exchange rate distortions are being eliminated,
have generally served the objectives of the credit. There are two local
commercial banks (the Uganda Commercial Bank and the Cooperative Bank) and
five international banks (Bank of Baroda, Barclays Bank, Grindlays,
Libyan-Arab Bank and the Standard Bank) operating in Uganda. All except
the Cooperative Bank (which does not conduct foreign transactions) are well
staffed, conversant with international commercial procedures, and take
their lending decisions independently. The Uganda Commercial Bank is an
implementing agency for both the IDA Industrial and Agricultural
Rehabilitation Credits. All the banks are also familiar with World Bank
operations and guidelines having participated actively in the past use of
IDA reconstruction credits. Accordingly, not less than 80% (about US$40
million eqivalent) of the two proposed credits would be made available to
firms able to purchase foreign exchange at the auction using their own
resources or which have quaLified for commercial bank credit without a
government guarantee or other government financial support.  Apart from
limitations on the categories of imports eligible for financing, on large
procurement contracts and oni the amounts that could go to any one
beneficiary, there would be no prior allocation of the credit proceeds.



- 27 -
59.       Not more than 20% (about US$10 million equivalent) of the credits
would be reserved for parastatals requiring government loans or guarantees
and government ministries whose operations are vital to the economy,
consistent with the RRP and adequately supported in the government budget
(Development Credit Agreement Section 3.01 (iv)). The Government's
proposals for these beneficiaries and their intended use of credit funds
were reviewed at negotiations and a list agreed. Credit funds would not be
allocated to any parastatal requiring budgetary support which was the
subject of a claim under the Expropriated Properties Act, (Development
Credit Agreement Schedule 5.B.2). These enterprises would also be given
priority in the parastatal accounting study. No one beneficiary would be
allocated an amount less than US$20,000 or more than US$2 million, unless
the Association's prior agreement has been obtained (Development Credit
Agreement, Schedule 5.A.3 and B.5).
Credit Administration and Management
60.       As under the two previLous reconstruction credits, the External
Debt Management Office (EDMO) of the Bank of Uganda would continue to
coordinate, monitor and supervise all credit activities. A Technical
Committee, under the chairmanship of MPED and consisting of representatives
from MF, BOU, CTB, Uganda Bankers Association and the import licensing
authority (at present the UABT) would be responsible for reviewing sales of
foreign exchange at the weekly foreign exchange auction to determine
eligibility for reimbursement under the credit (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.02). Eligibility criteria are described in paragraphs
63 and 64 below. The Committee will not undertake any prior credit
allocation and its terms of reference were agreed on at negotiations.
61.       In the case of parastatals dependent on the government budget and
government ministries, the submission of credit applications would be the
responsibility of the MF. The MPED will be, in the normal course of
monitoring implementation of the RRP, responsible for expediting this
portion of the credit.
62.       Under the first two reconstruction credits, the Central Tender
Board played the lead role in all procurement matters. The CTB will remain
responsible for procurement financed through the Government budget. Its
staff will also be expected to continue providing advisory assistance on
procurement to private firms. To further strengthen the CTB the Government
would arrange to continue the Crown Agents technical assistance already in
place under the Second Reconstruction Credit, including a training program,
or arrange new technical assistance and training satisfactory to the
Association (Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.07). The Government
would also submit for IDA's review and comments, the terminal report of the
current Crown Agents technical assistance team at CTB and to implement
recommendations satisfactory to the Association (Development Credit
Agreement Section 4.08).
Allocation of the Proceeds of the Credit
63.       The credit would finance the following broad categories of
imports. To enable a broad spread among important and adequately



- 28 -
performing industrial sub-sectors, transport and social sector enterprises,
disbursements for each category of imports which was agreed to during
negotiations would be subject to the maximum amounts indicated below:
US$ million
Medicinal drugs and pharmaceutical products                  2.0
Road motor vehicles, other than passenger cars               4.0
Tires and tubes                                             3-(
Spare parts                                                 20.0
Lime, cement and fabricated construction materials          13.0
Office machines, stationery supplies and books               5.0
Precision instruments                                        1.'i
Packing materials                                            3.0
Raw and semi-processed materials for manufacture            11.5
Railroad equipment                                           2.0
V7ariations to the above would be made only with the Association's prior
agreement. Except for items costing less than $200,000, credit funds would
not be available for capital equipment (Development Credit Agreement,
Schedule 5.A.3 and B.5). Agricultural input requirements have been
provided for under the Agricultural Rehabilitation Credit and several other
external assistance agreements. The amounts indicated above are based on
recent window two sales and on disbursements under the First and Second
Reconstruction Credits. Import payments following this classification are
already being monitored by the BOU as part of the foreign exchange budget
procedure outlined earlier (paragraph 48). The BOU will also keep the
classification system under review.
Procurement and Disbursement
64.       Procurement under all public sector individual supply contracts
expected to exceed US$1 million would be subject to international
competitive bidding and in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement
under World Bank Loans and Credits". Goods to be procured by public sector
enterprises under contracts which cannot be bulked in packages estimated to
cost more than $1.0 million equivalent would be procured after competitive
bidding in accordance with CTB procedures which have been reviewed and
found satisfactory (Development Credit Agreement Schedule 4A, 4.B.1(b)).
ALl procurement by bona fide private sector firms will, in addition to
satisfying all normal local commercial regulations, require either three or
more quotations from reputable suppliers or other procedures acceptable to
the Association, such as repeats of earlier orders under tender
arrangements (Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 4.B.1(a)). Contracts
of less than US$20,000 will be ineligible under the Credit.
65.       Disbursements will be made for the total foreign costs of
eligible imports, against full documentation, including invoices paid by
the Bank of Uganda or the relevant commercial bank under existing foreign
exchange regulations. Imports under the proposed credit would be purchased
using the auction system and under regulations presently governing the



- 29 -
operation of window two. If the two exchange rates are not merged by the
time imports under this credit are to be purchased, they would be
transacted at the window two exchange rate (Development Credit Agreement,
Section 3.01(b)). A special account totalling approximately US$10 million
would be P-!vablished by the BOU for the proposed credit as a revolving
fund to facilitate disbursements (Development Credit Agreement, Section
2.02(b), Schedule 2). Up to $5.0 million equivalent of the credits would
be available to finance retroactively items that meet all of the eligible
criteria under the credit for which the Government had either provided
foreign exchange financing or had made financial commitments after
February 1, 1984 (Schedule l(c) of the Development Credit Agreement). All
local charges would be financed by the importer. The Bank of Uganda will
keep relevant records in such form and detail as shall be required by IDA
to determine the eligibility of goods and services financed under the
credit. These records will be submitted to IDA on a regular basis
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.05(a)).
Counterpart Funds
66.       Local currency counterpart funds generated by the sale of foreign
exchange provided by the proposed credit would be allocated to a special
government account at the Bank of Uganda set up for this purpose. The
Government would utilize the counterpart funds to finance recurrent or
capital costs of projects in the RRP (Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.03(b)).
Accounts, Audit and Evaluation
67.       The accounts to be maiLntained by the Bank of Uganda under the
proposed credit would be audited by auditors acceptable to the Association
and certified copies of the relevant audited accounts would be submitted to
the Association (Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.02(a) and (b)).
The MPED would monitor the use and economic effects of the credit
proceeds. In addition, not later than six months after completion of the
proposed program, the Government shall prepare and furnish to the
Association a completion report on the costs and benefits resulting from
the proposed credit (Development Credit Agreement Section 3.05 (c)).
Benefits and Risks
68.       The principal benefits expected from the proposed credit are that
credit resources would finance high priority imports in support of the
Government's efforts to complete economic recovery as outlined in the
Revised Recovery Programme by mid-1985. The proposed cr dit would finance
approximately 6% of the total import requirements and about 45% of esti-
mated demand for eligible imports during the period ending December 1985.
In the case of inputs for the industrial and transport sectors, the
proposed credit would contribute directly to increased availability of
basic goods and government revenue. The availability of basic goods would
act as incentives to agricultural producers as well as improve living
standards in both rural and urban areas. As in the past, this credit could
serve as a catalyst for additional cofinancing for Uganda.  In  onjunction
with the Government's economic and financial programs and possible further



- 30 -
support from the IMF, the proposed credit would support and consolidate the
process of policy and institutional reform in Uganda and lay the
foundations for longer-term growth and development.
69.       The principal risks facing the proposed credit are that security
conditions in Uganda could again deteriorate and that shortfalls in
financing could further reduce import levels and delay recovery. In 1984
and 1985, shortfalls in foreign exchange requirements could jeopardize
Uganda's progress in rationalizing its exchange regime and, given the
sensitivity of economic performance to the availability of recurrent
imports, seriously threaten the mDmentum of economic recovery. These risks
have been reduced by the Government's clear commitment to improving law and
order and to its economic and financial programs. The Government has
continued to respond positively to the concerns of the principal donors, as
svident at the recent Consultative Group meeting in January 1984. However,
further efforts are needed to increase program support and, if these are
unsuccessful, it will be necessary for IDA to consider further such
assistance.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
70.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
UJganda and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being
clistributed separately.
71.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
72.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR AN
IDA THIRD RECONSTRUCION CREDIT
Introduction
1.        Economic recoveiry in Uganda, which started in 1981 with positive
GDP growth for the first time since 1977, has since continued with a growth
rate of 6.1% recorded in 1982 and one of 5.3% anticipated in 1983. The
basis of this resumed growth has been a substantially improved agricultural
performance (first in the subsistence sector and lately in the monetary
sector) aided by the increase in industrial production, albeit from low
levels. Associated with this recovery has been a fall in the inflation
rate from 104% in the fiscal year 1980/81, through 76% in 1981/82, to a
current estimate of 30% p.a. Moreover, the current account deficit has
been reduced from US$170 million in 1981 to US$113 million in 1982 and the
overall deficit has also been reduced from US$118 milion to US$52 million.
Government's budgetary position has improved significantly, especially the
recurrent budget which was in surplus to the tune of U.Shs. 4.8 billion in
1982183, compared to a deficit of U.Shs. 9.2 billion two years before.
2.        This improved performance is attributable to the June 1981 Budget
measures, which were associated with the adoption of the first Government
Financial Programme supported by a stand-by arrangement with the IMF and a
greatly improved security situation. Policy revisions since have been
within the spirit of these! measures, which included:
- Substantial increases in agricultural producer
prices (and subsequent re-adjustments to maintain
incentives).
- A large discrete and subsequent continual
depreciation of the shilling until August 1982
(when, within the dual exchange rate, Window I has
been continually depreciated whilst the other rate
(Window II) has fluctuated in response to market
forces).
- A dismantling of price controls which attracted
goods back into normal market channels.
- Tax reforms, including the conversion of specific
duties to an ad valorem basis, which led to
remarkable increases in tax revenue.

ANNEX I V
Page 2 of 8
Subsequently, substantial external assistance was mobilized, both for
projects outlined in the Recovery Programme (produced in June 1982) and for
the balance of payments support/commodity aid. The latter, mainly from the
IMF and IDA was used to purchase inputs which have since been the source of
much greater agricultural production and industrial capacity utilization.
Government's Programme
3.        It is now essential to build on these foundations and so the
Government's programme will continue in accordance with its current
financial program and the Revised Recovery Programme 1982/84 which fully
incorporates and outlines project expenditures envisaged in the fiscal year
1984/85. Sustained efforts are now being made to mobilize external
assistance in line with the Revised Recovery Programme which was launched
on 19th November 1983 and formally presented to the Consu.itative Group in
January 1984. Efforts continue to be made to consolidate security and the
rule of law throughout the country.
4.        The Government has in the past secured from IDA two Reconstruc-
tion Credits (of US$95 million and US$70 million) and two Technical
Assistance Credits (of US$8 million and US$15 million) which have
strengthened its ability to absorb aid and implement projects; but the task
started is far from complete. Further support is needed to support the
Revised Recovery Programme. Therefore, a third reconstruction credit is
proposed. The objectives of this credit would be:
(a) to provide recurrent import needs for high priority productive
sectors;
(b) to support urgent policy and institutional reforms; and
(c) to improve the Government's budgetary situation by generating
counterpart resources.
5.        In order to continue with the process of institutional strength-
ening and policy reform embarked upon under the Second Credit and the
Financial Programmes, the Government intends to take certain specific
measures, identified below.
The Exchange Rate System
6.        The introduction of the float in June 1981 and later a dual
exchange rate in August 1982 -- the two Window system -- have virtually
eliminated the parallel market for convertible currencies and assisted in
absorbing the excessive liquidity that existed in the economy prior to the
introduction of these measures. The exchange rate at the first window,
which continues to be managed, has progressively been depreciating while
that at the second window, is determined by weekly auction. It is,
therefore, envisaged that in the near future the rates at the two windows
will merge. This will automatically remove the present dual exchange rate
system which implicity penalizes the two major exports (i.e. coffee and
cotton) still at window one and subsidizes window one imports (i.e. oil
products and IDA reconstruction imports.)

ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 8
Taxation
7.        Government, with the assistance of IMF, has conducted a study to
review the tax structure. The Government w:Lll take appropriate taxation
measures taking into account the recommendations of the study.
Agricultural Producer Prices
8.        An incentive oriented crop pricing policy has so far been
implemented by Government to improve production. Government has undertaken
to keep producer prices under constant review in consultation with IDA in
order to ensure that producer prices provide optimal returns to farmers and
are aligned more closely with world market prices. The Agricultural Policy
Committee Secretariat has now submitted studies which will strengthen the
basis for the determination of producer prices, and the Government will
discuss these with IDA before April 15, 1984.
Parastatal Organizations and Expropriated Properties
9.        There are around 120 parastatals in which public resources  have
been and continue to be dissipated by weak management. Ownership
uncertainties continue to prevent definitive action on these questions.
Government policy is to develop a mixed economy by divesting itself of most
of these parastatals, encouraging private local and foreign investment and
by restoring certain enterprises to their former owners in accordance with
the provisions of Expropriated Properties Act.
10.       To resolve ownership uncertainties and facilitate private capital
ancl credit, the Government enacted the Expropriated Properties Act in
1982. During 1983, numerous claims for restoration or compensation were
submitted in accordance with this legislation. On January 17, 1984,
Government announced the appointment of a Chairman and members of the
Verification Committee which will process individual claims. The
settlement of these claims will be a long process but the Government will
by June 30, 1984, establish a program and a timetable for this exercise,
including appropriate technical assistance proposals, in which priority
will be given to large and medium-scale agricultural enterprises. This
program will involve strengthening government capacity to: (a) evolve
modalities for settlement andl to ascertain net values of properties,
including their assets and liabilities after verification of ownership, and
(b) decide foreign and local private investment policy, including economic,
legal and financial aspects, and guidelines for negotiating joint ventures.
11.       Government has decided that companies taken over and made
parastatals by the military regime will be offered to the private sector or
established as joint ventures. Some will be retained in the public sector,
some will be disposed of by sale, while others will te wound up. The
categorization of these parastatals is at Annex I. In making these
decisions, Government took into account the following considerations, among
others:
(a) with respect to enterprises for retention (Annex IA), return
to UDC (Annex IB) or joint venture (Annex IC):



-- 45 -
ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 8
(i) strategic importance of the enterprise,
(ii) nature of the services they provide (utilities),
(iii) foreign exchange earning capacity and potential,
(iv) revenue generation to Government,
(v) inter-sectoral or inter-industry linkages,
(vi) insistence on or demand by former owners for joint
participation with Government where the industry concerned is
considered vital by Government;
(b) with respect to industries for divestiture to the private
sector (Annex ID):
(i) claims by previous owners for 100% repossession,
(ii) where, in the assessment of the Government, the
performance of an enterprise would be enhanced by private
ownership and management;
(c) with respect to industries for sale or winding up (Annex IE):
(i) Government has decided to wind up umbrella or holding
companies in order to save unnecessary overhead costs and
avoid disruptive interference in management,
(ii) where the enterprises are considered unviable, whether
under private or public ownership, and former owners are not
willing to repossess them;
Annex IF lists those bodies whose future status is still under review.
12.       In order to provide basic data for negotiations with private
interests over these enterprises as well as recommendations to the
Government on policy and organizational matters, a study financed by the
World Bank will be carried out. Specifically the study would investigate
key parastatals in regard to the current financial status, organizational
and management matters. The stucy will make recommendations on major areas
requiring action, for example:
(a) financial matters such as the basis for revaluing
fixed assets, updating accounts, etc.;
(b) organizational matters such as merging or demerging
of parastatals; economic matters such as the basis
for revising public service tariffs; and
(c) policy matters which might have impact on the
achievement of financial viability within a reasonable
time scale.
The consultant firm has been selected, and the first phase of the study is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1984. Within three months of this
date, the Government will have consulted with the Bank on the work program
for the second phase of the study, and, based on the study's preliminary
recommendations, will have prepared a mutually agreed action program for
the ten selected parastatals (listed in Annex IG).

13.       The Government has designated the Uganda Development Corporation
(UDC) as the principal organization to ass:Lst in the development
ofindustrial enterprises by restoring to UDC potentially viable enterprises
taken away by the military regime (notably, Nyanza Textiles, Uganda Grain
Milling and Hima Cement Industries).  The Government has further decided to
reorganize UDC as indicated in Annex 1B.
14.       The Government will take the following steps to ensure the
viability of those organizations remaining in the public sector:
(a) following consultation with IDA implement agreed
recommendations of the parast:atals study regarding
tariffs, organization and management;
(b) pursue the strengthening of Uganda Electricity
Board, Uganda Airlines Corporation, Uganda Railways
Corporation and Uganda Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation; and
(c) define the roles of the Coffee Marketing Board
(CMB), the Lint Marketing Board (LMB), the Uganda
Tea Authority (UTA) and the Produce Marketing Board
(PMB) in the context of crop marketing studies
being carried out under the World Bank financed
Agricultural Rehabilitation Credit. These studies
will be completed by the end of 1984.
Foreign Exchange and Debt Management
15.       With the expected merger of the two windows at a realistic ex-
change rate, the character of foreign exchange management is likely to
change, in order to avoid, as much as possible, administrative allocation
of foreign exchange. To ensure that a good basis for future decision
making on this exists, Government will maintain and improve its procedures
for monitoring the sources and uses of all available foreign exchange, and
will develop a system for monitoring the commitment, utilization and dis-
bursement of all external assistance, to be in force not later than
June 30, 1984.
16.       Owing to the fact: that the powers of controlling and management
of public finance as well as the raising of external loans are vested in
the Ministry of Finance (i.e. by the Constitution of the Republic of
Uganda, the Public Finance Act, the Externa:L Loan Act and the loans
(Guarantee Act)) the responsibility for aid co-ordination lies with the
Ministry of Finance. It is therefore, this Ministry which has the sole
authority of negotiating and committing the country in external financial
aid. To this end, a full fledged department headed by a person of Perma-
rent:Secretary rank has already been created in the Ministry of Finance to
deal with external aid co-cirdination. Thus the Aid Co-ordination
Department in the Ministry of Finance will basically perform the following
functions:



- 47 -
ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 8
(a) Negotiation and execution of external aid/loan agreements,
(b) Keeping records of all official aid/loans granted to Uganda,
(c)  Monitoring of disbursement of all aid/loans,
(d) Synchronizing external assistance with the Budget.
17.       The provisions of the External Loans Act are already being
strictly adhered to in that all public external debt commitments are now
subject to prior approval by the Minister of Finance.  The Government has
undertaken to strictly limit the contracting of new debt on non-
concessional terms, and in consu'Ltation with the World Bank, will devise
appropriate criteria and guidelines for external medium and short-term
borrowing by June 30, 1984. An external borrowing committee, responsible
for recommending approval of all external loans to the Minister of Finance,
will be established by June 30 1984,
18.       The Ministry of Planning and Economic Development is primarily
responsible for the formulation and management of recovery or development
plans and to ensure that the implementation of projects and programs goes
on smoothly. The Ministry is responsible for selection of projects in the
context of the Government's financial program and ensuring that projects
are designed at a scale and to a standard consistent with the overall
objectives of the plans. In consultation with the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Planning and Economic Development carries out periodic
programming discussions with donors and sector ministries to evaluate
project implementation, review projects and funding status. While
utilization of external aid is a responsibility of the individual
ministries, it is the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development that
will continue to bear the responsibility for monitoring implementation of
all externally funded projects as well as evaluating the impact of external
assistance on the economy.
19.       The need for strengthening aid administration through staffing,
training, technical assistance and the adoption of appropriate procedures
has been recognized. By April 30, 1984, the Government will document the
procedures, reporting formats and strengthening programs required for aid
administration, and circulate these to donors and sector ministries.
20.       External debt management has been significantly strengthened by
the establishment of the External Debt Management Office (EDMO) at the Bank
of Uganda. This Department will. be responsible for:
(a) assessing the terns and conditions of aid/loans and
advising the Ministry of Finance before the
agreements are signed;
(b) management of project accounts;
(c) monitoring, in conjunction with Ministry of
Finance, disbursement of aid/loans; and



- 48 -
ANNEX IV
Page 7 of 8
(d) assessing in liaison with the Ministry of Planning
and Econonic Development the impact of aid/loans on
the economy.
Planning and Finance
21.       Government has taken steps to strengthen the links between the
Recovery Programme, the development budget and the recurrent budget.  The
Revised Recovery Programme was prepared in parallel with the 1983/84
development budget and project selection favored those projects which had a
sustainable impact on the recurrent budget. In the future, the Government
initends to exclude from the development budget expenditures which do not
reLate to the Revised Recovery Programme or subsequently authorized
development plans. However, the Government expects that in the context of
monitoring and updating its plans and programs, new or modified projects of
high priority will be considered and, if consistent with the RRP strategy,
formally adopted by the Government after full consideration of the resource
implications. The Government further expects to reduce the incidence in
the development budget of locally funded ongoing projects which are not
directly in the RRP.
22.       There will be closer working level links between the Ministries
of Finance and Planning and Economic Development particularly on aid
coordination and budget preparation. A Monitoring Committee for the
firnancial program meets weekly. The interministerial committee on aid
coordination has been revived, and consultation will take place early in
the budget cycle to ensure that the two ministries have the same view of
resource availability and usage. MPED will be represented on the estimates
committee when development budget submissions are being reviewed, and will
approve the draft ministerial submissions for the development budget.
23.       In order to further strengthen MPED and in addition to measures
being taken under the UNDP p:Lanning assistance project, Government will
review the staffing of the M-Lnistry of Planni-ng and Economic Development,
and, where appropriate, recruit more staff and confirm officers where they
have performed adequately in an acting capacity by July 31, 1984. Several
proposals to further strengtlhen the ministry, including the creation of a
single professional head of the economic planning staff in the ministry
under the Permanent Secretary, and a rationalization and restructuring of
departments, are presently uider consideration by Government. The
Government expects to prepare a draft action program for further discussion
with the World Bank by June 30, 1984 and to implement a mutually
satisfactory program by September 30, 1984.
24.       Technical assistance for Treasury Office of Accounts to
strengthen government financial control will be in place by June 30, 1984.
25.       The Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance is
charged with the responsibility of handling work on parastatals.  Currently
the Department is divided into three divisions:
(a) Banking and Finance Division
(b) Economic Analysis Division



- 49 -
ANNEX IV
Page 8 of 8
(c) Statutory Corporation Division.
The parastatal work is being handled by the Statutory Corporation
Division. This Division will be strengthened with people of sound business
knowledge. A technical expert will be required to strengthen the Statutory
Corporation Division; terms of reference and recruitment proposals for this
expert will be prepared for consultation with the World Bank by May 31,
1984.
26.      Before September 1984, the Government will start preparation of a
program to succeed or roll over the Revised Recovery Program 1982-84.
Public Administration
27.       In order to improve the efficiency of Government and to permit
more meaningful salaries to be paid, Government will:
(a) not later than June 30, 1984 start a detailed
review of the function of Government institutions,
concentrating resources on essential ministries and
rationalizing their functions. Technical
assistance for this task has been designed and has
been submitted for World Bank financing. While
unable at this time to specify where and how such
concentration can be effected, Government notes
that this review may result in the restructuring of
some ministries and retrenchment of staff numbers;
(b) maintain a selective freeze on declared
vacancies by filling essential positions only
against savings elsewhere in the existing
establishment; and
(c) concentrate salary adjustments on those officials
with specific skill requirements.
Conclusion
28.       As stated in the Recovery Programme, the role of the public
service and public sector institutions generally is being carefully
re-examined. Resource contraints make it important to provide Government
services in the most cost-efficient way and to keep total expenditure on
such services within strict limits related to the performance of the
economy in general. Rehabilitation and development needs make it vital
that the public service and other public sector institutions should
function more effectively.
