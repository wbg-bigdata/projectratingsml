1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.     Context at Appraisal

Country and sector background: In the two years preceeding the project‟s approval, Ethiopia‟s
economic performance was characterised by strong and broad based growth. Following a
significant drought-induced contraction, Ethiopia‟s economy rebounded in 2003/04 with real
GDP growth of 11 percent which slowed slightly to 8.9 percent in 2004/05. This was primarily
underpinned by exceptional agricultural expansion (12.1 percent growth), but also by strong
performance in other sectors (6.6 percent in industrial production, and 5.8 percent in services).
Despite abundant natural resources and promising prospects for development, most of Ethiopia‟s
population continued to live in absolute poverty, often linked to environmental and natural
resource degradation. Following the May 2005 election, a broad consensus coalesced around the
need to to improve governance in the service of economic development. Central to this consensus
was the belief that a deeper understanding of the political economy could more effectively
channel development interventions, particularly with regard to how institutional governance
affects the economic sphere.

At the time of the project appraisal, the Ethiopian financial sector could be characterized as
nascent and plagued by many weaknesses. In 2005 the sector was dominated by the banking
sector, which accounted for about 94 percent of total financial sector assets. The insurance sector
(3 percent) and microfinance institutions (3 percent) accounted for the remaining financial sector
assets. The Ethiopian banking sector was comprised of one development bank (the Development
Bank of Ethiopia [DBE]), two state-owned commercial banks, and seven private commercial
banks. Private bank participation had increased gradually, accounting for 23.5 percent of
commercial banking assets in 2005, with the remainder shared by the two public sector
commercial banks. Focused primarily in the rural sector, a small but enterprising microfinance
industry was demonstrating strong expansion.1

Rationale for Bank assistance: A notable weakness underpinning poor performance in the
financial sector was the relative inablity of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) to fulfill its
mandate to effectively regulate and supervise the financial sector, undertake research, and
formulate and implement monetary policy. A second area of concern was the country‟s severely
underdeveloped financial sector infrastructure. The absence of a modern payment system, a
clearing and settlement infrastructure for bond market development, deficiencies in the credit
information system, and weaknesses in accounting and auditing, presented serious impediments
to financial sector development. A third constraint, limiting access to finance by many segments
of the economy, was the absence of a sufficiently diversified basket of financial products. A lack
of long-term instruments, such as bonds, had limited the development of infrastructure and
housing finance. Financial sector practitioners were generally characterised by a paucity of
technical expertise and professional skills, and the development of these skills was hampered by
inadequate and unsatisfactory in-country training facilities and ineffective professional
associations .

 In 2005, 23 microfinance institutions serviced approximately 1.5 million households. In the 2004/05 FY, the number
of clients grew by about 26 percent, while the volume of credit extended to clients grew by more than 50 percent. The
average credit to deposit ratio of MFIs stood at over 200 percent.




                                                         1
Building on the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2003-2005), the Interim Country Assistance
Strategy (ICAS 2006-2007) included a greater emphasis on protecting pro-growth institutional
capital, the need to strengthen institutional governance and accountability, and the imperative to
deepen dialogue between government, the private sector and civil society, while concurrently
improving the capacity of private sector and civil society organizations to effectively participate
in such dialogue. Moreover, the CAS highlighted the need to develop effective instruments to
build a financial sector, characterized by transparency, effective regulation and good governance,
with the capacity to more effectively and efficiently allocate resources to the private sector.

Following several years of limited engagement on financial sector issues, the Financial Sector
Capacity Building (FSCB) project was initiated in response to a direct request from the
Government of Ethiopia (GoE). The project, closely aligned with the ethos of the Interim CAS,
aimed to incrementally build the foundation of a financial sector that could deliver more efficient
and equitable access to finance. Given limited bilateral support for Ethiopian financial sector
development at the time of the appraisal, the Bank‟s comparative advantage related to its ability
to deploy a wide range of instruments in support of financial sector development (advisory
services, training, finance), drawing on global best-practice and lessons learned from other
countries and related Bank projects in Ethiopia. The project preparation included interaction and
coordination with other development partners in Ethiopia, including the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), African Development Bank (AfDB), the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) and Development Cooperation Ireland (DCI).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD), states the PDO as “[building] the foundation for a more
transparent, well-governed, well-regulated, and competitive financial sector that allocates
resources to the private sector more effectively and efficiently, and helps ensure better access to
finance for all?.

The Project‟s Financing Agreement (PFA) uses an almost identical wording; the only difference
being that at the end of the sentence it does not explicitly emphasize “better access to finance?,
just “better finance? for all. 2

The PAD specifies that the achievement of the PDO would be measured in terms of sustained
improvements in financial sector soundness and effectiveness, and improvements in access to
financial services. Key indicators selected to monitor progress were:

    1.        Reduction in commercial banks‟ non-performing loan (NPL) ratio from 20 percent in
              end FY05/06 to 10 percent by end FY08/09;
    2.        Increase in the ratio of financial sector assets to GDP from 126.7 percent in end
              FY05/06 to 131.1 percent by end FY08/09;
    3.        Increase in the private sector credit to GDP ratio from 20 percent in end FY 05/06 to
              24.8 percent by end FY 08/09

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The PDO and key indicators were not revised during implementation.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

The PDO does not identify a specific group of beneficiaries. The rationale at the time of drafting
was that the project would benefit the economy as a whole through increased transparency,
governance, regulation and competition in the financial sector, and, contingently, improve access
to finance for the private sector and other segments of the economy that were underserved or
entirely excluded from formal financial sector participation.

However, the framing of the project‟s components implied the identification of a specific group
of direct beneficiaries, specifically: the NBE, the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MoFED) and the industry associations such as the Bankers‟ Association and
Insurers Association. All these beneficiaries sit on the Project Steering Committee, established for
the purpose of project oversight and to ensure coordination among the different activities and
beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components (according to OPCS guidelines)

The PAD outlined four broad project components summarized. Each component is summarized
including by first providing the rationale for the component, and then a brief description of the
component‟s intended intervention.

A)      National Bank of Ethiopia Capacity Building: The NBE was hampered by limited
capacity, and was unable to effectively discharge its key regulatory and supervisory functions
with regard to financial intermediaries, has insufficient capacity to undertake economic research,
and to formulate and implement monetary policy. In recognition of this shortcoming, NBE
commissioned a Comprehensive Restructuring Study, undertaken by an independent consulting
firm, KPMG. Following the completion of the study, NBE published a Strategic Plan Document
in October 2004 detailing a strategy and action plan to strengthen NBE‟s organization, operations
and capacity over a five-year time horizon. The objective of the Strategic Plan was to begin the
process of transforming NBE into a modern central bank, capable of effectively performing its
functions and delivering on its core mandates.

This component was primarily intended to strengthen the human and institutional capacity of
NBE, through interventions to: (i) improve banking regulation and supervision; (ii) strengthen
insurance regulation and supervision; and (iii) strengthen economic research, policy formulation
and implementation. Critical to sustaining capacity built through the project, complementary
support was intended to be provided to strengthen the NBE‟s Internal Audit, Finance, Legal and
IT departments, and in human resource management and bank modernization, to improve
performance measurement and management.

B)      Strengthening Financial Sector Infrastructure: The stability and development of financial
systems depend to a large extent on the quality of the financial sector infrastructure available to
support the operations of financial intermediaries and markets.

This component was intended to strengthen Ethiopia‟s financial sector infrastructure, through the
provision of financial and technical assistance in the following areas: (i) payment system


                                                 3
modernization; (ii) improving the credit information center; (iii) developing capital markets
infrastructure; and (iv) setting up an asset/collateral registry to facilitate secured loan transactions.
The project‟s support to enhance these four elements intended to lay the basis for significant
improvements in access to financial services.

C)       Developing New Financial Products: The Ethiopian financial system was
overwhelmingly dominated by a handful of banking institutions, limiting the range of available
financial saving vehicles, in turn demarcating bank deposits as the primary form of financial
savings.

The project aimed to promote greater financial diversity in Ethiopia by actively supporting the
development of new financial instruments and products considered to be critical in improving
access to finance and to foster the development of a more equitable and accessible financial
sector. Five complementary and mutually reinforcing sub-components were identified for
financial and technical assistance: (i) housing finance; (ii) leasing finance; (iii) SME finance; (iv)
agricultural risk insurance; and (v) other products including venture capital fund and credit cards.

D)      Enhancing Professional Skills in the Financial Sector: Ethiopia lacked the human capital
required for sustainable financial development, specifically suitably qualified financial sector
professionals (bankers, insurers, leasing experts, mortgage specialists, securities specialists, etc).

This component focused on the expansion and skilling-up of the cohort of qualified financial
professionals through the development of in-country training capacity, as well as helping to
strengthen the capacity of financial sector professional associations to enable them to more
effectively fulfill their role in building the sector. Specific interventions were envisioned to: (i)
strengthen the Ethiopian Institute of Banking and Insurance (EIBI); (ii) introduce certification
programs for financial sector professionals; (iii) strengthen financial sector professional
associations; and (iv) provide for the training of financial sector professionals in banking,
insurance and microfinance.

1.6 Revised Components

The PDO and key indicators were not revised during implementation. However, the third
component of the project (Developing New Financial Products) was dropped entirely following
changes to the funding environment in 2008 (details provided below).

1.7 Other significant changes

The project went through two significant adjustments:

(i)     The 2008 food crisis resulted in project funding being cut by 47 percent.

        In 2008 Ethiopia faced a food crisis that was broader, deeper and more complex than that
        experienced in almost any other country. Despite five years of double digit economic
        growth, the economy had failed to address long-standing and pervasive problems
        associated with food insecurity, and the country remained extremely vulnerable to
        external shocks. In 2008 the confluence of high inflation, a widening trade deficit, severe
        drought and local food shortages imposed severe hardship on the country, significantly
        impacting the livelihoods of the most vulnerable segments of the population. The World
        Bank, in partnership with the GoE, initiated an emergency operation under the auspices
        of the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), focusing on the needs of


                                                   4
           chronically food insecure households, while working to ensure that recent gains in crop
           production were sustained, with the ultimate objective of re-establishing food security by
           2009. The GFRP was financed from a combination of new IDA grant resources as well as
           redeployment of existing IDA commitments. These included twelve on-going projects in
           the Ethiopia‟s IDA portfolio totaling US$137.5 million (of which about US$15.0 million
           was grant and US$122.5 credit)3. An amount equal to SDR 4.5 million (US$ 7 million
           equivalent) was redeployed from the Financial Sector Capacity Building Project,
           corresponding to a 47 percent reduction in committed funds. Despite the substantial
           reduction, the Bank project team still considered the PDO achievable as the redeployment
           of funds had not necessitated the cancellation of any of the original components.4 Table 1
           presents a summary of the four Project‟s components and changes affected following the
           budget cut.

(ii)       The closing date was extended three times for a cumulative period of 27 months:

          First extension: Twelve months, from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010: The initial
           deadline for project effectiveness was postponed to December 31, 2006 (from November
           5, 2006) to enable the GoE to meet all outstanding conditions of effectiveness. Moreover,
           as a consequence of unclear institutional responsibility for some of the components and
           concerns expressed by the Project Coordination Committee (PCC) with regard to a lack
           of in-house technical capacity to prepare Expressions of Interest (EOI) and Terms of
           Reference (TOR), planned implementation was delayed from the outset. Implementation
           supervision missions conducted in April and November 2008 warned that in light of
           delays in the commencement of implementation and the short implementation life
           assigned to the project, it was unlikely that all activities would be completed in line with
           the envisioned project closing date of June 2009. While the analytical work concluded by
           June 2009 could have fed legal and policy reforms in view of a potential Development
           Policy Lending (DPL) intervention, there was still a substantial capacity building agenda
           to be completed, requiring an extension of the original closing date by twelve months.
           This was granted on June 2009 by the Country Director.

          Second extension: Eleven months, from June 30, 2010 to May 31, 2011: in March 2010,
           the GoE requested additional financing and an extension of the closing date of the project
           by two additional years to allow for the successful completion of the activities excluded
           from the project following the reallocation of Ethiopia‟s IDA funds for the food crisis in
           2008. However the World Bank considered that, given the circumstances, additional
           financing was not justified and agreed only to an extension of the project closing date by
           eleven months to allow for the successful installation and completion of the National
           Payments System (NPS) and the Credit Information Bureau (CIS) in addition to several
           other smaller consultancy assignments. It was believed that the additional extension

  Prior to the food crisis, the Ethiopia IDA portfolio consisted of 28 projects with a commitment of US$2.7 billion and
about US$1.8 billion in undisbursed balances. The average age of the portfolio was about three years. The
Government‟s proposal of redeploying IDA resources from twelve ongoing projects/programs accounted for about 7
percent of the undisbursed balance of the portfolio (see EPP of the Emergency Food Crisis Response Program (Report
No. 46658-ET), dated Nov 25, 2008 for details).
4
  The Bank team expected that the redeployed monies would be refunded to the project at a later stage, constituting
another reason why the PDO was not modified. While there are no official records of a formal commitment to refund
the money, this expectation was confirmed by team members working on other projects whose funding envelopes were
affected by the Ethiopian food crisis.


                                                          5
             would enable the project to fully disburse the funds earmarked for these components and
             achieve its development objectives.

            Third extension: Four months, from May 31, 2011 to September 30, 2011: By May 2011,
             Despite the successful completion of several consultancy assignments and the training of
             NBE staff (particularly in insurance and banking supervision), the implementation of the
             Credit Information Center (CIC) had been delayed due to several technical considerations.
             Because the CIS and NPS required a shared infrastructure to share data with banks and
             microfinance institutions, failures to deliver the required hardware, the development of
             critical software, and connectivity of the CIC with the National Payments infrastructure
             further affected implementation. These factors required a third extension to the project‟s
             closing date by four additional months.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis, lessons incorporated and rationale

The assessment of the constraints of the financial sector undertaken by the project team was
limited due to a lack of relevant analytical work and the background analysis could not draw on
an extensive track record of successful interventions specific to the Ethiopian financial sector.
However, it is noted that lessons learned from previous operations in other environments were
effectively utilized in tailoring the project design, and the overall rationale for the Bank‟s
intervention was clear.

The project was initiated following several years of limited engagement on financial sector issues
and was intended to represent the first step in a continuum of longer-term engagement with the
GoE on financial sector development. This explains the incremental approach to the design of the
components of the project as it was intended to lay the foundation for future substantive policy
reform. In light of the serious weaknesses evident in the client‟s capacity to make informed
choices or to implement financial reforms, the project team decided to focus initially on
strengthening the capacity of stakeholders to the financial system (NBE, the Ethiopian Institute of
Banking and Insurance [EIBI5], and other financial sector professional associations), kick-start
the development of new financial products, and strengthen critical financial sector infrastructure -
specifically payments and credit information systems, capital markets infrastructure and an asset
registry – with intended system-wide benefits.

Project design

The PAD was relevant for the country and responsive to the borrower‟s circumstances and
development priorities. It emphasized the importance of putting in place the foundations of
financial sector development as a precondition to establishing a financial sector capable of
achieving the goal of access to finance for all and, over the medium- to long-term,
complementing and sustaining pro-poor growth. In light of the specific country context, the PDO
may have been over-ambitious in framing a substantive impact on the four themes of financial
sector transparency, good-governance, regulation and competition. A more focused PDO could
have been more appropriate, and more likely to be effectively implemented.

Despite the complexity of the PDO, the project team tried to keep the project design relatively
simple with four mutually reinforcing components aimed at addressing the lack of adequate
capacity within the NBE to fulfill its role as the main supervisory and regulatory institution,
infrastructure constraints, diversification of financial products, and the enhancement of local
professional skills (see Table 2. below).

This project represented the first instance of the NBE fulfilling the role of implementing agency
in a World Bank‟s project. Drawing on previous Bank experience in building client ownership
and commitment, the project design incorporated a demand-driven identification of capacity
building priorities, and the design methodology encouraged beneficiaries to identify and provide
detailed inputs into the selection of specific activities. In designing strategies and an action plan


5
 The Ethiopian Institute of Banking and Insurance (EIBI) was subsequently renamed as Ethiopian Institute of Financial
Studies (EIFS).


                                                         7
to strengthen NBE‟s organization, operations and capacity, particular attention was paid to
aligning the project with the NBE‟s existing Business Process Re-engineering and the Strategic
Plan Document, released in October 2004.

However, the design also incorporated several shortcomings: the project was originally designed
with an unrealistically short implementation period (i.e. 3 years), far too limited for its ambitious
objectives. Eventually the project was extended for a cumulative 27 months. The project‟s design
was also extremely demanding in terms of number of consultants required to implement the
various components and subcomponents. A lack of relevant expertise and knowledge of
procurement practices, particularly in developing TOR for selecting consultants, suggests that the
design would have benefitted from a more conservative approach, trying to reduce as much as
possible the actual number of consulting services needed. Difficulty in attracting qualified
consultants willing to reside in the country contributed to delays in overall implementation.
Moreover, the design required a high level of government commitment as well as close
collaboration between different public and private institutions: despite the initial intention of
incremental implementation, the complexity of including sensitive areas like monetary policy and
capital markets proved to be quite challenging. Another major weakness of the design phase is
related to the choice of the M&E indicators and their baseline values, which will be addressed in
the next sections.

Government’s commitment

The PDO required strong and continuous commitment on the part of the GoE and implementing
agencies, to effectively implement ambitious changes in financial infrastructure and to address
weaknesses in technical capacity across the system as a whole. The involvement, interest and
commitment of the GoE seemed to be high through the design of the project. However as
obstacles and delays emerged through project implementation GoE commitment waned.
Following the redeployment of funds in response to the 2008 food crisis, a culture characterized
as “highly cautious and conservative [on the part] of the regulatory authority… resistant to
change? was highlighted in official documents as a significant factor contributing to delays in


                                                                    8
project implementation.6 Through the life of the project the GoE displayed selective commitment:
there were areas in which the GoE‟s interest was high and important achievements were reached
(e.g. financial infrastructure, banking and insurance supervision), and other areas where the
appetite for reform and policy change was less evident (e.g. capital markets development and
monetary policy). This may explain the GoE‟s reluctance to conduct a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), as well as resistance towards proposals to implement policy
reforms to liberalize the financial sector by opening it to external investors.

Assessment of risks

The Bank team identified some important risks to the project and its implementation. The PAD
specifically highlighted the potential for a “deterioration in [the] governance environment
resulting in calls for suspension of the project? and “Government‟s readiness to tackle effectively
financial sector reform issues?. However, in hindsight, the rating of both risks as “Moderate?
proved to be too optimistic. While the redeployment of funds necessitated by the food crisis came
unexpectedly, and at the time of appraisal that risk was rightly rated as moderate, the GoE‟s
selective attitude towards financial sector reforms was a known fact and the risk rating failed to
take this into account. Appropriately the project team identified as “Substantial? the risk of NBE
not retaining skilled staff. High staff turnover in the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and the
regular departure of key trained staff from the NBE represented a severe problem throughout
implementation, as well as for the sustainability of the project‟s achievements. More appropriate
mitigation measures, including the introduction of adjustments to salary and benefit scales of
NBE staff, should have been incorporated at the stage of project design.

2.2 Implementation

The implementation of the Project faced significant challenges: some were attributable to factors
beyond the project‟s control, while others, linked to procurement procedures and to weakness in
capacity on the part of the client and beneficiaries, could have been more effectively predicted
and addressed. Three main entities responsible for implementation were clearly outlined in the
original PAD, under the overall operational responsibility of the project implementing agency, the
NBE:

           (i) The PIU composed by a Project Officer, a Procurement officer, a Finance/Accounts
               Officer and an administrative assistant.

           (ii) The PIU reported to a Project Coordination Committee (PCC), responsible for project
                implementation. The PCC consisted of senior representatives from relevant units
                within NBE, with the support of a small secretariat whose secretary would have been
                the PIU‟s Project Officer.

           (iii) The PCC, in turn, reported to a high-level Steering Committee (SC), established to
                 ensure effective coordination among different beneficiaries and to guide the smooth
                 operation of the project.

A mid-term review scheduled for end-October 2007 was also included in the implementation
arrangements.

                                                         9
In general, the implementation structure described in the PAD was quite straightforward, with a
PIU primarily having an administrative role while technical leadership was envisioned to fall
under the PCC, and overall coordination and guidance being the responsibility of the SC. With
reference to the implementation arrangements described in the PAD, PIU members were
supposed to “be assigned to the appropriate functional units within NBE and be supervised by
their unit heads?.7 This arrangement was meant to mitigate the risk to the independence of the
PIU and preempt potential coordination difficulties as a consequence of PIU members being
mapped to different units. In practice this did not happen, and the PIU was established as a
separate unit, coordinated by one project manager.

As a consequence of the PIU being established as a stand-alone unit, delays were experienced
immediately due to a lack of clarity with regard to leadership and responsibility for the various
components and subcomponents of the project. This was compounded by inadequately defined
responsibility for the preparation of TOR and evaluation of outputs. Poor technical capacity on
the part of most PCC members caused delays in the preparation of requests for EOI and TOR.
Given the projects dependence on significant advisory and consultancy services delays in the
preparation of EOI and TOR represented a major obstacle to timely implementation.8 Having
achieved marginally satisfactory performance in terms of drafting TORs and securing consulting
services, implementation delays were experienced in overseeing and ensuring effective
fulfillment of consultant and contractor deliverables.

It is clear in reviewing the supervision reports that the SC was not effective in fulfilling the
mandate extended to it through the project‟s design. Problems associated with a lack of leadership
and institutional coordination should have been identified and addressed immediately by the SC.
In April, 2008, a year and a half following the commencement of the project, the PIU was
regularly going beyond its administrative functions, and was unduly involved in aspects of the
implementation process. Poor technical leadership and expertise to ensure the effective
implementation of components within departments of the NBE led to significant delays in
implementation activities. Inexperience in fulfilling WB procurement processes, limited
procurement capacity within the PIU, and difficulties associated with attracting competent
consultants, all contributed to delays in implementation. Significantly, no mid-term review was
conducted in 2007 as envisioned by the PAD, and no review was conducted in 2008 when major
implementation issues began to arise.

In assessing overall implementation, a number of opportunities to ensure more effective
implementation were missed: The food crisis that necessitated a 47 percent reduction in funding
to the project represents a significant turning point in the implementation schedule. While this
eventuality was completely beyond the control of the project and its leadership, the implications
for redefining priorities and implementation arrangements were under-appreciated. The crisis
itself cannot be considered a justification for the delays experienced in implementation, as the
risk of disengagement on the part of the GoE had been taken into account at the time of appraisal.
An opportunity was missed in assessing the extent to which it was considered sufficient to
redefine priorities without changing implementation arrangements and the PDO (as it happened),
or if the circumstances required a more thorough re-consideration of the PDO (e.g. by making it
more modest) as well as revisiting and reforming the role and composition of PCC and SC.
Ultimately, the PIU continued to fulfill responsibilities to which it was unsuited, surpassing the

administrative role envisioned, while concurrently experiencing serious challenges in fulfilling its
core responsibilities due to a high turnover of staff.

In the early stages of the project, confusion was also generated by the opportunity to utilize
technical assistance, staff and resources of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
implementing project components and the preparation of TOR for activities in which the Fund
had expertise: monetary policy, banking supervision and payments systems modernization.
Concerns were raised by NBE regarding potential duplication of Bank and Fund activities, and
the administrative implications for partnering with the Fund on the NBE‟s procurement
responsibilities with the World Bank. It was agreed that, with the consent of the NBE, that the
IMF would take the lead in providing technical assistance for drafting TOR for the three
components. However, this never happened, contributing to further implementation delays.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

In analyzing the M&E framework, a distinction will be made between the M&E design, by
looking at both appropriateness of the chosen indicators and their measurability, and its
implementation.

M&E design

The Bank team chose to measure the achievement of the PDO by looking at the soundness (using
as a proxy a measure of the reduction in commercial banks‟ NPL ratio), effectiveness (increase in
the ratio of financial sector assets to GDP) and accessibility (increase in the private sector credit
to GDP ratio) dimensions of the financial sector. An M&E framework of this kind is quite weak
and open to criticism due to the presence of heterogeneity: it is not easy to attribute results for
these three indicators directly (or solely) to the project. Moreover, these indicators provide an
assessment of medium-term impacts and are not appropriate for measuring the immediate impact
of a project at its closing date.

In line with the PDO, the choice of the outcome indicators was too ambitious. Valid alternatives
to these indicators could have been identified; for example through analyzing the increase in
coverage of the credit information center; an increase in the range of financial products available
on the market through the launch of pilot projects on housing financing, SME financing or
agricultural insurance; and the number and the amount of transactions processed through the
national payment system, etc. In addition, the component-specific intermediate outcome
indicators were not helpful in evaluating PDO objectives such as regulation, competition,
transparency and governance. The intermediate result indicators chosen for each component are
summarized in Table 3. While some appeared broadly appropriate and measurable (e.g. the
achievement of components 2, 3 and 4 seemed consistent with the proposed indicators and their
relatively straightforward measurability), others had to be revised following the first
implementation mission. In particular, some baseline indicators chosen for component 1 were
modified as those contained in the approved PAD were considered too qualitative and difficult to
monitor.9




9
 The baseline for indicator 1a (Table 3) changed from “Partial compliance with Basel core principles? to “80 percent
compliance of Basel core principles implemented by NBE?; the baseline for indicator 1b changed from “Partial
compliance with Basel core principles? to 90-day on-site inspection process and 75 day off-site analysis process.
However, these changes were not formalized in a project restructuring document.


                                                        11
Following the funding cut, it would have been prudent to substantially revise the M&E
framework in order to reflect the new priorities. Unfortunately this was not done and targets were
not updated to take into account the three extensions of the project‟s closing date.

M&E implementation

Weak and irregular implementation of M&E is a major shortcoming of the project. Several issues
articulated in the project‟s Implementation Status Reports (ISR) and supervision reports confirm
this impression: a critical failure noted in this regard was the absence of a dedicated M&E officer
within the PIU. 10 Moreover, the report of the first implementation mission, recommended the
revision of the economic research indicators (reported as indicators 1c, 1d, and 1e in the table
above) to ensure the accurate measurement of improvements against measurable baseline
indicators. While this is a shortcoming attributable to design rather than to implementation, the
staff of the NBE research department were supposed to review and develop measurable indicators
to address this identified concern. The recommendation was not implemented and consequently
these indicators were never collected, preventing accurate analysis.

Baseline values (as showed in the next section) were inaccurate and misleading. Following initial
compliance with M&E collection requirements, the data became increasingly poor and
inconsistent, with no new data collected since September 2009 (i.e. two years before the final
project closing date). For some indicators (e.g. indicators 1a and 1b), the scale of measurement
changed without notice or explanation from quantitative (i.e. 80 percent or 90 percent) to
qualitative (i.e. “partial?), making it nearly impossible to reach any meaningful conclusions. In
sum, the impression is that the M&E framework represents a major weakness for this project. Far
more effort was concentrated on implementing the different components to the detriment of
effective M&E for measuring the achievements of the results.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards (N/A)

As the project primarily aimed at providing technical and financial support to the GoE in
improving the financial sector, it was rated as a “Category C? project, requiring no safeguard
policies.

Financial management (Satisfactory)11

Throughout the life of the project good financial management systems were maintained.
Counterpart funds were not required due the Country Financing Parameters at the time the project
was designed and agreed. Generally, the project complied fully with the requisite financial
covenants outlined in its legal agreement, including the submission of quarterly Interim Financial
Reports (IFRs) and annual audits. The financial management risk ratings were averagely rated
Moderate. Owing to this risk rating, the project was supervised by conducting field visits at least
once annually (excluding quarterly IFR reviews, annual audit reviews and normal implementation
supports). The FM supervision missions focused on the areas of budgeting, accounting, fund flow,
internal control, financial reporting and external audit. Initially dispersal of funds from the Bank
to the project was slow but this improved towards the end of the project. Out of the SDR 10.3.3
million signed for the IDA portion, about SDR 4.5 million was cancelled due to overall portfolio
restructuring, but the remainder amount of SDR 5.8 million was fully disbursed. The project at
the close had USD 68,733.36 that was refunded to the Bank in February 27, 2012. The project
will have no “lapsed loans?.

Procurement management (Moderately Satisfactory)

The project required the procurement of two large information technology systems (CIS and
NPS), as well as the procurement of office supplies and the selection of many consultancy
services. The bulk of project procurement was executed using the international competitive
bidding and IC selection methods. The implementing agency, NBE, had never managed Bank
procurement and, as a result, procurement was initially very slow, and required significant
technical support. Ultimately the NBE has acquired considerable expertise in procurement
processes and succeeded to complete all planned procurement activities.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

No transition arrangements to post-completion operation have been established or agreed. The
NBE continues to face challenges arising from unsustainably high levels of staff turnover. Of
particular concern is the departure of key staff trained through the project, making any possible
transition arrangement all the more challenging.

However, in light of the achievements of the project, a follow-up action by the Bank would be
recommended to preserve and strengthen the outcomes achieved. The project effectively laid the
foundations for financial sector development and further strengthening of NBE capacity will be
required to fully implement most of the studies and recommendations prepared by the various
consultants in the first phase of the project. From a technical perspective, the effective

implementation of the infrastructure component constituted a critical first step towards the
modernization of Ethiopia‟s NPS and CIS, but further upgrading will be required to complete the
transition to a modern and efficient system.12

Components and subcomponents dropped from this project 13 due to the funding contraction
should be implemented, especially in light of their fundamental role in promoting better access to
financial services - critical dimension that the first phase of the project did not achieve in full.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Moderately Satisfactory)

The PDO of achieving a more transparent, well-governed, more efficiently regulated and
competitive financial sector was, and remains, a significant development priority for Ethiopia.
Improved transparency, governance, competition and regulation are necessary to the effective
functioning of a modern financial sector that is able to guarantee equitable access to financial
services for all, and one that is able to allocate resources efficiently and effectively in the service
of economic development.

The current CAS (2008-2011) was structured to support Ethiopia in sustaining high levels of
investment in key areas (both physical and human capital as well as institutional capacity
building), while addressing priority policy issues to maximize the impact of such spending.14 The
GoE has launched a new five-year plan (2010/11-2014/15), the Growth and Transformation Plan
(GTP), which envisions a major leap forward in improving the structure of the economy. The
GTP explicitly addresses the need to mobilize domestic resources to fund investments and growth,
and the Bank‟s new CAS is being prepared in line with priorities identified through the GTP. A
solid financial sector continues to represent a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for
facilitating the mobilization of domestic resources.

The PDO was effectively reflected in the scope of the project design, and is incorporated into the
four key components and major thematic areas (i.e. transparency, governance, regulation and
competition). The design remained relevant following the re-prioritization necessitated by the cut
in available funding.15 However the design suffered from an unrealistic time-frame of three years.



12
  With regard to the NPS, following the successful implementation of a real time gross settlement (RTGS) and
automatic clearing house (ACH), the following additions should be implemented: a Central Security Depository (CSD),
and the introduction of a central switch for the clearing and settlement of retail transactions, and in support of the
oversight function and payment risk management framework. With regard to the CIS, it will be crucial to raise public
awareness of the importance and uses of the credit reporting system, and on building the capabilities of financial sector
operators in using the credit bureau.

financing, leasing, housing finance, agricultural weather based insurance, venture capital funds.


14
     “Improving financial sector performance? was specifically mentioned as a core CAS Outcome.

15
  The decision to drop component 3 in light of the food crisis was appropriate. Despite the component‟s relevance, the
successful implementation of introducing new financial products require some pre-conditions to be in place, namely
adequate capacity on the part of the central bank to supervise and regulate the banking and insurance domains, and the


                                                          14
Serial delays in implementation, and a radically altered funding environment necessitated three
interventions that extended the intended life of the project by an additional 27 months. Project
design similarly over-estimated the technical knowledge of the implementing agency regarding
procurement procedures as well as effective definition of TOR.

The Bank‟s implementation assistance was responsive to changing needs and was effective in
supporting the country and Bank development objectives. The reduction in the size of the project
led to a re-arrangement of priorities, and the elimination of certain components. This made it
possible to achieve key components of the project and contributed to the maintenance and
relevance of objectives and design. However, the contingent opportunity to revisit and tailor an
ambitious PDO in light of new, and significantly changed, circumstances was not pursued, to the
detriment of overall effectiveness.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Moderately Satisfactory)

In order to substantiate this rating, the achievement of the original outcome indicators will be
initially discussed. Alternate evidence will also be provided in order to show that, despite
difficulties arising as a consequence of the substantial funding cut and changing country context,
key components were achieved in line with relevant objectives, and provided some important
results.

An examination of the outcome indicators contained in the original results framework shows that
only one (i.e. commercial banks‟ NPL ratio) of three indicators was effectively achieved, while
one of the other two (i.e. ratio of financial sector assets to GDP) was based on misleading
baseline and target indicators. However, the outcome assessment deserves a more in depth
assessment based on alternate evidence. Against this background the project has been able to
achieve key results in each of the four main thematic areas of the PDO: governance, regulation,
transparency and competition.

As mentioned in the previous section, the outcome indicators chosen in the original M&E
framework to measure soundness, effectiveness and accessibility of the financial sector are
questionable and, even if achieved, do not adequately solve the question of attribution. Table 4
presents the three outcome indicators together with their original baseline and target values.

There are three major difficulties in measuring the achievement of the project based on the
original M&E framework for the three outcome indicators:

          (i) Target values had not been updated despite the 27 month extension to the project,
                making it difficult to compare the closing date figures with any target values;
          (ii) The baseline figure collected for the ratio of financial sector assets to GDP during the
                ICR mission differs substantially from the original baseline figure reported in the PAD;
                however it is more realistic, considering that the indicator compares the size of the
                financial sector to the national GDP and the figure at the numerator is expected to be
                smaller than the one at the denominator16; and
          (iii) The measurement date (2005/06) reported for the baseline values in the PAD is
                misleading: it suggests the end of the fiscal year, but the baseline figure reported for the
                NPLs ratio is likely to reflect the June 2005 value (which was equal to 20.06 percent)
                rather than the June 2006 value (which was 14.01 percent).

To reconcile the actual figures collected during the ICR mission with the original targets figures
established in the PAD, the trends for the three indicators have been re-estimated, based on the
revised baselines:



       Table 6 – Outcome indicators (re-estimated trends based on the actual baseline figures
                                collected during the ICR mission)

  The definition of financial sector used to calculate the ratio of financial sector assets to GDP is in line with the
description contained on para. 5 of the PAD, where the financial sector is described as the sum of the Development
Bank of Ethiopia + commercial banks + insurance companies + MFIs. Even assuming the inclusion of NBE assets
(without reserve requirements of financial institutions to avoid double counting), the ratio of financial sector assets to
GDP would be below the baseline values reported in the PAD (as shown below):
                                     2005/2006     2006/2007        2007/2008        2008/2009      2009/2010       2010/2011
     FS Assets (including NBE)/GDP      71%           65%              53%              47%            52%             59%




                                                                  16
Against this background a number of considerations can be formulated in terms of achievements:
The NPL ratio has decreased substantially. Even by comparing its actual value to the (re-
estimated) 2008/2009 target, the figure was below the expected target. After further investigation,
this improvement was largely due to action plans that banks adopted following an NBE directive
and the impact of close monitoring.17 While NPLs were already declining prior to project
implementation through efforts to foreclose, restructure and/or write-off of bad loans, a partial
attribution of the merits of this improvement may owe to the improved capacity of the NBE in
banking supervision (discussed later).18

In assessing the final two indicators, trends relative to nominal GDP in the years spanning
2005/06 to 2010/11 (Table 5) do not allow for clear interpretation due to the fact that, apart from
2009/2010, nominal GDP was growing faster than both financial sector assets and credit
extension to the private sector. Nevertheless, looking at their absolute values and translating them
into real terms, both financial sector assets and credit provision to private sector have grown at an
average annual rate of 6 percent and 4 percent respectively. Table 7, below, reports the absolute
values, both in nominal and real terms, of financial sector assets and of credit to the private sector,
together with the nominal and real GDP.

   Based on explanations obtained from presidents and top managers of Ethiopian banks, the action plan they
implemented consisted mainly of loan classifications. NPLs were restructured and payments were negotiated with
defaulters. When this plan was advertised, some defaulters started settling their balances. The banks also used
foreclosure through the selling the collaterals to settle outstanding balances. A legal reform facilitated the collection of
loans contested in court cases. Ultimately, some outstanding loans were written off.
18
   The data collected for this indicator in the ISRs, from 2007 onwards, specify the exclusion of the DBE. In order to
clarify the interpretation of this indicator, it was discussed with the banking supervision department and the Vice-
Governor for financial institution supervision during the ICR mission. It was explained that DBE was never included in
the group of commercial banks as a consequence of it being considered a development bank that does not collect
deposits. Hence, the NPL ratio time series presented in Table 5 excludes DBE. It is not clear why this was specified
during the data collection for the M&E framework, given that the baseline value referred only to commercial banks as
confirmed on footnote 3 in the PAD.

In interpreting the achievement of the PDO, by connecting outputs to outcomes via the results
chain, and the effectiveness of the project, it is important to consider the wording of the PDO
itself.

The PDO can be divided into two main components:

      (i) The first focuses on building the foundations of a better system (“to build the foundation
          for a more transparent, well-governed, well-regulated, and competitive financial sector?)

      (ii) The second focuses on the actual functioning of the system built on those foundations
           (“that allocates resources to the private sector more effectively and efficiently, and helps
           ensure better access to finance for all?).

Both parts are inter-related, with the first being a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for
achieving the second. The project appears to have effectively achieved the first part of the PDO,
whereas for the second component more time is required to assess the impact of the project on the
financial system as a whole. This is underlined by the fact that important infrastructure items such
as the NPS and the CIS have only recently been launched suggesting that the second part of the
PDO may yet be achieved. 19 Taking into account the impact of the funding cut and the
challenging overall policy environment, alternate measures can be provided to show substantive
achievement of relevant objectives.

The presentation of the main project results is divided according to the key thematic areas
contained in the PDO: governance, regulation, transparency and competition. Detailed
descriptions of the deliverables and achievements related to each component are then contained in
Annex 2.

(i)       Governance: Improvements in the governance of the financial sector have been achieved
          through the implementation of components 1 and 4 of the project. Under component 1
          relevant consultancies in the areas of monetary policy, macroeconomic modeling,
          liquidity forecasting, balance of payments, internal audit and HR management were
          effectively completed with the following evident results:

              o   Liquidity forecasting: Prior to the implementation of the project there was no
                  effective forecasting framework in place. Following implementation, weekly
                  liquidity forecasting is published as a matter of course;

              o   Monetary policy: Policy formulation moved from a position whereby the NBE
                  employed no nominal anchor, to the anchoring of reserve money in line with an
                  operational target following project implementation;

              o   Balance of payments statistics reached a partial migration from Balance of
                  Payments Manual (BPM) 4 to BPM 5, improving their alignment with
                  international standards;

              o    Macroeconomic modeling: A model tailored on the country specificity has been
                   designed and delivered together with relevant training for NBE research staff.

              o    Internal audit: This key corporate governance function benefitted from the
                   introduction of a new manual on internal audit and the implementation of a risk-
                   based auditing methodology.

              o    HR management: New HR policies, procedures, strategies, career development
                   plans and incentive mechanisms have been prepared through the course of
                   project implementation, in line with the NBE‟s Business Re-engineering Process.
                   Currently NBE is revising its salary and benefit package in line with
                   recommendations provided by a consultant retained by the project.

(ii)     Regulation: Improvements in the regulatory environment were achieved through the
         redrafting of frameworks for banking supervision and regulation, and for insurance
         supervision and regulation.

             Efficiency gains are demonstrated in the reduction of working days needed for onsite
              and off-site supervision of both insurance companies and banks.
              - The five months previously needed for onsite banking supervision was reduced
                  to 31 working days, and off-site supervision reduced from one month to five
                  working days;
              - Onsite insurance supervision was reduced from almost six months to 31 working
                  days, and off-site supervision from one month to 15 working days;

              Moreover, in both banking and supervision departments the shift from a rule based
              supervision to a risk-based supervision system has been implemented.

             New proclamations and NBE directives have been issued (or are in the process of
              being issued) in relation to some of the projects‟ achievements:
              - NBE Directive for the Establishment and Operation of Credit Reference Bureau
                  (CRB/01/2012);
              - National Proclamation to Provide for a National Payment System (No.
                  718/2011);
              - (draft) NBE Directive on oversight of operation and management of payment
                  systems and of issuance and management of payment instruments;
              - (draft) Regulation of the Council of Ministers on the Establishment of a National
                  Payment System Council
              - (draft) National Proclamation on Insurance Supervision20

(iii)    Transparency: Effective gains in transparency were achieved through the upgrading of
         the CIS. A new credit bureau, equipped with a sophisticated technology platform is now
         able to provide more accurate and extensive credit information to lending institutions.
         This allows lenders to initiate higher quality credit decision-making, and has effectively
         lowered the default rate: lowering non performing loans (NPLs) and increasing lending
         volumes for good borrowers. Improvements to the CIS are captured in Table 10.

  Several draft directives have been prepared by the consultant on insurance that are awaiting ratification through the
passing of new legislation expected within the next 2-3 months.

(iv)       Competition: the NPS modernization project21, through the introduction of the Ethiopian
           Automated Transfer System (EATS), allows for Real Time Gross Settlements (RTGS)
           for large value payments and Automated Clearing House (ACH) for retail payments. The
           new payment system platform is considered a safe, secure and efficient payment and
           settlement infrastructure that reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services with
           potentially significant implication for national economic development.22 EATS was only
           launched on May 2011 but the efficiency gains captured in Table 11. have already been

  Global Payment Systems Survey (2008) shows global large value payments processed in a year are equivalent to
more than 50 times global GDP. RTGS systems have shown growth in total amounts settled (86 percent between 2002
and 2006) but also allowed for a safe and efficient processing (82 percent of the value of total payments).

The decision to completely drop component 3 (new financial products) as well as the
establishment of a national asset/collateral registry under component 2 due to the budget cut of
2008 23 represents an important limitation to the full satisfactory achievement of the PDO,
especially with regard to improving competition and transparency, as well as in extending access
to financial services. Housing finance, SME finance, leasing and agricultural risk insurance were
all dropped, representing important milestones foregone in increasing access to formal financial
services and achieving effective financial inclusion.24

3.3 Efficiency (Satisfactory)

No net present value or economic rate of return was provided in the PAD. As a consequence the
rating choice will be based on an analysis of the component cost breakdown provided in Annex 1.

The project focused primarily on capacity building and improving payment and credit
information technology systems, making it is difficult to estimate an economic rate of return.
Further, there are no data allowing for a valid comparison between payment systems or credit
information bureaus, given that costs would vary depending on the context and on the number of
technical specifications included.

Following the funding cut of $ 7 million undertaken by the Government in 2008, the new total
budget fell from $15.00 million to $9.18 million.25 This required a reallocation of budget per
component, prioritizing those components that had already commenced implementation and the
dropping of those whose implementation process had yet to be started. By comparing the actual
costs with the estimates of the budget reallocation, the disbursement results appear to be
satisfactory, showing total actual spending of 99 percent of the amended allocation. The
satisfactory rating for project efficiency derives from the consideration of the substantial benefits
that the project achieved despite the 47 percent contraction to the original budget.

In spite of implementation delays, mainly due to procurement procedures, IDA project funds
were fully disbursed by the project‟s closing date. 26 Accurate and judicious utilization of
resources based on the re-prioritization, meant that the project was able to effectively implement
and upgrade two key financial components of the NPS and of the CIS. Concurrently, substantial
gains in capacity have been enhanced or built within NBE: new tools for the formulation of


23
  The choice of dropping these components/subcomponents was based on the fact that, by the time the budget cut
occurred, due to difficulties in the procurement process, no consultancies for these subcomponents had been initiated.
24
   The IFC is providing technical support on the credit information system and contributing to expedite the
implementation of the project. A series of discussions were made at bureau and NBE vice-governor level about future
support of IFC in CIS areas with regard to developing a road map, bureau ownership structure setup, legal framework,
and public awareness on the benefit of credit information for credit market development. The IFC has also prepared a
proposal for setting up a collateral registry that would be useful for the credit information system. However, these
discussions are yet to be finalized, and are not supported by official documentation.
25
  The $ 0.62 mill from NBE reported in Annex 1 is an in-kind contribution of NBE. There is no fund allocation. The
types of NBE‟s contribution are explained in the Borrowers‟ Report in Annex 7. The difference between $8.00 mill (i.e.
=15 – 7) and the $9.18 mill of the new total amount is due to exchange rate gains from SDR.

26
  The three successive extensions to the project‟s original closing date allowed for the project to fully and efficiently
disburse its funding.

monetary policy (e.g. weekly liquidity forecasting, macro-economic modeling etc); improvements
in banking and insurance supervision (e.g. from rule-based to risk-based supervision and
consequent efficiency gains in the number of days required for onsite and offsite surveillance);
and recapacitating and improving core competencies such as internal audit and HR management.
Finally improvements to the training capacity of the Ethiopian Institute of Financial Studies also
have to be taken into account.

In addition to the improvement in the number of days used for banking and insurance supervision,
efficiency gains are evident in the use of the EATS. Launched only in July 2011, the first six
months of operations of EATS marked a clear year-on-year improvement in the number of Real
Time Gross Settlements (RTGS) messages processed and the gross value of RTGS transactions:

The comparison of the actual project costs with the estimates at appraisal leads to a more cautious
interpretation. The actual cost of component 2 (financial sector infrastructure) was 42 percent
higher than the original estimate. It was decided to transfer more resources to this component,
given its complexity and comparative importance in fulfilling project objectives. A substantial
revision occurred to the CIS sub-component, as the upgrading of the system and the procurement
of a turnkey solution turned out to be more expensive than estimated at the appraisal. However
this is counterbalanced by the substantial efficiency gained through component 1 where, despite a
funding adjustment from $3.79 million to $1.96 million, key objectives originally planned were
effectively achieved.

In light of the project‟s heavy reliance on consultants, it is important to consider that efficiency
was affected not only by monetary costs but also by substantial transactions costs accrued through
the length of time required to fulfill procurement processes, and the low capacity and knowledge
within the NBE for executing procurement procedures. As confirmed by the procurement
assessment, after initial delays, all procedures were conducted in the most efficient way.
Alternative procurement methods (e.g. procuring a single firm covering all the different aspects
related to implementation of the infrastructure) had been initially considered but the World Bank
advised NBE to avoid the single firm option because it was believed technical expertise and
consultancy service quality could be better serviced if individual consultants were deployed.27



27
   A meaningful comparison with the costs of a single firm providing all the services related to the installation of a
national payment system is not possible. Similarly, such an exercise is impossible with regard to the cost of a single
firm installing the credit information system. In this case, the issue relates to an inability to benchmark costs. Prices for
an effective credit information bureau, run from 150K to 3-4M depending on the functionality requested, security


                                                             24
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (Moderately Satisfactory)

This takes into account the relevance of objectives, design and implementation, rated moderately
satisfactory, the achievement of the project development objectives, rated moderately satisfactory,
and the project efficiency that was rated satisfactory. The overall rating is not in line with the one
provided in the latest ISRs as a consequence of the cut in available funding inevitably
compromising the full achievement of the original PDO. Moreover, the inadequacy of the M&E
framework posed additional challenges in terms of results measurement and the attribution of
impact.

Notwithstanding these considerations, the project still managed to reach important achievements
in terms of NBE capacity building (e.g. in the areas of monetary policy, liquidity forecasting,
macroeconomic modeling, banking and insurance regulation and supervision, internal audit and
HR management), of financial sector infrastructure (e.g. full upgrade of the credit information
center and launch of the RTGS platform of the National Payments System) and of enhancing
professional skills in the financial sector (e.g. by developing new training materials and course for
the EIFS). All this was achieved despite significant environmental challenges, the absence of
complementary reforms to the financial sector, and in a context characterized by a substantial and
unexpected cut in available funding that necessitated the redefining of priorities. Hence, though
moderately satisfactory, the overall rating remains above the line.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The poverty impact of the project is difficult to assess. The project aimed to improve access to
finance on the part of the private sector, inclusive of low-income households and other sectors
underserved or excluded from formal economic activity. No social impact study was conducted at
the time of appraisal making it impossible to measure the poverty impact of the project against
any pre-defined dimension. The participation of MFIs in the NPS and CIS, as well as the
improved capacity of the NBE in banking supervision, no doubt would contribute to increasing
access to these types of financial intermediaries (and in turn of their specific low-income type of
clientele) and, in turn, access to the benefits of a better regulated and transparent financial sector.
The dropping of the component intended to support the development of new financial products
probably reduced the potential poverty impact of the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Important investments in building the capacity of the NBE in the areas of supervision, research,
statistics and policy implementation, as well as on the fundamental functions of internal audit and
human resources management, have contributed to the institutional strengthening of the main
supervisory and regulatory authority in the financial sector. These achievements however require
timely follow-up in order to guarantee the sustainability of the institutional changes.




enhancements, licenses for oracle or other in additions to the bureau, hosting costs if any, the nature of management
contracts (revenue share or not), and other technical specifications such as encryption and backup sites (live or not).




                                                         25
Infrastructure-related improvements brought about through the implementation of the project will
similarly require careful follow-up and upgrades, where necessary, to sustain the benefits derived
from their introduction to the financial system.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A Stakeholder Workshop convening representatives from the banking, insurance and MFI sectors
was organized during the February 2012 ICR mission. The aim of the discussion was to gain a
clearer understanding of how the capacity building of NBE, the enhanced financial infrastructure
and the increased training capacity of the EIFS had been perceived by stakeholders in the
financial sector. The workshop also provided an opportunity for assessing feedback relating to
potential follow-up interventions.

Participants recognized the importance of the transition towards the realization of a modern
system based on increasing connections and opportunities. However this transition is gradual and
as yet incomplete. In particular, with reference to the financial sector infrastructure it was
highlighted how Ethiopia is penalized due to the lack of an effective connectivity system, and
financial institutions will continue to require capacity building assistance in order to effectively
access and utilize the new system. The effectiveness of the role of NBE as a supervisor in the
banking and insurance sector was criticized by financial institutions who do not yet see the
benefits and improvements implicit in the shift from rule-based supervision to risk-based
supervision. Realization of these improvements will require more time and enhanced skills.
Annex 6 presents a detailed summary of the issues raised during the workshop and the
participants‟ recommendations for any future follow up in building financial sector capacity.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Moderate)

The risk to the maintenance of development outcomes is Moderate. The project‟s main
accomplishments are in the areas of capacity building, regulation, financial infrastructure and
professional development. Three types of risks could impact the sustainability of these
achievements:

    (i) A lack of commitment from the GoE to follow up on the recommendations received
        through capacity building, and a failure to maintain momentum in building a modern
        financial sector.

    (ii) Risks related to technological advances and maintenance of the current technological
         solutions provided for the financial infrastructure.

    (iii) Risks to the overall political and economic environment.

In order to maintain the benefits accrued through the course of the project it is imperative that the
GoE is fully committed to ongoing reform and improving system-wide efficiencies and
accessibility.

Despite delays attributable to selective commitment on the part of the GoE towards project
components, project implementation significantly improved through the final phase of
implementation suggesting the risk of lack of Government commitment to be moderate. Capacity
building activities also initiated under the auspices of the project have also contributed to building
previously missing technical expertise at the NBE that had caused to delays in implementation.


                                                 26
Investment in the NPS as well as in the CIS can only be sustained with enhanced capacity in
managing and maintaining these systems, as well as through follow-up investments to keep
software updated and, possibly, extend functionality. In the absence of these important
infrastructural investments, systems can quickly become obsolete. This risk is considered
moderate.

With regard to the global and country specific economic and political considerations, economic
policy predictability may prove volatile due to over-ambitious and expensive GoE infrastructural
spending. Double digit inflation, leading to persistent fiscal deficits, coupled with gradual
currency depreciation will need to be offset by substantial real GDP growth (forecasted above
7percent until 2016).28 Overall the likelihood of this risk materializing is also moderate, while its
potential impact on the need for financial sector reform might be significant.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Moderately Unsatisfactory)

The project was designed through a participatory approach incorporating inputs from a range of
stakeholders, while trying to take into account needs and priorities in a country-driven manner.
The objective of establishing the foundations of a well functioning financial system were highly
relevant at the commencement of the operation. However, several shortcomings affected the
overall quality of Bank performance. The lack of analytical evidence and experience with regard
to the financial sector in Ethiopia limited the Bank team‟s ability to base the design on analysis of
the critical issues faced by the financial sector. The project would have benefitted from more
resources being invested in the collection of relevant information and baseline data on which to
build the design. Nevertheless, the team covered all the key aspects to fulfill broad development
objectives and the necessary attention was paid to balancing capacity building activities with
regulatory needs, infrastructural gaps and the forward looking part of new product development.

Similarly, significant attention was paid to the fiduciary framework and to risk assessment.
However the project would have benefitted from a more careful consideration of the risks
associated with of lack of in-country technical capacity and of the GoE‟s readiness and appetite to
tackle reform issues. The choice of the results indicators was questionable and this became a
major weakness of the project, making it impossible to effectively track project progress and to
attribute outcomes. The inaccuracy of the baseline values and targets contributed to making
monitoring difficult. An additional weakness was the unrealistic implementation horizon of three
years given the complexities of the project under review. In sum, due to the presence of
significant shortcomings, the quality at entry of the Bank team‟s ability in identifying, preparing
and appraising the operation in order to be able to achieve the stated development objectives was
unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision (Moderately Unsatisfactory)

Supervision was conducted regularly with approximately two missions per year. Over the course
of the project‟s life there have been three different TTLs and, while this did not translate into any
significant discontinuity in dialogue with the GoE, the consistency of Bank‟s interventions was
affected. In general supervision missions were adequately structured with the right mix of skills
to effectively provide guidance.

Aide Memoires from supervision missions indicate that supervision teams had a clear
appreciation of the issues and were able to provide practical recommendations on how to move
forward. However a number of deficiencies inevitably impacted the overall quality of Bank
supervision:

     (i)       The team disproportionately concentrated effort in ensuring that procurement
               processes were proceeding well. More attention should have been paid to the M&E
               framework, by assigning a dedicated M&E officer to the staff of the PIU and by
               making sure that at the completion of each supervision mission the framework was
               suitably updated. The M&E framework should have been revised and targets should
               have been updated in line with the three extensions to the project‟s closing date.

     (ii)      The lack of an official mid-term review, originally planned in the PAD, contributed
               to missed opportunities to revisit and implement changes to the project that could
               have helped keep the project on track for a fully satisfactory rating.

     (iii)     In light of the changes required in the wake of the funding cut of 2008, it would have
               been useful to clearly explain how the funding was to be reallocated to the remaining
               components. Subsequent ISRs continued to present budget allocation to components
               as if the budget cut had never been implemented29.
     (iv)      The Bank team had to face several issues due to the GoE‟s lack of engagement and
               selective interest in pursuing reform. Still this does not fully explain some of the
               inconsistencies contained in AMs and ISRs regarding recommendations for project‟s
               extension or conclusion.30
     (v)       Finally, while Component 3 was dropped in 2008, it was still rated in the ISR of June
               2009 (as MU) and in the ISR of March 2011 (as U); the only time on which it was
               officially rated as “dropped? was in the ISR of October 2010.31

Due to these significant weaknesses, the quality of supervision was moderately unsatisfactory: the
team, which was competent and dedicated, was overly concentrated on overcoming
implementation obstacles related to the GoE‟s lack of commitment. As a consequence insufficient
attention was paid to monitoring of the project, to the detriment of its success.


29
   It appears that as a consequence of the Operations Portal considering the project closed at the end of 2009
(corresponding to the original closing date), two missions were conducted on January and July 2010 without a the
completion of filing of an ISR in the system. This proved is particularly unfortunate with reference to the update of
M&E indicators; the last of which occurred on September 2009, despite the Project closing two years later.
30
   For example, in January 2010 the supervision mission recommended no further extensions beyond June 2010,
recommending instead preparation for a new financial sector development project, as this was seen as the only way to
complete current reform activities. By the subsequent implementation mission, in July 2010, the project had already
been extended for additional 11 months without the AM referring to the previous recommendation for a new financial
sector development project, and no indication as to why this idea was discarded.
31
   Due to a suspect glitch in the Operations Portal, the last ISR (i.e. ISR No 9 compiled on March 2011) could not be
correctly filed in the system before the project closing date and was therefore officially archived only in January 2012.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance (Moderately Unsatisfactory)

This rating is derived by combining the moderately unsatisfactory rating assigned at the quality at
entry (section 5.1(a)) and the moderately unsatisfactory rating assigned to the quality of
supervision (section 5.1 (b)). Although the overall rating of the project is in the satisfactory range,
the overall Bank performance attributed to the project in line with the Operations Policy and
Country Services (OPCS) guidelines is moderately unsatisfactory.

The project has been implemented within an environment characterized by intermittent
government support for financial sector reform, unexpected delays and a significant cut in
resources. Despite these challenges, the project delivered important achievements in building the
foundations for a more accessible and efficient financial sector, in turn opening space for further
engagement and follow-up. The technical expertise of the Bank team allowed for the continuation
of the project under difficult circumstances, and relevant adjustment to priorities in response to
external shocks, but the highlighted shortcomings in the design and implementation phase were
severe drawbacks that undermined the overall quality of Bank performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance (Moderately Unsatisfactory)

Government‟s support and ownership were important at the project preparation stage. Moreover
the subsequent three requests from the GoE for extending the project‟s closing date signaled
interest and appreciation of the project‟s activities. This is also confirmed by the Government
report in Annex 7. However the impact of the severe food crisis of 2008 negatively affected
Government‟s support for the project, and the decision to cut a substantial portion of the
originally assigned funding inevitably compromised the project‟s ability to achieve all of the
original objectives. 32 Concerns over Government commitment are evident in ISRs and
supervision reports, where, on more than one occasion, the World Bank‟s Country Director
suggested the need for a high level retreat involving the NBE governor and other senior policy
makers to confirm the existence of a shared vision for reform and to agree on a road map for
achieving results. The selective attitude of the GoE in supporting full implementation of
components represented a major shortcoming of the project, and translated into implementation
problems and delays. Unfortunately, the project‟s SC proved to be ineffective in performing its
coordinating role as confirmed by numerous delays, especially in the initial stages of the project‟s
implementation. A lack of coordination and clear technical leadership among the different
implementation stakeholders significantly postponed the commencement of necessary
procurement procedures.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance (Moderately Satisfactory)

A PIU composed of full time project staff showed high commitment to achieving development
objectives. Especially during the initial phases of the project, the PIU assumed implementation
responsibilities beyond its original mandate in an attempt to ensure that no abnormal delays



32
   In the ISR of December 2008, progress towards the achievement of the PDO was rated “Unsatisfactory? due to
substantial delays in the commencement of implementation. This was in turn a consequence of the need to process a
large number of consultancies and the decision on the part of the government to reallocate funds from this project to
address high food and fuel import costs.


                                                        29
occurred due to the lack of coordination and technical expertise. The PIU was coordinated by the
same project officer for the entire duration of the project, guaranteeing stability and continuity
through the life of the project. The protracted absence of a technical lead, forced the PIU to
assume leadership of various components in addition to their administrative tasks, leading to
unnecessary delays. The failure to update the M&E framework, due in part to the absence of a
dedicated M&E officer within the PIU, negatively affected the monitoring and evaluation of
activities especially during the second part of the project. Retaining qualified staff represented a
chronic challenge to the PIU, with substantial staff turnover contributing to implementation
delays.

However, books were kept in order and the project managed to disburse 99.3percent of the
assigned funds. Given the extremely high number of advisory and consultancy services procured
and the implementation of relevant infrastructure, all made possible by the dedication of the PIU
staff and its manager, the performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance (Moderately Satisfactory)

This rating is derived by combining the moderately unsatisfactory rating of Government
performance with the moderately satisfactory rating of the implementing agency. In light of the
overall outcome rating being located in the satisfactory range, the overall borrower performance
rating is moderately satisfactory. It is worth specifying that selective Government‟s commitment,
highlighted above, does not negatively reflect on the highly professional and dedicated work
performed by the PIU.

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons learned through this project reflect both general lessons and recommendations to be
applied to all projects as well as some more specific ones for projects having highly technical
components.

a)      Projects need to be simple with a focused PDO. This project was premised on an
        overly ambitious PDO. The inclusion of outcome indicators whose measurement created
        severe problems of attribution in project impact significantly complicated the assessment
        of outcomes. PDOs must be both relevant and achievable, and must incorporate well-
        defined and measurable baseline data and indicators, and reinforce a coherently
        structured M&E framework.

b)      Local capacity needs to be accurately assessed. The implementing agency (NBE) had
        no prior experience in implementing Bank projects. A lack of technical expertise and
        experience with regard to procurement procedures led to substantial implementation
        delays. In technically complex projects, the capacity of the implementing agency to
        effectively implement procurement (and/or financial management) must be accurately
        assessed prior to the commencement of the project and should be included as an
        effectiveness condition.

c)      Project handover between TTLs needs smooth facilitation. This project had three
        different TTLs over the course of its life, and the transition from one TTL to another,
        inevitably impacted the consistency of Bank‟s intervention. The lesson that can be
        derived is that transition between TTLs must be reduced to a minimum and, where
        handover is unavoidable the Bank should ensure sufficient overlapping time to avoid



                                                30
     major discontinuities in the dialogue with counterparts and in the overall consistency of
     Bank interventions.

d)   The M&E framework needs to be properly designed and implemented. This project
     suffered from the inadequacy of the M&E framework, both in terms of excessively broad
     outcome indicators and in terms of inaccurate baseline and target values. The M&E
     framework should be properly designed and should be considered a fundamental point of
     reference throughout the project‟s lifetime.

e)   Appropriate restructuring actions should be considered when major parts of a
     project are cancelled. This project, for different reasons, was not restructured following
     the cut in the available funding and the consequent dropping of a major component. Early
     restructuring has the potential to mitigate the potential for implementation delays, and
     allow for the achievement of objectives that accurately reflect changed circumstances.

f)   The implementation structure needs to cover all functions necessary for smooth
     project implementation. The PIU did not include a full time M&E officer leading to
     extremely poor management of the M&E framework, and a failure to assist project
     implementation by measuring effectiveness against stated objectives. Implementing units
     and agencies must be appropriately staffed with the right mix of competences and key
     functions.

g)   Government’s commitment and ownership require a careful assessment ex ante.
     Throughout the course of this project the Government was extremely selective in backing
     interventions. This led to inefficient use of resources (e.g. capital markets), that could
     have probably been better used for other interventions. A careful and candid assessment
     of Government‟s commitment during the project‟s design phase should take into account
     contingency measures for resources that, rightly or not, are known to be of limited
     interest and importance for the Government.

h)   Counterpart’s staff turnover needs to be considered a major risk especially in
     capacity building projects. Many key staff of the central bank trained through this
     program as well as most of the PIU members left the central bank and moved to more
     attractive jobs in part as a direct consequence of skills acquired through their
     participation in project implementation. This represents a fundamental risk to the
     sustainability of the results of the project‟s interventions. Measures need to be taken, at
     the project design stage, to discuss proper incentives and conditions to ensure staff
     retention and/or training of new staff.

i)   Payment systems and credit information systems are technically complex and
     require adequate time to implement. Due to the highly technical content of these
     interventions, delays were experienced not only due to the lack of knowledge of
     procurement, but also due to lack of technical knowledge in expressing and evaluating
     the specifications needed for each system. Such projects require highly dedicated Bank
     and Government teams with specialized skills to ensure effective support and supervision
     phases of technical implementation.

j)   The project timelines need to be realistic. This project was initially designed with a
     three-year horizon, despite its technical complexity, leading to three extensions adding 27
     months to the life of the project. A more realistic timeframe could have avoided lengthy
     and inefficient procedures for repeatedly negotiating new closing dates.

                                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: NBE capacity building - Moderately satisfactory. This component aimed at
strengthening the human and institutional capacity of the National Bank of Ethiopia in the areas
of:

             research and monetary policy formulation and liquidity forecasting,
             banking and insurance regulation and supervision,
             internal audit,
             human resource management, and
             Information Technology,

Contracts with international consultants (consulting firms and/or individual consultants) were
executed and the consultants provided the following advisory services for different directorates of
the National Bank of Ethiopia:

         a)     Monetary policy and liquidity forecasting
         b)     Balance of payments statistics
         c)     Macro-economic modeling
         d)     Developing framework for banking supervision and regulation
         e)     Developing framework for insurance supervision and regulation
         f)     Strengthening internal audit of NBE
         g)     Development of human resources management

Below a detailed description of the achievements under each of these subcomponents is reported.

    a) Monetary Policy and Liquidity Forecasting

Achievement rated moderately satisfactory. Global Insight (USA) in association with DIW-Berlin
(Germany) has provided the consultancy services on monetary policy and liquidity forecasting.
According to the review of current conduct of monetary policy in Ethiopia the consultant came to
the conclusion that government borrowing from the NBE drives the monetary base that the
money multiplier (hence broad money) and velocity are unstable and that therefore hitting the
intermediate target of broad money and the ultimate objective of monetary policy, namely the
target growth of nominal Gross Domestic Products (GDP) growth, is a matter of chance.
Therefore, the tool arsenal of the NBE needs to be enriched with additional, so-called indirect
instruments.

The main indirect instruments are open market operations and central bank intervention rates
including discount facilities. The discount facility is an instrument for exceptional liquidity needs
of the banking sector. In recent times the Ethiopian banking sector carried large excess liquidity
and therefore the discount window was not and could not have been operative. Open market
operations, the main indirect tool, used widely in advanced and emerging countries, need
however a market for securities. It does not need a highly developed securities market but it does
need a liquid market for government securities. If Ethiopia aims to set up open market operations
it would have to modify the ways the government conducts its borrowing. Therefore, the study of
the consultants goes beyond the question of how indirect instruments can help in the conduct of
monetary policy and proposes ways to overcome the present market constraints.




                                                 33
The consultants proposed the monetary policy formulation approaches for final policy objectives,
intermediate targets and policy instruments. They developed a framework for the conduct of
monetary policy in Ethiopia based on their research work in the areas of the targets of monetary
policy and they recommended open market operations with short-term high-quality securities in
the payments and settlement systems.

Compared to the way monetary policy and liquidity forecasting was conducted before the project
implementation and after the project implementation, the following changes have been
recognized:

       NBE moved from the lack of a liquidity forecasting framework to the production of
        weekly liquidity forecasting
       In terms of monetary policy, it moved from no nominal anchor to anchoring reserve
        money as operational target;

The serious concern is linked to the staff turnover: the 3 staff members trained under this
subcomponent have all left NBE. Moreover, being a policy-sensitive area, not all consultant‟s
recommendations have been followed and implemented, especially concerning the need for open
market operations

    b) Balance of Payments

Achievement rated moderately satisfactory.
The consultant for this subcomponent provided consultancy service as a resident advisor for six
months to counsel the Balance of Payments and International Economic Conditions Follow up
Directorate of NBE on collection and compilation of the balance of payments (BOP) statistics.

The main objective of the consultancy service was to build the techniques needed for establishing
a comprehensive and standardized balance of payments statistics in line with BPM5. Accordingly,
the consultant performed the following main tasks in relation to upgrading BOPs statistics
compilation system:

       Identify problems in the current BOPs statistics compilation system in terms of quality,
        disaggregation, coverage and methods of compilation,
       Devise a strategy to collect and compile BOPs data according to BPM5 requirements,
       Review and redesign survey formats for all components of the BOP items and design a
        standardized reporting format for commercial banks,
       Provide training to NBE concerned staff and BOP data stakeholders,
       Conduct baseline surveys to acquire the necessary data for the compilation of BOPs
        statistics in line with BPM5,
       Establish automation for BOPs statistics compilation in line with the BPM5,
       Introduce a system of backward revision of the BOPs data in line with the BPM5,
       Design and produce monthly progress reports on the implementation of tasks and
        problems encountered.

The consultant compiled and analyzed the data and made recommendations; trained NBE staffs in
data compilation; and conducted workshops for different participants from governmental, non-
governmental and private organizations. However, the technical assistance faced a challenge in




                                              34
establishing contact with surveyed enterprises such as FDI, hotels, tour operators and travel
agencies due to lack of up-to-date and the right addresses of these companies.

    c) Macroeconomic Modelling

Achievement rated moderately satisfactory.
The international consultant hired for this sub-component reviewed the current economic data
base and designed structural set up of the macro-economic model.

The objectives of the consultancy services were:

       Extending and improving the current macro-econometric model for the Ethiopian
        economy, so that it can serve as an effective tool for forecasting and policy analysis.
       Laying out a clear framework for updating and reviewing the model so that, when needed,
        it can be adapted to a rapidly changing economy and in response to changing
        circumstances in the international environment.
       Establishing procedures to ensure that forecasting and policy analysis are conducted in an
        orderly and systematic fashion, and that these activities serve the ultimate goal of
        effective policy making.
       Training the research staff from the NBE to enable them to build a macro-econometric
        model, and to enhance their understanding of how the model works and how it can be
        modified, so that they can have it as a tool to support their policy and forecasting
        activities.

The consultant established procedures for organizing, collecting and describing data and prepared
structure for simulation of different policy variables. The consultant also trained NBE staff
members on estimation, simulation and forecasting using relevant software like E-views and
Winsolve as well as in use of the model to run simulations and how to use the model for
forecasting and policy analysis. However, the staff turnover was a big challenge to apply the
knowledge transferred from the consultant.

    d) Framework for Banking Supervision and Regulation

Achievement rated satisfactory.                                             IOS
Partners Inc (USA) provided consultancy service for developing a framework for banking
regulation and supervision in the following areas:

       International Financial Reporting Standards for financial institutions and Internal
        Auditing Guidelines.
       A national deposit insurance program, and
       IT based banking supervision.

The objectives of the consultancy service were:

       To assess accounting, auditing and reporting practice in Ethiopia and recommend
        appropriate standards and draft implementation guidelines;
       To conduct a comprehensive assessment on creation and implementation of deposit
        insurance and drafting related regulation and recommendation on how it will be
        established and operate;


                                                  35
       Introduce IT based supervision for NBE;
       Training NBE staff in the above areas of expertise and proposing future training on the
        basis of needs assessment.

The consultants drafted transition guidelines which will assist in adoption of IFRS; drafted
external audit related frameworks; drafted deposit insurance scheme legal framework and
recommended appropriate IT solutions that will assist IT based supervision. Also valuable
trainings were provided to Bank Supervision Directorate staff, other relevant directorate of the
NBE and representatives of banks. Exposure visits to Malaysia, India and Ghana were also
conducted for key NBE staff.

Important knowledge was acquired on basic concepts and the way of applying IFRS, basic
principles of creation and operation of deposit insurance scheme and IT based supervision. In
addition, the consultants‟ findings indicated that NBE may not be able to adopt IFRS by itself
alone, but in collaboration with others at national level, and the creation and operation of deposit
insurance scheme needs a national level awareness creation regarding its importance for
depositors‟ protection and its contribution to financial system soundness.

However, implementation phase of IFRS, deposit insurance scheme and IT based supervision is
the remaining task that requires additional resources in the future.

The number of days needed for on-site and off-site supervision decreased substantially after the
project implementation to 31 working days for on site and 5 working days for off-site compared
to 5 months and 1 month respectively.

    e) Framework for Insurance Supervision and Regulation

Achievement rated satisfactory.                                                  An
international consultancy was provided for developing overall framework for insurance
supervision and regulation. The consultancy service was provided in five phases:

Phase I: Assessment of the legal environment of insurance supervision

           The consultant has produced an inception report which among other things made
            adequate assessment of the legal and regulatory framework in addition to providing
            sufficient insight into the underlying factors that presumably influence the overall
            scope of regulatory framework.
           The gaps in the existing law were identified and well and clearly addressed in the
            draft proclamation taking into consideration of the existing reality of the country and
            other related laws.

Phase II: Establishing licensing and regulatory requirements for companies and auxiliaries

           The consultant has developed draft insurance proclamation which, among other
            things, laid down the legal framework for licensing and regulatory requirements by
            taking in to consideration of international experience, core insurance principles and
            the state of development and experience of the insurance sector in the country.
           The new proclamation is in the process of ratification (expected within the next 2
            months)



                                                36
Moreover, the Consultant delivered various draft directives on:

           Application of insurance license;
           Assets covering technical provisions;
           Application for insurance brokerage license;
           Application for life insurance agent‟s license;
           Application for general insurance agent‟s license;
           Instruction for accounting records of brokers;
           Misconduct of auxiliaries;
           Classes of insurance;
           Reinsurance reserve.

Most of these directives are revisited in line with the prevailing situation and the issuance of the
directives is awaiting the ratification of the new law.

Phase III: Develop prudential and conduct of business reporting tools. Under this phase, the
following were delivered:

           Supervisory handbook on risk assessment and management;
           Draft regulation on investment by insurers which sets out the areas of investment
            permissible to insures and the proportion of investments that would be taken in to
            account for solvency purposes;
           Capital adequacy and solvency regime: this has been dealt in the supervisory
            handbook.

Phase IV: Development of insurance supervisory policies and procedure for off-site and on-site
examination. Under this phase the following were delivered:

           Reporting format;
           Requirements for reporting, reporting frequency and accounting standards;
           Surveillance manual;
           Methods for critical analysis of financial statements.
           Develop risk based examination manual;
           Standard reporting format for on-site examination;
           Analyses on the strength and weaknesses of the on-site examination function.

The manual and handbook are being in use.

Phase V: The Consultant conducted formal training for 6-day program which has covered:

           Introduction to supervisory framework;
           Risk assessment of insurers;
           Critical risk areas;
           Adequacy of provisions (both life and non-life);
           Market place supervision;
           Basic principles of insurance;
           Organization of inspection;
           Licensing and on-going supervision;


                                                37
            Basic elements of supervision;
            Financial analysis;
            Investment functions and so on.

The training program also provided a forum of sharing the experience of the consultant. The
project was comprehensive and brought and introduced the best international practices. However,
implementing all aspects of the manual and guidelines has been found to be challenging. Some
practical exposures have still believed to be essential to realize the benefit of the consultancy.
For example, risk based supervision (RBS) is a new approach suggested by the consultant that
involves too many technicalities.

The legal frame work has been developed; the system for RBS has been designed well. Manual
and handbook were put in place, regulatory requirements that support the implementation of the
RBS has been drafted. Moreover, some level of training was delivered. Overall, the quality of the
technical assistance was comprehensive and to the full satisfaction of Insurance Supervision
Directorate.

Though the system was well designed, due to lack of skilled personnel particularly in the areas of
RBS and the high technicalities it involves, full implementation of the system would be still a
challenging for Insurance Supervision Directorate.

    f)   Strengthening Internal Audit of NBE

Achievement rated satisfactory.                                                  PKF
Accountants and Business Advisers (UK) have prepared quality assessment report and developed
Internal Audit Charter and Audit Manual for Internal Audit and Risk Management Directorate of
National Bank of Ethiopia.

The primary objective of the project was to strengthen the capacity of the Internal Audit
Department (IAD), currently named as Internal Audit and Risk Management Directorate, of the
National Bank of Ethiopia in line with international standards and best practices. To attain the
objectives the Consultant executed the following major activities:

        Updated Internal Audit Charter;
        Developed Internal Audit Manual
        Introduced risk based audit planning process;
        Develop new risk based audit procedure manual;
        Piloted the risk based auditing methodology; and
        Provide trainings on IIA Standards; risk based auditing methodology; and risk
         management, internal control and governance guidelines and best practices to the IAD
         staff and management including.

Added value of the project:

        The risk based auditing methodology has being adequately applied using the templates
         since the accomplishment of the project;
        The risk based procedure manual is fully operational; and
        The training materials and other deliverables are still functional and valuable;



                                               38
However, the Directorate‟s staff needs further training with regard to bank-wide risk management
facilitation and coordination roles as the provided trainings were mainly focused on the assurance
(auditing) role of the Directorate. From the trained manpower only two staff members are in the
Directorate currently.

As a result, to further enhance the Directorate‟s capacity to strengthen the Bank‟s risk
management, control and governance process, it requires assistance/trainings/exposure in the area
of:

       Central bank-wide risk management methodology, tools and techniques;
       Further on risk based auditing methodology, tools and techniques;
       IT risk and auditing process;
       Computerizing the auditing and risk management process; and
       Enhancing employees‟ central bank business knowledge like payment system, currency
        destruction process, financial institutions supervision etc.

    g) Study and Development of Human Resources Management System

Achievement rated satisfactory.                                              SGGROUP
(Canada) provided consultancy services to Human Resources Management Directorate of NBE.
The main objectives of the consultancy service were:

       To provide a modern and workable human resource management policies and practices in
        the bank in general that makes a significant difference;
       To identify talent, knowledge and skill gaps;
       To furnish the Directorate with the necessary HR related policies, guidelines and
        procedures in particular.

The consultant has developed the human resources policies and procedures, human resources
strategy, succession plan and career development, training needs assessment and evaluation,
incentive mechanism and benefit/compensation administration manual as well as Human
Resources Management Information System. The consultant also made recommendations for
tools, systems and policies for talent management process; recruitment, selection and hiring
process; performance evaluation process; evaluation of potential process; training and
development process; human resources services; human resource management information
system requirements for the implementation of the processes. In addition the consultant
recommended on managing NBE people and facilitating change; proposed structure for human
resources management of NBE; capacity development to the Human Resources Management
Directorate of NBE; and NBE succession planning and talent planning.

Trainings were conducted locally and abroad for NBE staff and management members. Exposure
visits were organized for NBE staff and management members to central banks of different
countries mainly in Africa and Asia. The project also financed all benchmarking and balanced
score card visits to different banks abroad to support the transformation process of NBE through
Business Re-engineering Process which is currently being implemented.

However, NBE has faced a series challenge of staff turnover. Most of the trained manpower of
NBE including from the Human Resources Management Directorate has left the Bank.




                                               39
The project has also provided the following institutional capacity building for National Bank of
Ethiopia:

                 IT equipment (hardware and software) was procured and provided to NBE to
                  strengthen insurance supervision, banking supervision and economic research
                  activities.
                 Professional books were procured and provided to NBE to strengthen insurance
                  supervision, banking supervision, economic research and monetary policy, and
                  the Ethiopian Institute of Financial Studies.

Component 2: strengthening financial infrastructure - Moderately satisfactory. The World
Bank has provided financial and technical assistance in the areas of (i) payment system
modernization; (ii) improving credit information center and (iii) developing the capital markets
infrastructure.

The achievements under each subcomponent are described below:

    a) National Payments System

The National Bank of Ethiopia hired international consultants to develop strategic plan, legal
framework and architectural design to modernize the national payments system. The consultants
in their respective areas have finalized their reports on vision and strategic framework, project
management and governance, proclamation on payments transactions and settlement systems and
other legal instruments, and technological design to install and implement the modern national
payment and settlement systems in the country. With the input from the international consultants
and the World Bank technical assistance, the National Bank of Ethiopia undertook the
procurement process of the turnkey solution for the national payments system.

Based on the global architectural design and the bidding process, the National Payments System
turnkey solution provider has been selected. Accordingly, a contract agreement has been signed
with the winning vendor, Montran Corporation, for the supply and installation of the Automated
Transfer System with a contract value of US$ 1,630,900. Recurrent cost of US$ 671,000 will be
paid from local sources over five years after three years warranty period.

The national payments system modernization project is a technology platform of both real time
gross settlements (RTGS) for large value payments and Automated Clearing House (ACH) for
retail payments. The new payment system platform is a safe, secured and efficient payment and
settlement infrastructure that reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services which will have
significant impact on the national economic development.

An Initial Report had been prepared defining the overall modality of the system implementation,
functional requirements, module requirements of both Real Time Gross Settlement and
Automated Clearing House, interface requirements, infrastructure requirements, operational
issues like participants‟ rules and obligations, NBE roles and responsibilities, organization and
staffing of operations, project plan and organization, training, testing and acceptance, cost
recovery and principle for price setting, contractual framework and high level milestones
completion criteria. The Initial Report document has a main part and detailed descriptions in its
Annexes. The report has been approved by NBE and signed off by both parties (NBE and
Montran). Hardware for national payments system such as servers, network equipment,
firewall/VPN/ router, e-tokens, workstation computers, printers, cheque scanners and accessories


                                               40
with the total cost of USD 286,037.02 have been delivered and installed. Equipment such as e-
tokens, printers, workstation computers, power supply (UPS) and cheque scanners have been
distributed to NBE and participant banks. EATS software has also been delivered and integration
installation and test-bed testing have been carried out. NBE and participant banks have been
trained.

Currently all 17 banks operating in Ethiopia are networked with the national payments system at
NBE. The implementation of national payments system project has been finalized and its
operation was launched on May 27, 2011 and operational since the beginning of June 2011.

The picture below shows the overall architecture designed for a fully functional national payment
system. As explained, under the project the RTGS and ACH part of the system have been
delivered. Still the central security depository and the national switch (for mobile banking and
POS) are needed.




    b) Credit Information System (CIS)

The scope of CIS sub component was to provide a turnkey solution for supply, installation and
implementation of credit information system for upgrading/automating the existing credit bureau;
enhancing the coverage of the existing database; building skills of NBE staff in the effective use
of the database and skills of commercial banks staff and other parties in provision of credit
information and usage of credit reporting systems.



                                               41
An international consultant has developed the overall architecture of the credit information
bureau, the business requirement and the corresponding technical specification for purchasing a
turnkey solution which includes both hard ware and software.

Based on the architectural design and bid process, a turnkey solution provider has been selected.
Accordingly, contract agreement with Compuscan Direct has been signed with the total contract
amount of US$1,015,403.22 plus EUR 1,404,000 plus Birr 442,262 for supply and installation of
credit information system (financed by the World Bank) and the recurrent cost of
US$1,452,030.49 to be paid from local sources over five year after three years warranty period.

The new credit bureau, which is equipped with high technology platform of CIS, can provide
accurate and wider credit information to lending institutions for quality credit decision making in
line with lowering default rate which means lowering non performing loans (NPLs) and
increasing lending volumes for good borrowers. The implementation of CIS project has been
finalized and its operation is launched on August 12, 2011.

Compared to the previous system, the new CIS has brought the following additions:

       It houses both banks and MFIs
       It applies stringent data validation systems
       It‟s a complete paper-less system
       Connected through VPN and secured internet connection
       Has a unique identifier for each borrower based on the Tax Identification Number (TIN)
       The number of fields for each borrower went from 6 to 40, leading to more informative
        credit reports
       The time for receiving credit reports went from 2 weeks to immediate download.

Finally, in February 2012, the NBE directive for the “Establishment and Operation of Credit
Reference Bureau? (CRB/01/2012) was approved. The directive applies to all banks and outlines
duties and responsibility of the credit bureau as well as of the participating banks, the complaint
handling, the fees and the penalties and suspension terms.

    c) Capital Market Infrastructure Development

International consulting firm, Maxwell Stamp (UK) conducted a feasibility study for capital
market infrastructure development. The consultant has developed a design strategy and action
plan for development of government and corporate bond markets, and for development of stock
exchange. The consultant has also drafted a proclamation to provide for the establishment of the
Ethiopian Securities Commission and for the regulation of the offer, sale, and issuance of
securities in the primary securities market and a Securities Exchange Proclamation for secondary
market.

This component did not developed further and at the moment there seems to be no intention to
follow up on the study‟s recommendation in a policy-sensitive area like capital markets.



Component 3: Development of New Financial Products - DROPPED




                                                42
It was designed to develop new financial products that include housing finance, leasing finance,
SME financing, index based weather insurance, venture capital and credit card development.
However, the entire component has been cancelled due to restructuring of the project fund for
Government‟s priority of food security in the country.

Component 4: Enhancing professional skills in the financial sector – Moderately
satisfactory

International consulting firm, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management (FS) has developed a
strategic plan and training materials for strengthening Ethiopian Institute of Financial Studies
(EIFS). The consultants also assisted EIFS in implementing the strategic plan and piloted newly
developed training courses. The intervention achieved the development of 34 new and enhanced
courses. 30 courses have been piloted and standard material is now available to the free-lance
trainers that are hired, from time to time, to deliver the courses. The institute, in fact, does not
have internal resources for delivering trainings and need to rely on external trainers (most of
which have been trained through ToT classes provided under the project). Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) is signed for twinning arrangement between EIFS and FS for future
cooperation of the two institutions in the area of certification program. The full list of 34 courses
that EIFS is now able to provide based on Training Needs Assessment is reported below.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

No cost-benefit analysis was prepared at the project‟s design stage; however an economic and
financial analysis was included in the PAD. Based on that analysis the project‟s objective was to
build the foundation for improved financial sector soundness and effectiveness. This would have
been achieved by supporting better access to finance for the private sector, including low-income
households and other segments of the economy that were underserved or totally excluded from
the formal financial sector. Over the medium term the project was supposed to generate
“substantial benefits for private sector development, overall economic growth and poverty
reduction?.

The costs of the different components were clearly defined at project preparation, and were well
accounted for at project closing. Annex 1 presents the cost breakdown by component and shows,
by comparing actual costs with the original PAD estimates and the reallocation of budget in 2008,
that component one consumed only 49 percent of the resources originally allocated, and 100
percent of the new budget allocation; component two used 133 percent of the resources originally
allocated, and 100 percent of the new budget allocation; component 3 was dropped; component 4
used 63 percent of the resources originally allocated, and 100 percent of the new budget
allocation; and component 5 (implementation and monitoring) used 61 percent of the original
resources and 92 percent of the new allocation.

The broadness of the PDO justifies the lack of a specific economic and financial analysis,
outlining focused and measurable benefits to be accounted for. However, the prospective or
realized benefits of the project‟s intervention in the areas of institutional capacity building and
financial infrastructure are subject to a host of external factors relating to governance,
environmental and economic that makes attribution difficult to quantify. Many intangible effects
could, in the medium- to long-term, be attributed to the project‟s completed interventions,
including:

       Benefits from a more capable regulator like the central bank include:
           o a more effective monetary policy conducted on the basis of solid macroeconomic
                models and modern forecasting techniques;
           o improved capacity for surveillance of the system through risk-based supervisory
                methods; and
           o a higher level of professionalism for the conduct of the everyday economic and
                policy activities.
       Benefits from a modern credit information system include:
           o increased transparency in the functioning of the financial market;
           o improved efficiency as a consequence of reduced information asymmetries and
                the ability of financial intermediaries to make better informed decisions on
                credit;
           o a reduction in the processing time of credit applications due to the immediate
                availability of credit reports; and
           o an overall improvement of credit quality, with improved financial stability for the
                system as a whole.
       Benefits from a modern payments system that cannot be readily quantified include:
           o increased competition among financial institutions that can lead to reduced costs,
                improved client service and the reduction of transaction costs to consumers;
           o improved efficiency in cash management: a decrease in payment delays for
                participating banks and their clients in a context whereby previously lengthy



                                                45
                clearing processes tied up funds for extended periods, reducing their productive
                deployment;
            o   the reduction of risk exposure of the banking community as a consequence of the
                introduction of a real time gross settlement system (RTGS).

By installing an RTGS system, NBE has joined a group of almost 100 central banks that are
secure and in line with international standards and best practices. But retail payment systems in
developing countries still lag significantly behind when compared to those of developed
countries: as of 2006, there were 100+ per capita cashless transactions per year in the EU and
other developed countries, against 15-20 per capita transactions per year in East Asia and the
Pacific and in Europe and Central Asia, and less than 1 per capita transaction per year in Africa.




Holistically, these benefits will contribute to laying a foundation for better access to financial
services that was intended to be the key economic impact of this project in the medium-long term.

The Ethiopian banking sector is relatively underdeveloped compared with its regional peers. With
respect to overall financial sector depth (measured by private sector credit/GDP), the table below
shows that the country‟s standing is comparable with Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, especially
when accounting for Ethiopia‟s lower income per capita. However, when the financial sector‟s
penetration, as measured by distribution network, technology and number of loans and deposits
per capita, is considered, the country‟s banking sector is underdeveloped when compared with
Kenya and Uganda.

A reason for the anomaly between the macro data and actual sector development is the
overwhelming influence of the government in the sector, which has resulted in Ethiopian banks
gathering and intermediating a substantial proportion of funds under government direction, rather
than by developing products, services and a modern distribution system.

The Ethiopian banking sector‟s depth has not been growing in recent years: as the chart below
demonstrates, Ethiopia‟s regional peers have seen credit to the private sector as a proportion of
GDP rise substantially over the last five years, from 26.8percent to 33.8 percent for Kenya from
2004 to 2010, and from 8.1 percent to 15.8 percent for Uganda. For Ethiopia, however, this ratio
has fallen from 19.3 percent to 15.01 percent

However signs of an increase in the accessibility of financial services are encouraging. The chart
below shows how from 2004 to 2010 the number of commercial bank branches and ATMs per
1000 sq. km and per 100,000 adults has shown encouraging growth.

Interestingly access to, and usage, of financial services does not appear to have followed the same
trends. The chart below shows how the usage of banking services has seen a substantial increase
from 2004 to 2010 only with reference to the number of depositors with commercial banks per
1,000 adults. On other dimensions of usage, like the number of borrowers from commercial banks,
outstanding loans and outstanding deposits have not followed the same path.

This indicates the need for more financial education to encourage the use of the available
financial services, as well as the need to work to increase the range of financial services that
could meet the needs of the population. In this sense the component of the project that has been
entirely dropped due to the budget cut (i.e. developing new financial services) could have played
an important role and needs to be considered for a subsequent intervention.

                     Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A workshop was conducted to discuss the performance of the FSCBP and the level of adoption
and benefits gained, by the private banks, microfinance institutions and insurance companies,
from the interventions by the project in the areas of: National Payment System, Credit
Information System and Supervision by NBE. A high attendance composed by top management
representatives of banks, insurance companies and MFIs contributed to a fruitful discussion and
provided useful insights on the financial sector. Overall, the private banks, insurance companies
and microfinance institutions have benefitted in terms of awareness and knowledge gained
through the process of project implementation. The industry has come to a moment where it can
see the benefit of benchmarking its performance against best practices in terms of serving the
clientele and the national economy better. The financial sector was operating with the minimum
use of technology and modern systems. As a result, the national economic development had been
suppressed for years.

The FSCBP had the objective of introducing modern systems and building the requisite human
resource capacity to manage them as a first step to lay the foundation for a sound and responsive
financial sector. It also sought to raise the supervision capacity of the National Bank of Ethiopia
(the country‟s Central Bank) so that both efficiency and effectiveness are achieved in the process.
Three components of the project were designed to address the above: the introduction of (i) a
National Payment System, (ii) a Credit Information System, and (iii) the enhancement of the
NBE‟s supervision capacity. The main take from the discussion was that expertise in all the key
competencies are inadequate at both the NBE and the industry as a whole, and that properly
planned and managed capacity building and “on-the-job? training is critical in order to succeed in
the effective use of the existing and additional technology and systems that are being introduced.

The detailed views of the private banks, microfinance institutions and insurance companies in
those three areas are summarized in the following manner:

National Payment System (NPS): the FSCBP has succeeded to install the basic infrastructure
for the NPS. The banks stated that they are handling wholesale level payments using the system
and have been able to better manage their liquidity compared to before. The requisite training has
also been provided to the different directorates of the NBE in relation to the functions of their
respective areas of responsibility in terms of adopting the new technology. At the industry level,
most of the banks have introduced core banking in their operations and some have achieved
limited reduction in process time. More can be achieved with capacity building and removal of
some internal problems. However, only two banks have carried out straight through process
(STP) and the connection of all branches to their respective headquarters. For those two banks
that can take advantage of the technology, the weaknesses of connectivity pauses serious
challenges forcing manual processing of transactions when the connectivity is interrupted.
Overall, the adoption of the technology to the branch level by only two banks out of seventeen
has limited the benefits as transactions through/with the other banks cannot be processed through
the system.

Going forward, banks need capacity building support in: project management, technology and
general knowhow about modern banking infrastructure and systems.

Regional Clearing Houses: this was intended at the time of project design. However, the current
volume of transactions does not warrant such infrastructure and therefore the idea has been
dropped for the time being.



                                                53
No Operational Central Switch at the national level yet: the FSCPB did not address the
Central Switch part. Currently, banks are in the process of organizing themselves to install a
Central Switch. In the meantime, the full use of the available technology is not practical as central
clearing is not possible for retail type operations.

Check Clearing: the program was intended to reduce the time and cost of clearing checks.
However, because all the banks are not yet connected to the system, the checks are not
standardized and because the system still involves physically moving the checks, the time it takes
to clear checks has not improved; in some instances it has actually got worse.

Weak Capacity to adopt the new technology and system: The 15 other banks are at different
stages of introducing core banking and branch connectivity. One of the challenges they face in the
process is the level of competency in terms of the use of the technology as there has not been
adequate capacity building work prior to the introduction of the system.

Selection of Technology: the private banks stated that the system at the NBE limited their choice
of technology supplier for E-Token and scanners because of perceived security risk. It is not clear
whether this is a case of non-compatibility or lack of technical skill to interface other suppliers‟
equipment with that of the NBE‟s.

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs): out of 31 MFIs, only 5 have the capability and justification to
use the national payments system. The adoption of a functioning Management Information
System (MIS) is a critical challenge for all the MFIs due to cost and capacity limitations. Many
MFI‟s are far from any automation for the same reasons. All of them are not yet connected
although the few that have evolved to micro-banking may eventually do.

Credit Information System (CIS): As there is no a system of National ID in Ethiopia, the
banks and microfinance institutions are using Tax Identification Number (TIN) for the CIS. This
is being used reasonably well by the banks. The data from the previously used system has been
partially migrated to the new system and use of the CIS has become practical. However, the very
few MFI‟s that have installed are not using it. Moreover, the use of TIN is being resisted by MFI
clients thus creating a serious challenge of dropping size of clients. Moreover, the fact that MFIs
are doing group lending (and single payments for collection from the groups) does not enable
them to use the CIS.

Supervision of Insurance Companies – the objective of the project was to reduce time for both
off-site and on-site supervision. To this effect, manuals had been produced and distributed to the
insurance companies much earlier in the project implementation period utilizing the limited
allocation made for the task. However, the NBE provided minimum help to introduce the concept
of risk-based supervision, and in some cases no follow-up was done by NBE after passing over
the voluminous manuals. The capacity of insurance companies both in terms of human resources
and technology (IT, Database – MIS, etc.) is low; almost all activities are processed manually.

Insurance companies also question the mandate and indeed interest of the NBE as the
regulatory body for the insurance industry. They state that the NBE does not have the attention as
it mostly focuses on the banking sector. Some mentioned that an autonomous insurance
supervision commission be set up outside the NBE as the practice in other countries is. However,
this was clearly outside the mandate of the FSCBP.

Knowledge of Risk Management: the insurance companies stated the inadequacy of risk
management competency throughout the industry as well as at the NBE. Moreover the Ethiopian


                                                 54
Institute of Financial Studies also lacks the specific training modules/courses. Need for capacity
building in this area was highlighted.

Current supervision is not risk-based: NBE is still using rules-based supervision as it often
questions compliance to guidelines and directives irrespective of the risks associated with
transactions.

Banking Supervision: Banks‟ views about the application of risk-based supervision by NBE is
similar to that of the insurance companies. The NBE rush to applying penalties on the basis of
non-compliance to directives.

On-the-Job Training needed: the banks stated that there is a need for continuous on-the-job
training to make risk-based supervision practicable as well as risk management.

1. INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to signing of financing agreement and project agreement between the World Bank and
the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for executing the Financial Sector Capacity
Building Project (FSCBP) in Ethiopia and upon fulfillment of the necessary requirements, the
project implementation was effective since December 19, 2006.
The project has achieved significant results in capacity building of National Bank of Ethiopia,
development of financial infrastructure that includes national payments system and credit
information system as well as capacity development of financial sector professionals over the past
five years. The project was closed on September 30, 2011.
This completion report describes the background of the project design and its development
objectives; implementation arrangements and major achievements of each component.
Finally, recommendations are made in order to give highlights for further reform of the financial
sector capacity building project in the second phase.

2. BACKGROUND

The first phase of FSCBP has been designed, in a medium term road map, to improve banking
system in a sequenced manner. The main focus areas were improving payments system;
strengthening institutional, regulation and supervisory capacity of insurance industry; developing
capital market in the areas of money and bond markets; exploring and piloting rural and low-
income finance and strengthening legal, judicial and information environment of the financial
sector in the country. The project was launched at the end of 2006 and has implemented targeted
interventions aimed at supporting immediate priorities in the financial sector.

Accordingly, the implementation of FSCBP has brought a significant improvement in the
capacity of National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). Consultancy services have been provided in the
areas of bank supervision and regulation, insurance supervision and regulation, monetary policy
and liquidity forecasting, macroeconomic modeling and balance of payments statistics, internal
audit and human resources management. NBE staff and management members have developed
their capacities through skill transfer from international consultants, the World Bank technical
assistance as well as through trainings and workshops. Staff exposure visits were made to
selected central banks in Africa and Asia in the areas of monetary policy formulation and
implementation, reserve management, currency management, financial institutions supervision,
banking operation, information systems management, corporate planning and financial reporting,
human resources management, procurement and property management for benchmarking and
performance improvement which contributed a significant input to organizational and process
reform through business process re-engineering (BPR) which is being implemented by NBE. IT
equipment has been provided to strengthen the capacity of research and supervision of NBE and
Ethiopian Institute of Financial Studies (EIFS). The World Bank also provided technical
assistance to NBE in the area of reserve management.
With regard to financial sector infrastructure, the project has focused on three sub-components
namely: national payments system, upgrading credit information center and capital market
infrastructure development. Accordingly, strategic plan and legal frameworks have been
developed for national payments system. The national payments system and credit information


                                               57
system have been automated. Feasibility study of capital market infrastructure development has
been finalized for implementation of secondary market particularly for government bond as the
first phase of securities market development.

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

The Financial Sector Capacity Building project was implemented by Project Coordinating
Committee, Task Forces, ad hoc working groups and full time project staff. The Steering
Committee provided overall guidance and direction for the smooth operation of the project so as
to ensure the effective coordination among different stakeholders. The Project Coordinating
Committee was responsible for the overall implementation of the project. The Procurement
Committee was established and functional for procuring goods and the services of consultants.
Various ad hoc working groups such as Task Forces for national payments system and credit
information system, Technical Team for components two and three, Technology Working Group
and Legal Working Group for national payments system, and different counterpart teams were
established to closely work with international consultants and to review their reports. Senior staff
from commercial banks and Ethiopian Information and Communication Technology
Development Agency were assigned and provided a counter party services for consultants‟ works
in the areas of strategic plan development, information technology, legal advisory services;
selection process of vendor and implementation of national payments system. Similarly, banks
participated in the review of consultancy service, selection process of vendor and implementation
of credit information system. Daily project activities were carried out by full time project staff
that included the project officer, procurement officer, finance officer, monitoring and evaluation
expert and administrative staff.

4. MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS

4.3 The World Bank Implementation Support and Technical Assistance Missions

The World Bank Project Implementation Support Mission made several visits to Ethiopia on
frequent basis to assess progresses in meeting the project development objectives; review
implementation progress and actions taken on the mission‟s recommendations, and; address
specific safeguard aspects of the project, particularly financial management, disbursements and
procurements issues.

The World Bank also made the following technical missions to support the project
implementation:



                                               59
       A follow up mission to assist NBE in the implementation of core components with main
        focus on national payments system;
       The World Bank Institute mission to provide technical assistance for strengthening the
        capacity of Ethiopian Institute of Financial Studies;

       International Finance Corporation missions to provide technical assistance for credit
        information system project implementation.

4.4 Main Challenges

4.4.1   Lack of international consultants

Lack of international consultants in the financial sector was the main challenge for the project.
Rigorous announcements in the international media including UNDB online, dgMarket, the
Economist magazine and local newspapers were used for inviting the consultants. However, the
responses were usually insufficient. Consultants were usually reluctant to provide service for
longer period on residence basis.

4.4.2   Limitation of financial resources.

The IDA fund of US$15m was allocated for the Financial Sector Capacity Building Project.
However, US$7m which is 47 percent has been deducted to reallocate the project resources for
government‟s priority area. As a result, some important elements of the financial sector
infrastructure and the entire component 3, new financial products were cancelled.

4.4.3   Implementation arrangement and project staffing issues

Financial Sector Capacity Building Project encountered serious challenges in the course of
project implementation.

Technically, outside the functional areas of the central bank such as capital market infrastructure
development, asset registry, housing finance development, leasing finance, SME financing,
agricultural risk management, credit card development and venture capital lacked a technical
leadership since there were no directorates or departments that could take a lead for the
implementation of these financial sector infrastructures and new financial products.

Administratively, the overriding principle for institutional and implementation arrangement of the
project was „mainstreaming‟ of operational responsibility to National Bank of Ethiopia. However,
within three years of the project life 5 project staff members out of 7 placements resigned due to
lack of staff incentives/motivation in the mainstreaming arrangement of NBE‟s human resources.

5. A NEED FOR FURTHER CAPACITY BUILDING OF ETHIOPIAN FINANCIAL
   SECTOR




                                                60
Further strengthening of supervision capacity of National Bank of Ethiopia in the areas of bank
supervision, insurance supervision and microfinance institutions supervision as well as research
and policy formulation capacity development is needed. The consultants‟ studies and
recommendations in the first phase of the project need to be implemented in the second phase.
Also support for establishment of data warehouse for research and supervision as well as
advanced Information and Technology environment is needed for NBE as the Bank introduced
new financial sector infrastructures such as national payments system and credit information
system which service for the entire financial sector industries.

Developing financial infrastructure is a critical component of financial sector that needs further
financial and technical support of the World Bank. Highlights of support areas for the financial
sector infrastructure sub components are as follows:

(i) The national payments system is currently at “stage 1? wherein the real time gross settlement
    (RTGS) and automatic clearing house (ACH) are implemented. The following subcomponent
    activities need to be undertaken in Phase II project:
            Procurement of systems hardware and software including installation and testing of
               security settlement system (SSS) i.e. Central Security Depository (CSD),
            Central switch for clearing and settlement of retail transactions. This infrastructure
               can be implemented in collaboration with Ethiopian Bankers‟ Association.
            Support of retail payment instruments such as mobile banking, POS, e-token devices
               to enable banks and microfinance institutions fully participate in the retail payment
               system; as well as credit cards development,
            Policy development, oversight function and payment risk management framework,
            Market development for retail payments, enhancing remittances and in-country
               money transfer, assessment for cross-border payment and regional integration in the
               future.

(ii) Strengthening credit information system

The current project of credit information system provided technological capabilities with business
and functional specifications to run credit bureau reporting. The second phase of the project needs
to focus on:
           development of business plan and road map for implementation and credit bureau
           Institutional and legal framework development of Credit Bureau, developing skills
              of staff in NBE, commercial banks, MFIs and other stakeholders;
           Skill transfer to financial sector staff through residency based advisory services,
              and
           systematic public awareness campaign on the importance and usage of credit
              reporting system

  (iii) Developing infrastructure of capital market

  In the first phase of Financial Sector Capacity Development Project, international consultants
  developed strategic plan, legal and regulatory framework for government and corporate bond
  markets and stock exchange in Ethiopia. A proclamation to provide for the establishment of the
  Ethiopian Securities Commission and for the regulation of the offer, sale, and issuance of
  securities in the primary securities market and a Securities Exchange Proclamation for
  secondary market has been drafted. In the second phase of the project the following sub
  components need to be undertaken:


                                                61
         Developing action plan and establish Ethiopian Securities Commission
         Conducting feasibility studies and action plan to establish Stock Exchange/securities
          market, and
         Investments in Technology Infrastructures hardware and software to establish a trading
          platform and collateralized depository/clearing and electronic settlement mechanism for
          government debt and corporate debt and securities market.

 (iv) Establishing the national asset/collateral registry to facilitate secured loan transactions

A system of securing assets, both movable and immovable, is fundamental in creating an
effective credit market. Given the prevalence of collateral lending in the country, developing
asset registry is important for expanding the scope of secured lending transactions and improving
access to financial service. The following activities will be carried out under this component:

         Reviewing the legal and institutional framework for an asset registry
         Designing the registry architecture and other operational elements,
         Providing the necessary IT equipment to the registry operational, and
         Awareness raising program on the uses and benefits of an asset registry system

Component 3: Development of new financial products

(i)   Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) financing

The Small and Medium Enterprise financing helps in         meeting the funding gap for SME by
providing a credit line to qualified and participating financial institutions, with a Government
guarantee, aimed at viable SMEs that currently do not have access to bank financing and/or a
Partial Credit Guarantee facility to encourage selected private sector financial institutions to
expand their SME portfolio, particularly to qualified medium-size enterprises outside the target
client group. The project needs to include:

              Feasibility study‟ pilot design for provision of guarantee scheme
              Pilot test of the guarantee scheme with seed money of partial guarantee, and
              Capacity building programs through trainings and exposure program

(ii) Leasing

Leasing can be an effective mechanism for jumpstarting the Ethiopian economy by aggressively
promoting the leasing industry to finance long-term projects for SMEs and to induce the banking
sector to foster and enter the industry. Leasing companies play an important role in the financing
of small and medium-sized businesses, which need funds to expand but often do not have the
credit history or collateral sufficient for other financing sources. Leasing gives these enterprises
the opportunity to create and modernize their operations hence increasing productive, lowering
transaction costs, increasing employment opportunities especially among the unskilled, increasing
business profitability, promoting innovation and creativeness, and increasing product choices.
Hence, assessment will be made and support for the implementation of leasing products will
carried out

(iii) Housing finance




                                                  62
Housing finance calls for an appropriate real estate property valuation mechanism and techniques
by establishing (i) the National Association for Property Valuation professionals including
drafting of its organizational structure supported by appropriate legal and regulatory framework;
(ii) technical assistance on real estate property valuation techniques for banks, insurance
companies, and other financial intermediaries participating in the housing market including the
Ministry of Works and Urban Development and the National Bank of Ethiopia; (iii) developing a
housing wholesale markets attracting banks and other financial intermediaries including mortgage
companies to be more flexible in financing their mortgage products; and (iv) developing housing
financing products like mortgage-back securities and covered bond products which will help to
assist banks and mortgage companies to finance more affordable and longer term fixed rate
mortgages. Hence, the following activities will be carried out:

             Market survey and feasibility studies
             Pilot design
             Developing standards for property valuation
             Developing affordable housing finance products and capacity building

(iv) Index-based weather insurance

The index based weather insurance to be piloted under this component would be highly
innovative. It combines self-insurance, market based insurance and social insurance. Farmers will
retain small losses that do not affect the viability of their business (self-insurance), while larger
losses are transferred to the private insurance industry (market insurance through the Base
Insurance Product) and the final layer of catastrophic losses is borne by the government (social
insurance through the Disaster Response Product). The following activities will be undertaken:

            Feasibility studies and piloting
            Scaling up, and
            Warehouse receipts study

Component 4: Enhancing Capacity of the Financial Sector

(i)   Strengthening Ethiopia Institute of financial Studies

In the first phase of financial sector capacity building project, international consultants developed
a strategic plan, new processes and procedure for EIFS, as well as new training product for the
Ethiopian Institute of Financial Studies. Pilot trainings were also provided by consultants to banks,
insurance companies and micro finance institutions. The following activities need to be
undertaken in the Phase II of the project:
       Institutional strengthening of the EIFS, incl. consultancy services on the strategic and
          operational management
       Restructuring the Institute to enable it to provide training services of high quality to the
          financial sector



                                                 63
        Development of new training products
        Implementation of the already developed training programs
        Strengthening of the local trainer pool to increase the sustainability of the project
        Further development of the certification program, and
        Enhancement of the training facilities of the Institute (facilities, equipment)

(ii) Support for financial industry associations
Institutional capacity building for Ethiopian Bankers‟ Association and Association of
Microfinance Institutions so that they will be able to manage central switch and cheque
automation for national payments system, and establishment of private credit information bureau.

6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The development objectives of the first round project have been achieved as the core components
of the project mainly national payments system and credit information system are successfully
implemented. However, the continuity of the outcome of the achieved development objectives of
the project is highly dependent on the design and implementation of the second phase of the
project to enhance the development and role of the financial sector in Ethiopia.

National payments system modernization project provided only basic infrastructure for large
value payments and cheque clearing and settlement services. However, there is a need to expand
retail payments that will significantly impact the overall economy and commercial activities in
the country. The payments system also involves, sooner or later, cross-border payments and
international remittances, foreign exchange settlement systems and securities settlement systems
as well as locally affecting currency circulation and management by providing real-time and
efficient payments, clearing and settlement facilities eventually impacting monetary policy.

The payments system also positively influences industry and service sectors as well as
subsequently agriculture sector through direct and indirect participation of microfinance
institutions in the system through innovative products for example point of sales (POS) expansion
for payments and settlement services in rural part of the country by expanding access to finance.

The implementation of secondary government bond market, rural and urban pro-poor financing
programs such as setting up an asset/collateral registry to facilitate secured loan transaction;
developing new financial products such as housing finance, leasing finance, small and medium
enterprises financing, agricultural risk/insurance management and other products like venture
capital fund and credit cards are pending until the Phase II project starts. Other areas of
intervention would also be identified during the course of project identification process in the new
financial sector project.

 II.   Introduction

This Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report is being submitted as part of inputs at
the end of the project in question and follows guidance provided by “Financial Management
Manual For World Bank-Financed Investment Operations? issued by the Financial Management
Sector Board on March 2010 and “Implementation Completion and Results Report Guidelines? as
updated on October 5, 2011. The objective of this report is to capture significant financial
management issues affecting project implementation and outcomes during the course of its
implementation as lessons learnt for later projects to be implemented in the sector.

The project maintained, throughout the life of the project good financial management systems
which had a satisfactory rating. Counterpart funds were not required owing to subsisting Country
Financing Parameters at the time the project was designed and agreed. Generally, the project
complied fully with the requisite financial covenants outlined in its legal agreement which
included submission of quarterly IFRs and annual audits. The financial management risk ratings
were averagely rated Moderate. Owing to this risk rating, the project was supervised by
conducting field visit at least once annually (excluding quarterly IFR reviews, annual audit
reviews and normal implementation supports). They key significant aspects the project
encountered during implementation from which future projects ought to learn are as follows:

III.   Lessons Learnt

The key lessons learnt in this project from the financial management perspective include:
    Staffing and consistent management oversight-The project had not encountered staff
       turnovers and so the availability of well qualified financial management staff was key to
       understanding and resolving issues quickly (e.g. preparing FMRs, audit reports were
       clean, no management letter issues, etc). In addition the PCU management close
       oversight on fiduciary issues is of course an important aspect as well.

      Strengthening the internal audit function – The lack of internal audit oversight as
       agreed in the project documents needed careful reflection from appraisal up to


                                              66
          implementation. We needed to understand why it was not performed by the NBE and
          what impact it had on the project in providing real time information on controls and
          issues so that prompt action is taken to resolve/address them. But in general, it is well
          known that conducting regular internal audits adds value to a system in addressing
          weaknesses on time and ensuring that risk aspects are promptly dealt with when they
          arise.

IV.       Appraisal

The main strengths identified during the appraisal were that (a) NBE had many years experience
in handling government resources and also managing structural adjustment credits and (b) It was
also noted that the NBE had well experienced staff in its Finance Department. This project was
implemented using the NBE‟s FM systems and with the involvement of NBE‟s finance staff. The
main challenge noted was retaining skilled staff and it was stated then that to overcome this
problem, NBE was in the process of reviewing and revising its incentive system and
remuneration policy. For this project it was stated as an action plan that the NBE will either
assign or recruit one accountant, who would be primarily responsible for the project and he/she
should receive adequate training on World Bank reporting requirements.

     V.   Implementation support missions

Throughout the project‟s life, FM supervision missions were undertaken as per Bank policies33 to
ensure that the FM arrangements remained acceptable to the bank. The missions on the overall
focused on assessing the status and adequacy of the project‟s financial management arrangements.
The objective of the assessments was to determine whether the implementing entity‟s financial
management arrangements continue to be adequate with the objective of ensuring that: (i) the
project funds were used only for the intended purposes in an efficient and economical way; (ii)
the preparation of accurate, reliable and timely periodic financial reports; (iii) the compliance
with the legal covenants related to financial management and (iii) safeguard the entities‟ assets.

Based on the overall supervision missions conducted during the life of the project, the overall FM
ISR rating of the project has improved from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory as a result of
the actions taken to improve internal control except internal audit, external audit, fund flows,
budget control and monitoring accounting. Both the residual inherent and control risks were rated
as Moderate for the most part of the project. The overall residual risk was rated Moderate for the
better part of the life of the project. At the close of the project the overall project risk was rated
to be Moderate and the FM ISR rating of the project was rated as Satisfactory. However, the main
issue not addressed was the Lack of adequate internal audit oversight. On the other hand, the
external auditors‟ audit reports did not reveal significant internal control weaknesses.

The FM supervision missions focuses on the areas of budgeting, accounting, fund flow, internal
control, financial reporting and external audit. Based on the implementation support missions
conducted, the following were observed as challenges and strengths of the project on the key FM
aspects (areas) mentioned above.

1. Budgeting: Budgeting approval process had experienced some delays at times. Budgets were a
  bit ambitious at times but it was also observed budgets were updated regularly which were

  Guidelines issued by Financial Management Sector Board on June 30 2001 and revised on October 1 2003,

                                                  67
  aligned with work and disbursement plans which are the basis of cash requests. However, most
  IFRs especially towards the end of the project raised the issue of low budget utilization.
  Budgets were monitored on a quarterly basis and justifications for variances were reported to
  the management as well as to the Bank in the quarterly FMR.

2. Accounting: There was generally good accounting arrangements (including adequate staffing)
  in place and this was being adhered with for the most part of the project.

3. Internal control and internal audit: The overall internal control environment was relatively
  strong but one major weakness noted in most supervision missions and which was not
  addressed was internal audit oversight. It was stated in the PAD that the NBE‟s Internal Audit
  Department would audit the financial transactions of the project. However, we noted that an
  internal review/internal audit have not taken place for the better part of the project.

4. Fund flow and disbursement: Generally the funds flow from the Bank to the Project was
  slow at the beginning years but picked up towards the end of the project. As can be seen below
  out of the SDR 10.3.3 million signed amount for the IDA portion, about SDR 4.5 million was
  cancelled due to overall portfolio restructuring but the remainder amount of SDR 5.8 million
  was fully disbursed. The project as at the close had USD 68,733.36 which was refunded back in
  February 27, 2012. Although full project advances were made to the project by February 2010,
  there was low level of documentation for some time which finally picked up towards the end.
  The main reason for this could be attributed to ambitious budgeting and excessive cash requests
  coupled with low budget utilization due implementation issues. However, the project managed
  to utilize all and document all advances at closure and refunded the remaining balance of USD
  68,733.36 and hence the project will have no “lapsed loans?.

5. Reporting: The project submitted acceptable quality quarterly reports Financial Monitoring
  reports (FMRs) on time. FMRs were reviewed and the low budget utilization as was mentioned
  above was a repeated issue noted during these reviews.




                                               68
6. Auditing: In the financing agreement, the project had given in to the financial covenant of
  submitting audit reports within six months of the year end. Audit Services Corporation was the
  auditor of the project throughout its life cycle.

  Audit reports were generally submitted on time (in fact in most cases they were being
  submitted before the deadline dates). Past three year (FY 2009 to FY 2011) audit reports were
  issued with an unqualified opinion.

  The year ended June 30 2009 audit had two some internal control weaknesses in the
  management letter. The issues were relating to long outstanding travel advance of which was a
  balance brought forward from previous year and to the practice of recording advances to
  consultants as expenditures. The project improved on these issues and during subsequent audits
  (year ended June 30 2010 and June 30 2011 audits), the auditors did not issue a Management
  letter as they had not discovered reportable findings.

  The final project audit covering the period from July 1 2011 to last disbursement date is being
  audited. The auditors finalized the field word and are currently working on report preparation.
  Agreement is reached with the Project to deliver the audit report by end of March 2012.
