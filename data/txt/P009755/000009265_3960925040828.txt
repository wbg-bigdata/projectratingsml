RARNATAIA SERICULTURE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1034-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Karnataka
Sericulture Project. The project for which a credit of US$54 million was
made  available was  started  in  late  1980.   The  credit was  closed on
Sep_ember 30, 1988, three years behind schedule. The last disbursement was
made in April 1989 and US$52,778.23 was cancelled.
Parts I and III of this report were prepared by a FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Programme mission which visited India in February 1990.
Part II is a summary based on a draft "old-style* Project Completion Report
prepared by a consultancy firm employed by the Government of Karnataka
(GOK).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in 1987, and is based, inter alia, on
the Staff Appraisal Report,  the IDBI Agreement,  the Development Credit
Agreement and the Project Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda, as well as
discussions with staff, entrepreneurs and farmers.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
KARNATARA SERICULTURE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1034-IN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Obiectives
1.       The project, which was the first IDA-funded operation in support of
Indian sericulture, had three main objectives: (i) to increase raw silk
production in Karnataka by about 1,600 tons, including 1,000 tons high quality
bivoltine silk per year, by providing better silkworm eggs and intensive
advisory services to sericulturists already cultivating about 24,000 ha
irrigated and 60,000 ha rainfed mulberry, and to those who were projected to
plant about 14,000 ha irrigated mulberry in new areas during the project
period; (ii) to introduce modern processing facilities and methods that would
upgrade raw and spun silk to export grade quality; and (iii) to introduce the
latest technologies from leading silk producing countries and expand local
research for longer-term improvement of the industry (see para. 3.I).
Implementation Experience
2.        Overall the project can be considered a success as it has met most
as its objective, i.e., increasing raw silk production, expansion and
modernization of facilities and services provided to sericulturists,
introduction of modern methods and facilities, and enhancing research (see
para. 6.1). Project implementation was originally phased over a five-year
period (mid-1980 to mid-1985). However, initial progress was slower than
anticipated due mainly to delays in the construction of DOS facilities and
staff recruitment. By the end 1985, (when only 672 of the credit had been
disbursed) a review of the project was undertaken and it was agreed to extend
the project period by one year and to incorporate changes including the
addition of 4,500 ha of new mulberry planting, supplementary DOS and research
facilities as well as staff. The original IDA credit amount of US$54 million
remained unchanged. After this extension, most of the project targets were
achieved. In the case of smallholder development, the new areas planted to
mulbecry amounted to 30,300 ha, far exceeding even the revised target of
18,500 ha. The replanting programme, however, covered only 15,250 ha against
the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) target of 20,000 ha.  Furthermore, it was
anticipated that as a result of the project supporced modernization programme
the Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation (KSIC) would become commercially
viable. This, however, did not materialize due mainly to poor capacity
utilization and high labor costs. Technical assistance funds were almost
fully utilized.
3.       Another critical variance was the considerable delay in the
procurement and installation of the highly specialized cold storage facilities
for grainage requiring a further extension up to September 1988. By the end



- iv -
of the extended project period actual disbursement amounted to US$53.95
million (para. 5.1).
Project Results
4.       By the end of the extended project period, incremental raw silk
production amounted to over 2,400 tons as against the target of 1,600 tons;
the share of bivoltine silk was however only 100 tons (see paras. 6.2 and
6.3). For KSIC, the SAR projections had indicated a net profit before taxes
of Rs 10.2 million in FY1984/85 increasing to Rs 17.9 million in FY88/89.
Instead, net losses before taxes increased from Rs 27.8 million to Rs 49.7
million during the same period (para. 6.6). At appraisal, also cottage basin
operations were considered highly profitable with a financial rate of return
of 32Z. Due mainly to a steep increase in cocoon prices which was not
compensated by a proportional increase in yarn prices, the rate of return fell
to about 5Z. Financial returns for sericulturalists considerably exceeded
appraisal estimates due mainly to a substantial increase in cocoon prices (see
para. 6.11). Also employment generation was higher than anticipated.
5.       The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project at appraisal was
estimated at 22Z. The reestimated ERR is 20Z. Factors contributing to the
slight decrease are the substantially lower values added by KSIC and cottage
basin operations (see para. 6.10).
Sustainability
6.       Having been based on an existing institutional structure, the
sustainability of project activities even after project termination is secure
(see para. 6.13). Physical facilities created by the project continue to be
properly maintained and staff recruited for project purposes were integrated
in the cadres of the respective agencies. Farmers have clearly demonstrated
their willingness and ability to adopt improved practices. The only concern
is represented by the substantial losses of KSIC which requires continuous
budgetary support. An increase in bivoltine cocoon production together with
the proposed restructuring programme are however expected to improve the
situation by 1990/91 (see paras.5.4, 7.1 and 7.2). It can be assumed that the
project will maintain an acceptable level of net benefits throughout its
economic life.
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.       The project was generally well designed and implemented.  It
succeeded in expanding silk production in Karnataka, introducing modern
processing technology and improving incomes and employment. The main lessons
can be learned through the project's two major shortfalls, which failed to
introduce bivoltine cocoon production on a large scale and transform KSIC into
a commercially viable enterprise.
8.       From the former the lessons are that sufficient lead time must be
allowed for the development and introduction of new production technologies,
including the establishment of the required infrastructure, staff positioning
and training. The latter failure indicates that considerable attention should



be paid to the social environment where a restructured enterprise is expected
to operate , The project should have anticiDated that the closure of uneconomic
units would have been critical for the purpose of transformine KSIC into a
commercially viable enterprise.

2. Background
2.1       The Government of India's (GOI) development plans have persistently
emphasized not only expansion of agricultural and in particular foodgrain
production but also alleviation of rural unemployment and poverty, and have
therefore included investments for labor-intensive sub-sectors such as
sericulture. Based on past favorable experiences and because of its potential
for employment generation and improving rural incomes, both GOI and the
Government of Karnataka (GOK) have been planning measures to expand silk
production in Karnataka. Among these, the Karnataka Sericulture Project
constituted a major initiative and was the beginning of IDA involvement in the
sub-sector. Preliminary discussions between GOI and the Bank took place in
early 1977. As a result, project preparation was undertaken by GOK in
collaboration with the Project Preparation and Monitoring Cell of GOI's
Ministry of Agriculture and with the assistance of the Bank's New Delhi office
staff. The project was ba-ed on the resulting preparation report of January
1979 and on the findings of the February 1979 Bank Pre-Appraisal Mission and
the September/October 1979 Appraisal Mission.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1       Objectives.  The project had three main objectives:  firstly, to
increase raw silk production in Karnataka by about 1,600 tons per year,
including 1,000 tons of high-quality bivoltine silk, by providing better
silkworm eggs and intensive advisory services to sericulturists already
cultivating about 24,000 ha irrigated and 60,000 ha rainfed mulberry and
intending to plant an additional 14,000 ha of irrigated mulberry in new areas
during the project period; secondly, to introduce modern processing facilities
and methods that would upgrade raw and spun silk to export grade quality; and
thirdly, to introduce, for the longer-term improvemeuit of the industry, the



latest technologies from l'ading silk producing countries and to expand local
research. In addition the project was expected to result in a considerable
increase in rural incomes and employment.
3.2       Components. In order to achieve these objectives, the project was
to include the following components:
(a)  Silk Production
(i) credit for 25Z of farmers in new areas for planting of mulberry
and, purchase of silkworm rearing equipment as well as for the
construction of 1,400 silkworm rearing houses to support the
14,000 ha new mulberry planting programme;
(ii) incremental staff, vehicles, equipment and operating costs
for 150 technical services centers (TSCs) with
1,700 communal hatcheries, 2/ four mobile training units,
construction, equipment and operating costs of 20 model
hatcheries, and improvement of an existing Sericulture
Training Institute and establishment of two new ones for
expanding and strengthening the technical services of the
Department of Sericulture (DOS);
(iii) construction, equipment and operating costs for 10 modern
grainages (including cold stores) to expand and improve
silkworm egg supplies from DOS; and
(iv) construction, equipment, staff and operating costs of 30
market units to expand cocoon markets and establish 12 new
ones.
(b)  Silk Processing
(i) establishment of a semi-automatic departmental small
filature in the new areas;
(li) credit for reelers for establishing 500 cottage basin
units; and
(iii) improvement of Government silk processing factories by
replacing the existing seven outdated filatures with a
modern one, and renovating, modernizing and expanding the
exiscAng spun silk factory.
(c) Research and Technical Assistance
(i) expanding facilities at the main station of Central
Sericultural Research and Training Institute (CSRTI) and
establishing or improving two regional stations and 10
2/   Locally known as Chawkies Rearing Centers (CRCs).



- 3 -
sub-stations; supporting programmes at three Karnataka
universities; and establishing a sericulture research
station for the Karnataka State Sericulture Development
Institute (KSSDI), which GOK was in the process of
setting up;
(ii) technical assistance programmes including 70 man-months of
consultants time and 380 man-months of overseas training
to support the production, research and processing
components; and
(iii) support for monitoring and evaluation services.
3.3       At appraisal (1979), total project costs were estimated at
US$95.1 million equivalent (including physical and price contingencies), of
which US$20 million would be foreign exchange costs.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1       Design.  The project was designed to improve and expand the existing
production base, processing facilities and the extension as well as research
infrastructure and facilities. Although being the first of its kind, the
concept was not meant to be innovative, aiming however at introducing modern
production and processing techniques. The project was generally well prepared
and its scope and scale were appropriate. In view of the rapidly increasing
local and export demand for silk and silk products, the project's timing was
most appropriate. However, in retrospect, the technological package proposed
for rapid implementation was somewhat overambitious.
4.2       Organization.  The project was to be implemented through a multitude
of existing agencies and institutions. Part of the credit was to be on-lent to
ARDC for refinancing participating banks for the provision of loans to silk
farmers and silk reelers. At appraisal, the institutional concept and the
different roles and functions were endorsed by GOI and GOK and the
arrangements generally proved satisfactory throughout implementation. Only in
the case of research, better coordination by the Research Coordination
Committee could have helped to eliminate some duplication in research efforts
and to improve the research/extension linkage.
4.3       In retrospect, it was mainly the project's enphasis on the planting
and replanting of areas with iniproved mulberry varieti?s together with
substantial extension and research efforts which contributed most to its
success. Possibly too much emphasis was given tu bivoltine silk production,
since conditions were not conduci-;e to rapid development.
5. Project Implementation
5.1       Critical Variances in Project Implementation.  The main variances
between planned and actual implementation were the project's limited success
in introducing bivoltine cocoon production which reached only about 10 of the
target and its failure to transform the processing units of the Karnataka Silk
Industries Corporation (KSIC) into commercially viable enterprises. Due to a



slow start-up, there was slippage in project implementation and the project
was therefore reviewed towards the end of its original closing date. Based on
this review, the project period was extended by one year to incorporate
changes such as the addition of 4,500 ha of new mulberry planting, the
expansion of DOS and research facilities as well as provision of incremental
staff. By the end of the extended period, most of the project's main physical
targets were completed with the main exception of the cold stores for
grainages requiring further extension to September 1988.
5.2       Slippage occurred in the initial years mainly in the construction
programmes of grainages, cocoon markets, training centers and schools, which
was partly due to inadequate staff strength in the Engineering Cell as well as
to delays in the provision of construction material. This could have been
avoided through more adequate staffing and material flow planning. Also staff
appointments lagged behind schedule partly due to cur.bersome selection
procedures imposed by GOK, which were later rectified. Also the uptake of the
mulberry replanting programme was much slower than anticipated due mainly to
the reluctance of many farmers to sustain losses in productivity during the
gestation period of the replanted crop.
5.3       The limited success in introducing bivoltine cocoon production can
be attributed to three factors. The development of bivoltine silk depends on
the availability of hardy varieties to withstand Indian conditions and
specialized technology for the production of quality seed. During the project
period, success in the development of appropriate varieties was slow.
Secondly, the essential, highly-specialized humidity controlled cold stores at
the grainages were only installed a.fter credit closing (December 1989). The
delay was due mainly to the assumption that the equipment would be available
locally. After unsuccessful local bidding, consultants had to develop
detailed specifications for ICB and the contract was awarded to a Japanese
company. Subsequently GOI required the payment of a 902 import duty, which
only after long negotiations between GOI and C.OK was reduced to 45X. Thirdly,
the market premium for bivoltine silk was not sufficiently high for most
growers to accept the additional cost and risk, as prices were depressed due
to low cost imports of bivoltine silk yarn.
5.4       The Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation was created in April 1980
in order to relieve DOS from operating processing complexes and to establish
modern processing units operating on a commercial basis. Under the project,
the spun silk mill of KSIC has been modernized and expanded. It was
anticipated that the existing seven filatures would be transferred from
DOS to KSIC, of which one, under the project, would be totally modernized and
others closed down. Only three filatures were transferred, one was modernized
and one closed down. In order to avoid mass redundancies the third plant,
however, was rot closed down and the original staff strength was maintained.
The continuing operation of this plant, which has been incurring heavy losses,
is contrary to the SAR proposal and has contributed to KSIC's losses. GOK
agreed to reimburse KSIC for t'he losses, but most of the claims are still
outstanding. It is now proposed by KSIC to retransfer this filature to DOS.
5.5       Besides the losses incurred by the old filatures, the
underutilization of the modern filature (mainly due to the insufficient supply



- 5 -
of bivoltine cocoons) and subsequent processing facilities also contributed to
the losses of KSIC (para. 6.3). Furthermore, KSIC was obligated by GOK to
carry out developmental activities such as bivoltine cocoon procurement in
remote areas, which substantially added to the costs of its operation.
5.6       The project, however, succeeded in introducing modern processing
technology resulting in a substantial improvement of the quality of yarn and
fabrics. It is expected that by 1990-91 the Corporation will make a net profit
due mainly to the increased availability of bivoltine cocoons and the proposed
restructuring program.
5.7       Project Risks.  Most potential risks of the project were correctly
identified and suitable provision was made to minimize these risks. However,
more attention coul.d have been given to redress the problems related to the
mulberry replanting component (see para. 5.2) and to bivoltine production and
marketing (see para. 5.3). The commercial risks of the KSIC operation were
also underestimated and especially the adverse impact of the social obligation
of GOK towards the labor force of the filatures which were proposed to be
closed down was not adequately assessed.
5.8       Unforeseen Factors Affecting Project Implementation.  Most of
Karnataka State suffered from drought during the last four project years.
Precipitation was 25Z to 40Z below long-term means, mostly affecting rainfed
farming. GOI had to divert some of its budget to drought relief, affecting
local funding of some project components, leading to reduced hiring of
extension staff and a decrease in the civil works component. However, these
events could not have been foreseen.
6. Project Results
6.1      General.  The project as a whole can be considered a success as it
has met most of its objectives, i.e., increasing raw silk production;
expanding and modernizing the facilities and services provided to
sericulturists; introducing modern processing facilities and methods and
enhancing research. Only tile cold storage component, which is the most
crucial element to the success of future silk exports, was not completed by
project closing. The success of the project, particularly the impact it had
on small farmers, formed the basis for the formulation of the National
Sericulture Project (Cr. 2022 IN/Ln. 3065 IN). This project, which includes
follow-up operations in Karnataka, was approved by the World Bank Group in
April 1989.
6.2       Production.  At appraisal, it was estimated that, as a result of the
project, the area under irrigated mulberry would increase by 14,000 ha, that
about 20,000 ha of mulberry area would be replanted with improved planting
material and existing (mostly rainfed) mulberry areas would benefit from
improved farming practices. These targets were revised in 1985. The
comparison between staff appraisal report (SAR) targets, revised targets and
final achievements is summarized below:

Area under                                 Revised
Mulberry                  Estimate         Estimate     Achievement
---------____--(ha)------------------
New planting               14,000           18,500         30,338
Replanting                 20,000           20,000         15,253
6.3       As a result of the increase in area and productivity, it was
estimated at appraisal that, at full development, incremental raw silk
production would increase by 1,600 tons p.a., including 1,000 tons of high-
quality bivoltine silk. The total target for raw silk production has been
substantially exceeded with incremental silk production and re-estimated to
have reached over 2,400 tons at project closing in 1988. However, due to the
difficulties mentioned above (para. 5.3) the share of bivoltine silk (about
100 tons in 1988) was still substantially below the appraisal estimate.
6.4       On-Farm Credit.  Under the project's credit component, loans were to
be provided to sericulturalists through commercial banks for on-farm
development (planting new mulberry, purchasing silkworm rearing equipment and
building rearing houses), for establishing cottage basins and for improved
charkas. Actual credit disbursements as against the appraisal and revised
targets have been as shown below:
Credit Components                       Revised Target          Actual
----------------(Rs'000)-------------------
On-farm development        50,400          59,520               68,361
Cottage basin              16,000           8,280                6,999
Charkas                         -          11,160                6,658
As shown above, the revised financial targets were exceeded or almost reached
for the on-farm development and cottage basin sub-components. The shortfall
in credit disbursements for improved charkas was due mainly to the
non-acceptability of the improved charka by many entrepreneurs and partly due
to lack of skilled reelers and low unit returns in the new areas. Credit
repayment is reported to be satisfactory although no detailed data were
available.
6.5      Department of Sericulture.  Even by the original completion date
(1985), most of the ph'ysical facilities were completed with the main exception



- 7 -
of the cold stores (see para. 5.9). Staff recruitment was initially slow and
never reached full strength mainly due to diversion of local funds for drought
relief (see para. 5.9). The facilities which were added in the 1985 review
were all completed by the credit closing. Details are provided in Part 111/4.
6.6      Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation.  Although some delay occurred
in the civil works component and the procurement of equipment, the KSIC
facilities were also completed well before the original project closing date.
However, contrary to SAR estimates, the investments made by KSIC have so far
failed for the reasons explained earlier (paras. 5.4. and 5.5) to make the
Corporation profitable as shown below:

6.7       Research.  Due to delays in construction of facilities and staff
positioning, the component suffered a setback. This adversely affected
especially the progress of the bivoltine programme. However, in the later
part of the project (starting in 1987), KSDI developed a range of suitable
bivoltine races and some progress was made in the further improvement of
mulberry varieties. Adequate research support for post-cocoon processing
technology was not provided.
6.8       Technical Assistance and Study Tours.  A total of 70 man-months of
consultancy was earmarked for utilization by KSSDI, CSRTI, DOS, Central Silk
Board (CSB) and KSIC, which were almost fully used. They were found to be
useful and especially the consultancies provided to KSSD1 and CSRTI helped
considerably to advance mulberry and silkworm breeding. The entire allocation
of 380 man-months of local training was utilized by DOS and CSB, but 38 of the
80 man-months of overseas training provided for KSSDI staff were not utilized
due to staff se3ection delays. Practically all staff trained, locally and
overseas, remained with the respective organizations.
6.9      Project Evaluation Study.  The study was entrusted to the Institute
for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) and initiated in 1981 as foreseen in the
SAR (for details, see Part III, 6 C).
6.10     Economic Rate of Return.  At appraisal, the ERR for the whole project
was estimated at 22Z. Using 1989 constant prices, the re-estimated ERR
amounts to 202. Factors contributing to the slight decrease are mainly the



- 8 -
low value added to raw silk and silk waste by KSIC and the poor performance of
cottage basin (for details, see Part III, 6 B and Table 1).
6.11     Financial Performance.  At appraisal, it was estimated that the
financial rate of return for new irrigated farms would be 132, for replanting
existing farms with improved mulberry varieties 152, and for improved rainfed
farms over 50Z. Due mainly to an increase in cocoon prices, the financial
rates of return have been reestimated at 262, 31% and above 502, respectively.
6.12     The KSIC was projected to achieve an operating profit of Rs 12.3
million in Year 5 resulting in an IRR of 161 over a 13-year period. Contrary
to expectations, KSIC failed to become profitable with a resulting negative
IRR. The IRR for cottage basin reelers was estimated at 32Z. Due mainly to a
substantial increase in cocoon prices which was not sufficiently compensated
by silk yarn prices, the IRR is now estimated at 5Z, i.e., less than the
opportunity cost of capital.
6.13     Project Impact.  The project had a significant impact on the agro-
industry sector of Karnataka with a substantial spillover effect on
sericulture in neighboring areas of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. By
utilizing and strengthening existing agencies, the project had a considerable
impact on institution building, especially in research and extension. The
planting of over 30,000 ha to mulberry has improved the physical environment.
With an estimated incremental annual employment of over 230,000 workers and
about 9,000 additional positions created in DOS (35Z staff and 652
skilled/unskilled labor), the project has played a vital role in the
alleviation of rural poverty and unemployment.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1      The Government continues to support the investment undertaken by the
project and further the promotion of sericulture in the State. The farming
community has generally accepted the improved husbandry techniques and areas
under n lberry are continuing to expand. The low acceptance of bivoltine
rearing for commercial cocoon production by the farmers, however, constitutes
a continuing project risk.
7.2      It can be assumed that the project will maintain an acceptable level
of net benefits throughout its economic life, especially in view of the
start-up of the National Sericulture Project, which inter alia will provide
continuing support to the Karnataka sericulture sector.
8. Bank Performance
8.1      The Bank performed well from identification through project
appraisal, responding swiftly and generally in a technically sound manner to
the borrower's requirements. A total of 12 supervision missions were fielded
over the seven and half year's of the project period (see Part 111/8), which
were properly timed, suitably staffed and beneficial to the project.
8.2      However, realizing the importance of specialized cold stores for the
processing of bivoltine eggs, the Bank should have insisted on the appointment



- 9 -
of consultants at an early stage which would have been helpful to avoid
subsequent delays. The other main lessons learned from project implementation
that may be relevant to other Bank-financed projects are:
(a) In the case of projects which partly depend on research findings,
sufficient time should be allowed for start-up of research
programmes crucial to the implementation of specific components and
to develop procedures to ensure field trials at an early stage (see
para. 6.7).
(b) Where the procurement of highly specialized equipment is required,
its availability in the borrower's country should have been
assessed at an early stage (see para. 5.3).
(c) Care should be taken at an early stage to address risks associated
with the implementation of individual components as these become
apparent (mulberry replanting, bivoltine silk production and
commercial risks of KSIC operation). (See para. 5.7).
(d) For the commercial viability of KSIC, the project should have
focussed not only on the modernization of the filatures and spun
silk factory, but also on the restructuring of KSIC through closure
of uneconomic units (see para. 5.4).
9. Borrower Performance
9.1      The borrower performed very well throughout the whole project cycle.
All ministries and agencies collaborated fully with the World Bank missions at
the preparation and appraisal stage and were supportive to the supervision
missions.
9.2      The borrower adopted all the agreed covenants (see Part III/7),
except for audited accounts which were initially submitted with considerable
delays and the situation was only rectified in 1986. Project management was
satisfactory throughout and staff resourcs were adequately deployed and
trained. However, the slow and ultimately reduced recruitment of mainly
extension staff by the borrower may have contributed to delays in the
achievement of various targets.
9.3      Experience gained by the borrower was that:
(i) Adequate trained staff in sufficient numbers have to be recruited
at an early stage of the project to provide the required
implementation capacity (see para. 5.2).
(ii) Tendering and import procedures (including duty exemptions) should
have been decided at an early stage to avoid delays in the project
implementation (see para. 5.3).
(iii) There is need to ensure timely auditing to comply with the
respective covenants (see para. 9.2).

10. Project Relationship
10.1     The Bank-borrower relationship was satisfactory throughout the
project period. A fruitful dialogue was maintained between GOI as principal
borrower, GOR and the implementing agencies on the one side and the Bank on
the other. Only with regard to the first project extension, a minor problem
occurred due to the borrower s delayed submission of audit reports and the
Bank's subsequent slowness in the approval of the projrct. extension resulting
in some disbursement delays.
11. Consulting Services
11.1     The SAR included a total of 70 man-months of consultants' time in
support of KSSDI, CSRTI, DOS and KSIC, which were almost fully utilized (see
para. 6.8). With an allocation of over US$25 million for civil works and
equipment, contractors and suppliers played a major role in the project and,
with the exception of some delays in construction work, performed well
throughout the project.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1     There were four main documents containing the legal agreements for
the project, namely the Development Credit Agreement, a Project Agreement, an
Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC) Agreement and an
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) Agreement. All documents here
clear and concise and generally the parties adhered to the agreements. Two
amendments (1985 and 1987) had to be made to the Development Credit Agreement
reflecting the extensions of closing dates and amendments to Schedules I and
II.
12.2     The Staff Appraisal Report provided a useful framework for the Bank
and the borrower to implement the project and monitor its progress. However,
the successive extensions and the depreciation of rupee reduced the SAR's
usefulness, especially in providing a financial guidance.
12.3     Not all financial data relevant to the PCR preparation were readily
available. This was mainly due to the fact that the data were not collected
and processed to serve as basis for a broad ex-post evaluation but rather for
short-term monitoring of project results.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Achievement from the Borrower's Perspective
1.        The overall achievement of the Karnataka Sericulture Project is
noteworthy, despite holdups and a few disappointments. Sericulture was
extended from 8,200 to 13,100 villages. Sericulture families have increased
from 470,000 families to 627,000 families. The area of mulberry increased
from 110,000 ha to 141,300 ha, 164Z over the target of 18,500 ha. Even the
replanting which most Indian projects fail to take up, achieved 75Z of its
target. Cocoon production increased from 36,250 tons to 50,500 tons. Most
noteworthy is that silk production increased from 2,700 tons to 5,317 tons, an
increased of nearly 96Z.
2.        Equally noteworthy is that technical achievements have been as a
result of the encouragement from the Project. At least 6 new varieties have
been introduced and the most popular new variety, M5, has replaced 20,000 ha -
a highly encouraging accomplishment. New varieties for rainy, highland, more
tropical and drought zones have also been developed during the project period.
A technical package of inputs and practices have been developed for these new
varieties. Although not all have been approved by the scientific community,
they will have a huge impact in coming years. In addition, and equally
noteworthy, is that yields of cocoons per 100 disease-free layings (Dfls) has
increased to 25 kgs and 20 kgs from 17 kgs under irrigated and rainfed
mulberry respectively -- a direct manifestation of the crossbreeding of
silkworms. This crossbreeding program brought into production bivoltine worms
crossed with natives; and this cross with bivoltine worms upgraded the
quantity and quality of silk. The renditta has decreased from 13 to 15 under
irrigated and rainfed conditions to 9.5 and 12 respectively - another
manifestation of the crossbreeding encouraged by the project.
3.        Finally the infrastructure developed in Karnataka h.- not only
promoted the growth of the industry in Karnataka, but also the border areas of
two other states, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, by providing outlets for
their cocoons, higher yielding silkworms, and new and high yielding varieties
of mulberry.
Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III
4.        The country data, defining the project profile at completion as
present in Part III, was prepared by the Government of Karnataka and the
Department of Sericulture and discussed thoroughly in the field. It was
collated into the Table 1 to 4, cross-checked with the field tables, and
served as the basis for the tables in Part III.
Evaluation of Bank's Performance and Lessons Learned
5.        Bank personnel were recognized as professional in all respects.
Most mission members were highly qualified in their respective fields. There
were occasions, however, when the composition of supervision missions was not
appropriate to address the kinds of implementation problems occurring.



- 12 -
6.        One of the important components was to establish cold storage
plants, which is crucial for processing the bivoltine silkworm eggs and
producing multivoltine silkworm eggs. The cold store equipment required had
to be able to maintain variable temperature, exact humidity, air and light for
preservation of silkworm eggs, silkworm moths and seed cocoons. If India is
to make a technological breakthrough, this equipment is a basic requirement.
Otherwise, there would be no quality change in its silk. The appraisal cost
estimates of the cold stores was not unrealistic.
7.        Moreover the tendering process was not monitored close enough, as
the State adopted LCB procedures instead of ICB procedures. The Bank experts
should have known that this equipment which needed such exacting temperature
and humidity controls could not have been produced in India. Because none of
the local bids could provide the equipment according to specifications, all
bids were rejected by the Government's own technical committee. The Bank then
recommended consultants to draw up specifications for the 13 grainage/cold
store plants. This process and other delays caused a price escalation due
mostly to exchange rate (60Z increase in value of the Japanese Yen)
differences and a unexpected customs duty of about 90Z on the cost of imported
equipment. GOI, at the plea of the Government of Karnataka and the Bank,
reduced the duty to 45Z. Nevertheless, there was a much higher duty than what
was anticipated at Appraisal. Moreover, the delay in completing this
component sooner caused the low level of achievement in bivoltine silk
production. The lesson learned is that more realistic estimates of the
equipment must be made at appraisal and that any government commitments, such
as custom duties are fixed in a side letter with the participating Government
agencies.
8.        Another major component that the Bank should have placed more
emphasis was the reeling component. While the Bank supported the State
Corporation, it failed to design a program that would stimulate new or
traditional reelers to have proper training to handle the multivoltine and
bivoltine cocoons. As a result, while the achievement in plantation,
equipment and rearing house was very good, achievements for upgraded cottage
basin or semi-automatic reeling equipment was poor. Reelers were not skilled,
management/entrepreneur training was not given, and an incentive program was
not in place for the early years to encourage the private sector. The lesson
learned is that the Bank should have identified the needs of the reeling
sector, not just the public sector, and it should have provided a program with
new improved equipment and incentives to stimulate participation of existing
private reelers.
9.        Another major lesson learned was that the national procedures for
clearing new varieties of mulberry and silkworm races should have been
investigated prior to appraisal and a streamlined approach should have been
sought by the appraisal to speed up the introduction and distribution of new
mulberry and silkworm eggs.



- 13 -
Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
10.       The performance of the participating institutions in overall project
planning and implementation was good. The implementation of the project was
slowed by a shortage of improved varieties of mulberry, higher yielding
silkworm multivoltine and bivoltine eggs.
11.       The other major lessons learned were:  (a) there is a need to train
and encourage skilled reelers in the new areas where bivoltine reelers and
cocoon auction halls are placed; (b) if the private reelers are not available
KSMB, a state organization, should be able to provide assured market to the
silk cocoon producers in the new area; (c) the project should have supported
strengthening of the private reeling sector; (d) research should concentrate
on developing bivoltine silkworm races and mulberry suitable to the different
agro-climatic areas as well as a management package that is economically
viable; (e) the Central Silk Board plus CSRTI and the Silk Technology section
of KSSDI should develop and/or import technology for processing the bivoltine
cocoons and provide adequate training facilities to the bivoltine cocoon
reelers; (f) the State of Karrnataka should pay more attention in providing
advisory services to the reelers by organizing reeling technical service
centers and employing qualified personnel to work in these centers; (g) the
State of Karnataka should promote bivoltine cocoon and silk production by
recommending prices of Rs 10 per kg for cocoons over the highest price
multivoltine cocoons, and Rs 100 per kg over the highest price multivoltine
silk; and (h) the State of Karnataka should seek a way for bivoltine reelers
to purchase their cocoons directly from the sericulturists and pay at the
market rate.

B. Economic Imoact
Agoraisal Estimate          Actual
Economic Rate of Return                   22%                    20% 1/
Underlying Assumptions
SAR. Economic costs of the project were based on capital investment
and operating costs for production and processing infrastructure, on-farm
development and cottage basin capital and production costs, and KSIC net
incremental working capital. No attempt was made to quantify benefits from
investment in research, technical assistance and foreign training or the
project evaluation study, and costs for these components were not included
in the analysis. All costs were net of duties, taxes, price contingencies,
interest and other transfer payments, but included physical contingencies of
5%-10% for civil works, equipment, vehicles and incremental operating costs.
Traded components in construction costs, operating costs, KSIC equipment and
fertilizer were adjusted by estimated standard conversion factors of
0.82-0.84. Opportunity cost for unskilled and semi-skilled labour was valued
at 70% of wage rates.
The export parity price for raw silk was derived from Japanese
imports of standard 20/22 dernier, mixed grade quality. Added value from
KSIC manufactures was taken at domestic pric.es because of the specialty
nature of production for the domestic market and difficulty in comparison
with internationally traded fabrics that include a design element.
In the future without the project, it was assumed that 25% of the
targeted 14,000 ha for new production would be converted to sericulture with
existing yield levels, producing about 200 tons raw silk for reeling by
.cottage basins and charaka units and about 65 tons silk waste. The remaining
area (10,500 ha) would remain under well-managed irrigated farms producing
traditional crops (paddy, maize, cotton, sugarcane) with an average annual
net income of Rs3,900/ha. Area and yields for existing rainfed irrigated
farms were assumed to remain at current levels. The analysis was calculated
for a 20-year period during which a major equipment replacement was assumed
necessary.
PCR. Using the same major underlying assumptions, the re-estimation
of the ERR was carried out for the whole project on the basis of 1989
constant prices. Past project investment costs, net of duties and taxes,
were adjusted to 1989 constant prices by using wholesale price index
deflator factors. Foreign exchange costs were valued at the prevailing
exchange rates and local costs were converted into border prices by a
standard conversion factor of 0.80. In view of the improved employment
situation, no special conversion factor has been used for labour. In
the future without project situation it was assumed that 25% of the
actually planted area would be converted to sericulture. For
detailed calculations see Table 1.

Comments: The study was to be initiated by 31 March 1981. The Institute for Socio-economic Change was entrusted by G0O with its
Implementation. A benchmark survey was carried out in 1981 and subsequently the Institute continued to monitor the
project for about two years. Thereafter, surveys focussed only on selected topics/components of the project in rather
general terms.
