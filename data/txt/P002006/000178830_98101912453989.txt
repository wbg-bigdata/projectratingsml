PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
NIGERIA FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 72-UNI)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the First Education Project in
Nigeria, for which IDA Credit 72-UNI in the amount of US$20.0 million was
signed in March 1965. The credit was fully disbursed by January 25,
1978.   About $700,000 had been repaid, as scheduled, by March 31, 1978.
The audit report consists of an audit memorandum prepared by the Operations
Evaluation Department and a Project Completion Report (PCR), prepared by the
Western Africa Regional Office, dated December 19, 1977.
The audit memorandum is based on a review of various documents and
on discussions held in Washington and in the field. A three-member Opera-
tions Evaluation Department Mission visited Nigeria January 23-31, 1978,
and held discussions with officials of the Federal Ministries of Education
and Finance and the State Ministries of Education in Anambra and Kaduna and
staff of the coordinating consultants (Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall
and Partners). The contribution of these officials is gratefully acknow-
ledged and is fully reflected in the audit memorandum. The documents
reviewed included (i) the PCR, (ii) the 1963 report of the UNESCO Educa-
tional Investments Programming Mission to Nigeria, (iii) Nigeria's
National Development Plans for 1962-68, 1970-74 and 1975-80, (iv) the
Credit Agreement and four related Project Agreements and supplementary
letters, (v) the Appraisal Report No. TO-434b dated December 16, 1964,
prepared for this project, (vi) the Report and Recommendation of the
President to the Executive Directors, No. P-413 dated December 21, 1964,
(vii) a completion report dated March 1977 prepared by the Coordinating
Consultants, (viii) Volume X (Education) of the Bank's report on
"Economic Growth of Nigeria" (No. Af-34c, November 29, 1965), (ix) the
Appraisal Reports, No. PE-33a dated March 9, 1972 (for the Second Education
Project (Loan 814-UNI)) and No. 60a-UNI dated May 25, 1973 (for the Third
Education Project (Loan 929-UNI)) and (x) the material available in the
Association's files relating to Credit 72-UNI covering the period from
1962 to date. Discussions have also been held with staff of the Bank who
were involved in the implementation of this project.     No comments have
been received from the Borrower and the coordinating consultants to whom
a copy of the draft audit report was sent on February 2, 1979.
The PCR, with which this audit concurs, reports on the implemen-
tation of the project, its cost, and some remaining problems, and makes a
number of recommendations for action by-the government. However, in the
light of the serious extraordinary difficulties encountered in this
project, a more thorough examination of project design and supervision
was called for and the audit memorandum attempts this.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
NIGERIA FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 72-UNI)
HIGHLIGHTS
Under the Nigeria First Education Project (Credit 72-UNI,
signed in March 1965) IDA provided US$20 million to help expand,
diversify and improve secondary and technical education and teacher
training in Nigeria. The Project originally included 190 schools,
and was more than twice as large as any Education Project approved
previously. After the Civil War of 1967-70 the number of schools
in the Eastern Region was reduced, but the final project still
included 137 institutions. The Project emphasized development in
the Northern region, a relatively deprived area educationally (para.
5, PCR para. 1.06). The Credit was completely disbursed by January
25, 1978, when the project was substantially completed.
This ambitious project suffered serious problems in imple-
mentation caused in part by management arrangements that were
inadequate in view of the considerable number of bureaucracies and the
large geographical area involved (para. 4, PCR paras. 1.04, 3.02).
The Civil War and the division of the four original Regions into first
12 and then 19 States compounded these problems.    The audit report also
notes limited institution building because of the extensive project
management role given to private expatriate firms which did not train
Nigerians (para. 12); the shortage of qualified Nigerian staff to
implement the project (paras. 10, 12, PCR paras. 1.07, 1.11, 3.03);
weaknesses in the local construction industry, equipment and furniture
procurement and architectural design work (paras. 15-20, 26-28, PCR
paras. 1.12-1.13). The report also draws attention to shortcomings in
project design and supervision (paras. 33-40, PCR paras. 1.10, 3.03).
Nevertheless, the overall implementation effort and
achievement have been considerable. Experience with this project
has influenced to some extent the Second and Third Education
Projects in Nigeria, particularly in regard to greater local
involvement in implementation and to reduced geographical coverage.



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
NIGERIA FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 72-UNI)
I.  Project Background and Summary
1.        Nigeria's National Development Plan for 1962-68 accorded the
highest priority to the development of agriculture and industry, to the
training of high and intermediate level manpower (such as extension
workers, supervisors, foremen, technicians, administrators and managers)
and to extending primary and secondary education as a base for this technical
education and training. The manpower needs, as roughly estimated by the
National Manpower Board for the period 1963-68, greatly exceeded the
possible output of the existing and planned training institutions. Plans
for educational development were prepared'by a number of commissions,
notably the Ashby Commission of 1960. However, it was the report of a
UNESCO Educational Investments Programming Mission of 1962 which formed
the basis of the Bank Group's first educational lending operation in
Nigeria.
2.        For the First Education Project (Credit 72-UNI), signed on March 1,
1965, a sum of US$20 million was provided to assist Nigeria tb:
(i) expand secondary education, including secondary teacher
training (54% of the total credit);
(ii) expand technical and craft training, including technical
teacher training (40%), and
(iii) increase the emphasis on science and vocationally oriented
subjects in secondary schools and on science in teacher
training colleges (6%).
This project originally involved 190 schools, of which 9 were to be newly con-
structed, 5 were to be converted to new uses, and 176 were to receive additions,
furniture and equipment. Following the Civil War of 1967 to 1970, 56 of the
60 project schools planned for the former Eastern Region were cancelled and 9
new ones were added. During the course of the project, some slight changes
were made in the project content as it related to each of the other former
regions. At the time of the Completion Mission, 1977, the project comprised
the following 137 schools:

Included in the estimates was housing for expatriate staff of project
institutions, leaving to the Borrower the responsibility of providing
housing for Nigerian staff.
3.        In the supplementary letters on educational objectives, the
Federal Government undertook to:
(a) modernize curricula, teaching methods and examination
procedures;
(b) increase the emphasis on practical agricultural education
in urban and rural schools and the practical bias in
secondary school curricula;
(c) use efficient and economical technical education programs
suited to Nigerian needs along with relevant examinations;
(d) ensure that staff of technical training institutions had
practical training and industrial experience and, as far
as practicable, arrange for all technical training institu-
tions to have advisory committees representative of
employers and appropriate government departments; and
(e) maintain a competent and efficient teaching and adminis-
trative staff, by such steps as effective training programs
and adequate salary levels, comparable with those found
at similar levels of private employment.
4.        The project attempted to redress somewhat the regional imbalance
in education and training facilities by allocating the bulk of the invest-
ment to the Northern Region which had traditionally been relatively
undersupplied with such facilities. The project items were scattered
widely over Nigeria's vast expanse of 357,000 square miles as follows:

1/ As Regions became States and large States became smaller States, each
unit assumed responsibility for the project items located within its
boundaries.
2/ The Federal Territory has, in fact, been changed but these figures
represent the Federal items situated in Lagos.
3/ The rearrangement of boundaries in 1976 resulted in two items being
included in the new Benue State which had formerly been located within
the 1968-76 boundaries of Kwara State.

5.         The project was originally expected to cost about US$30 million
with a foreign exchange component of about US$11 million. Thus 45% of the
credit (US$9 million) was intended to cover local costs. The geographical
distribution of this investment and its subsequent revisions in the light
of the creation of 12 states was as follows:

The project, as it applied to the Eastern States was re-appraised in
October-November 1970, following the cessation of hostilities. The project
cost for the Eastern Region then reverted to the 1965 figure (US$3.96m.)
divided as follows: East Central $2.02m., Rivers $0.79m. and South
Eastern $1.15m.

6.        Under the Credit Agreement, a private firm of architectural
consultants was to be employed by the Federal Government to assist the
Federal and Regional Governments in carrying out the project and to
ensure coordination and uniformity. It was expected that these con-
sultants would, through their participation in the project, help to
establish architectural design and cost standards for all school
construction in Nigeria. The selection of sites and construction of
government schools were the responsibility of the several Ministries
of Works, in consultation with the Ministries of Education. The Credit
Agreement and related Project Agreements provided that the five
Governments would employ additional architects and engineers to handle
the added workload. For the 39 private state-aided schools included in
the project (known as Voluntary Agency Schools), construction was the
responsibility of their proprietors (mainly missionary societies).
7.        The Association's approval was needed for (a) the Federal
Government's relending agreements, (b) the choice of, and the contract
with, the coordinating consultants, (c) the designs, specifications,
contracts and work schedules for the construction of the project schools
and (d) the choice of building contractors. Credit effectiveness was
made dependent upon the employment of the firm of coordinating consultants.
The closing date was fixed at December 31, 1969.
8.        Although greatly delayed by a number of factors, most of the
project's new institutions had been completed by March 1977, and many of
the additions lacked only minor works, such as connections to electricity
or water supplies. The Completion Mission reported that.in July 1977 87%
of the planned facilities (classrooms, laboratories, dormitories) had been
completed, but that only 75% of the intended facilities were being used as
originally planned. Some 4% had been put to "other uses" and 8% had been
abandoned when other sub-items could not be completed. Construction work
was continuing on the other items. By January 25, 1978, the Credit had
been fully disbursed.
II. Principal Issues
1. Design of Arrangements for Project Management
9.        This was one of the pioneer Bank Group projects in education.
Its appraisal mission was the fifth sent out in this sector and the project
was by far the largest in the sector up to that time - the previous largest
having been a credit of US$8.5m. to Pakistan approved a few months prior
to this credit. Both IDA and Nigeria wished to expedite the processing
of an education project. IDA by-passed both the formal preparation stage
and the receipt of a formal credit application thus advancing project



- 6 -
appraisal by about one year. However, the result of this was that the
prospective borrower was less involved in project preparation than he
might have been. The list of project items which was appraised had been
drawn from the recommendations of the 1962 UNESCO Investments Programming
mission as reviewed by a Bank Group reconnaissance mission in 1963. While
it is clear from the appraisal report that some of the problems of imple-
menting a project had been identified, particularly in regard to the short-
age of technically qualified manpower, the visits to the majority of sites
and detailed discussions on project management - both needed in order to
appreciate the special country problems and to formulate appropriate
arrangements for implementation - were not undertaken. As became in-
creasingly clear during project implementation, the management arrange-
ments made for this project were inadequate in view of the geographical
size, communication difficulties and human resource situation in Nigeria.
(a) The Use of Coordinating Consultants
10.       The appraisal mission had identified some of the problems facing
the regular services for implementing development programs - the Ministries
of Works were understaffed, overworked, faced with a rising workload and
losing their qualified expatriate staff faster than these could be replaced
by qualified Nigerians. IDA expected the project to introduce measures to
reduce the cost of school buildings - at that time an important objective
of educational lending - namely, closer attention to bidding procedures,
supervision of construction, contract awards, material specifications and
design standards and establishing design standards over the country as a
whole. For these reasons, IDA required that a private firm of consultants
be employed to oversee project implementation, namely:
(i) to propose criteria and goals for economical school construction;
(ii) to coordinate school planning and design;
(iii) to advise on the employment of qualified architects, engineers
and contractors;
(iv) to supervise bidding and contract procedures and awards; and
(v) to supervise construction and disbursement.
As elaborated in the appraisal report, the firm's duties were expected
to include supervising the preparation of tenders, controlling the award
of contracts, checking plans and drawings and, as required, assisting in
their preparation. This extensive role was more appropriate for a govern-
ment agency. It was not surprising that, as both the consultants and
the Borrower have observed, the consultants came to be regarded by the
Borrower as IDA's representative and the project as IDA's rather than as
Nigeria's.



- 7 -
11.       There were several problems with this role in addition to
those noted in para. 3.09 of the completion report. The association had
not discussed it sufficiently with the country in advance. At credit
negotiations the country's officials requested explanations of the con-
sultants' proposed role and functioning. The scope of the consultants'
duties generated extensive discussion both during negotiations and over
the period of one year of contract negotiations between the government
and the firm. During these contract negotiations the consultants envi-
saged a role and authority beyond that which the government was prepared
to grant, especially as far as procedures for bidding and contracting
were concerned. The distinction between the consultants' role and that
of the Ministries of Works on design matters was difficult to define,
especially as the design work on some project schools was already far
advanced and the Northern Region was already using the design standards
of the same firm of consultants. The eventual contract required the
government to provide for the consultants, at the start of their work,
site plans and drawings of existing structures at the sites where
extensions were contemplated - the vast majority of project schools.
Neither these plans nor the technical staff to prepare them were available.
12.       The arrangement was insufficient in that it did not deal with
the essential question of supplementing the resources of the Ministries
of Works. As the consultants have indicated, it would have been better
for their role to have included the preparation of standard drawings and
bills of quantities - instead of being limited to setting design standards
which would have saved considerable work in the Ministries of Works. Given
the financial and logistical impossibility of entrusting full site super-
vision to the firm, the burden of site supervision also remained with the
Ministries of Works. The project did not provide the additional staff needed
within the Ministries of Works to cope with the added workload.l/ The design
of the consultants' role did not specifically call for the training of
Nigerians. The contract ultimately negotiated between the government and the
consultants provided for the consultants to train Nigerians assigned to the
firm by the government; however none was ever assigned.
1/ For example, the Northern Region Ministry of Works, the one most
heavily affected, was faced with a US$27.4 million school construction
program for 1967 and 1968, funded by IDA, USAID and Nigeria. Its
staff included only eight architects and one quantity surveyor, even
though budgetary provision existed for 25 and 7 respectively. During
negotiation of the contract with the consultants, the borrowers'
officials, aware of the problem, asked for credit funds to be used to
pay for additional staff and for the consultants to recruit such
staff to work under the governments. Granted the flexibility of
technical assistance salary scales, suitable inducements could have
been offered. However, the Association offered no solution, such as
a possible technical assistance grant or a reallocation of credit
proceeds to cover the needs of the Ministries; instead, it merely
objected to the use of the credit to finance government staff.

13.        In retrospect, it appears that the design of project management
arrangements required much more thought and preparatory work than had been
given to it by IDA. A more efficient approach would have been either to
have given to a firm the entire architectural responsibility or to have
included in the project financing to strengthen the Ministries of Works
to enable them to carry out the project. In either case, the responsibility
for national coordination of project implementation would have been better
placed in the hands of a government unit assisted by such experts as may
have been needed. In this respect the arrangements for the Second and
Third Education projects showed improvements over those made for the
First (see para. 47).
(b) Arrangements for Furniture/Equipment Procurement
14.       The Association overlooked the need for special management arrange-
ments for procuring instructional equipment and furniture in such a large
project, particularly the need for technical assistance and coordination
at the regional or federal level. The appraisal report did not deal with
the issue. Originally, IDA had envisaged the firm of consultants as the
coordinating agency. However, the government opted to use the London-based
Crown Agents, its traditional overseas procurement agency and the question
of local coordination was not pursued by the Association.
2. Physical Implementation
(a) The Implementation Schedule and Time Overruns
15.       The Association had estimated that project implementation would
require about 3.5 years (ending in December 1968), an estimate which appears
to have taken little account of the size of the country, the relatively
unprepared state of the project and the time required to recruit consultants
and have their design standards formulated, agreed and applied. The project
was about 87% completed by April 1977 and as of November 1978, only a few
of the project buildings remained unfinished and work is continuing on these.
This is one of the longest time overruns experienced on an education project;
however, the unusual country circumstances of this project - in particular,
the civil war which probably delayed the completion of the project by about
five years - are well described in the completion report which notes,
in addition (paras. 1.05-1.13, 3.01-3.11):
(i) delays in concluding the contract with the coordinating consultants;
(ii) the successive administrative and political reorganizations of 1968
(four regions becoming twelve states) and 1976 (twelve states
becoming nineteen) - each change spreading thinner the very limited
numbers of experienced personnel in the ministries; and accentuating
the shortages of project management personnel and the administrative
inefficiencies at the Regional or State level;



- 9 -
(iii) weaknesses in the construction industry - shortages of imported
materials, the impact of the civil war, the crippling effect of
slow payment of contractors and architectural designs which were
unsuited to the limited technology at the command of the smaller
contractors, and
(iv) the wide geographical dispersion of project items which posed
severe problems of supervision and coordination.
As no implementation schedule was included in the appraisal report it is
not clear how the estimate that construction would be completed by the
end of 1968 was arrived at.
16.       These causes of delay interacted with one another in many ways
and the impact of one was sometimes exacerbated by another. For example,
soon after the consultants' contract had been signed, the disturbed
political situation in July 1966 (when the Lagos airport was closed) caused
the team to postpone its arrival to September. It was to the firm's credit
that its design guide was approved by the government as early as March 1967 -
but this was just before the civil war began. Because of the variations in
the impact of different weaknesses and problems in each region or state the
performances varied widely, as is shown in the following table:

17.       Delays were also caused by factors specific to one or a few
project items in a State. For example, in the Federal Territory, the
design work for the staff houses and flats for the National Technical
Teachers College was delayed by changes in plans, including a new site
plan decided on towards the end of 1970; the contract for construction
of classrooms and dormitories was not signed until April, 1972; funds
were not allocated by the Federal Ministry of Education for staff housing,
and this was not built. The Western Region depended on its Ministry of
Works for architectural design work and made slower initial progress
than the Northern Region which made greater use of private architects.
In various areas, some schools were withdrawn from the project and
replaced by others; the designs for metal windows were impractical for
fabrication and had to be redone; structural steelwork was not delivered
on time and, when delivered, was not drilled for bolts to fasten it;
disputes arose between architects and contractors; a supplier was
unable to deliver roofing material for 2 months; contractors were late
in ordering essential materials; roof trusses were not delivered. In
Bauchi, four of the five project items were abandoned, even though
they were already from 40% to 65% complete.
18.       Many of the Voluntary Agency Schools were completed early
and at an economical price. Only one out of the 39 was less than 85%
completed in April, 1977; and, as a group, they were 98% completed.
Because of the traditional autonomy of these schools, and the established
practice of government grants to reimburse them for 50% of new construc-
tion, they were given freedom from IDA procedures to construct their
own schools, subject only to the coordinating consultants' approval of
standards and designs, and their certification of work completed. The
equipping of these schools was somewhat less efficiently done since
they were subject to the same delivery problems as other schools and
not all their principals accorded high priority to practical subjects.
19.       While it is instructive to review the delays and their origins,
it is important to note that this project, involving one of the largest
and most widely dispersed school construction programs in the history of
Bank Group educational lending, has been substantially implemented. For
this achievement, considerable credit is due to the unremitting efforts
of the coordinating consultants and the several officials in various
ministries in Nigeria over the long history of this project to keep
implementation moving - efforts that prevented a total collapse of the
project.
(b) Buildings
20.       The consultants prepared standards for construction, a pro-
cedures guide and a design guide. The initial design guide specified
performance standards in such a way that some executive architects
prepared uneconomical and difficult-to-build designs. These designs



- 12 -
had to be redone, and the design guide had to be revised. Ministry of
Works and IDA officials have observed that architectural designs were
sometimes unnecessarily sophisticated and did not take into account i/e
technical capabilities of small local contractors (PCR, para. 1.13).-
In regard to the designs under the project, some school officials com-
plained of not being consulted at the design stage and have criticized
the housing and dormitory standards as being too low. The consultants,
in reviewing their own performance, have observed that some design features
have been inappropriate for maintenance, such as large glass panes and
special sanitary fittings which have proved difficult to replace, and
paint colors which have been too light and readily show stains. The idea
of the heavy roof for thermal control was scientifically sound but depended
on too fine and precise a manipulation of windows for best results. The
consultants consider that the design guide for this project was of limited
value; it was the first of such efforts and was important in raising
some issues such as space standards and economy; however, they felt, in
retrospect, that the design guide should have done more to warn against
some of the problems that were encountered. It is not clear that the
consultants' design and cost standards have iqluenced subsequent school
construction in Nigeria as had been intended.- However, the Second
Project design guide, prepared by the same firm of consultants, benefitted
from some of the experiences gained under the First Project.
21.        By March 1977, some 78% of the target of 17,453 secondary school
places had been provided (PCR, Annex 7). Construction was continuing and
all new buildings and most additions were expected to be completed even-
tually. Five schools had, however, been abandoned (PCR, para. 3.13,
Annex 4) - in one case because of unexpectedly deep, unstable soils, in
others because of contractor weaknesses, either financial or technological.
22.        One of the project objectives was to increase the emphasis
on science and vocationally oriented subjects in secondary schools,
including the teaching of science in teacher training colleges. This
objective accounted for only 6% of the credit but affected a third of
1/ One example of this was noted in Sokoto where the heavy concrete
roof slabs, which the consultants suggested for resisting the intense
insolation experienced in that region, could not be lifted into
position by the contractor. Subsequently, the Ministry of Works
redesigned the roof, using glass wool in the ceiling for thermal
control. In Bauchi, one of the principal causes of the abandonment
of sites by one contractor was the heavy roof slab which, despite
the requests of the Ministry of Works, the consultants refused to
alter on the erroneous assumption that IDA would not agree to a change.

there has been such influence.

the 137 project items. The percentage completed was higher for science
facilities than for workshops, but still considerably less than for
ordinary classrooms as is shown by the following table:l/

23.       In the eight completely new institutions which were built,
enrollment was generally at, or above, the planned level. However, at two
new training centers - Maiduguri and Makurdi - enrollment was from 20%
to 30% below the planned level: at one, because of a change in objectives
after appraisal, and at the other, because of use of space by administrative
units of the new State Ministry of Education (PCR, paras. 4.11 and 4.12).
The one new craft school (at Mubi) was substantially completed and used
as a comprehensive secondary school because of a change in education
policy in favor of such schools rather than separate craft schools.
24.       For the 123 institutions which were extended under the project,
only partial data on enrollment are available. The Completion Mission
visited 24 of the extended secondary schools and found that total enroll-
ment in these schools was 15,353 (PCR, Annex 8).    It is not known, however,
how much of this represents increases made possible by the additions. It
may be assumed that, in the light of the considerable social demand for
secondary education in Nigeria, all new places provided by the construction
have been filled. The appraisal report did not, in general, estimate the
new enrollments to individual extended schools but it did so for Edo College,
Benin, which, during the PCR mission visit, had an enrollment of 929 in
comparison with the appraisal figure of 800.
25.       The quality of construction varied from school to school - the
deficiencies resulting largely from inadequate capacity in the construction
industry, the competing demands of reconstruction after the Civil War, and
1/ PCR, Annex 7



- 14 -
the construction of some of the many minor project items by small, inex-
perienced contractors whose problems may have been aggravated by sometimes
unnecessarily sophisticated and technically difficult architectural designs.
Inadequate site supervision by the Governments and the coordinating consultants,
and slowness in the Governments' making payments to contractors also played
some part (PCR, paras. 1.12, 3.07).
(c) Equipment and Furniture
26.       Preparing lists which were acceptable to IDA was a lengthy process
because of unfamiliarity with IDA procedures; the States were also slow to
place indents - in Lagos and Mid-Western States these were not placed before
March 1972. Procurement of furniture and equipment was carried out by the
Crown Agents, London, including those items of furniture manufactured in
Nigeria. The Crown Agents had recommended, at the outset, that the
government appoint a procurement coordinator for the Federal Government or
one for each Region. This was never done and the Crown Agents had to deal
with individual schools directly. However, in mid-1973, the government
agreed that an equipment procurement specialist should be added to the
staff of the coordinating consultants. There can be no doubt that, under
the circumstances, the Crown Agents did an effective job in getting so
much equipment and furniture into the schools. For many years the Crown
Agents were the only effective coordinators of procurement of equipment
and furniture. However, several problems occurred for which the country
circumstances cannot be blamed.
27.       Contrary to the Government's undertaking in the Credit Agreement
and Project Agreements to maintain records, records were routinely destroyed
by the Crown Agents after two years. Prior to 1975, the Crown Agents
furnished inadequate information to the Government about the progress of
procurement and even lost track of whether items for certain schools had
been ordered at all.l/ In some cases, equipment was not ordered because
the Crown Agents' vital queries on specifications remained unanswered.
Equipment often arrived at ports without prior notification by the Crown
Agents or subsequent notification by the Government coastal agents to the
consultants, the project managers or the schools to which it was consigned.
The delivery to schools of imported items cleared at the Nigerian ports
was not well coordinated. Deliveries were sometimes made to schools
before construction was complete and furniture and equipment so delivered
was often unsatisfactorily stored. There were cases of delivery of the
crates to the wrong schools, faulty installation, the loss of many items
and damage to others. Because equipment was often not unpacked untii
after insurance coverage had expired, recovery from insurance firms could
not be made. The State Ministries of Works sometimes received crates
1/ The Consultants' completion report lists three technical and 18
other schools in which this problem occurred - items not having
been ordered which the Crown Agents assumed had been ordered.



- 15 -
without advising the Ministries of Education concerned. It was not until
1975 that these problems of liaison were corrected, after discussions
between IDA and the Crown Agents and between the coordinating consultants
and the Crown Agents. These discussions led to clearer procedures,
improved communications between the Crown Agents and the States, and the
strengthening of Crown Agents staff devoted to this project. However,
these improvements came generally too late to help this project.
28.       Furniture procurement was fraught with problems.     Double bunk
beds were to be supplied by a Malaysian firm but never arrived because of
(a) delays in providing a letter of credit and (b) rising prices. Most of
the remaining furniture was manufactured in Nigeria but there was inade-
quate inspection (and quality control) at the factories and some poor
quality furniture resulted. A British firm supplied kits for library
shelving, but, even after delivery difficulties- had been overcome, many
schools did not assemble these shelves. There was some confusion over the
delivery and allocation of the two different sizes of chairs and tables
designed for senior and junior pupils. However, on the whole, the schools
received their required supply of furniture. Partly as a result of its
experience in this project, the Borrower has arranged procurement of
equipment and furniture-under the Third Education Project differently.
The equipment lists are being coordinated by the project's coordinating
consultants and the purchasing is being done through a Nigerian
procurement agency.
(d) Maintenance
29.       Maintenance of physical plant has not been properly funded by
the Borrower. Many buildings have been found to have, broken windows and
peeling paint, and equipment has not been promptly repaired (PCR, para.
4.15). The Borrower has indicated that difficulties are being experienced
in maintaining imported equipment and has made some efforts to service
science equipment, including the use of mobile units, but this project pro-
vided no assistance in this direction.
(e) Costs and Disbursement
30.       The extraordinary increase in costs which occurred during the
prolonged period of implementation was due to increases in freight rates
and costs of materials, awards of.higher wages to labor, and the general
pressure on prices and wages brought about by the Civil War and the
demands of reconstruction-including war taxes. Furthermore, there was an
11% devaluation of the dollar against the naira during the implementation
period. For the incomplete project, costs exceeded the original estimate
by 31% in U.S. dollar terms.   This overrun has been financed from Nigerian
resources (PCR, para. 1.04). It is estimated that the cost overrun,
measured in dollars, will be 50% when-all construction is completed.     The
proceeds of the credit were used rather differently from the original
plans, equipment and furniture allocations being halved and the consultants



- 16 -
fees being doubled.   The increased costs for civil works came about
primarily because of price increases; for consultants' services this
increase arose because of the great extension in the life of the project.
Furniture and equipment cost figures were less than expected because many
items delivered before 1972 were not included in the accounts and the
amounts purchased were less than the amounts on the original lists,
as many of the items originally specified were no longer being produced
by the time bid invitations were sent out several years later. For the
States of the former Eastern Region, cost increases in civil works
prompted a request in 1974, acceded to by IDA, that equipment and furniture
be financed unilaterally by the States.
31.       The State Governments' procedures for claiming reimbursement
under the Credit were complex. They differed somewhat from one State to
another, but the procedure typically involved approval of the withdrawal
application at each successive stage as follows: (1) coordinating consul-
tants; (2) State Ministry of Works; (3) State Ministry of Education;
(4) State Ministry of Finance; (5) Federal Ministry of Finance; (6) Bank's
resident mission in Lagos and (7) IDA headquarters, with risks of delay at
each stage.
32.        The Borrower experienced difficulties in processing its claims
for reimbursement. In July 1972, it was reported that the Federal Govern-
ment had forwarded no claims for reimbursement to IDA for one year, al-
though the Government had paid its bills and had the necessary certificates.
For much of the equipment supplied before 1972, no reimbursement claims
were ever presented because the States were often unaware of the procedures
for making claims. In April 1974, two applications were mailed to IDA,
after having been delayed in the Federal Ministry of Finance for one year
and for eight months, respectively.
3. Overview of the effort made by IDA
(a) Implementation Assistance
33.        IDA's performance on this project should be viewed in the
context of the knowledge and resources at its command. In the project
design stage, IDA had had only very limited experiences in educational
lending; however, in other projects it had anticipated certain problems
and made arrangements to help resolve them. For example, the First
Tunisia Education Project (Credit 29-TUN, approved FY63) had included
a technical assistance grant to help Tunisia with school designs; the
two Pakistan Education Projects (Credits 49 and 50-PAK, approved FY64) had
included funds for experts to assist in equipment list preparation as
well as an arrangement for UNESCO to review these lists as to their
suitability for international bidding. In the first Morocco Education
Project (Credit 79-MOR, approved October 1965)- involving 21 schools
and a total project cost of about US$13.8 million - IDA had agreed to local



- 1 7 -
competitive bidding for civil works contracts of less than US$100,000 in
value and for equipment contracts of less than US$30,000 in value and no
prior IDA approval of such contract documents and awards was required.
The Nigeria First Education Project, especially in view of its extraordinary
size, would have benefitted from, but did not include, such facilitative
arrangements.
34.       At the implementation stage, IDA assistance, especially in the
critical period 1965-1972, appears to have been limited by comparison with
its efforts in some other .projects simultaneously experiencing difficulties.
In the case of the Morocco First Education Project, IDA arranged for a
UNESCO Cooperative Program architect to spend four weeks in the country
in 1972 assisting in expediting physical implementation. In the Korea
First Education Prbject an educational consultant was recruited and sent
by IDA for four months in 1970 to assist in briefing the architectural
consultants. These services were provided without charge to the countries
concerned. This kind of assistance was not provided for the project in
Nigeria despite its more serious problems of implementation delays; nor was
there any revision of the project to include the technical assistance needed
by the Ministries of Works. In 1972, after the Civil War was over, and the
project already three years delayed and less than 40% complete, IDA under-
took a review of the former Eastern Region component of the project which
resulted in the Second Education Project to help with reconstruction in the
Eastern States. At this stage IDA urged that the project implementation
units established to deal with the Second Education Project (and, later,
the Third) assume some responsibility for the First. These were positive
steps; however, in retrospect, it appears that it would have been better
to have undertaken a more thorough review and re-shaping, if necessary, of
the entire project and its implementation arrangements, once the magnitude
of the problems had become apparent.l/
(b) Supervision
35.        IDA appears not to have given sufficient recognition to the size
and supervision requirements of Nigeria which, in practical terms, was the
equivalent of several countries. Nigeria was allocated man-days in the field
much like other, and smaller, countries. For example, the first education projects
in Nigeria (US$20.0 million credit for some 190 institutions originally),
Senegal (US$2.0 million credit for five institutions) and Sierra Leone
(US$3.0 million credit for 16 institutions) were supervised in the
field at intervals of 8.6, 5.7 and 6.0 months, respectively, and with
average man-weeks per mission amounting to 2.4, 2.6 and 1.0 respectively.
During the first five years there were only four one-man missions to
Nigeria averaging 8.5 days each - too short a time to permit travel to
many of the State capitals let alone the project schools, and for adequate
contact with officials.
1/ The Regional Office has reservations as to whether any more substantial
changes than those actually made would have resulted in the project be-
ing brought to a more successful conclusion.

36.       None of these first four missions visited the Governments of
Lagos State, the Mid-Western State, or any of the six Northern States
except for a visit to Kaduna in December 1966. Further, the Borrower
considered that these earlier missions did not adequately brief the
staff of the Ministries involved in implementation on the procedures and
requirements of implementation, as was done by supervision missions after
1973. This direct briefing of States' officials by IDA was important in
view of the fact that the two intermediary agencies - Federal Government
and coordinating consultants - were not in a position to represent IDA and
could not sufficiently clarify its procedures. The civil war precluded
a visit to the Eastern States from 1967 to 1970. No mission reported
visiting the project sites or the Government of the North-Western State
until April 1972, the North-Eastern State until August 1973, the Mid-
Western and Benue-Plateau States until February 1974 and Lagos State
until April 1975. The lack of continuity of Government and Bank mission
personnel was recognized as a problem. An important policy of using
larger missions of longer duration in the field was introduced in 1974.
These missions were able to achieve better, but by no means adequate, cover-
age of State capitals and were able to visit some project sites.      However,
they were able to brief project units on procedures regarding imple-
mentation, reimbursement claims and equipment procurement and to advise
on resolving some of the causes of delays. This momentum of supervision and
supervision reporting declined considerably after August 1975, because
the Borrower's reluctance to receive missions rendered the scheduling
of such visits difficult.
37.        The following table summarizes the geographical scope of
coverage by supervision missions:

38.        There were 18 supervision missions in all during the 12 years
between the signing of the Credit Agreement and the arrival of the
Completion Mission. Educators participated only intermittently, however.
Of the 34 person-visits represented by these missions, architects
accounted for 19 (56%), educators accounted for eight (24%) and economists
accounted for seven (20%). There was only one visit by an educator during
the first five years of the project. No educator participated in the six
1971 through 1973 supervision missions. Educators played important roles
in the October 1970 mission, the two 1974 missions and the first mission in
1975, however. More frequent visits by IDA educators might have resulted
in greater involvement by Nigerian educators in the project, and in greater
achievement of its educational objectives.
39.       Additional field visits by Bank Group staff were undertaken - one
by three officials in May 1966 to assist in the negotiation of the Nigerian
Government's agreement with the architectural consultants; one by a lawyer
in early 1968, who visited Lagos and Kaduna to discuss the impact of the
division of the Regions into States (primarily in the North) on the adminis-
tration of the various projects supported by the Bank Group; another by two
officials in June 1972, to discuss delays in filing claims for reimbursement;
and visits in 1974 and 1975 by a representative of the Controller's Depart-
ment to advise on procedures for reimbursement claims for all loans and credits.
40.        In 1970, the Bank Group re-established its resident mission in Lagos,
after a five-year lapse. While the Borrower had hoped that this mission would
have authority to make many decisions without referring to Washington, and
thus speed up project implementation, this did not happen to any significant
extent in education. However, the staff of the resident mission was able
to visit the state capitals and discuss problems with the officials.
4. Implementation of Education Aspects
41.        The Federal and Regional Governments had undertaken, in their side
letters on educational objectives, to improve curricula, teaching methods,
examination procedures, the staffing of educational institutions, and
integration of technical schools with the employment world through
advisory committees.
42.       The secondary school curriculum now gives much more attention to
Africa and particularly to Nigeria and to the achievements of modern science
and technology. Similarly, the teaching of science has been strengthened
by the provision of the new facilities. However, the project's educational
objectives have been achieved only partially. The completion mission has
noted the difficulties imposed in the way of full utilization of laborato-
ries and workshops by the lack of qualified teachers, equipment and



- 21 -
supplies and by the reluctance of some school administrators to regard technical
education as an integral part of general education. The trade centers and
craft 'schools have not established the expected close, regular ties with
prospective employers, nor have advisory committees of the kind referred to in
the letters on "Educational Objectives" been established. Technical examina-
ations are now being given by the West African Examinations Council, generally
in conjunction with the City and Guilds of London Institute, and are expected
to be taken over fully by the Council (PCR, Annex 10).
43.        The Federal and State Governments have been only partly successful
in staffing the project institutions, especially in the area of technical
education. The National Technical Teachers Training College, which was in-
tended to be the principal sources of technical subject teachers, experienced
some difficulty in attracting and retaining staff. The situation reported
by a 1973 UNDP evaluation report was that the college was experiencing
extensive turnover of principals and staff, shortages of Nigerian staff
in many fields and difficulty in competing with the private sector for
personnel. The staff position in 1976-77 is compared below with that in
1973-74:
Staff Actually        Staff Actually
Positions        in Position           in Position

Vice-Principal                  1                 1                      1

While the teaching staff was 35% below established strength, the student:
teacher ratio was a reasonable 13:1. The enrollment of nearly 400 students
is also reasonable for the accommodation provided.l/
44.       The broadening of secondary education programs was envisaged in
this project. The project also included some post primary craft schools
and trade training centers. During the period of the project, a gradual
change was introduced in the Nigerian school system towards a six-year
primary school cycle followed by a three-year lower secondary and a
three-year upper secondary cycle with emphasis on a broad academic and
practical compulsory course in the lower secondary cycle. This has
de-emphasized separate post primary craft and trade schools and centers.
In some cases, such craft schools have been integrated into the new
structure by being converted into comprehensive secondary schools
offering both academic and practical courses.
1/ Compare PCR, paras. 4.16, 4.17. The PCR expresses the contrary view
that staff is in short supply and that facilties are overcrowded.



- 22 -
45.        It is as yet too early to attempt an evaluation of the projected
improvement in teaching methods. Efforts have been made by the Borrower
to maintain competent and efficient teaching and administrative staff by
providing effective training programs and adequate salary levels, but these
have not all been successful. Although conditions of service of teachers
had already been considerably improved by 1975, the Third National Development
Plan, 1975-1980, referred to the "persistent shortages" of teachers and to
the launching of emergency training programs in all States in 1974-75 with
the financial assistance of the Federal Government. The Plan proposed that
full and automatic scholarships were to be extended to all teachers-in-training,
in an effort to reduce attrition within the teaching profession.
III. Bank Group and Borrower Reactions
46.       At Federal and State levels, officials considered the project
unsuccessful in various respects. They considered, for example, that
there were too many minor matters on which IDA approval was needed,
international competitive bidding should not have been required in
regard to furniture which could have been produced locally, there were
high overheads and excessive red tape in administering the project; IDA
procedures were too complex and the country's procedures could have been
used to build the schools. At the conference of African Education Minis-
ters in January 1976, the then Nigerian Federal Commissioner for Education
also criticized the delays in implementing Bank-financed education projects.
These criticisms of conditions and performance in Bank/IDA financed education
projects are broadly similar to those made by other borrowers in the course
of a recent review by OED of the Bank's educational lending experience in 17
countries including Nigeria.l/
47.        The Bank Group has learned considerably from this experience.
As indicated in its Sector Working Paper (1971), in large countries with
federal structures, "individual Bank projects would probably not attempt
to finance large-scale national building programs".2/ Accordingly, the
Second and Third projects in Nigeria have had a more limited geographical
spread - the former Eastern Region and the former Northern Region, respec-
tively. However, these (especially the Northern Region) are quite large
areas in themselves; thus, the problems in this respect have been reduced
rather than eliminated. In these latter projects the Borrower has had
central responsibility for implementation through a Federal Project
Director and Project Office and a network of State Project Managers and
Project Units. In the case of the Third Project, a local architectural
firm (in association with a foreign firm) was accepted as coordinating
consultants and the Third Project included 18 man-years of technical
assistance to help the project units in physical implementation while the
Second Project utilized the First Project architectural consultants in a
technical assistance role.

48.       Procurement conditions attached to more recent education
projects supported by the Bank Group, especially those approved after
FY72, have generally been liberalized to provide (a) greater opportunities
for the use of local procedures, (b) more frequent exceptions to the use
of international competitive bidding and (c) some exemption of smaller
contracts from the need for prior Bank/IDA review of bid and contract
documents. However, in the cases of the Nigerian Second Education Project
(approved FY72) and the Third (approved FY73) - which was, like the first
project, the largest approved up to that time - such liberal conditions
were not included. Performance to date under the Second and Third Education
Projects suggests that the Bank Group and the Borrower have not yet found
a solution to some of the basic problems that have delayed implementation
of the First Project, including limitations in the capacity of the
construction industry and government administrative weaknesses.
IV. Conclusions
49.       The First Education Project provided expanded facilities on a
large scale for secondary and technical education and teacher training
in Nigeria, especially in the former Northern Region, where opportunities
for such education had previously been more limited than elsewhere in the
country. In this respect it has been one of the most considerable achieve-
ments in Bank/IDA lending. The project items were scattered over so large
an area and involved so many bureaucracies that effective coordination was
difficult to achieve and the management arrangements were inadequate to the
task (paras. 4, 9-14). The Civil War and successive fragmentations of
administrative units (Regions and States) had adverse effects on imple-
mentation, and the weaknesses in equipment procurement and the local
construction industry, the inappropriateness of some architectural designs,
and the shortage of the Borrower's qualified staff to implement the
project also contributed to delays (paras. 15-27). The design and imple-
mentation assistance efforts of IDA were insufficient in view of the
problems (paras. 33-40). Nevertheless, the overall implementation effort
and achievement have been considerable. There was very limited in-
stitution building in regard to project management, school design and
procurement of equipment and furniture because of the extensive manage-
ment role given to private firms which did not train Nigerians in the
process (paras. 10-14, 26).
50.       Some of the project's lessons have been reflected in the Second
and Third Education Projects in Nigeria, but some of the problems remain
unresolved (paras. 47-48). The experience of this project emphasizes the
value:
(1) in regard to project management, of:
(a) ensuring that the project is of manageable scope in
terms of the number of items and their geographical
spread (paras. 4, 9, 15; PCR, paras. 1.14(a), 3.02);



- 24 -
(b) detailed discussions with the Borrower at the project
generation stage on all aspects of project management,
including the availability of manpower needed to implement
the project, paras. 9-14);
(c) involving the Borrower centrally in managing the
project (paras. 9-14); and
(d) ensuring - if necessary, by including it within the
project financing arrangements - the availability
of necessary technical assistance support needed
for the Ministries responsible for project implementation
(paras. 13, 40; PCR, paras. 1.10, 3.03);
(2) in regard to Bank Group supervision/implementation assistance
efforts, of:
(a) reviewing, and if necessary, revising the project or its
implementation arrangements in the light of serious
implementation difficulties being encountered (para. 34);
(b) an overall field supervision effort commensurate
with the scale of the project and with the magnitude
of the implementation problems being encountered
(paras. 35-40); and
(c) utilizing the full range of specialists (including
educators) on field missions needed to cope with the
problems (para. 38);
(3) reviewing architectural designs to ensure their suitability
from the standpoint of the technological competence of the
construction industry (para. 20; PCR, para. 1.13); and
(4) monitoring equipment procurement more closely from list
preparation to installation (para. 27).

1.02      Completion mission.   This report summarizes data in IDA project
files and information gathered by a mission which visited Nigeria in March/
April 1977. The mission, which also supervised the second and third education
projects partially financed by loans 814-UNI and 929-UNI respectively, con-
sisted of D. Davies and G. Hadjicostas (WAPED), M. Wodajo (CPS), R. Aujame and
G. Dolbnin (Unesco) and S. Kadleigh (consultant).
1.03      Project content.   Between appraisal in December 1964 and the comple-
tion mission in April 1977, the project content was reduced from 192 to 137
items. Most of the reduction was in the former Eastern Nigeria region where,
as a consequence of a reappraisal in 1970 after the civil war, 56 of 60 items
were cancelled and 9 new project items added. The details of changes in
project content since appraisal are shown in Annex 1. At completion, the
project comprised construction, furniture and equipment for:
(a) additions to 103 existing secondary schools; the additions
included science laboratories, domestic science rooms,
workshops, classrooms, school libraries, assembly halls
and living accommodations;

(b) 8 new trade training centers;
(c)  additions to six teacher training schools;
(d) additions to ten craft schools;
(e) an advanced Teacher Training College;
(f) a National Technical Teacher Training College;
(g) a Federal School of Arts and Science;
(h) a new craft school;
(i) a new secondary school; and
(j) additions to five trade training centers.
1.04      Project costs.   The total project cost was originally estimated
at US$30 million, of which US$20 million or 66% was to be financed by IDA
and the remainder from internal Nigerian resources. The proceeds of most
of the credit were relent by the Federal Government to four Regional Gov-
ernments and later to the State Governments; the Federal Government re-
tained US$3.9 million of the credit to finance project items in the Federal
Territory, consultants' fees and contingencies. On0October 31, 1971, be-
cause of anticipated-cost overruns, the disbursement percentage from the
credit was reduced from 66% to 48%. In April 1977 the total cost of the
project, then 87% complete, was estimated at US$39.3 million, implying a
cost overrun of 31% which was entirely financed from Nigerian resources.
1.05      Delays.   The credit was to be totally disbursed and the project
completed by December 31, 1969. The closing date was postponed five times
from December 31, 1969 to December 31, 1972, December 31, 1974, December
31, 1976, September 30, 1977 and finally December 31, 1977. The postponements
were attributable to slowness in the appointment of consultants, delays in
construction caused by the civil war, the reorganization of governments in
the former regions, the serious scarcity of manpower in ministries of works,
the low quality and slow payment of contractors, and weak project management.
Because of the civil war, the project was inactive in Eastern Nigeria for
five years; at the request of the Federal Government, IDA discontinued dis-
bursements in that region on June 5, 1967, and did not resume until March 15,
1972.
1.06      Project objectives.   The project was designed to assist Regional
and Federal Governments in implementing their development plans which were
formulated for the period 1962-68.    The objectives of these plans were to:
(a) increase secondary school enrollments.;
(b) emphasize science and vocationally oriented subjects in
secondary schools; and
(c) increase craft and technical training.



- 28 -
The project attempts to redress the regional imbalance in education and
training facilities by allocating 65% of the project in terms of total value
to the Northern Nigeria Region which had much lower school enrollment ratios
than the rest of the country. Of the total project costs, secondary schools
account for about 60%, technical and craft schools for 32% and teacher training
colleges for 8%. Finally, the project envisaged that the consultants hired
by the Federal Government would help to establish architectural design and
cost standards for all school construction in Nigeria. Because of the civil
war, the project was in abeyance in Eastern Nigeria from 1967 to 1972 and
was reappraised in this region in October 1970. At reappraisal, the project
content was almost completely changed in the new states of the region to
conform to new national and regional objectives of reconstruction and the
rehabilitation of war-damaged installations (Annex 1).
Project Results
1.07      Summary.  In terms of physical implemention, about 79% of all build-
ings planned are in use, 13% have not been built and 8% have been built and
abandoned because of a lack of electrical connections, water or equipment.
Only 8 of 14 new institutions and 43 of 123 additions to existing institutions
were completed as originally envisaged (para.3.14). However, it is anticipated
that all new institutions in the project will be completed; the six incomplete
new schools are located in states of the former Eastern Region where disburse-
ments were discontinued during the civil war for a period of five years. At
the time of the completion mission, contracts had been awarded and work was in
progress on all six of these institutions. The poor overall results in the
physical implementation of the project and the eight years' delay in its
completion are attributable to weaknesses in project management, severe shortages
of manpower in regional and state ministries of works, problems of finance,
low-quality contractors, and the problems of procurement, particularly of
equipment. The civil war and two subsequent reorganizations of governments
below the federal level, as well as extremely ambitious development plans such
as the accelerated introduction of free and universal primary education,
increased the demand for scarce manpower and aggravated these problems.
1.08      The project's educational objectives of increasing the science
content and the vocational orientation of the secondary school curriculum
have not been achieved at many institutions because of poor physical imple-
mentation, a lack of teachers and a lack of commitment on the part of some
headmasters to the Government's education policy. However, it is possible
that these educational objectives may be achieved gradually through the
teachers being trained at the project-assisted National Technical Teacher
Training College in Lagos and the advanced Teacher Training College in
Zaria. Most of the objectives of the technical education and vocational
training components of the project which are not associated with secondary
schools will be achieved when the construction program, now under way
in the former Eastern Region, is completed. In spite of curriculum problems
and shortages of qualified teachers and materials, the training provided at
completed technical and vocational institutions is of an acceptable standard.



- 29 -
1.09      Project management.   Project management was the responsibility of
the Ministry of Works of the Federal Government for project items in the
federal territory and of the four Regional Governments for project items in
their respective areas. In 1967 the four Regional Governments were divided
into 12, and in 1976 into 19 State Governments, each with its own Ministry
of Works. Project management suffered from lack of site supervision, lack
of continuity in Ministry of Works personnel, and preoccupation with the
priority demands of the civil war and reorganization. An important conse-
quence of these problems was that there was occasionally confusion with
respect to the project, its origins, its objectives and the respective roles
of State Ministries of Works, the Federal Government, the consultants and
IDA. Both state and federal officials came to regard IDA as responsible for
project execution and the consultants as IDA's executors. Unfortunately,
these misconceptions were never corrected and, currently, many state and
federal officials consider both IDA and the consultants responsible for project
failures.
1.10      Manpower shortages.   From the outset, it was apparent that the
Federal and State Ministries of Works did not have the technical manpower to
administer the project and, consistent with an agreement with IDA reached
during negotiations, several Regional Governments asked the project consult-
ants to recruit technical assistance on their behalf. However, the consultants
were unable to follow through on these requests because the recruitment of
technical assistance was dependent upon external financing which IDA refused
to provide. Many of the delays and failures in the project could have been
avoided if more vigorous action had been taken by the consultants and by the
Government to staff State Ministries of Works and if IDA had been receptive
to suggestions that technical assistance be partially financed from the
proceeds of the credit. Further, the shortage of skilled construction
workers resulted in poor quality workmanship on some sites and in delays
on others.
1.11      Finance.  Financial problems were of three types:   (a) cost over-
runs of 13%, requiring a reduction in the reimbursement percentage from
66% to 48%; (b) failure of some State Governments to make adequate budgetary
provision for project execution; and (c) slowness in paying contractors. The
State Governments' slowness in paying contractors was the most serious fi-
nancial problem because it resulted in contractors abandoning a number of
sites after construction was under way.
1.12      Procurement.  Inadequate staffing and project management were
reflected in serious procurement problems. Equipment procurement, in parti-
cular, required a level of administration and monitoring which the Government
could not establish. Given two governmental reorganizations, the existing
system of procurement from abroad, and poor communications, the control of
equipment procurement broke down and much equipment has been permanently lost.
Contracts for specialist works, such as electricity and water supply and the
prefabrication of roof trusses, were often separated from main building
contracts; the delays and failures of contractors for specialist works were
reflected in delays in the completion of buildings, outright abandonment of
sites by the main contractors and abandonment of buildings which were completed
with the exception of such minor works as electrical connections.



- 30 -
1.13      Low-quality contractors.   The appraisal report describes the poor
condition of the construction industry in the country. While there has
been considerable growth during the 13 years since appraisal, the industry
remains inadequate to the demands which are made upon it. Generally,
contracts for additions to secondary schools attracted a higher proportion
of poor contractors than larger contracts for completely new schools. Poor
contractors, who did not have adequate supervision from ministries of works,
produced either low-quality buildings or, in some cases, were technically
incapable of executing the works for which they had contracted. A common
complaint of State Ministry of Works officials is that the problem of poor
contractors was aggravated by architectural designs which were sometimes
unnecessarily sophisticated and which did not take into account the tech-
nical capabilities of small local contractors. While there is considerable
variability, the overall quality of the buildings is fair.
Lessons of the Project and Recommendations
1.14      Set out below are the "lessons learned" in the implementation of
this first education project in Nigeria and the resulting recommendations.
(a) Nigeria's size, problems of communication, diversity,
political organization and administrative constraints
render projects of national and regional scope such as
this one difficult to manage, administer and supervise.
Financing should be concentrated on projects in individual
states.
(b) Projects in Nigeria require well-defined responsibilities
for project management and specifically assigned project
staff. It is significant that construction was completed
more expeditiously at voluntary agency schools than at
government operated schools because headmasters at
voluntary agency schools served as managers for their
portions of the project. No one was specifically responsi-
ble for government schools, although in some cases the
headmasters at these schools assumed an expediting role
with effective results.
(c) Public sector construction projects require that ministries
of works be reinforced with technical assistance in archi-
tectural and engineering occupations and, if equipment
purchases are envisaged, with equipment specialists. The
volume of technical assistance would depend upon the
intensity of supervision of contractors which may be
required.
(d) Close attention should be given to project finance, in
particular the payment of contractors and the annual
capital estimates exercises.
(e) All minor works should be included in main building
contracts.



- 31 -
(f) Achievement of the project's secondary education objectives
requires a level of school supervision which does not exist;
as a consequence, some headmasters diverted completed project
facilities to uses for which they were not intended. Close
attention should be given to the school supervisory function
in projects where curriculum changes are envisaged.
(g) Similarly, visits of mission members to project-assisted
craft and trade training centers indicated that the Govern-
ment should take action to (i) simplify the certification
of graduates, and (ii) develop formal relationships with
employers to assure a more relevant curriculum.
(h) The quality of IDA supervision was apparently diminished by a
lack of continuity in personnel and by a consequent incon-
sistency in issues stressed on supervision missions and
in the intensity of supervision. There were only two
supervision missions during the crucial first two years
of project implementation, each consisting of one person;
the duration of the first mission was 10 days and the second
7 days. This was clearly inadequate and was interpreted
as a lack of interest on the part of IDA.
II. ORIGINS OF THE PROJECT
2.01      Identification of project content.   The "idea" of a project
originated at Unesco, which at the Government's request mounted an
educational investments programming mission in November/December 1962.
A draft report of this mission, which identified the elements of a project,
was discussed by IDA and Unesco officials in January 1963. Project content
was further defined by a Bank Group economic mission, with Education Division
participation, in March 1963 and by an appraisal mission in November/December
1963. There are minor differences between the project as described in the
appraisal report and in the Development Credit Agreement of March 1965;
namely, the Credit Agreement adds a Teacher Training College in Eastern
Nigeria and deletes (a) a rural education center from Eastern Nigeria, and
(b) additions to two secondary schools from Mid-Western Nigeria.
2.02      Because of the civil war, the project never got off the ground
in Eastern Nigeria and no project activity occurred in that region before
1972. Prior to reactivation of the project in 1972, a reappraisal
mission changed nearly all of the items in the project for Eastern Nigeria to
be consistent with the priority assigned to the reconstruction and rehabilita-
tion of war-damaged technical and vocational institutions. The project
in the former Eastern Region was, in effect, reidentified and is different
from the project in other regions in its rehabilitation objectives and its
phasing. The back-to-office report of the reappraisal mission suggested
that a new "rehabilitation" project be considered to follow up on a redesigned
and reactivated first education project in the region. Thus, the reappraisal



- 32 -
mission for the first project in the former Eastern Region was, at the same
time, the first of two appraisal missions for a Second Education Project (Loan
814-UNI) which had the objective of providing further assistance to the three
states of the former Eastern Region in rehabilitating war-damaged education
institutions.
The Education Sector
2.03      When the Unesco education investments programming mission
visited Nigeria in 1962, the country had been independent for only two
years and was just completing comprehensive reviews of the education
system and the country's manpower situation. The most important of these
reviews is summarized in the Report of the Commission on Post School Certificate
and Higher Education in Nigeria, otherwise known as the Ashby Report, after
the Commission's Chairman, Sir Eric Ashby. Contrary to the report's title,
the report identifies most of the major issues and problems in Nigeria's
edcuation system. The Unesco mission also had available to it reports of
education commissions and of a commision on technical education, as well
as the preliminary results of a manpower survey and preliminary drafts
of regional and national development plans with project lists. Nigeria's
educational development priorities were clearly defined.
2.04      The structure of Nigeria's education system was determined by
missions or voluntary agencies which were largely of British origin.
English is the medium of instruction of curricula which, at independence,
were more oriented to the arts than to the sciences; there was little
provision for technical training. Among regions, the duration of primary
education varied from six to eight years, followed by two cycles of
secondary education, the first lasting five years and the second two years,
preparing for examinations which have their British equivalents. University
education of three years' duration was obtainable at five universities.
2.05      At independence, responsibility for the administration and plan-
ning of education, with the exception of university level education, was
vested in the four regions and, with respect to the Federal Territory, the
Federal Government. Most of the system was in the hands of voluntary
agencies for the operation of secondary schools and of local authorities
for the operation of primary schools. Voluntary agencies and local
authorities absorbed most of the educational budgets of financially
autonomous regional governments. Significant federal control over
education existed at the university level only where a National Univer-
sities Commission attempted to avoid a duplication of faculties and
promote teacher training through control over the allocation of a block
grant provided by the Federal Government.
2.06      At independence, only 2.8 of 9.1 million children of primary
school age were enrolled, for an enrollment ratio of 31%. However, there
was considerable variation among regions; the enrollment ratio was 6.9%
in the north, 73.7% in Lagos, 68.2% in the east and 57.7% in the west
(including the midwest, which became an autonomous region in 1963).



- 33 -
The percentage of the secondary school age-group enrolled in schools
was 10.1% in Lagos, 0.3% in the north, 2.4% in the east and 2.1% in
the west (including the midwest). All regions had critical shortages
of teachers which served as the important constraint on both the expan-
sion of the system and improvement in the quality of education. As in
primary and secondary education, the north, with half of the country s
population, lagged significantly behind the rest of the country. Only
20% of the country's 31,000 teacher trainees were from the north.
There is considerable uniformity throughout the country in technical and
craft training, with the curricula for technical and trade training
leading to British qualifications, specifically, the City and Guilds of
London Institute qualifications. On manpower grounds, technical and
vocational training required expansion at all levels. Technical and
vocational teacher trainers were in particularly short supply.
2.07      At appraisal, the major problems in the education and training
system were as follows:
(a) the low level of development of the system in terms of
overall access;
(b) the severe regional disparities in access to education,
with the north lagging severely behind the rest of the
country;
(c) a secondary school curriculum which was inadequate in
its science, math, and vocational and prevocational
content;
(d) the shortage of teachers and heavy dependence on
expatriates;
(e) with voluntary agencies controlling much of secondary
education and the local councils primary education,
lack of effective control by both the Regional and
Federal Governments over such crucial matters as
curricula and admissions standards; and
(f)  inability of the sytsem to meet the country's require-
ments for technical and vocational manpower.
The project was designed to make a contribution to solutions to these prob-
lems, in particular by increasing the supply of secondary school teachers
in the north and of technical and trade teachers for the country as a whole,
and by providing laboratories and workshops for secondary schools which
would enable an improved curriculum to be taught. About one-third of the
total cost of the project was for technical training, and about 60% for
general secondary education, including laboratories and workshops. Nearly
three-quarters of the secondary school component of the project went to
Northern Nigeria to help redress the imbalance in educational development
among regions.

III.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Principal Issues
3.01      Overview.   The principal issues which affected implementation of
the project were: (a) the large scale of the project in terms of geography,
numbers of administrative and governmental units concerned, and project
objectives; (b) the weakness or lack of project management and technical
manpower assigned to the project; (c) disruptions attributable to the civil
war, including the suspension of the project in the east and its redefinition
after the war; (d) the creation of 12 and then 19 State Governments to replace
the original four Regional Governments; (e) the low quality of contractors;
(f) after 1972, the boom in the construction industry with a high priority
assigned to the rehabilitation and restoration of war-damaged economic infra-
structure made it difficult for the project to compete successfully for scarce
manpower and materials; (g) the initial 14-month delay between the signing of
the Credit Agreement and Credit effectiveness, caused by difficulties in
reaching an agreement on contract terms between the Government and the consult-
ing architects; (h) ineffective procurement procedures; and (i) inadequate
financial planning.
3.02      Large scale of the project.    The 192 elements in the project as2
appraised were widely dispersed over a country with an area of 924,000 km
and 56 million people, the ninth largest national population in the world
(Annex 2). As appraised, the Ministries of Works of four largely autonomous
Regional Governments and of the Federal Government were to be responsible for
project implementation under the supervision of the project's consulting
architects. In April 1967, the number of administrative units or ministries
of works responsible for implementing the project including the Federal
Ministry of Works, was increased from five to 13 and in 1976 to 20. This was
accomplished entirely by dividing the staffs of existing ministries. With
poor roads and communications, it was difficult for the consultants to super-
vise the project even at the regional and state government levels, much less
at the site level. Ministries of Works in the States often found the project
components to be too widely dispersed to supervise.
3.03      Lack of managerial and technical manpower.    The appraisal report
and the reports of successive supervision missions call attention to the
s';ortage of technical and managerial manpower in ministries of works to
implement the project, the lack of qualified site supervisors being the
most serious manpower problem. In a completion report on the project formu-
lated by the architectural consultants, IDA is held partially responsible for
the failure to resolve this problem. The consultants charge that early in the
project, IDA was not receptive to proposals by Regional Governments and the
consultants that the IDA credit proceeds be used to assist in financing staff
for Regional Ministries of Works. Division of the four Regional Ministries of
Works and Ministries of Education into 12 and then 19 State Ministries,



- 35 -
respectively, meant a lack of continuity in personnel, incomplete project
documentation and files, and a nearly total preoccupation of ministry staff
with reorganizational issues. After 1967, very few people in the new States
understood the origins and objectives of the project; consequently the consult-
ants, who provided the project's only continuity in personnel, assumed greater
importance for project implementation.
3.04      Disruptions attributable to the civil war.   In addition to the
strains of Government reorganization, the civil war led to a suspension
of disbursements in the east on June 1967 and the ultimate identification
of new project elements by a reappraisal mission in 1970. Disbursements
did not resume until March 1972. The war claimed priority on personnel,
materials and transport, thereby slowing implementation. Rehabilitation
and reconstruction efforts after the war led to even more shortages of
personnel and building materials and stretched the capacity of the construc-
tion industry.
3.05      Financial planning.   The lack of state project management was
partially responsible for the failure of some states to budget sufficient
funds for the implementation of the project. One consequence was that there
were sometimes delays in awarding contracts and frequent delays in the pay-
ment of contractors, in some cases leading to abandonment of construction
sites.
3.06      Procurement procedures.   The project was delayed and in many cases
buildings were left incompleted because of procurement problems. Some of the
more serious problems were as described below.
(a) The procurement of civil works for voluntary agency schools:
the Regional Governments wished to continue their practice
of providing voluntary agencies with grants in aid for capital
expenditures; they wished to be reimbursed by IDA after the
grant had been made and before contractors had been paid. The
proposed procedure created problems for IDA with respect to
competitive bidding and the normal practice of reimbursement
after approval of expenditures. The problem was resolved when
IDA agreed to reimburse on the basis of the Government grant
of actual expenditures or of costs estimated by the consultants,
whichever was lower, after the consultants had certified that
buildings had been satisfactorily completed. While the prob-
lem caused initial delays, the solution led to highly success-
ful results. The buildings were constructed rapidly, the
quality was good and the costs were substantially below those
obtained by the Government for comparable buildings.
(b)  The procurement of equipment, which was associated with some
delays and substantial waste: following the Government's normal
practice, the procurement of furniture and equipment was done
by the Crown Agents. Discussions between the Government, the
Crown Agents, the consultants and IDA concerning the specifi-
cations for equipment in bidding documents caused a two-year



- 36 -
delay. The poor performance of the Crown Agents, together
with a near total lack of control and procedure for receiving
goods in Lagos and ensuring that they arrived at building
sites, resulted in a substantial amount of equipment being
lost and damaged. It was realized, belatedly, that a full-
time equipment specialist was required in Lagos and in each
state to organize and coordinate equipment procurement. The
consultants added an equipment procurement specialist to their
staff in 1974.
(c) The procurement of loose furniture: while virtually all project
schools were ultimately supplied with serviceable furniture,
procurement from abroad suffered from the same distribution
problems as experienced in equipment procurement. Procurement
from small local contractors in Nigeria proved awkward because
procurement and payment were made through the Crown Agents in
London, who often would find unacceptable the documentation
provided by Nigerian manufacturers. Some furniture was
damaged because it arrived on sites before buildings were
completed and was not adequately stored.
(d) Civil works where specialist services were separated from the
main building contract: State Ministries of Works normally
undertake building contracts for electrical installations,
water, sewerage and even roof trusses separate from the
main building contracts. A consequence of this practice
is that there are a number of buildings in the project
which have been completed for years except for minor
works; they are normally unoccupied.
3.07      Low-quality contractors.   The problem of lack of capacity in the
construction industry is discussed in the appraisal report. In the project,
this often was reflected in shoddy workmanship, in technical inability to
execute building designs and in financial inability to sustain operations at
a work site. The problem was substantially aggravated by inadequate site
supervision, complex designs and slowness in Government payments to contractors
for work completed.
Architectural Consultants
3.08      Terms of reference.   The Development Credit Agreement 72-UNI was
signed on March 1, 1965, about 14 months after the appraisal mission visited
Nigeria.  Pursuant to Section 4.03 of the Agreement, the Federal Republic of
Nigeria appointed a firm of consultants acceptable to IDA and the regions
to (i) propose criteria and goals for economical school construction; (ii)
coordinate school planning and design; (iii) advise on the employment of
qualified architects, engineers and contractors; (iv) supervise bidding and
contract procedures and awards; and (v) supervise construction and dis-
bursement. This was the only technical assistance component in the Schedule
Description of the Project Goods eligible for project financing.



- 37 -
3.09      The agreement with the consultants took 12 months to negotiate
because of:
(a) insufficient information about the project given to the
consultants, who had to draft an acceptable agreement; they
were not given a copy of the Appraisal Report; and
(b) lack of experience on the part of the Borrower, the
consultants and IDA in implementing such a project
under the conditions of an IDA credit, there being no
precedent either in IDA's history or in normal professional
practice. At appraisal in 1964, the project was unique in
terms of the number of institutions involved, its management
and its use of consulting and executive architects.
3.10      In accordance with their agreement and to enable them to prepare
the project, the consultants visited each region and the Federal Territory
of Nigeria with a strong team that included specialist educators as well as
architects experienced in school building. Together with each regional gov-
ernment and with the Federal Government, they prepared schedules of accom-
modation and estimated costs for each project item. They also discussed the
organization, administration and management that would be required in each
region to successfully implement the project. Their interim findings were
presented for discussion and review at a conference in Lagos, November 30 -
December 2, 1966, at which all Regional Governments except Eastern Nigeria
were present. The Federal Government and IDA were represented and reached
provisional agreement on the material submitted by the consultants. At the
conference, it was pointed out by the governments and the consultants that
government ministries, particularly the ministries of works who were to be
fully and solely responsible for execution of the project, could not handle
the project without recruiting additional staff. A second conference, which
IDA did not attend, was held in Lagos from February 28 to March 2, 1967, and
design and procedures guidelines prepared by the consultants were approved
and adopted by the governments. This date marked the real start of imple-
mentation of the project as prepared by the consultants and approved by the
Regional and Federal Governments.
3.11      The consulting firm, Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall, provided
the project with remarkable continuity in qualified personnel over a long
period of time and attempted to compensate for the lack of project management
at the state level. The design and procedures guidelines which they prepared
are of good quality. The consultants have been criticized sometimes by the
Government for (a) producing or approving designs which are too sophisticated
for local contractors and which require materials not readily available locally,
(b) not providing sufficient leadership to state project management, and (c)
misrepresenting themselves as the agents of IDA rather than as consultants
employed by the Federal Government. It was the completion mission's view
that while there is some truth to the criticism of designs, criticism on
the issue of leadership is unwarranted. More serious is the issue of mis-
representation because this has resulted in the widely held view in Nigeria



- 38 -
that IDA was responsible for implementing the project through the consultants.
On this matter, IDA itself contributed to the problem by allowing the miscon-
ception to persist. Overall, it was the mission's view that the consultants
have performed well under very difficult circumstances. Over the life of
the project they have been paid US$2.6 million, or about 7% of total project
costs. Each state hired its own executive architects and paid a total of
US$3.4 million, or about 9% of project costs. The fees of both the consult-
ing and the executive architects account for about 16% of total project costs.
Physical Implementation
3.12      Construction of new institutions.    Of the 14 institutions envisaged
for new construction, eight (57%) were built. The status of the remaining six
institutions is as follows: one institution is more than 80% womplete; two institu-
tions are about 50% and three institutions are less than 50% complete (Annex 3).
3.13      Construction of additions to existing institutions.     Of the 123
institutions for which construction of educational additions (classrooms,
workshops, laboratories, etc) was planned, only 43 have been fully imple-
mented and are in use (35%) (Annex 4). The most successful program of
implementation is in Benue State, where 11 out of 14 institutions (79%)
have been fully completed with all the sub-items, followed by Kwara State,
which completed 11 institutions out of 17 (65%), and Kaduna State, which
completed 9 out of 16 (56%). At 80 institutions (60%), all the sub-items
envisaged in the project have not been completed. In most cases the con-
struction of buildings was either completed or more than 50% completed, but
equipment and furniture have not been installed and electricity and water
supply connections have not been made. At five sites where work started,
nothing has been completed and the sites abandoned for many years
(four institutions in Bauchi State and one in Borno State).
3.14      Annex 5 gives more detailed information on the implementation
and use of project sub-items such as workshops and laboratories for each
institution in the project. Thus, the 137 project institutions or project
items consist of 1,457 sub-items. Of this number, 1,144 (79%) have been
completed and are in use. For various reasons such as lack of equipment,
furniture, electrical connections or water, 49 of these sub-items are
in use for which they are not intended; 116 sub-items (8%) are not in use
at all, many of which have stood abandoned for several years; and 186 sub-
items (13%) have not yet been built.
Project Supervision by IDA
3.15      Prior to the completion mission, IDA sent 16 supervision missions
to Nigeria for 568 man-days. The record of supervision missions lends some
support to the observations of the project consultants and some Nigerian
officials that IDA supervision has been uneven (Annex 6). During the first
five years of project implementation there were five one-man supervision
missions averaging nine days each; this was clearly inadequate given the
size of the country, the desirability of visiting each ministry of works



- 39 -
involved in implementation, and the outstanding implementation issues.
From February 1974 through September 1975 there were four IDA missions
lasting an average of 25 days with an average of four mission members.
Sixty percent of the total number of man-days devoted to supervision of
the project was expended during this 19-month period. Over the long period
of project implementation there was little continuity in IDA personnel.
IV. PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
Secondary Education
4.01      The project helped to finance:
(a)  Construction and equipping of educational and communal
facilities for two new institutions, both of which were
visited by the completion mission: the Federal School
of Arts and Science (Lagos) and Edo College, Benin
(Bendel State);
(b)  Construction and equipment for additions (laboratories,
classrooms, workshops, etc.) to 103 existing secondary
schools, including grammar schools and colleges, dis-
tributed as follows: Northern Region, 68; Eastern
Region, one; Western Region, 22; and Mid-Western
Region, 12. The completion mission visited 40 of
these schools.
4.02      The Federal Territory's former Emergency Science Center is now
the Federal School of Arts and Science. Established in 1958, it provides
only sixth form science work to prepare students for university entrance.
At the time of the appraisal mission in 1963, the school had an enrollment
of about 800 students and occupied temporary wooden buildings erected during
World War II. It was proposed to rebuild the school on its existing site
with provision for 1,500 students, including 500 evening students. To
achieve this, the project provided an assembly/examination hall, a library,
6 classrooms, 12 laboratories, 4 lecture theaters, a kitchen, a students'
common room, and administrative offices. The mission found that all these
sub-items were built and in use and that total enrollment was 1,250. The
teaching staff of 40 are fully qualified; the student/teacher ratio is 30:1.
4.03      At appraisal, Edo College, Benin occupied an inadequate, old
building and had an enrollment of only 133 students. The project was to
expand the college from a single-stream institution to a four-stream plus
a sixth form institution and to raise enrollment to 800 students. To meet
these objectives, the project was to construct and equip an assembly/dining
hall, a library, 23 classrooms, 7 laboratories, a science room, a technical



- 40 -
drawing room, an arts/craft room, a woodworkshop, a metalworkshop, a dual
purpose workshop, a sixth form study area, a sixth form common room, a
kitchen, 4 dormitories, and an administration block. All project objectives
have been achieved. The school is adequately staffed, has an enrollment of
930 students and is functioning satisfactorily.
4.04      The project helped to finance additions to 103 secondary schools.
The additions include teaching facilities (classrooms, workshops, libraries,
etc.). The mission found that additions to only 38 out of 103 schools in
the project (37%) were completed as intended and are in use. More than
100 sub-items, consisting of workshops, laboratories and drawing rooms, in
the remaining 65 schools were incomplete; in most cases, equipment had not
been installed.
4.05      Annex 7 shows the status of implementation and use of facilities
financed under the project at 103 secondary schools. The Annex shows that
177 of 180 classrooms in the project have been built and furnished and are
now in use by about 6,500 students; 24 of 26 libraries, 6 of 7 domestic/
science rooms, 22 of 27 arts/craft rooms and 38 of 47 science/demonstration
rooms have also been completed as intended and are in use. The project's
achievement with respect to laboratories, drawing rooms and workshops is
unsatisfactory. The project was to provide 89 laboratories for about 3,300
student places; the mission found that only 62 laboratories have been com-
pleted with 2,300 student places. The buildings for the other laboratories
have been built, but due to the lack of equipment and teaching materials,
most are not being used; some are used as classrooms. Of the 32 drawing
rooms envisaged in the project, only 21 have been built and equipped and
are in use. The buildings for the rest of the drawing rooms have been
constructed but are either being used as classrooms or not used at all
because of a lack of equipment and qualified technical teachers. Of 52
workshops for practical studies, only about 13 have been built and equipped
and are now in use by about 500 students. In some cases, the schools use
only half a workshop, mainly for woodwork. The buildings for the remaining
workshops have been built but are not equipped and not in use. Most work-
shops which are in use are not being used properly because:
(a) they are not fully equipped with the machine tools
needed for a group fo 40 students;
(b) throughout there are no hand tools and instruments;
(c) there is a lack of training materials; and
(d) there is a shortage of qualified technical teachers.
To summarize, only 13,600 of the envisaged 17,500 secondary school places
have been built and are in use (78.1%).
4.06      Since the appraisal mission in 1963, the general structure of
secondary education has not changed. Secondary education in all states is



- 41 -
of five years' duration and leads to the West African School Certificate
(WASC). In Forms I - III, the curriculum consists of general courses for
all students. In Forms IV and V, students may elect to follow either arts
streams or science and mathematics streams. At appraisal the secondary
school curriculum had two main weaknesses:
(a) it was based on the English syllabus and was not
entirely suited to Nigerian conditions; and
(b) although the need for "pre-vocational education" as an
integral part of the curriculum was recognized, in
actual practice few schools had facilities or staff
to provide it.
The completion mission found that while the structure has not changed, there have
been some important changes since appraisal in the secondary school curriculum and
syllabus. The syllabus now gives much more consideration to the African
continent and particularly to Nigerian history, geography, literature and
culture. The achievements of modern science and technology have been intro-
duced into the syllabus and the teaching of science, biology, physics and
chemistry has been strengthened. The project helped to finance 62 labora-
tories and 38 science/demonstration rooms; however, the lack of laboratory
materials, equipment and qualified teachers continues to prevent the proper
teaching of these subjects.
4.07      The mission found that while the curriculum in most secondary
schools remains academically oriented, serious efforts are being made to
diversify it by introducing prevocational subjects like woodwork, metal-
work, handicrafts and technical drawing into the first three years. Voca-
tional subjects occupy 4 to 6 periods out of 35 per week in the curriculum.
The prevocational training facilities provided by the project makes only a
small contribution to the improvement of secondary prevocational education
and this contribution is diminished by a lack of hand tools and workshop
materials. The mission felt that prevocational education has not yet found
its proper place as an equal subject among others in secondary schools.
Many senior administrators and professionals in the education system still
believe that technical education, in all its forms, is an alternative to
general education rather than an integral part of it. Until they are per-
suaded of the educational, social and economic benefits to be gained by
introducing every pupil to prevocational education, the achievement of these
objectives will continue to be elusive.
4.08      Finally, the mission noted that despite enormous pressures to
increase secondary school enrollments the student/teacher ratios at the
secondary schools visited by the mission were very low (Annex 8). It was
the mission's view that part of the teacher shortage could be relieved by
larger classes.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
4.09      This part of the project comprised:



- 42 -
(a) construction and equipping of new educational and com-
munal facilities for 8 trade training centers (TTC) and
a craft school in Mubi;
(b) construction and equipment for additions to 5 existing
trade training centers and I teacher training school
in Ogoja, converting it into a trade training center
and 9 existing craft schools; and
(c) construction and equipping of a new National Technical
Teacher Training College in Lagos (NTTC). The mission
visited 12 TTCs, 2 craft schools and the NTTC.
Of the new facilities, the mission found that the construction of 3 out of
8 trade training centers (Kaduna, Maiduguri and Makurdi) and of a Government
craft school in Mubi has been completed satisfactorily and these institutions
are in operation although the craft school at Mubi has been converted into a
comprehensive school. The remaining 5 new trade training centers are in the
former Eastern Region and 4 of them are still under construction (Owerri TTC
is about 80% completed, Onitsha and Abakaliki TTCs are more than 50%, and
Port Harcourt TTC is less than 50% completed). Construction of the new Ikot
Ada Idem TTC and Ogoja TTC (converted from a teacher training school),
also in the former Eastern Region, has not yet started.
4.10      The Government Secondary Technical School in Kaduna, formerly
the Kaduna Trade Training Center, began operating in the newly constructed
premises in 1973. The project included construction and equipment for
an assembly/dining hall, a library, 7 classrooms, 2 labs, 3 drawing rooms,
a radio mechanics workshop, an electrical installation workshop, a fitter
machinist workshop, an electrical fitter workshop, a motor vehicle electri-
cian workshop, a motor mechanical workshop, a kitchen, and dormitories for
about 400 students. All buildings were completed and equipment installed
between 1971 and 1973 and are in operation. Some of the instructional equip-
ment was lost on the Lagos docks while being stored before delivery to the
school. Originally designed for 3 disciplines (mechanical, auto-mechanics,
and electrical engineering), the curriculum has now been expanded to include
4 more disciplines: carpentry, building, refrigeration, and radio/television.
The duration of the courses is 5 years and leads to the West African School
Certificate (WASC). The capacity of the school as planned under the project
was 432 students; present enrollment is 450 students. There are 40 teachers,
of whom 31 are technical teachers. While the school is short of qualified
teachers, it is a well-run and high-quality operation. Students who complete
the course are in great demand.
4.11      The Ramat Technical College in Maiduguri, formerly the Maiduguri
Trade Training Centre, began operating in 1973. The project includes con-
struction and equipment for an assembly/dining hall, a library, 7 classrooms,
3 laboratories, 3 drawing rooms, 7 workshops, a kitchen, dormitories for 400
students, an administration block, and 16 staff houses. All buildings have
been completed and are in proper use except 2 laboratories and 2 drawing rooms,
which lack equipment and are being used as classrooms. The college was



- 43 -
designed for the instruction of 430 students. Because of changed objectives
since appraisal, the college has a capacity of only 350 students and runs City
and Guilds three-year courses in mechanical fitting, metal machinery, elec-
trical installation, internal combustion engine work, vehicle work and motor
vehicle electrical work. The college also offers two-year courses in welding,
agricultural mechanics, refrigeration, air-conditioning, radio/television and
electronic servicing. In addition, it conducts two-year courses in carpentry/
joinery and masonry. Recently, new three-year ordinary technician courses in
mechanical, electrical and civil engineering have been added for 40 students
and the trade training center has been converted into a technical college.
The mission found that for the trade courses most of the equipment is avail-
able, but for the technician courses the equipment is not appropriate. There
are 40 teachers, of whom 37 are technical teachers. While the college is
short of qualified teachers, it is well run.
4.12      The Technical Training School in Makurdi, formerly called the
Makurdi Trade Training Centre, began operating in 1975. The project included
construction and equipment for an assembly/dining hall, 7 classrooms, 2 lab-
oratories, a library, 3 drawing rooms and 7 workshops, a kitchen, dormitories
for 430 students, an administration block, and 16 staff houses. All the
buildings have been constructed and most of the equipment has been installed
and is in proper use; however, the library, a dormitory and administration
blocks are temporarily in use as offices by the newly created State Ministry
of Education. The center runs three-year courses in electrical, and civil
engineering, automechanics and electronics. The planned capacity was 432
student places; however, because of the use of space by the State Ministry
of Education, only 300 students are enrolled.
4.13      The Government Craft School in Mubi.    The project included the
construction and equipment for an assembly/dining hall, a library, 3 class-
rooms, a laboratory, a technical drawing/arts room, a general utility room,
2 workshops, a kitchen, a dormitory, and an administration block. With the
exception of the library and the administration block, all the buildings
have been constructed and are in use as a comprehensive rather than as a craft
school.
4.14      The project also comprised construction and equipment for addi-
tions to 14 existing trade training centers and craft schools. The addi-
tions included workshops, laboratories, dormitories and kitchens. All the
additions to 6 out of 14 centers and schools have been fully completed and
are in proper use (Owo and Idah TTCs and Pategi, Mashi, Soba and Sokoto craft
schools). However, in 1968 the Sokoto Craft School was converted into a
Secondary Technical School, following the West African School Certificate
curriculum. Some centers and schools have completed construction of buildings
for educational facilities, but due to lack of equipment the buildings are
being used for other purposes. The Oyo TTC uses workshops as dining halls,
the Idah TTC uses workshops as dormitories, and at some schools the labora-
tories and libraries are being used as classrooms. Construction of additions
at nine sites has not yet been finished. The sites for additions to two
craft schools, Maiduguri and Gombe have been abandoned.



- 44 -
4.15      Annex 9 shows that only 68% of the projected additions have been
built and are in use; however, even those constructed are often not used
properly. As at the project secondary schools, some workshops and labora-
tories are not equipped adequately for the number of students in the group.
There is a lack of hand tools, instruments and expendable materials and
insufficient funds are provided for the maintenance of equipment, buildings
and grounds. Many buildings have broken windows, peeling paint, and unkept
roads and compounds. The mission noted that in most of the trade centers
and craft schools visited, workshop safety has been neglected. The mission's
evaluation of the programs at craft and trade training centers is set out in
Annex 10.
Technical Teacher Training
4.16      One objective of the project was to assist the Government in increas-
ing the number of qualified technical teachers. To achieve this objective, the
project included construction and equipment for new facilities for the National
Technical Teacher Training College (NTTTC). According to the project, the
NTTTC was to be transferred from a temporary site at Yaba (Lagos), where
it was founded in 1907, to a permanent site at Akoka (Lagos). The project
included the construction and equipment of an assembly hall, a students'
common room, a library, 11 classrooms, 2 laboratories, 4 science demon-
stration rooms, 2 technical drawing rooms, a domestic science room, a typing
room, a lecture theater, a building and planning workshop, an engineering
workshop, an electrical workshop, a teaching aids block, a kitchen, a dining
room, dormitories for 48 students, an administration block, 2 staff houses
and 16 staff flats. The mission found that -- except for the staff houses
and flats, which were not built, and the lecture theater, which lacks furni-
ture -- all buildings have been constructed and are in use.
4.17      In September 1975, the NTTTC moved to its permanent site at Akoka.
The college has a qualified teaching staff of 31 teachers. The main problems
facing the college stem from the fact that facilities and equipment are not
being used for the curriculum for which they were designed. The college was
designed to offer a one-year teacher training course for those possessing
recognized technical and commercial qualifications and appropriate work
experience who wished to become teachers in technical or commercial subjects.
However, in addition to the one-year course, new courses of four years'
duration have been introduced for those who had graduated from general se-
condary schools and wished to become technical and commercial teachers.
In addition, a two-year nurse-training course has been introduced, creating
a problem of overcrowding. Nearly 400 students are using facilities designed
for 200, with probable detrimental effects on the quality of technical teacher
training.
Secondary School Teacher Training
4.18      The project included:
(a) construction and equipping of a new Advanced Teacher
Training College in Zaria; and



- 45 -
(b) construction and equipment for additions to six existing
Teacher Training Schools in the former Eastern Region.
4.19      The Advanced Teacher Training College in Zaria was established in
1962 and started in temporary buildings to train secondary school teachers.
At the time of the appraisal mission, there were 218 trainees and the lack
of accommodations would not permit the further expansion of the college.
The old buildings had neither the capacity nor the required teaching and
laboratory facilities. Accordingly, the project included the construction
and equipping of an assembly hall, a library, 12 classrooms, 5 laboratories,
a science demonstration and an arts/craft room, a domestic science room, a
lecture theater, 7 tutorial rooms, a dining hall, a kitchen, dormitories,
an administration block, and 13 staff houses. All facilities have been built
and equipped and are in use. The total number of student places is now 500.
The college runs three-year courses of study, including education principles
with practical teaching, English, arts and physical education, and special-
ization in two major subjects selected from among English, French, Arabic,
Hausa, history and geography, or mathematics, general science, physics,
chemistry and biology.
4.20      The project also included the construction and equipping of science
laboratories for six existing teacher training colleges. The mission found
that only one laboratory had been constructed, but it was not in use because
the equipment had not yet been installed. The other laboratories are more than
half completed. Thus, the main educational objective of this part of the
project (to establish science labs at TTSs) has not yet been achieved.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
5.01      At appraisal, the total cost of the project was estimated to be
US$30 million, including a 15% allowance for contingencies. In terms of
cost, 65% of the project was in the Northern Region, 13% in the Eastern
Region, 5% in the Mid-Western Region, 10% in the Western Region, and
7% in the Federal Territory of Lagos. The credit of US$20 million, which
was to finance 66% of total project costs, was relent by the Federal Govern-
ment to each Regional Government in proportion to each region's share of
total project costs. Civil works comprised 84% and furniture and equip-
ment 16% of total estimated project costs; the foreign exchange component
of estimated project costs was 37%.
5.02      A comparison of costs of what was originally envisaged in the
appraisal report with what was actually implemented is difficult because of
changes in project content after appraisal. Price escalation averaged 4.4%
per year over the life of the project. Part of the price escalation was
attributable to an 11% devaluation in the US dollar after 1971. However,
only 87% of the project has been physically completed, at a total identifiable
cost of US$39 million (Annex 11). Because some States paid for equipment
which was lost and undertook minor works without seeking reimbursement the
total cost of the project as implemented to date may have been as much as
US$43 million.



- 46 -
In 1971, IDA reduced its disbursement percentage to 48% to ensure that dis-
bursements would continue until the project was fully implemented.
).03      'ine record of disbursements on the project accurately reflects the
low level of project activity during the civil war. From 1967 to 1971, a
period of four years, only US$2 million was disbursed, From 1971 to 1975,
US$15 million was disbursed. Disbursement after mid-1975 has been slow.

EVALUATION OF CRAFT AND TRADE CENTRE PROGRAMS
The Craft Schools and Trade Centres offer craft courses which usually
last for 2-3 years, leading to Intermediate City and Guilds Certificate of London
Institute (CGLI), the Nigeria Craft Certificate, and the Federal Ministry of Labour
Trade Test Certificate Grade III in specific trades.
Secondary Technical Schools offer a five-year course to primary school
leavers. These schools take the West African Examinations Council's technical
examinations, which are, at present, mostly being run in conjunction with the City
and Guilds of London Institute. It is expected that this particular examination
will soon be taken over fully by West Africa Education Council (WAEC).
The mission found that while some attempts have been made, under the
auspices of the WAEC, to modify the syllabuses in order to make them more directly
relevant to Nigeria's needs, little real progress has been made. The partial irre-
levance of the syllabuses is not, however, the major criticism, but rather the in-
flexibility of the overall system of technical education and vocational training
at the post primary level.
It is a system of training by levels and certificates, operating largely
in isolation from the world of work which in many cases has led to an attitude
that obtaining the certificate is more important than learning how to do the job.
The lack of flexibility is further exemplified by the commonly used standardized
time required to complete any course, with little regard given to the degree of
complexity of the trade, e.g., plumbers and instrument fitters.
On completion of the courses, it is not uncommon to find the following
certificates available to the same students: the Craft Certificate of CGLI, the
Grade III Ministry of Labour Trade Tests and the Federation of Nigeria Craft
Training Certificate. In some cases, only one of these qualifications was avail-
able; in others two, sometimes all three were available. This multiplicity of
certificates and examining bodies serves no useful purpose and only adds to the
difficulty of analyzing the degree of success of the various approaches and of
finding a common solution to the problems enumerated above.
Another vital requirement in the vocational and technical training is
the establishment of close ties between the Trade Centres, Craft Schools, and the
employers or prospective employers. The problem of determining in advance the
needs of employers fQr craftsmen in Nigeria is difficult under the best of cir-
cumstances. Because of so many unpredictable factors beyond their control, such
as import restrictions, taxation, credit and consumer preferences, employers find
it is difficult to forecast their needs beyond a few years.
Such a short time-horizon renders it essential for the Trade Centres
and Craft Schools to maintain the closest possible ties with its customers, the
employers, and in order to be able to meet their rapidly changing needs, they must

remain as flexible as possible. While the majority of Trade Centres and Craft
Schools visited by the mission claimed good relations with industries, in prac-
tically all cases, relationships were of the ad hoc nature and almost invariably
were the result of the principal's or other senior staff members' personal
friendships with employers.
Such an informal relationship is completely inadequate and is unable to
provide the necessary liaison between the Trade Centres, Craft Schools, and the
employers. This does not imply that such relationships are not valuable, but
rather that they should be expanded and institutionalized. In much the same way
as the manufacturer has access to national and local economic indicators and
makes use of the market surveys to check the acceptability of his products, so
should the Trade Centres and Craft Schools be continually guided by similar
information and feedback from their "market".
Some Trade Centres and Craft Schools have been able to arrange on-the-
job training during summer vacation periods. However, since it is rare that
employers participate in the organization and management of the Trade Centres,
it was reported that there was little effort to relate the on-the-job training
to the school instruction and the experience of trainees on the job was sometimes
left unsupervised and unstructured.
The mission found that the student/staff ratio at Trade Centres and
Craft Schools was workable, although minimum in most instances. Unfortunately,
a high percentage of the teaching staff are unqualified and have little or no
practical experience in the use of the skills they are trying to impart. For
this reason, even existing training facilities are not used effectively or main-
tained properly, and when the rest of the training facilities (which are now under
construction) are put into operation, the problem of qualified technical teachers
will become more acute than it is now.
