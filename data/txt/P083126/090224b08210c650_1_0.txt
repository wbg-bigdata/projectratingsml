                         of Project support to include training to the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC) staff and development of new services (by upgrading the e-cadastre software with infrastructure
                         cadastre module); and (iii) extending Project closing date for 18 months, till June 30, 2015.
                         Project restructuring created a new momentum, and resulted in the implementation speeding up substantially over the last three months. All the critical actions agreed during the

                         restructuring mission (April 2013) have been met. The project is on track to meet its development objective (PDO). Particularly impressive progress was made with activities in the
                         Authority for Legal and Property Affairs, as they completed renovations of 24 offices, contracted the delivery and installation of equipment and the networking, developed the
                         Management Information System and started the training of the staff.
                         On the other hand, the challenge of having the project uninterrupted funding ensured seems to remain. There are still serious budget constraints that impact project's day-to -day
                         implementation.
