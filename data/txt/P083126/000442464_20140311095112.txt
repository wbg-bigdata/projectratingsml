A. Summary of Proposed Changes
This restructuring proposes three main changes: (1) an extension of the current project closing date by 18
months; (2) a revision of the Results Framework; and (3) a revision of the design of Component 2 to
support upgrade of existing software systems for improved registration service delivery and training for the
implementing agency staff. It has been prepared upon request of the Borrower, which was presented to the
Bank in form of the correspondence from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on April 12, 2013. Its main
purpose is to reflect the impact of 18-month loan disbursement ceiling imposed by the Government in
2011-2012 to mitigate the impact of the global financial crises on the economy.

B. Project Status
The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project (RECRP) was approved on March 15, 2005. The project
was designed as a €10.3 million loan to support the establishment of an efficient and effective real estate
cadastre and registration system in former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRoM). By June 2009, the
end targets of the project outcome indicators had been surpassed. The World Bank approved a € 9 million
additional financing and a three-year extension in May 2010. Two new components were introduced. The
first supports the mass digitization of cadastral maps in the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC), the
development of a Web-based geographic information system to provide on-line access to the digitized
maps, the development a Government Geo Portal, and the upgrading of the country’s geodetic reference
infrastructure. The second component provides the Authority for Legal and Property Affairs (ALPA) with
technical assistance and trainings, as well as resources to upgrade its equipment, automate its business
processes, create a digital record keeping system, and renovate its local offices.

Project implementation remained very successful until September 2011, when MoF decided to impose a
loan disbursement ceiling aiming at reducing public expenditures and mitigating the impact of the financial
global crisis on the country’s economy. As a result, the implementation progress was halted and the project
ratings were downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory.

With the lifting of the loan disbursement ceiling on February 20, 2013, the implementation has accelerated
and project rating has been upgraded. The achievements observed over the last few months are
encouraging. Progress toward achieving the Project Development Objective is satisfactory and PDO
continues to be achievable. The number of property transactions registered, as well as the number of
mortgages using property as collateral (PDO indicators), continue to grow. Project activities are back on
track, with disbursement increased from 17 percent in October 2012 to 30 percent in June 2013, with
additional 18 percent in new commitments. Major contracts related to digitization of cadastre maps have
been completed with all AREC’s original cadastre maps now vectorized (phase one of two in digitization
process). However, delays caused by the imposition of the 18-month loan disbursement ceiling are such
that project activities cannot be completed by the current project closing date. For instance, all digitized
cadastre maps still have to be updated and uploaded into the management system; AREC's Geo Portal
(WebGIS) remains to be developed and data uploaded to enable on-line use of data and various on-line
services. Development of Document Management System and IT infrastructure improvement in ALPA
need additional 12 months to be completed..

Project Development Objectives (P083126 - Real Estate Cadastre & Registration Project)
Original PDO
The objective of the project is to build an efficient and effective real estate cadastre and registration
system, contributing to the development of efficient land and real estate markets.
Change in Project's Development Objectives – No change in PDO
Change in Results Framework
Explanation:
The proposed modifications are the following: (i) include a new PDO level indicator to better capture the
impact of investments under the Additional Financing (specifically, digitization of cadastre maps and

                                                  6
development of AREC’s WebGIS for on-line use of cadastre data); (ii) introduce core sector indicators;
(iii) revise the targets to reflect the new proposed project closing date; (iv) reduce the targets related to
customer satisfaction from 4 to 3.8 on the 1-5 scale to reflect the trend of declining citizens satisfaction
with government services noticed in the region over the past few years, which is a result of prolonged
impact of financial crises; (v) revise the indicators for which the targets have already been achieved; and
 (vi) strengthen the indicators for Component 6 to better capture the impact of investments under the
Project to improved efficiency and quality of services delivered by ALPA. The proposed changes in
intermediate indicators for Component 6 include: (1) introducing one additional indicator, and (2)
replacing the indicator related to decrease in urban land privatization cases backlog which proved to be
unrealistic, as the number of cases continued to increase over the last two years due to prolonged deadline
for submitting applications (original deadline was Dec 31, 2011), with the number of urban land
privatization cases resolved ;
The revision of targets will reflect progress in project implementation and an impact of the financial crisis.
There would be no change in the PDO.


                                                 Financing
Change in Loan Closing Date(s)
Explanation:
The proposed new closing date is June 30, 2015. While the Project DO remains achievable more time is
needed to achieve the objectives of the Additional Financing related to digitalization of cadastre data and
development of on-line services. Borrower's performance remains satisfactory; and the Bank and the
Borrower agreed on actions that will be undertaken by the Borrower to complete the Project. The proposed
18 months extension corresponds with the number of months during which the disbursement under the
project was constrained. This second project extension will bring the total extension for this project to 4.5
years. There are no outstanding or unsatisfactory audits under the Project.

Change to Components and Cost
Explanation:
It is proposed to modify the design of Component 2 - Institutional Development and Improving Service
Delivery - to include support to an upgrade of existing software systems for improved registration service
delivery and training to AREC staff. This is assessed as technically sound and reasonable proposal for
utilizing the loan funds that became available when AREC took over financing some of the critical project
activities with its own budget at the time when the loan funds were constrained during 2012, as well as to
utilize savings that were made under Component 3 and Component 5. The upgrade of AREC’s software
(electronic cadastre or eKAT) would expand AREC’s services and facilitate the improved registration of
utility and infrastructure property rights. In terms of the training, the Project has been funding only the
training related to Enterprise Resource Management system (ERP), National Spatial Data Infrastructure
and Project Management Unit training. All other training activities were funded by SIDA project which is
now closed. There is a need to ensure that AREC staff will be receiving the training related to Web-GIS,
IT and also train the trainers refresher courses. The project would support study tours as well as the
training for both government officials and private sector professionals on the new law on Real Estate
Cadastre (enacted in April 2013). The changes in the component costs presented in the table below result
from the savings made under the project and increased financing needs for: (i) Component 2 as explained
above and (ii) Component 4 (project management) due to proposed extension of 18 months. There will be
no change in the total project costs.

Change in Implementation Schedule
Explanation:
Project extension will require for the activity schedule to be revised and new starting and completion dates
established. The draft revised implementation schedule was discussed in details during the restructuring
mission in April 2013. The revised schedule includes new dates for completion of activities on:
    1. Development of Enterprise Resource Planning System and its integration with eKAT by May 2014
    2. Updating of all digital cadastre maps (DCM) by Dec 2014 and uploading the DCM to AREC?s
         Portal by June 2015
    3. Development of WebGIS (AREC’s Portal) by Dec 2014, with digital cadastre data available on-
         line by June 2015.
    4. Developing software for Government GeoPortal by December 2014.
    5. Completing activities on improving the Gravimetric Network by November 2014
    6. Finalize the refurbishment, equipping and VPN network installation in all ALPA offices by April
         and December 2014, respectively.
    7. Initiate and complete three new activities: development of a document management system;
         upgrade of eKat with a module for utility cadastre; and development of software for digital archive
         by January 2015.
A revised procurement plan was prepared and discussed between the Bank team and AREC and ALPA.
The Bank team and the implementing agencies prepared and agreed a detailed action plan to ensure all
project activities would be completed within the extended Closing Date.
