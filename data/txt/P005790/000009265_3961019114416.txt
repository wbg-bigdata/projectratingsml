MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Yemen
Sixth Education Project (Cr. 1470-YEM)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Yemen: Sixth
Education project (Cr. 1470-YEM, approved in FY85) prepared by the Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office. Part II was prepared by the borrower.
The project had three objectives: to expand training facilities for primary
school teachers; to provide basic education and skills training for out-of-school youth and
adults in District Training Centers (DTCs); and to strengthen public administration training
programs through the upgrading of teaching staff of the National Institute of Public
Administration.
The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. Physical infrastructure
targets were met with the exception of a new "Senior" Primary Teacher Training Institute
(PTT), a component which was cancelled when the borrower's policies for teacher training
changed. Uncommitted funds were utilized to rehabilitate five schools and to procure equip-
ment for eight other PTTls, but at considerable cost in terms of a twenty-nine month delay in
loan closing. Enrollments exceeded targets in the PTTIs but actual enrollments in the DTCs
are not known.
Training for public administration was carried out and a National Training
Board (NTB) was established. But the NTB became inactive when the country unified.
Therefore, institutional development is rated as modest. Sustainability, however, is rated as
likely because the borrower places high priority on education development and has provided
adequate financing for project institutions. Compliance with covenants was good.
The PCR is adequate in reporting on project implementation but lacks specifi-
city on outcomes, particularly for the basic education and skills training components.
An audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THE REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
THE SIXTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(Credit 1470-YEM)
PREFACE
i.          This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth
Education Project in the Republic of Yemen for which an IDA Credit (1470-YEM)
in the amount of SDR 9.5 million was approved on May 1, 1984. The Credit was
closed on May 31, 1993, two years and five months past the original closing
date. Except for a small amount of SDR 261, the Credit was fully disbursed.
ii.         The PCR was prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division, Country Department II, of the Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office, with substantial inputs from the Borrower. The report
is based on information contained in the President's Report, Staff Appraisal
Report, Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and
the Borrower, internal IDA memoranda, discussions with IDA staff,,and
information gathered in the country. The PCR mission discussed the outcome of
the project with Borrower representatives, but was unable to visit project
sites due to security problems at the time of the visit (January 1994).

(Credit 1470-YEB)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Prolect Obiectives and Scone
i.          In line with IDA's continued support for establishing a modern
education and training system in Yemen, the project's principal objectives
were to: (a) expand training facilities for primary school teachers; (b)
provide basic.education and skill training for out-of-school youths and adults
in rural areas; and (c) strengthen public administration training programs
through upgrading the teaching staff of the National Institute for Public
Administration (NIPA). The project design and organization incorporated the
lessons learned during the implementation of the previous projects in the
education sector, which included: (a) the selection of a management agency to
implement the project's technical assistance; and (b) avoidance of the use of
short-term specialists for ad-hoc assignments. Most importantly, the project
provided continuity for programs introduced under previous projects and
continued these programs to their full development.
ii.         The project as designed included the following principal
components: (a) establishment of four new Primary Teacher Training Institutes
(PTTIs) in rural areas; (b) extension of a PTTI for female teachers; (c)
establishment of an innovative Senior PTTI (Grades 13-14) which introduced a
new program of primary school teacher training in Yemen; (d) setting up two
District Training Centers (DTCs) which would offer courses in literacy and
occupational skills; (e) fellowship training and specialist services to
strengthen the staff of the National Institute of Public Administration
(NIPA); and (f) two front units were provided through a basic training
facility (BTF) and a National Training Board was established to administer the
BTF. In addition, two studies - educational finance and preinvestment for
NIPA - were to be prepared under the project.
Implementation Experience
iii.        Overall, the project components were satisfactorily completed,
with the exception of the construction of the senior PTTI. The main variances
in the planned versus actual implementation of components relate to the time
taken to complete (a) the civil works (due to contractors' financial
difficulties and the lack of a price escalation clause for civil works
contracts); and (b) procurement of equipment and furniture for the various
institutes financed under the credit. The project was largely implemented as
designed: Four new PTTIs were built; the PTTI for female teachers was
extended; two DTCs were established; and the studies were completed. One
project component, the Senior PTTI, was cancelled due to difficulties in
finalizing the tender. The cancellation, however, coincided with the
introduction of a new approach to primary teacher training in Yemen based on
post-secondary two-year programs which are now offered in fourteen PTTIs. The
concept of Senior PTTIs was therefore not lost and was in fact reinforced in
subsequent years.
iv.         Uncommitted proceeds of the Credit which had become available from
favorable exchange rates, lower than anticipated construction costs and the
cancellation of the Senior PTTI component, were used to: (a) rehabilitate five
schools financed by earlier IDA credits; (b) purchase equipment, furniture and



iv
buses for eight government-financed PTTIs; and (c) additional technical
assistance for teacher training and NIPA. To enable the reallocation of
funds, the Credit Agreement was amended twice. The Credit was almost
completely disbursed.
v.          Actual project costs (US$15.6 million) were lower than originally
estimated (US$19.3 million). As a result, the share of IDA in total project
financing reached 81 compared with 52% estimated at appraisal (see para 20
and Tables 5-7).
vi.         Implementing the project took longer than anticipated, causing
three extensions of the closing date. The Credit closed on May 31, 1993, two
years and five months past the original date. The principal reasons for the
delays were problems experienced with bidding procedures; with local
contractors and with the procurement of equipment. Additions to the project's
scope (justified by the use of uncommitted funds) contributed to the delay in
project implementation.
Project Results
vii.        The project objectives were met and while implementation took
longer than estimated, it was handled flexibly to permit adjustments to
changing project and country conditions.   Technical assistance inputs were
particularly critical to the success of the Government's plans to improve and
Yemenize the teaching force so as to reduce the substantial drain on
Government resources caused by the excessive use of expatriate teachers.
Specifically, the following results were achieved:
(a) Four new PTTIs are in operation, and demand for student
places is strong;
(b) The two DTCs are completed and training programs have started;
(c) The findings of the studies were used to strengthen educational
finance, and to prepare investments for NIPA;
(d) Five schools financed with earlier IDA credits were rehabilitated,
and equipment was provided for eight government-financed PTTIs; and
(e) Two front units were constructed under a BTF.
Project Sustainability
viii.        The Government is fully committed to human resource development,
particularly in the area of primary teacher training. It has conducted an
extensive review of the PTTI system to ensure its future viability and has
adopted recommendations to rationalize the system to meet the current needs of
the unified country. At full development, the project is expected to increase
the stock of Yemeni primary teachers by about five hundred every year against
an estimate of two hundred and five teachers, which will reduce the dependence
on foreign teachers and free up valuable resources for future investments in
the country's education and training system. A comprehensive preventive
maintenance study (financed under the Teacher Training Project - Credit 1773-
YEM) has been completed and the implementation of its recommendations is
underway to ensure the upkeep of institutions. Recurrent expenditures for the
operation of project facilities are financed by the Government, which
continues to give high priority to education sector development. This
commitment is demonstrated by the growing share of education in total
government spending, which rose from 12% at the time of appraisal to 17% in
1990 and 20% in 1992.  Increasing government revenue, mainly from the oil



v
sector, and growing community participation in support of public and private
schools should provide the basis for further sustainable growth of education
expenditures.
Lessons Learned
ix.         The project achieved its physical targets and its outcome has
been supported by lessons learned from previous operations, with the principal
factors contributing to success being: (a) an appropriate project design based
on clear sector objectives; (b) close interaction between IDA and Borrower
staff; and (c) a viable financing plan. Project implementation demonstrated,
nevertheless, that there are trade offs between adding new activities for the
purpose of utilizing uncommitted funds and that the risks of implementation
delays and sharp increases in prices should be assessed before making a final
decision.
x.          An important lesson learned was that a price escalation clause
should be included in contracts. Because of the absence of such a clause,
civil works implementation was adversely affected by successive devaluations
of the Rial and high inflation rates. On the basis of this experience, the
government has introduced a price escalation clause and authorized the local
currency share of contracts to be denominated in U.S. dollars.
xi.          Finally, another lesson was that, in volatile country
circumstances (such as country reunification), the project timetable should be
more realistic.

B.  Proiect Backaround
1.          Sector DeveloDment and Issues:  Until the late 1960s, the
northern governoratesl of the Republic of Yemen remained isolated and
traditional in their economic and social structures. Modern development
started in the 1970s, when a central administration was established, major
infrastructure projects were undertaken, and the country was opened to foreign
trade and investment. Accomplishments in the human sector were especially
impressive: in 1971, only 125,000 children were enrolled in primary schools,
representing 12 percent of the school-age population. At present, this figure
had risen to almost 600 thousand or close to half the school-age population.
A diversified secondary school system was built up and the country's first
university was established in Sana'a.
2.           Present education and training in Yemen includes all major
elements of a modern system: primary and secondary education, teacher
training, vocational and technical training, and higher education. In 1991/92
some 2.5 million students were enrolled in the system, a tenfold increase
since 1970/71. In addition, some 70 thousand adults received literacy
training in 1991/92. The past emphasis on quantitative expansion has led to
imbalances and quality deficiencies. One major imbalance is evidenced in male
enrollment in the system which is three times as large as female enrollment.
The only exception is adult literacy training where female students exceed
males. Present education facilities are ill equipped to train the needed
manpower for the economy. Moreover, inadequate teacher qualifications,
overcrowded and poorly maintained school buildings, insufficient educational
materials and the absence of reliable testing have led to low achiev em nts
among students and graduates.
1/ Before the unification of Yemen in 1990, the northern part of the country
was known as the Yemen Arab Republic.



2
3.          The rapid expansion of educational facilities had its cost.  One
of the most pressing issues that emerged in the late 1970s was a growing
shortage of primary school teachers which forced the Ministry of Education
(MOE) to rely increasingly on expatriate teachers. Their number grew from
3,360 in 1978/79 to some 13,300 in 1982/83 and by 1990/91 twenty-five percent
of teachers in primary and unified schools were expatriates. In 1990, there
were approximately 9,900 primary level Yemeni teachers in the Northern
governorates. Low internal efficiency caused in part by inadequately trained
teachers, led to extremely high attrition rates with only about 15 percent of
all first grade students completing the sixth grade. This resulted in
continuously high illiteracy rates for the population aged 10 years and above.
Another issue was the scarcity of qualified civil servants which severely
constrained the Government's capacity to build an effective public
administration, and to manage a growing and increasingly complex development
program.
4.          Government Sector Policy:  The Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86)
gave special emphasis to primary teacher training to reduce the use of
expatriate teachers as the foreign exchange cost of employing these teachers
became excessively high; train local teachers; improve the physical facilities
of schools; and to meet the growing demand for basic education. The Plan also
provided for an expansion of functional literacy and basic skill training
programs for semi-skilled workers, and the strengthening of the Government's
principal agency for public administration in-service training (the National
Institute of Public Administration - NIPA). Other key objectives were the
development and modernization of curricula; the expansion of vocational and
technical education; and the diversification of programs at Sana'a University.
The rapid build-up of education facilities gives testimony to the priority
assigned this sector by the authorities. Major support also came from foreign
donors who provided teachers and financed school construction and equipment.
5.          IDA Lending Strategy:  IDA support for education and training
supported the Government's strategy of establishing a modern education and
training system. Since 1972, five education credits totalling US$ 51 million
had been approved. Initially, IDA focused on basic education as well as basic
skills and literacy training in rural areas. Besides teacher training this
included assistance in curricula development, local production of education
materials, vocational training, and non-formal education through District
Training Centers (DTCs) in rural areas. The third credit helped the
Government with the diversification of secondary education and the training of
civil servants at NIPA. The fourth credit provided support for higher
education, especially the engineering facility at Sana'a University. It also
financed the establishment of the Educational Research and Development Center
(ERDC) which assists MOE in analyzing educational issues and in developing
policies. The fifth credit was approved in March 1983 and financed several
Primary Teacher Training Institutes (PTTIs) in rural areas. It also provided
further support to the DTC network and helped establish a Basic Training
Facility (BTF) for village training programs. All five projects have been
successfully completed - albeit with implementation delays - and their
educational objectives were generally met.

6.          Linkages to Country Strategv: IDA lending for education,
including the sixth project evaluated in this PCR, had three major links with
the general country strategy: (i) upgrading the quality of teachers as a means
to improve human capital formation; (ii) generating an increasing flow of
trained manpower to meet the demand of labor markets; and (iii) strengthening
education research and policy formulation, as part of an overall social sector
development strategy.
C.  Proiect Obiectives
7.          Building on the preceding Fifth Education Project (Cr.1340), the
Sixth Project had the following main objectives:
(a) Further increase the supply of Yemeni primary school teachers by
expanding teacher training programs;
(b) Provide additional basic education and skill training programs for
out-of-school youth and adults in rural areas; and
(c) Strengthen public administration training programs provided by
NIPA.
These objectives were consistent with the ones spelled out in the Second Five-
Year Plan, and addressed some of the key issues in the education sector (para.
2 and 3).
D. Proiect Preparation and Desion
8.          The project was prepared by the Borrower following an IDA
identification/preparation assistance mission in October 1982. An appraisal
mission visited the country in March 1983. Subsequent processing of the
Credit application was delayed, however, pending a Government review of
education sector priorities which confirmed the objectives of the project.
Negotiations finally took place in March 1984, and the IDA Board approved the
Credit (SDR 9.5 million) on May 1, 1984. The Credit Agreement was signed in
June 1984 but did not become effective until February 1985, due to delays in
its ratification by the country's National Assembly (see Part III, Table 2).
9.          The project was well conceived and adequately prepared.  Its
design was clearly spelled out and understood by the institutions and agencies
responsible for implementation, and the project was on a scale commensurate
with the absorptive capacity of the sector. Its principal components
included:
(a) Constructing, equipping and furnishing of four new PTTIs for male
teachers in rural areas, with a total of 880 student places;
(b) Extension of a PTTI for female teachers in Taiz to alleviate
overcrowding and support new programs (320 new student places); and



4
(c) Establishing an innovative Senior PTTI (grades 13-14) for male
teachers in Sana'a (280 student places).
10.         Its design called for about 70 teacher trainers who would be
required for the operation of the four new PTTIs and the extension of the PTTI
for female teachers. The trainers would be mostly Yemenis and were expected
to graduate from an instructional program initiated in 1979 by USAID. Yemeni
staff for the Senior PTTI would be drawn from existing MOE personnel upgraded
under the project through fellowship training.
11.         The project would also finance two additional District Trainino
Centers (DTCe) and thereby expand the basic training programs initiated under
the preceding IDA projects. The two DTCs would offer (i) literacy courses
combined with basic occupational skills; (ii) agricultural and health courses;
(iii) house crafts, nutrition, health and child care courses specifically for
women; and (iv) skills training in automotive and farm equipment mechanics,
carpentry and electricity. Other courses could be offered to meet local
needs. Each DTC would support training units in about ten surrounding
villages. Target groups were from 11-40 years of age; about 2000 people could
be trained by one DTC, and a similar number by the village training units.
12.         Each DTC would have a staff comprising 8 skills instructors and
10-20 literacy teachers. The latter would be drawn from local primary school
teachers. Skills instructors would be secured through bilateral programs
(Netherlands, Germany, Sweden) or through recruitment from neighboring Arab
countries. Yemeni instructor. would come from local technical and vocational
schools. Instructors for the village units would be trained under special
programs organized by MOE utilizing vocational facilities of the DTCs.
13.         To foster village training units, additional funds (US$ 0.4
million) would be provided to a Basic Training Facility (BTF) established
under the Second Education Project and replenished by the Fifth Education
Project.
14.         Training and Technical Assistance  (TA) would be provided in
three areas:
(a) Fellowships for staff tralning of the Senior PTTI supported by
consultancies to assist in curricula development - 45 staff years;
(b) Fellowships and specialist services to strengthen the staff of NIPA
- 7 staff years; and
(c) Consultant services to prepare a study on education finance and a
preinvestment study for NIPA - 1.5 staff years.
E.    Proiect Implementation
15.         The project was largely implemented as designed: Four new PTTIs
for male teachers were built; the PTTI in Taiz for female teachers was
extended; two DTCs were established and the Basic Training Facility was



5
replenished. One major project component, however, the Senior PTTI in Sana'a,
was cancelled due to changes in the initial site followed by persistent delays
in Government's approval of the civil works tender. The cancellation,
however, coincided with the introduction of a new approach to primary teacher
training in Yemen based on post-secondary two year programs which are now
offered in fourteen PTTIs. The concept of the senior PTTI was therefore
preserved and reinforced in later year.
16.         Credit Amendments.  In May 1989, the Borrower requested to use
uncommitted proceeds of the Credit for the rehabilitation of five schools
financed by earlier IDA credits (No.421 and 611). The funds ($1.25 million)
had become available through (a) fluctuations in the value of the Yemeni Rial;
(b) lower than anticipated construction costs; and (c) a favorable SDR/US$
ratio. The schools in question - two Vocational Training Centers, a DTC, an
Agricultural Secondary School and one PTTI - had experienced severe
deterioration of infrastructure and equipment due to lack of adequate
maintenance. To accommodate the request, IDA agreed to amend the Credit
Agreement (September 1989). At the same time, the Borrower undertook to
initiate a suitable school maintenance program after completion of a
maintenance study financed under the Teacher Training Project (Credit 1773;
see Part III, Table 1). By the end of 1992, the five schools had been
rehabilitated. The maintenance study was completed in September 1993, and
school maintenance programs were included in the Basic Education Project
(Credit No.2412) and the recently approved Education Sector Investment Project
(Credit No.2570).
17.         In July 1991, the Credit Agreement was again changed to make use
of funds that had become available from the cancellation of the Senior PTTI
(US$1.8 million). The funds were spent to purchase equipment, furniture and
buses for eight government-financed PTTIs and to set up a computer information
network. The two Credit amendments facilitated the full utilization of the
approved IDA funds, and supported to a large extent the initial project
objective of increasing the supply of Yemeni teachers.
18.         Technical Assistance.  There was considerable reluctance on the
part of the Government to use foreign experts who were considered to be too
expensive. However, Government agreed to 'package' all technical assistance
under the project (along with technical assistance from the Fifth Education
project and the Teacher Training project - Credits 1340 and 1773-YEN) under a
management services contract with the AMIDEAST. This step greatly improved
the development of project-related TA activities and made its implementation
more efficient and effective. A review study of teacher training, financed
under the Teacher Training Project (Cr.1773) resulted in the reorganization of
the primary teacher training program which entailed (a) keeping a three-year
program of training for rural areas and females; (b) abolishing the five-year
post secondary program; and (c) adopting a two year program as the new pattern
for teacher training. In order to implement these changes, the TA allocated
for the SPTTI when the project was designed, was used instead to prepare
course materials/curricula and textbooks for the two year programs at the
fourteen primary teacher training centers. In addition, NIPA received a
further allocation of funds for fellowships and expert services which was



6
fully utilized. The two studies on education finance and preinvestment were
completed.
19.         Closina Dates.  Implementing the project took much longer than
anticipated and as a result, the closing date was extended three times (Part
III, Table 2). The Credit was closed on May 31, 1993, that is, twenty-nine
months later than the original estimate. Disbursements continued until
October 12, 1993 for eligible expenditures committed before the closing date.
The principal reasons for the delays were problems experienced with bidding
procedures, with local contractors and with the procurement of equipment.
Preparation and approval of tenders took more time than expected because of
cumbersome administrative procedures of the Borrower. Most civil works were
not completed on time when the funding agreed with contractors failed to cover
escalating costs in an inflationary environment. Unforeseen bottlenecks in
shipping and long waiting periods at customs delayed the procurement of
imported equipment. Technical assistance started slowly but progressed
satisfactorily after contracts were given to a management services agency
(AMIDEAST). The additions to the project contributed to the delay in project
implementation.
F. Proiect Costs and Financing
20.         The total costs of the project as originally designed were
estimated by the appraisal team to reach the equivalent of US$ 19.28 million,
including US$3.84 million physical and price contingencies (Part III, Table
5). The actual costs were US$ 15.6 million, about 19 percent less than the
estimate. Although the two figures are not strictly comparable becaucs of the
changes in project content - cancellation of the SPTTI, addition of school
rehabilitation, equipment and technical assistance - the final outcome
suggests effective costs control for civil works and the procurement of
equipment and services.

21.         The original financina Dlan had envisaged that US$10.0 million
(52%) of the project costs would be paid from the proceeds of the IDA Credit



7
(SDR 9.5 million). The Credit was almost fully disbursed, but due to a more
favorable SDR/US$ rate financed the equivalent of US$12.71 million (81% of
total project costs) which covered all foreign exchange costs and 65% of
domestic expenditures. The balance of US$2.89 million was financed from
Government sources (Part III, Table 6).
22.         During the first five years of project implementation,
disbursements of IDA funds lagged seriously behind the agreed timetable. At
the end of FY89, only 29% of the estimated amount had actually been spent
(Part III, Table 3). In the early 1990s, disbursement accelerated after
administrative and contractual bottlenecks had been overcome (see para.18).
By October 1993, the Credit had been almost fully disbursed, and a small
balance of SDR two hundred and sixty one (SDR 261) was subsequently cancelled.
23.         The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) maintained detailed and
accurate records of project accounts, which were audited annually by private
audit companies. The audit reports were submitted to IDA and were found to be
of acceptable quality.
G. Proiect Results
24.         The project was completed in May 1993.  Its objectives, which
were amended to include the rehabilitation of institutions financed under
earlier IDA credits, were met and while implementation took longer than
estimated, it was handled flexibly to permit adjustments to changing project
conditions. Specifically, the following results were achieved:
(a) Four new PTTIs are in operation, and demand for student
places is strong. Enrollment figures exceed the estimates made at
appraisal, but most students are still in training and have not
yet graduated (Part III, Table 10).
(b) The two DTCs are completed and training programs have
started.
(c) Training and technical assistance has been used effectively
to train teachers for PTTIs and NIPA, to provide fellowships for
civil servants, to hire foreign experts for teaching, planning and
research assignments, and also to prepare the curricula and
textbooks for the entire new system.
(d) Two studies were undertaken and their findings have been used
to strengthen educational finance mechanisms, and to prepare new
investments for NIPA.
(e) Uncommitted proceeds of the credit and funds available from
the cancellation of the SPTTI have been used to rehabilitate five
schools financed from earlier IDA credits, and to procure
equipment and furniture for eight Government-financed PTTIs.
(f) The BTF was provided as planned and included two front units.

The National Training Board was established in January 1987 but
became inactive following the country's unification. Its reorganization
is expected to be effected when the now Education Law is implemented.
H. Proiect Sustainabilitv
25.         Recurrent expenditures for the operation of project facilities
are financed by the Government, which continues to give high priority to
education sector development. This commitment is demonstrated by the growing
share of education in total government spending, which rose from 12% at the
time of appraisal to 17% in 1990 and 20% in 1992. Increasing government
revenue, mainly from the oil sector, and growing community participation in
support of public and private schools should provide the basis for further
sustainable growth of education expenditures.
I. IDA's Performance
26.         Close involvement of IDA staff during the identification and
preparation phase contributed significantly to the design of the project.
Supervision of project implementation was efficient and appropriately timed
(see Part III, Table 9). Changes in project design during implementation
focused on priority areas and ensured full utilization of the approved IDA
Credit. IDA also facilitated the development of programs through the use of
its own staff expertise - a senior procurement advisor assisted the Government
in attempting to resolve civil works procurement issues in connection with
price escalation; senior disbursement personnel conducted a seminar for local
staff; and a senior ILO specialist, at IDA initiative, assisted PIU staff in
the preparation of equipment lists based on the revised PTTI curricula. IDA
maintained a schedule of not less than two supervision missions per year to
ensure project viability. IDA staff used these occasions to share, inter
alia, its management an implementation expertise with PIU personnel.
J. Borrower's Performance
27.         Government agencies responsible for the project were motivated
and cooperative. They were supported by a well established PIU which served
as principal coordinator between the Borrower and IDA. Close participation of
Borrower staff in all phases of preparation and implementation ensured an
appropriate design and successful outcome of the project. Credit covenants
have been complied with (Part III, Table 8). Progress reports, prepared by
the PIU, were well-documented and timely. This greatly facilitated the work
of the supervision missions. The MOE responded expediously to IDA's
recommendations in connection with issues raised by the various supervision
missions. This greatly facilitated the project's implementation progress and
contributed to the success of its components. On the other hand, the
procurement process for civil works was delayed because of cumbersom
bureaucratic approval processes and actual disbursement performance was well
below appraisal estimates.

K. Proiect Documentatlon
28.         Project preparation and implementation were well documented.  The
President's Report, Staff Appraisal Report, supervision reports and internal
working paperm all provided essential information to gauge the progress of the
project, and to evaluate its final outcome. The Credit Agreement and
subsequent amendments were appropriate, and data for the Project Completion
Report (PCR) were readily available. Borrower representatives supported the
completion mission.
L. Lessons Learned
29.   The project achieved its physical targets and its outcome has been
supported by lessons learned from previous operations, with the principal
factors contributing to success being: (a) an appropriate project design based
on clear sector objectives; (b) close interaction between IDA and Borrower
staff  and (c) a viable financing plan. Project implementation demonstrated,
nevertheless, that there are trade offs between adding new act_vitien for the
purpose of utilizing uncommitted funds and that the risks of implementation
delays and sharp increases in prices should be assessed.
30.   Overall, project implementation could have been improved through better
procurement practices. In particular, an important lesson learned was that a
price escalation clause should be included in contracts. Because of the
absence of such a clause, civil works implementation was adversely affected by
successive devaluations of the Rial and high inflation rates. On the basis of
this experience, the government has introduced a price escalation clause and
authorized the local currency share of contracts to be denominated in U.S.
dollars.
31.   Finally, another lesson was that, in volatile country circumstances
(such as country reunification), the project timetable should be more
realistic in order to avoid implementation delays well beyond the original
closing date.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
31.         The Ministry concurs with the discussion presented in Part I of
this Project Completion Report (PCR) concerning the Sixth Education Project
which we feel adequately present. the issues related to the project
component.
32.         Overall, the project objectives were generally met for all
components.
33.         From our perspective, the major issues requiring our focus and
concern involve the issues of project design and preparation (in relation to
changing conditions and requirements) and the problems adversely affecting
timely and effective project implementation.
34.         In regard to project design and preparation, we desire to
initiate continual efforts to accommodate changeg when needed. In this
project, the design was successfully modified to accowmmodate factors which
developed during the life cycle of the project, all things considered.
35.         Regards the problems affecting project implementation, the major
issues continue to be the inflationary environment and the difficult
administrative procedures.
36.         With the active participation of the IDA/WB staff, we now feel
that the provision of a foreign currency component in civil work contracts
will partly resolve the delays and problems cause by decreasing currency
valuo.
37.         Regarding the difficulties faced due to the administrative
environment and procedures, we think that a more detailed review of the
overall generic problems, should be undertaken i.e. in country review,
training and coordination seminars, etc.
38.         We are most pleased with the IDA/WB staff's continued active
participation in the resolution of these problems. Our extensive discussions
have led to a better understanding of the problems which will no doubt lead to
an ovorall improvement in the implementation of all future development
prospects in Yemen.

Comments:         The Third Education Project (Cr. 915) in the amount of USS10 million ws appraised in 1979 and
assisted the Government with the diversification of secondary education in the areas of agriculture
and livestock training and also with the training of Government employees at the National Institute of
Administrative Services. The Fourth Education Project (Cr. 1203) in the mount of USS12 million was
appraised in 1981 and assisted the Government in diversifying secondary education nd financing a
facility at the University of Sana's. It aLso established the Education Research and Developm nt
Center which assists the Government in addressing education issues and in developing polIcies. Both
projects were completed successfully.
