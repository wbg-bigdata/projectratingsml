INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NIGERIA FOR A
KADUNA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the equivalent of US$92 million to help
finance a project for water supply in Kaduna State. The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7.9 percent per
annum. The Federal Government would relend the loan to the Kaduna State
Government (KSG), which would further onlend the total amount of the loan to
the Kaduna State Water Board (KSWB), on the same terms as the Bank loan. KSWB
would carry the foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled "Nigeria, Recent Economic Developments and
Short-Term Prospects" (Report 1690a-UNI), dated December 23, 1977, has been
distributed to the Executive Directors. The following paragraphs summarize
the major conclusions of that report, and update them on the basis of more
recent findings by an economic mission which visited Lagos in October/
November 1978. The report of this mission is expected to be distributed to
the Executive Directors in the near future. Country data are attached as
Annex I.
Political Background
3.        After 12 years of military regime, Nigeria is now embarking on the
final stages of its program for a return to civilian rule. The present
military government is adhering closely to the plan, announced in July 1975,
for restoring constitutional government in 1979. In 1976/77, a new constitu-
tion was drafted and elections for local government councils were held. The
draft constitution was subsequently adopted by a Constituent Assembly com-
prising mostly elected but partly nominated members. An amended version was
accepted by the Supreme Military Council and formally promulgated in November
of last year. When the 12-year-old ban on political parties and activities
was lifted in October 1978, over 20 parties were formed. However, only five
of these met the rules laid down by the Federal Military Government and will
compete in the elections of federal and state legislatures and of an executive
president during the course of this year. The complete transfer of political
power to a civilian administration should occur by October 1, 1979.
1/   Part I is substantially unchanged from Part I of the President's
Report on the Forestry Plantation Project (P-2487-UNI) of March 14, 1979.



Economic Background
4.        Nigeria has an estimated population o. 79 million (1977).  GNP per
capita is around US$420,, which partly reflects the gain from increased oil
prices, and is higher than other indicators of the standard of living would
suggest. In terms of such criteria as life expectancy, child mortality, and
number of people per physician, Nigeria ranks amongst the poorest countries in
the world. Oil has been a major resource for Nigeria for over a decade, but
not until the sharp incr2ase in the oil price in late 1973 did it acquire such
a dominating influence, surpassing the agricultural sector in all measures
of relative importance except employment; it now accounts for 80 percent of
government revenue and over 90 percent of export earnings. The oil boom gave
a major boost to economic activity and supplied the means for a huge develop-
ment effort. An ambitious Third National Development Plan (1975-80) provided
for a US$70 billion investment program. As a result of the rapid rise in
government expenditure, the non-oil sector grew at an average of 11 percent
per year and overall GDP at 6 percent over the four years sinc:e 1973. How-
ever, the main sources of growth were construction and the tertiary sectors,
whereas investment and production in the directly productive sectors, partic-
ularly agriculture, has been lagging.
5.        The level of petroleum revenue, up from US$2.3 billion in 1973/74
to US$9.2 billion in 1977/78, has had a profound influence on the fiscal
situation. In the four--year period following 1973/74, recurrent expenditure
by the Federal Government increased from US$1.1 billion to US$4.2 billion, and
capital spending from US$1.2 billion to US$9.7 billion. Public sector invest-
ment showed a remarkable expansion not only in such traditional areas as
transport, communications, and power, but also in education and large-scale
manufacturing.
6.        The impact of the oil boom on the balance of payments has been
equally strong. Exports rose by 150 percent in 1974 and, by mid-1975, foreign
exchange reserves amounted to US$6.2 billion. This permitted a rapid expan-
sion of imports which, by 1978, were at a level four times that reached in 1974.
Re-emergence of Financial Constraints
7.        Projections made early in 1975 did not indicate a reversal of the
country's resource position until 1980; yet, the first signs of a turnaround
appeared already late in 1975, and the financial constraint tightened towards
the end of 1977. The re-emergence of a resource gap has been more rapid and
drastic than expected. The cause is a combination of two major factors: on
the one hand, lower than expected oil exports due to a surplus of light crude
on the world market and, on the other hand, the inability of the Government to
adjust expenditures to available resources.
8.        So rapidly did Government expenditures rise, that already in 1975/76
the Federal budget showed an overall deficit of US$2.6 billion; the situation
deteriorated further with the deficit reaching US$3.3 billion in 1977/78.
State governments' budgets were also in deficit. Initially, thae Federal



- 3 -
Government was able to draw upon its previously accumulated balances, but they
have now been depleted, and domestic borrowing, largely through the banking
system, has financed the additional requirements. More recently, external
borrowing has assumed greater importance as a source of finance.
9.        With public sector investment accounting for 70 percent of total
investment, and total Government expenditure around 43 percent of GDP, the
strain on the administrative resources of the Government has been enormous.
The severe shortage of skilled manpower, in addition to physical bottlenecks,
seriously limited the extent to which Nigeria's oil wealth could be effectively
utilized within a short period.
10.       Having reached 2.25 million barrels per day (mbpd) in 1974, oil
production has fluctuated since then at significantly lower levels. In the
first quarter of 1978 production fell sharply to 1.5 mbpd mainly because
Nigeria maintained a relatively high price in the face of intense competition
from the newer sources of oil, e.g. the North Sea and Alaska. Following an
adjustment of the Nigerian price, production recovered strongly throughout the
remainder of 1978, and is currently at the high level of 2.4 mbpd.
11.       As a result of the stagnation in oil production and the heavy import
demand, the balance of payments recorded an overall deficit from 1976 onwards.
This reflects a basic change in the balance of trade. Whereas oil exports
in 1978 were roughly the same as in 1974, imports more than quadrupled and,
consequently, the current account showed a deficit of US$3.6 billion in 1978.
Foreign exchange reserves fell gradually to US$4.2 billion at the end of
1977, then dropped rapidly to US$1.9 billion by the end of 1978, the equiva-
lent of only 7 weeks of imports.
12.       There can be little doubt that the rapid expansion of Government
expenditures has contributed to a high level of inflation in recent years.
The increase in the cost-of-living averaged 26 percent per year between 1975
and 1977, but may have dropped below 20 percent in 1978. Severe port conges-
tion and internal distributional bottlenecks have prevented liberal import
policies from being more effective in dampening inflation. The domestic
rate of inflation has been considerably higher than that of Nigeria's main
trading partners, and consequently the competitive position of domestic
producers of traded goods is thought to have been seriously weakened.
Recent Measures and Short-Term Outlook
13.       The Government has recognized the deteriorating financial position
and, over the last two years, has introduced a series of measures aimed at
curbing inflation and strengthening the balance of payments. Wages in the
public and private sector were frozen. Monetary policy measures included
ceilings on bank credit and a rise in interest rates in two stages by up to
two percentage points. Investment in agriculture and oil exploration was
encouraged through fiscal incentives. While the official oil export price was
lowered by 5 percent early in 1978, the price of domestic fuel was raised by
about 60 percent. The principal measures, however, were the introduction of



- 4 -
an austere budget in 1978 together with extensive import restrictions. The
revised Federal Government budget estimates for 1978/79 provided for a cut of
5 percent in recurrent expenditures and of 32 percent in capital expenditures
compared with the previous year's actual outlays. Although the budget esti-
mates for 1979/80 show a modest rise in nominal expenditure, there is probably
no increase in real terms. In addition to the imposition of substantially
higher import duties, a wide range of consumer goods as well as intermediate
goods were either banned or licensed in 1978. These restrictions were further
tightened in the 1979/80 budget. The Government also successfully raised two
large Euro-currency loans amounting to a total of US$1.75 billion.
14.       While the Government is continuing to experience serious financial
limitations, and last year's measures have not yet become fully effective,
the financial situation appears to be stabilizing. The budget deficit in
1978/79 was greatly reduced to about US$1.7 billion and, in view of the
large external loans, borrowing from the domestic banking system was limited.
Along with the substantial run-down of foreign exchange reserves that has
already occurred, this resulted in a sharp drop in monetary expansion, which
helped to dampen inflation. The 1979/80 budget should essentially maintain
this situation. The balance of payments outlook, however, is less sanguine.
On the positive side, oil exports in 1979 will be considerably higher follow-
ing the recovery in oil production and the recently announced OPEC price
increase. The present uncertainty in the world oil markets could also work
to Nigeria's advantage. In addition, the import restrictions which caused
anticipatory purchases in 1978 should have an impact in 1979. On the other
hand, no significant change is expected in non-oil exports, and there is
virtually no scope for further use of foreign exchange reserves. Moreover,
external borrowing on the scale of 1978 is unlikely to be maintained.
15.       The tighter financial position is also affecting the implementation
of the Third Plan (1975-1980). Its size has been gradually reduced, initially
due to a lack of administrative and executive capacity, which restricted the
rate of implementation, but more recently also as a result of resource con-
straints. Substantial inflation further eroded the value of actual Plan
expenditure.
Longer-Term Prospects and Policies
16.       The Government is in the midst of preparing the Fourth Five-Year
Plan (1980-85). Although the guidelines have not yet been made public, the
authorities have indicated that the next few years would be viewed as a
period of consolidation, as public sector investments are stabilized at the
current level, and the economy is restructured by stimulating the growth of
commodity producing sectors. Gross domestic investment would account for
around 25 percent of GDP in 1985. Provided investments are well conceived
and effective, this rate should permit a satisfactory growth of the economy,
albeit modest compared to recent performance, with considerable potential for
employment creation. However, the principal constraint on future growth will
be the balance of payments, and the actual performance of the economy will
depend on how successfully imports are replaced by domestic production and
non-oil exports are stimulated. One critical factor will be to ensure the



- 5 -
competitiveness of domestic production relative to foreign goods. This will
require measures affecting the incentive structure, including the establish-
ment of a favorable cost and price structure, as well as a change in invest-
ment priorities towards more directly productive projects.
17.       The demand on the institutional and manpower resources of the public
sector in recent years has clearly been excessive. This accotnts, in part,
for the relatively weak economic management and inefficiency in resource use.
However, the expected more modest investment effort should ease the strain
on the Government's administrative and managerial capacity. Furthermore, the
transition to civilian rule in October 1979 is generally expected to lead to
a greater role for the private sector, thus easing what has been one of the
fundamental constraints to obtaining a higher return on the large investment
effort. In spite of limitations imposed by the scarce human and, more
recently, financial resources, a medium-term growth of around 4 percent
would be within reach.
External Borrowing and Creditworthiness
18.       Until recently, Nigeria had only limited recourse tco external
borrowing. The public guaranteed external debt outstanding (including undis-
bursed) amounted to $1.3 billion at the end of 1977 and, mainly because of the
two syndicated Euro-currency loans, it amounted to $3.2 billicn at end of 1978.
The service on this debt would rise to an average of $550 million a year in
the early 1980s, representing about 3 percent of the expected export earnings.
The World Bank's share in the external debt now is about 25 percent. The
Government has indicated its reluctance to incur any more syndicated loans,
though it would continue to contract project financing largely on commercial
terms. Given the relatively low level of the existing external debt and the
Government's cautious approach to foreign borrowing, the debt service ratio
over the next ten years is unlikely to rise above 15 percent. Provided the
Government is able to effectively implement policies that will correct the
current imbalance between aggregate demand and supply and lead to improved
resource use, Nigeria can be considered creditworthy for considerable Bank
lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA 1/
19.       Bank and IDA lending to Nigeria as of March 31, 1979 amounted
to US$942.9 million (net of cancellations) 2/. The amount of these loans
and credits disbursed as of March 31, 1979 was US$612.2 million, leaving an
undisbursed balance of US$330.7 million. Transport and power together account
for about 43 percent of total commitments; agriculture for about 31 percent
(most of which was committed in the last four fiscal'years); and education,

Report on the Forestry Plantation Project (P-2487-UNI) of March 14, 1979.

industry, and the post-.ar rehabilitation loan for the remaining 26 percent of
total commitments. Gross disbursements were about US$59 million in FY77 and
US$51 million in FY78, but are expected to increase in the coming years
in line with the expansion of Bank lending to Nigeria. There have been only
two IDA credits to Nigeria, for US$35.5 million; both are fully disbursed.
IFC has made three loans to borrowers totalling US$3.6 million, and four
equity investments totalling US$2.4 million. Of these amounts, US$3.6 million
have been repaid, cancelled, or sold.  Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments, as well as notes on.the
execution of ongoing projects.
20.       The main thrust of the Bank's activities in Nigeria in recent years
has been to support agriculture and rural development, with particular
emphasis on institution-building and transfer of technology. These objectives
are in consonance with the Federal Government's priorities under the Third
Plan, which places considerable emphasis on agriculture, and with its policy
to use the proceeds of Nigeria's oil revenues to increase the productive
capacity of the economy, and thereby raise the standard of living of its
population, including the rural poor.
21.       In view of Nigeria's increasing need for external finance, and the
interest it has expressed in greater Bank involvement, a greatly expanded
Bank lending program is contemplated. In developing a broader approach to
lending in Nigeria, a central objective is to encourage the shift (already
discernable in the Federal Government's investment programming) away from
the massive and diffused infrastructure investment which characterized the
two or three years following the oil boom towards a more discriminating
support for growth in the commodity producing sectors. A second objective of
Bank lending is to raise the productivity of the lowest income groups and
thereby diminish the incidence of absolute poverty in Nigeria. This objective
has been actively pursued in recent agricultural projects which benefit some
of the very lowest income groups. Agricultural lending of this kind would
continue to figure prominently in the future lending program. A third objec-
tive of Bank lending is to support the Federal Government's efforts to
diversify the economy, and reduce the excessive dependence upon petroleum
as a source of foreign exchange and fiscal revenue. Consequently, we hope
to develop some industrial projects of an explicitly export-oriented nature,
though our efforts are still at a rather preliminary stage. Agricultural
lending in particular would include strengthening the potential for export
crops such as cocoa.
22.       The commodity producing sectors constitute an appropriate focus
for an expanded lending program. Projects in both agriculture and industry
together should account for a large share of Bank lending in the coming two
years. Effective support for the commodity producing sectors will also
require strategic investment in production-related infrastructure, how-
ever. There would appear to be good opportunities for the Bank to make
a significant contribution in water supply, power, and highway maintenance,
including the presently proposed project and a power distribution project



-7-
in Lagos, scheduled to be submitted to the Executive Directors in the near
future. Further project identification work is under way in these sectors.
Strategic support for the commodity producing sectors would also be given
by lending for education. In this context, it is proposed that vocational,
technical, and teacher training be given heavy emphasis. Finally, the Bank
would support the Federal and state governments' efforts to spread the bene-
fits of growth to the social sectors. It is envisaged that some of the
pressing problems of rapid urbanization will be addressed through a number of
urban development projects, including one already appraised in Bauchi State,
focussed on the needs of the urban poor. A sectoral distribution of lending
along these lines would be in keeping with the need to generate employment,
and would also support the Federal Government's aim of mobilizing Nigeria's
petroleum revenues to alleviate poverty and improve the overall distribution
of income.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
General
23.       Water supply and sanitation is the responsibility of the state
governments. Each state has its own development plan, which is a component
of the national plan. Under the Third National Development Plan (1975-80),
the Federal Government set the following reasonable policy objectives regard-
ing urban water supply:
(i)  all communities of 20,000 or more people should be provided
with pipe-borne water; and
(ii)  all major urban centers should be provided with at least
115 liters per head per day by 1980.
It also decided to advance modern sewerage and drainage systems in the major
urban centers. However, project implementation in the individual states,
including in Kaduna State, has been largely uncoordinated, and has fallen
short of established targets.
Kaduna State
24.       Kaduna State covers about 8 percent of the total area of Nigeria,
and has a population estimated at just over 6 million. Its capital is Kaduna,
with a population estimated at about 600,000. The town is a major industrial
center, and one of the two dominant cities in northern Nigeria. The state's
largest river, the Kaduna River, is perennial, and by far the major source of
water supply in the state. Other rivers are seasonal. Groundwater resources
have not yet been explored in detail, but are generally limited to low yield-
ing shallow wells.



-8-
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Organization
25.       The main water resources agency in the state is the Kaduna State
Water Board (KSWB), which was established in 1971. It is responsible for
providing water for domestic, industrial, and agricultural purposes through-
out the state. Until recently, there was no agency specifically responsible
for waste water disposal. However, in the Kaduna city area, the Kaduna
Capital Development Board (KCDB), which was established in 1971, has now been
given responsibilities for sewerage, in addition to maintenance of roads and
drains and refuse collection and disposal. A UNDP-financed Master Plan for
Sewerage and Stormwater Drainage in Kaduna city is being completed. Under
this two-year project, engineering consultants are preparing a program concern-
ing waste water disposal, storm drainage, and refuse disposal for execution by
KCDB.
Existing Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities and Services
26.       KSWB is responsible for urban and rural water supply throughout the
state, but is estimated to reach only about two-thirds of the urban population
and one-tenth of the rural population. The supplies in many areas are un-
reliable.
27.       In the Kaduna city area, the first public water supply system was
constructed on the Kaduna River in 1929. The treatment plant is in poor con-
dition, but cannot be taken out of service, because of the already serious
shortage in overall production capacity. A second plant began operating in
1964. The two treatment plants supply a transmission and distribution system
which includes about 300 km of pipes. Until the early 1970s, the plants were
able to meet the demands from the distribution system, which served about 70-
80 percent of the population. In recent years, however, both domestic and
industrial demand have accelerated, and KSWB has not adequately expanded the
system. Consequently, and aggravated by KSWB's low operational efficiency,
there have been increasing water shortages in Kaduna in the past two to three
years.
28.       The vast majority of KSWB's private connections are for domestic
consumers. Although residents in Kaduna's higher income areas seem to be
reasonably well-served, low-income residents receive poor service. Many areas
have no distribution system at all, and others have only a skeletal network,
with some private connections and a few standpipes. About one-third of the
population, mostly low-income residents, lack proper access to public water
supply.
29.       Excluding industrial consumption, which accounts for about 50 per-
cent of available water, per capita consumption in the Kaduna city area aver-
ages only about 45 liters daily. Moreover, the supply is unreliable because
of inadequate production capacity and frequent breakdowns caused by electric
power failures. The standard of service is further affected by the increasing
pollution of the Kaduna River, which results in periodic contamination of the
drinking water.



30.       Waste water disposal is rudimentary throughout Kaduna State.
There are practically no piped sewerage systems in the state, and sanitation
is poor, especially in the urban lower-income areas. Less than one-tenth of
Kaduna city's population is estimated to be served by piped sewerage and about
one-third by septic tank systems. All effluents, including treated sewerage,
eventually flow into the Kaduna River.
Water Supply and Sanitation Development
31.        There is already a large unsatisfied demand for water in Kaduna
city, and the continuing rapid growth of the city -- with the population
expected to double by 1987 and triple by 1995 -- will require a considerable
expansion of KSWB's facilities. Projections of future capacity, production,
and sales indicate that the city's water supply should double within four
years and quadruple within nine years.
32.        The Kaduna State Government (KSC) is giving high priority to
improving water supply, and has allocated about one-sixth of its capital
budget for the period 1975-80 to KSWB for water supply projects. KSWB has
allocated about half of its budget to projects in rural areas and urban
centers outside Kaduna city.
33.        KSG has allocated only 2.4 percent of its capital budget for the
period 1975-80 for waste disposal, reflecting the limited attention this
service has been receiving so far. However, the UNDP-financed study of
Kaduna city's waste disposal requirements should provide a basis for future
programs (para. 25).
Bank Role
34.        Since 1974, when KSG and KSWB first approached the Bank on possible
assistance, the Bank has given KSWB advice from time to time on its operations
and policies, as well as on its organization and management. As proposed by
the Bank, KSWB hired consultants to prepare a master plan for Kaduna State s
water supply and to carry out studies on Kaduna city's distribution system and
the pollution of the Kaduna River. However, KSWB requires substantial assis-
tance from the Bank, which would be provided under the proposed project, our
first operation in the sector.   The project would not include a sanitation
component since KSG wants to await the completion of the Sewerage and Waste
Disposal Master Plan before deciding upon a comprehensive sanitation program
(para. 25).
35.        The Bank is awaiting the outcome of the Rapid Assessment of the
country's water and sanitation sector proposed at the United Nations Water
Conference in Argentina in 1977, and to be completed by WHO in 1979; the
study will provide the basic data for a plan of action to achieve, in the
context of the International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, the provi-
sion of safe water and sanitation facilities for all by the year 1990.
This study, together with a sector survey to be carried out by staff of
the Bank/WHO Cooperative Program in 1979, is expected to enable the Bank
to more systematically plan its further role in Nigeria's water supply and
waste disposal sector. The Bank has already been approached by various state
governments on assisting other water supply and sanitation projects.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       Nigeria originally sought Bank support for a water supply project
in Kaduna in 1974. However, after the Bank had appraised the project in early
1975, KSWB came under new management, which suggested a completely revised
scope and content of the project. The modified water supply project was
prepared by KSWB with the help of consultants and overall guidance from Bank
staff, and appraised by the Bank in May/June 1978. Post-appraisal missions
visited Kaduna in November 1978 and January 1979. A Staff Appraisal Report,
dated April 1979 (2247-UNI), is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations on the proposed loan were held at the Bank in March
1979. Supplementary data on the project is to be found in Annex III.
Project Objectives
37.       The project would assist in strengthening Kaduna city's water supply
system by increasing the quantity, improving the quality, and ensuring a
socially more equitable distribution of potable water. Because of the already
large unsatisfied demand for water and the expected high rate of population
growth, the expansion of the water supply system envisaged under the project
would not meet total requirements. However, the project would eliminate
shortages caused by production constraints, double the distribution system to
reach at least 85 percent of the population, provide all connected consumers
with an uninterrupted supply of safe water, and strengthen KSWB's management.
Project Description
38.       The project would be implemented over the period 1979-85, and would
consist of:
Water Supply Facilities in the Kaduna City District
(i) cSnstructing a raw water intake with a capacity of 300,000
m /day ani a pumping station with an initial capacity of
150,000 m /day on the Kaduna River;
(ii) constructing a water treatment plant with a capacity of
150,000 m /day;
(iii) constructing 6 storage reservoirs and installing 16 pump
sets;
(iv) laying about 37 km of transmission mains and 300 km of
distribution pipelines, and installing about 250 public
standpipes in presently unserved areas; and
(v) rehabilitating the city's North water works;



- 11 -
Operating Facilities
(vi) constructing new headquarters offices and central workshop
and meter repair facilities; and
(vii)  installing facilities for communication between the major
KSWB offices and water supply facilities in Kaduna and
throughout the state.
Institutional Support and Technical Assistance
(viii) strengthening KSWB management and organization;
(ix) expanding and improving formal and in-service training; and
(x) providing consulting services.
39.        An important component of the project, with state-wide and even
country-wide implications, would be the expansion and improvement of KSWB's
training program for supervisory and operator-level staff. In order to meet
its own training requirements, as well as those of other state water boards
and local government agencies involved in minor water supply and sanitation
works mainly in rural areas, KSWB needs to expand its present facilities and
staff. The project therefore provides for the construction and equipping of
additional training facilities, the appointment of a Training Executive
Officer and additional instructors, a manpower survey and assessment of
training needs, and a revamping of the existing training program.
40.        The project would also provide for consulting services and technical
assistance. Engineering consultants (47 man-years) have been and would be
employed for design, procurement, and construction supervision of the project
components. Training consultants (5 man-years) would assist in reviewing
KSWB's manpower situation, in planning and implementing its revised training
program, and in developing its training facilities. Consultants (10 man-years)
already employed by KSWB have prepared a master plan for Kaduna State's water
supply and studies of Kaduna city's distribution system and the pollution of
the Kaduna River (para. 34); these studies supplied essential data for the
preparation and evaluation of the proposed project, and were completed in
late-1978 and early-1979. Consultants (13 man-years) would also be engaged to
study and advise on the future utilization of the city's first water treatment
plant and KSWB's tariff level and structure, and to provide specialized
management assistance.
Project Implementation
41.        The project would be implemented by KSWB over a period of five
years. Its major component would be the construction of the water treatment
plant, to be built under two contracts, one for equipment and the other for
civil works. Tenders for the first contract were called in late-1978, follow-
ing review by the Bank. Operation of the first half of the treatment plant is
scheduled for late-1982, with final completion in 1984.



- 12 -
42.       KSWB was recently reorganized to improve its operational effective-
ness. Its Board of Directors now comprises 16 members (3 state government, 3
local government, 1 army, and 8 private sector representatives in addition
to KSWB's General Manager). Under a recently appointed General Manager,
various senior staff have been redeployed. While a number of vacancies still
exist at the middle management level, the staff situation has improved greatly
over the past two years. KSWB presently employs about 23 expatriates, mostly
engineers and accountants, and intends to continue recruiting expatriate staff
until trained and experienced local staff is available. Its total staff
numbers about 1,750, of whom 300 are employed for the routine operation
and maintenance of Kaduna city's water supply system.  The staffing situation
would be reviewed under the manpower survey to be carried out by the training
consultants (para. 40).
43.       The lack of effective management has been a major cause of KSWB's
low operational efficiency in recent years. To strengthen management, and to
ensure the effective and timely implementation of the proposed project, KSWB
has agreed to employ a Project Manager, who would be directly responsible to
the General Manager. His terms of reference, qualifications, and terms and
conditions of employment should be acceptable to the Bank, and the appointment
would be a condition for effectiveness of the Loan (Section 6.01(d) of the
Loan Agreement). KSG and KSWB would consult the Bank on any future changes in
KSWB's organization and senior management (Section 2.03 of the Kaduna State
Agreement and Section 3.02 of the Project Agreement). KSWB is also exploring
the possibility of obtaining specialized management assistance from more
experienced foreign public utilities or consultants.
44.       KSWB would pay special attention to the basic water requirements of
the low-income consumers. It would give priority to pipeline construction in
areas which are critically short of water, and would install public stand-
pipes where house connections are not yet appropriate. A final decision on
the standard of service for various consumer groups would be taken by KSWB,
in consultation with the Bank, after design and engineering studies have been
completed.
Project Costs
45.       Total costs of the project for the project period 1979-85 are
estimated at US$158.4 million (including taxes and duties of US$4.7 million)
of which the foreign exchange component would amount to US$92.0 million or 58
percent. A breakdown of costs by major categories is given in the Loan and
Project Summary. Allowance has been made for physical contingencies equal to
on average 12.4 percent of base costs, and price contingencies have been
calculated on base costs plus physical contingencies. Price contingen-
cies for foreign costs allow for an annual rate of inflation of 8 percent;
price contingencies for local costs are estimated at 20 percent per annum.
On this basis, total contingencies are estimated at 77 percent of base costs.
46.       The project would provide for minimum acceptable standards of
service at the lowest possible cost. Nevertheless, the costs are still
relatively high due to the high cost of construction in Nigeria aggravated by
high transport cost overland from Nigeria's ports.



- 13 -
Project Financing
47.       The proposed loan to the Federal Government of US$92.0 million would
finance 60 percent of the total project cost, net of taxes, and would be
equivalent to the foreign exchange cost of the project. The Federal Government
as borrower would onlend the loan to KSG, which would further onlend the total
amount of the loan to KSWB, on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.
KSWB would carry the foreign exchange risk. The signing of subsidiary loan
agreements between the Federal Government and KSG on the one hand and between
KSG and KSWB on the other would be a condition of loan effectiveness. As
detailed in the Loan and Project Summary, of the remaining project cost, KSG
would finance US$38.0 million, or 24 percent of total project cost, as a
grant, and KSWB US$28.4 million, or 18 percent, from internal cash generation.
48.       To ensure the timely provision of counterpart funding, KSG has
agreed to make the necessary allocation in its annual budgets, and to deposit
each quarterly portion of such budgetary allocations three months in advance
in KSWB's bank account to be used exclusively for the payment of capital ex-
penditures under the project (Section 3.01 of the Kaduna State Agreement).
In addition, KSWB would use the revenues from the Kaduna city district ex-
clusively to pay for the district's operating and capital expenditures and
to service the district's debt. Separate accounts and financial statements
would be prepared for the district, and audited accounts would be submitted
to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year. Tariffs
would be adjusted each year to generate in the district, and gradually also in
the other districts, revenues sufficient to cover total annual cash operating
requirements and debt service, as well as an agreed proportion of capital
expenditures, such proportion averaging 18 percent of total capital expendi-
tures over the project period. Finally, additional debt would not be incurred
by KSWB unless its internal cash generation covers its maximumt future debt
service 1.5 times (Sections 4.03 and 4.04 of the Project Agreement and supple-
mentary letter).
Financial Position
49.       During the last two years combined, KSWB obtained a rate of return
of 3.2 percent on unrevalued net fixed assets. The Kaduna city district is
estimated to have earned between 7 and 12 percent on the same basis while the
other districts combined operated at a loss, despite operating grants from
KSG. In the future, assuming a gradual improvement in KSWB's operational
efficiency and a satisfactory tariff policy (para. 52), the Kaduna city dis-
trict should be financially viable; its return on revalued net fixed assets
in operation is projected to amount to 3 percent in 1983, a year of heavy
transfer of assets to operation, and to reach about 5 percent in 1985.
50.       The project would help KSWB to bring all districts eventually to a
level of financial viability comparable to that envisaged for the Kaduna city
district. This assumes among others reduction of unaccounted-for water from
45 percent of water produced in 1978 to about 25 percent by 1984 and improved
billing and collection practices. These objectives form part of a Manage-
ment and Operations Improvement Program to be carried out during project imple-
mentation (supplementary letter).



- 14 -
Cost Recovery
51.       Although in most states in Nigeria water is provided at much less
than cost or even completely free, KSG has been promoting the principle of
cost recovery. For this reason, KSWB's water tariffs are generally higher
than elsewhere in Nigeria. In fact, existing tariffs, which are uniform
throughout the state, already reflect the long-run marginal cost of water
supply in the Kaduna city district. However, KSWB's current tariffs are not
deemed to discourage minimum levels of consumption; the high cost of alter-
native supplies, including through privately constructed unregistered con-
nections and reliance on water carriers, exceeds KSWB's charges.
52.       To meet the revenue targets proposed for the Kaduna city district,
and gradually also for the other districts (para. 48), it is projected that
the tariff level would need to be increased each year so as to produce an
additional 15 percent in revenues annually during project implementation. In
deciding upon its future tariff structure, KSWB would pay particular attention
to the needs of the low-income consumers. Most of those consumers are being
and would be served by public standpipes, which would be metered but completely
paid for by KSG. However, appropriate water tariffs cannot be determined
without further study. Consequently, KSWB would engage consultants, and
would, in consultation with the Bank, restructure its tariffs in accordance
with the recommendations of the study by October 1, 1980 (Section 3.07 of the
Project Agreement).
Procurement
53.       Equipment, estimated to cost about US$43 million, would be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines
for contracts of US$100,000 or more, and through local competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank for contracts of less than
US$100,000. About 23 percent of these orders are expected to be supplied
through Nigeria-based companies. Civil works, estimated to total about US$99
million, would be contracted through international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines for contracts of US$1,000,000 or more, and
through local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to
the Bank for contracts of less than US$1,000,000. These contracts are expected
to be won by Nigeria-based companies. Construction of new standpipes and
conversion of illegal connections, estimated to cost about US$3 million, would
be carried out by KSWB on force account as part of its routine operations.
Domestically manufactured goods procured under international competitive
bidding would be allowed a 15 percent preference or the applicable import
duty, whichever is lower, for purposes of bid evaluation. The services of
consultants and specialist staff to be engaged under the project, valued at
US$80,000 per man-year or about US$6 million, would be obtained on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Disbursement
54.       The proposed loan would be disbursed during the period 1979-85.
Disbursement on plant, equipment, and materials, estimated at US$35.2 million,
would be made against 100 percent of foreign expenditures or, if locally



- 15 -
procured, against 90 percent of local expenditures. Disbursement on civil
works, estimated at US$45.1 million, would be made against 60 percent of total
expenditures. Disbursement on consulting services and technical assistance is
estimated at US$4.3 million, and would be made against 100 percent of foreign
expenditures. This includes an amount of US$1,000,000 for three studies
carried out by consultants over the period 1977-79, which provided essential
data for the preparation and evaluation of the proposed project (paras. 34
and 40), and assistance in final design and engineering of the distribution
system, all of which would be financed retroactively. An additional amount
of US$7.4 million is provided on an unallocated basis.
Project Benefits
55.       Since it would be impractical to distinguish water production
resulting from the project from that produced by other components of KSWB's
ongoing and future system expansion in the Kaduna city district, the internal
economic rate of return has been calculated for the total investment program
to be carried out over the period 1978-1994. On that basis, and assessing
benefits as the value of water consumption at present tariffs, and costs at
present domestic market prices, the rate of return of the water supply project
is estimated at 9.5 percent. The assessment of the benefits is somewhat
conservative, however, since the demand price significantly exceeds present
tariffs because of insufficient supplies. The rate of return is not very
sensitive to changes in the projected growth of demand for water in Kaduna; if
demand is assumed to grow at only half of the expected rate from 1982 onward,
the rate of return will be 8.5 percent, provided that capital expenditures
beyond 1983 are rescheduled appropriately. The external economies which
accrue from increased water consumption, such as considerable lhealth benefits,
cannot be quantified, and have not been included in the valuation of benefits.
Similarly, the calculation does not take account of improved employment
prospects in Kaduna city. At the peak of the construction activity, the labor
force would comprise about 1,200 workers. KSWB would require about 150
additional employees to operate and maintain its expanded system. More
important, the provision of dependable water supplies to present and future
industries would assist in creating long-term employment opportunities in the
city.
56.       The principal benefits of the water supply project would be the
expanded coverage and improved quality of service provided by the water
supply system of Kaduna, one of Nigeria's most important cities. Expansion
of the distribution network would permit KSWB to serve an additional 400,000
consumers with piped water, as well as new industries and institutions. The
production capacity of the system would more than double, ensuring sufficient
quantities of water until about 1989. Operational standards would be expected
to improve substantially so that all consumers could anticipate an uninter-
rupted supply pf safe water. The project would particularly benefit low-
income consumers, who are poorly served at present. Although the poverty
level cannot be established exactly because of lack of data, it is estimated
that about three-quarters of the additional 400,000 consumers would be in the
low-income group. The strengthening of KSWB in terms of organization,
staff, and performance could be expected to lead to its becoming a model for
other water utilities throughout Nigeria.

Project Risks
57.       KSWB's management deficiencies in the past were mainly caused by
the scarcity of qualified and experienced executives, and there is a risk that
KSWB would not be able to attract and/or retain competent management. However,
the appointment of a Project Manager and KSG's and KSWB's recent senior
appointments and hiring policies should reduce this risk (paras. 42 and 43).
58.       Since water intake requirements would increase considerably over
the next years, a sufficient flow of the Kaduna River would have to be assured.
In the past, the river at times did not have sufficient water in periods of
extremely low flow. For this reason, a storage reservoir was completed in
1978, upstream of Kaduna at Kangimi, to release water when necessary. Its
proper operation should meet Kaduna city's water requirements until at least
1990. Nevertheless, Kaduna city's water resources should be carefully con-
trolled, and the Kangimi Reservoir operated judiciously. Therefore, KSG and
KSWB have agreed (Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the Project Agreement) that:
(i) plans for irrigation at Kangimi would be reviewed by both
parties to ensure an adequate minimum flow of the Kaduna River;
(ii)  KSWB would continue to be responsible for the operation of
the Kangimi Reservoir;
(iii)  no further abstractions would be permitted from the Kaduna
River basin upstream of Kaduna without prior consent of KSWB;
and
(iv)  availability of water from the Kaduna River system in low-
flow periods would be evaluated by KSWB at least once every
three years for review by KSG and other interested parties.
59.       The construction of the project would have no significant envi-
ronmental impact. However, the project would result in the production of
increased quantities of waste water. This matter is being studied by consul-
tants as part of the Master Plan for Sewerage and Stormwater Drainage (paras.
25 and 34). In the meantime, KSG has agreed to intensify its public health
information campaign and to start rehabilitating and constructing high-priority
drainage and refuse collection facilities at its own expense (Section 3.03 of
the Kaduna State Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Loan No. 427-UNI      Western Nigeria Road Project:  US$14.5 million Loan of
September 26, 1965; Effective Date: March 29, 1966;
Closing Date: March 31, 1975
The project has been completed. Before formal closure, the Bank
awaits word from the Government that no further withdrawal applications are
pending.
Loan No. 814-UNI      Second Education Project:  US$17.3 million Loan of
April 18, 1972; Effective Date: November 28, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Disruptions caused by the creation of new State Governments in 1976
are no longer delaying the project. While progress is being made in the
implementation of the project in three of the four participating States, the
current financial constraints have affected part of the project in Imo State.
The project should be completed during 1979.
Loan No. 838-UNI      Fifth Highway Project:  US$26.3 million Loan of
June 26, 1972; Effective Date: February 20, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The construction components of the project have been completed.
The closing date of the loan was recently extended in order to complete
disbursements and to allow consultants to complete preparation for a Sixth
Highway Project.
Loan No. 847-UNI      Fourth Power Project:  US$76.0 million Loan of
June 30, 1972; Effective Date: June 26, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
While the completion of the rural electrification component has
been delayed, the project is expected to be completed by August 1979.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 922-UNI      Second Lagos Port Project:  US$55.0 million Loan of
August 1, 1973; Effective Date: October 30) 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Civil works are complete. Container cranes are now on order and
will be in operation by the end of 1979. Total project costs are much in
excess of the appraisal estimates due to labor awards and cost overruns.
A revision of the tariff structure in 1977 considerably improved the
financial situation of the National Ports Authority.
Loan No. 929-UNI      Third Education Project:  US$54.0 million Loan of
August 16, 1973; Effective Date: January 14, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Since appraisal, project costs have increased fourfold and the
scope of the project is under review. Because of weak management and a need
to redesign the project, completion could be delayed by a year or more.
Project administration was complicated by the partition of many states
in 1976. Discussions are being held between the Bank and the Government with
a view to strengthening the project administration and making adequate provi-
sions for timely counterpart funding. Once these issues have been resolved
satisfactorily, a proposed revision of the project scope and extension of the
closing date will be submitted to the Board for consideration.
Loan No. 1045-UNI    Second Cocoa Project:  US$20.0 million Loan of
October 11, 1974; Effective Date: October 15, 1975;
Closing Date: September 30, 1981
Although the creation of new States has created some organizational
and managerial problems, the project is almost completed in three of the four
states. Progress of the Bendel State component is now better because manage-
ment/organizational problems have been reduced.
Loan No. 1091-UNI    Livestock Development Project:  US$21.0 mi:Llion Loan
of March 20, 1975; Effective Date:  July 19, 1976;
Closing Date: July 1, 1981
Project implementation has been slow due to the creation of new
States and operational difficulties. Serious problems of counterpart
funding from the Federal Government have been encountered. A contract has
recently been concluded with a management consulting firm and, as a result,
prospects for project implementation are greatly improved.

Loan No. 1092-UNI    Funtua Agricultural Development Project:  US$29.0 million
Loan of March 20, 1974; Effective Date:  January 5, 1976;
Closing Date: July 1, 1982
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily with excellent
farmer response and the full support of both Federal and State Governments.
Demand for inputs is consistently above appraisal estimates. The federally
controlled Agricultural Projects Monitoring and Evaluation and Planning Unit
financed under this loan is fully operational. Project costs are in line
with appraisal estimates and disbursement is proceeding satisfactorily.
An expanded second stage project to cover the remainder of Kaduna State is
being appraised.
Loan No. 1099-UNI    Gusau Agricultural Development Project:  US$19.0 million
Loan of April 4, 1975; Effective Date:  January 5, 1976;
Closing Date: July 1, 1982
The project is progressing satisfactorily with support from both
Federal and State Governments. Farmer response is good and appraisal
objectives are being met and in some cases exceeded. Project unit costs are
some 25 percent above appraisal estimates due to domestic inflation.
There have been problems relating to the timely delivery of fertilizer
supplies which are centrally procured by the Federal Government. Recent
agreements between the Bank and the Government on the streamlining of
fertilizer procurement should help to resolve this problem. Thes possibility
of a second phase project is being examined.
Loan No. 1103-UNI    Rice Project:  US$17.5 million Loan of April 25, 1974;
Effective Date: January 10, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
Project implementation has been slow due to deficiencies in
counterpart funding and staffing limitations. The Bank has withdrawn from the
project component located in Cross River State because of acute problems of
cost overruns and inadequate physical progress. Plans to reallocate the
remaining funds to project components in Anambra and Imo States, where physical
project progress is more satisfactory, will depend upon improved counterpart
funding.
Loan No. 1164-UNI    Gombe Agricultural Development Project:  US$21.0 million
Loan of September 29, 1975; Effective Date: December 29,
1976; Closing Date: July 1, 1982
The project is being implemented sdLisfactorily with full support
from both Federal and State Governments. Farmer response is most favorable.
The demand for inputs and the production of maize is exceeding appraisal
estimates. Problems in recruiting intermediate and junior staff continue.
There have been no delays in the provision of local counterpart funds. The
preparation of a feasibility study for an expanded second-stage project to
cover the remainder of Bauchi State is proceeding satisfactorily.

Loan No. 1183-UNI   Mid-Western (Bendel) State Oil Palm Project:
US$29.5 million Loan of December 31, 1975;
Effective Date: October 17, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
Loan effectiveness was substantially delayed because of problems
relating to staff recruitment, land acquisition and completion of the
Federal and State Legal Opinions and State Loan Agreement. Appraisal
targets have not been met for the smallholder component as a result of
financial and managerial problems. Management has improved recently but
planting targets are behind schedule. Cost overruns are likely to be
substantial.
Loan No. 1191-UNI   East Central (Imo) State Oil Palm Project:  US$19.0
million Loan of February 12, 1976; Effective Date:
April 6, 1977; Closing Date:  December 31, L984
Project implementation was delayed due to the creation of new states
and problems with intermediate and junior staffing. The latter have now
been resolved, but there are problems of local counterpart funding. Appraisal
targets have not been met and substantial cost overruns are expected.
Loan No. 1192-UNI   Western (Ondo) State Oil Palm Project:  US$17.0
million Loan of September 22, 1976; Effective Date:
February 13, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The smallholder component is progressing well but planting is
lagging behind appraisal targets, although the final target is Likely to be
achieved. Problems with estate land acquisition and funding deLayed effec-
tiveness, and will result in a reduced planted area.

Loan of June 28. 1977; Effective Date: March 3, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Although local counterpart funding is now adequate, the project
is still experiencing some problems of a technical nature, particularly con-
cerning extension and training. However, overall project progress is satis-
factory.
Loan No. 1455-UNI   Ayangba Agricultural Development Project:  IJS$35.0
million Loan of June 28, 1977; Effective Date:
March 3, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
After experiencing some problems of local counterpart funding,
the project is now progressing satisfactorily.
