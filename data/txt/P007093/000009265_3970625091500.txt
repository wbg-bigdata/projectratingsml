MEMORADDUM AND RBCWHMENDATION OF TEE PRESIERNT
OF TIIE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Ecuador for US$48 mil-
lion is submitted for,approval. It would help finance a second agricultural
credit project. The proposed loan would be repayable over 17 years, includ-
ing 4 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and
charges. The Government, through the Central Bank (BCE), would onlend the
loan proceeds in local currency to the National Development Bank (BNF) and to
private banks. These intermediaries would onlend to final beneficiaries at
market interest rates and terms of 2 to 12 years. BCE would charge flexible
onlending rates adequate to permit BNF to earn an initial spread of 8 percent
and private banks 5 percent p.a. The Government would assume the exchange
rate risk.
2.        Background.  In 1970, agriculture accounted for about 33 percent of
GDP, 90 percent of export earnings, and employed 65 percent of the economi-
cally active population. During the next decade, influenced by the discovery
and export of petroleum, the relative importance of agriculture declined; and
by 1983 the sector (including fisheries) accounted for only 12 percent of
CDP, 22 percent of export earnings and 50 percent of the economically active
population. In general, average yields have not increased for major crops,
and except for livestock production, forestry, and the shrimp industry, agri-
culture has grown slowly. The growth rate of real value added for the major
export crops--bananas, coffee, and cocoa--has been about 1.7 percent p.a.
from 1970 to the early 1980s. The other traditional crops which constitute
Ecuador's food production have grown at only 0.6 percent p.a., well below the
rate of population growth of 2.8 percent. While the comparative advantage of
Ecuador's traditional exports remains strong, domestic resource cost calcula-
tions indicate that Ecuador also has a comparative advantage in rice, hard
corn, cotton and soybeans, products which are currently imported or only oc-
casionally exported in years of surplus. In the past, agricultural develop-
ment and production were constrained by inadequate public support and by low
investment levels induced by price, exchange rate and interest policies which
no longer stimulated agriculture. The administration that took office in
August 1984 formulated a new development program designed to: (a) raise farm
prices; (b) progressively eliminate consumer and producer subsidies;
(c) achieve realistic exchange rates; (d) make interest rates adjustable and
positive; (e) emphasize efficient import substitution and export expansion;
(f) strengthen agricultural support services; (g) reduce Government interven-
tion in the marketing system; and (h) improve terms of trade for agricul-
ture. Good progress has been made in each of these, and the Bank is monitor-
ing further actions in the context of an Agricultural Sector Loan approved in
FY86.

3.        Project Performance Audit Reports of past livestock credit projects
found them well-managed, improving productivity and output on participating
ranches. However, there were deficiencies in the accounts and internal con-
trols of BNF, the principal participating bank. The most recent agricultural
credit project (Loan 1459-EC) was closed in September 1985. Its performance
was less than satisfactory and it had to be extended for two years. The main
causes for delays were: (a) inadequate counterpart funding; (b) declining
performance of a coordinating uni:; and (c) availability of competing, lower
interest rate funds which caused delays in disbursements. In the design of
the proposed loan, these problems have been addressed: (i) a savings mobil-
ization program will help BNF generate its own funds; (ii) considerable other
institutional strengthening of BNF is also planned; and (iii) onlending terms
of the proposed loan will be competitive with other sources of credit.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would:  (a) expand pro-
duction, especially of exportable products, and increase farmers' profitabi]-
ity through on-farm investments; (b) improve operating efficiency of public
and private banks in agricultural lending and enhance domestic resource mobi-
lization capacity, and (c) stimulate the participation of private banks in
agricultural lending.
5.        Project Description.   The project, to bet carried out over seven
years, would: (a) establish a program for medium- and long-term loans
through BNF and private banks to finance on-farm investments for crop and
livestock production, and marketing infrastructure at the farm level; and
(b) provide institutional strengthening to BNF aimed specifically at
strengthening the capability of the Departments of Credit and Finance. It
would also train BNF staff, both locally and abroad, in the areas of: savings
mobilization, credit promotion, programming and planning, accounting, audit-
ing, reporting, project formulation and subloan appraisal, approval and
supervision. To increase rural resource mobilization and lending, eight new
BNF branch offices would be opened and 42 existing ones would receive addi-
tional equipment. Overall, credit operations would be improved with the pro-
curement of 300 vehicles for loan generation and supervision, and 15 mobile
banking units to serve farmers in areas difficult to reach. BNF would, in
turn, help train staff of private banks in subloan appraisal and supervision.
6.        The total project cost would be about US$93 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$48 million (52 percent). A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procure-
ment and disbursement, as well as a disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Ecuador are given in Schedules C and D, respective-
ly. A map showing BNF offices and physical regions of the country is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6143-EC dated August 15, 1986 is
being distributed separately.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.   As a result of the present Admin-
istration's sector adjustment program, supported by the Agricultural Sector
Loan, the economic efficiency and profitability of the sector is improving.
Consequently, there is an intensification of the demand for investments in
the areas of production, marketing and exports of agricultural goods. The



recent application to the sector of a system of adjustable interest rates for
long-term loans and the support by the proposed project of a savings mobili-
zation program to capture local savings for subsequent investments in the
sector are aspects which would enhance the incentives for financial entities
to initiate lending for development credit in agriculture. However, the re-
cent decline in oil prices has affected significantly Ecuador's financial
capacity to take full advantage of these opportunities. The proposed loan
would help to remedy the country's current lack of resources to meet the ris-
ing demand for agricultural investments and complement Bank support of agri-
cultural and financial sector policy reforms.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following ac-
tions: Ci) Central Bank handling of rediscounting, as the fiscal agent of
the borrower; (ii) BNF assistance to the private banks in subloan evaluation
and monitoring for an initial period; (iii) employment of an expert to help
design a resource mobilization program for BNF and semiannual joint reviews
on the adequacy of the resource mobilization efforts; (iv) maintenance of
positive, adjustable, unified interest rates for the sector, to be reviewed
semiannually beginning April 1, 1987; and (v) maximum accumulated subloan
limits of US$400,000 and US$600,000 for individual farmers and farmers' asso-
ciations, respectively.
9.        Justification.  It is expected that the project would cause an in-
crease in production of a range of products leading to significant foreign
exchange earnings/savings. There would also be intangible benefits resulting
from institutional strengthening, and increased farm employment estimated at
1.7 million incremental man/days, including income increases for 5,000 farm
families of which about 40 percent would be small-scale farmers. Financial
rates of return range from 30 to 37 percent.
10.       Risks.  The main risk is the sustainability of the macroeconomic
adjustment program through which the Government is reactivating agriculture.
The Administration has to date moved successfully forward with its reforms
which are supported and monitored by both the Bank and the Fund.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

Country Brief
ECUADOR
I. THE ECONOMY
1.        The most recent economic report on Ecuador, Report No. 5676-EC en-
titled "Ecuador: Public Investment Revlew," was distributed to the Executive
Directors on December 16, 1985. An earlier general economic memorandum,
Report No. 5094-EC entitled OEcuador: An Agenda for Recovery and Sustained
Growth," was distributed on October 5, 1984. The subsequent paragraphs re-
flect those reports as well as the findings of a March 1986 economic mission
to Ecuador. Annex I provides the main social and economic indicators.
Background
2.        While Ecuador began the 1970s as one of the least developed Latin
American countries, the discovery, exploitation and subsequent world price
hikes of oil placed it firmly among the middle-income countries of the hemi-
sphere by the end of the decade. Oil changed Ecuador's economy dramatical-
ly. Two-thirds of 1970 export revenues were from agriculture; by 1980, near-
1J two-thirds were from petroleum and only a quarter was from traditional
agricultural crops. Real GDP grew an average 9 percent a year in the 1970s.
With this rapid income growth, much social progress was made in spite of
rapid population gro"th (2.8 percent). Significant increases in education
enrollment were achieved, infant mortality was halved, and life expectancy
increased by 15 years.
3.        Resources generated from oil exploitation were, in general, used to
improve priority physical infrastructure needed for development: trunk
roads, pipelines, airports, seaports, power generation. In addition to
financing much of public sector investment, these oil revenues were channeled
through Central Bank credit to the private sector. However, the Government's
role grew: total public expenditulres rose from 24 percent of GDP in 1973 to
34 percent in 1982. Government subsidies--to urban consumers, fuel and elec-
tricity users, import-substituting industries, exporters--grew in impor-
tance. The public sector's use of external borrowing also grew; medium- and
long-term debt outstanding rose from around US$600 million in 1977 to USS7.1
billion in 1985. Nevertheless, the country's institutions remained weak.
Moreover, the benefits of growth not only created severe structural problems,
they were also unevenly distributed: a sizeable middle class emerged but
about 40 percent of the urban and 65 percent of the rural population still
live in poverty.
4.        By 1984 over half of fiscal revenues came from petroleum.  Since
much of the oil revenues were earmarked, only 60 percent of General Govern-
ment current revenues were channeled through the budget. Furthermore, the
non-oil revenue effort was seriously weakened: income taxes represented less
than 2 percent of GDP, while income and import taxes collected represented
less than a quarter of their theoretical yield. Low internal energy prices
created distortions in consumption and investment patterns.



-2-
5.        Further structural problems developed as a result of the trade and
exchange rate policies followed since the 1960s, which gave high protection
to the lndustrial sector and permitted a steady real appreciation of the ex-
change rate. These policies allowed real manufacturing output to rise 150
percent during 1972-1982, virtually all based on import-substitution. But
with one or two exceptions, Ecuador's non-oil exports stagnated, and by 1982
two-thirds of foreign exchange came from oil exports. These underlying prob-
lems made Ecuador's economy very vulnerable to world petroleum prices and to
the availability of foreign credit lines, and helped bring the period of
prosperity to an end by 1982-1983.
Sconomic Performance In Recent Years
6.        A recession developed when oil prices ended their real rise in
1981, foreign credit lines were reduced drastically in 1982, and natural
disasters occurred in 1983. GDP dropped by 3 percent in the latter year.
The Authorities Initially borrowed heavily abroad to counteract the fall in
oil prices, but as Ecuador's access to external funds dwindled, an IMF-sup-
ported stabilization program became necessary. This program adjusted the ex-
change rate, introduced mini-devaluations, and placed temporary restrictions
on imports. Ecuador also undertook a debt rescheduling and initiated a
fiscal austerity program. Inflation, however, surged to 50 percent in 1983
owing to flood-related output disruptions and the short-term effects of the
adjustment measures. By 1984, economic growth resumed (4.1 percent of GDP),
the public sector deficit was virtually eliminated, and inflation was
halved. With new petroleum fields coming on stream, the volume of oil pro-
duced rose 18 percent between 1983 and 1985. Non-oil exports, responding to
improved exchange rates and better weather, also rebounded.
7.        Following a close election, a new Administration took office in
August 1984. Its economic philosophy is very much market-oriented. The new
Government took a number of significant measures aimed at consolidating eco-
nomic recovery and initiating structural reforms: further devaluations; in-
creases in domestic fuel prices, electricity tariffs, and interest rates; re-
moval of those emergency import controls introduced in 1982; promotion of
direct foreign investment; and elimination of most administered prices in
agriculture.  It also negotiated a new IMF Stand-by, which focussed on
achieving balance of payments equilibrium and a reduction in inflation. Sup-
ported by the Stand-by, Ecuador unified two official exchange rates, intro-
duced a new financial savings instrument--certificates of deposit--with
market-determined interest rates, generated a public sector surplus, elimi-
nated some prior import deposits, and tightened monetary control. The re-
sults of all the above measures, together with continued recovery from the
1983 disasters, allowed 1985 GDP to grow by 3 percent, inflation to decline
to a 22 percent annual rate, export volume to grow by 8 percent, net reserves
to improve to nearly US$200 million (equivalent to one month of imports), and
private savings mobilization by the financial sector to increase significant-
ly, mostly through the new certificate of deposit.



-3-
8.        A prime target of the Government's program was its external debt,
servicing of which would have consumed three-fourths of export earnings had
further reschedulings not been arranged. The Government's multi-year debt
rescheduling was finalized in December 1985. All principal falling due to
commercial banks between 1985-1989 (about US$4.2 billion) was rescheduled,
but virtually no fresh money was provided. Similarly, a multi-year arrange-
ment was worked out with the Paris Club in April 1985, dealing with 1984 ar-
rears and principal falling due in 1985-1987 (about US$400 million).  Assum-
ing world petroleum prices had remained about constant in real terms,'the
Authorities-and Bank staff--believed Ecuador could have achieved GDP growth
of 5-6 percent p.a. with a modest level of additional external financing re-
stricted to official sources.
9.        The precipitous fall in oil prices in early 1986, however, has sig-
nificantly changed Ecuador's prospects. Petroleum revenues stand to decline
by over US$850 million in 1986 alone (29 percent of 1985 merchandise ex-
ports), while fiscal revenues from oil could fall by US$460 million (5 per-
cent of GDP). Partly offsetting the oil export losses, agricultural exports
are expected to bring in an additional US$250 million because of higher cof-
fee prices and Ecuador's good policies during 1984-1985. Nevertheless, these
net losses now mean that over a quarter of Ecuador's 1986 domestic savings
and 28 percent of its exports will be needed for foreign interest payments.
Outlook
I0.       Given the recent enormous loss of oil income, Ecuador is likely to
suffer a recession in 1986. While the economic performance of Ecuador is
highly sensitive to world petroleum prices, its prospects also depend on its
ability to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms.
11.       The country is, especially in its new petroleum fields, a rather
low-cost producer, so low that six private oil firms have signed exploration
contracts since 1985; one has found new oil and is testing its commercial
feasibility. Staff projections indicate that oil prices are likely to in-
crease to levels above US$lS/bbl for 1987 and beyond (at 1987 prices). This
would permit GDP to grow at rates above population growth after 1987, even if
the current account deficit were restricted to about 3 percent of GDP. The
debt-service ratio would be about 30 percent of exports of goods and serv-
ices, assuming that thze new borrowings were provided by official and commer-
cial sources at attractive terms. At this relatively low oil price, and
without major increases in oil exports, the Ecuadorian economy could begin
only a slow recovery if the Government desired to improve its creditworthi-
ness and maintain private consumption per capita at about the 1985 level. If
oil prices reach a level around US$17/bbl in 1987 and thereafter (at 1987
prices), the economy could achieve higher GDP growth rates-4 to 5 percent-
even if the current account deficit were restricted to 2 percent of GDP.



-4-
12.       After oil prices, the greatest effect on Ecuador's recovery and
creditworthiness will stem from the Administration's ability to aggressively
implement adjustment policies already begun. These include a steady liberal-
ization of many factor and product prices, reduction of industrial protec-
tion, divestiture of inefficient state enterprises, maintenance of an attrac-
tive exchange rate for exporters, increased utility tariffs and domestic
petroleum prices, increased exploration for oil by both public and foreign
private companies, and enhancing and diversifying sources of fiscal revenue.
The new lower oil price prospects will also require greater efforts to re-
strict the growth of public expenditures, both current and capital.
13.       The IMF recently approved a new Stand-by arrangement for Ecuador.
The Bank is also assisting the Authorities in developing a medium-term growth
strategy as a possible vehicle to mobilize additional resources for Ecuador's
development. Because of Ecuador's past determined effoTts to adjust its
economy despite political and economic difficulties, the likelihood that
petroleum prices will rise from early 1986 levels, and the Government's posi-
tive policy responses, we believe the country remains creditworthy for Bank
lending.
II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Bank Group operations in Ecuador date back to 1954 when a loan was
made for a first highway project. The Bank and IDA have extended 36 loans
and 6 credits to Ecuador totalling US$872.6 million net of cancellations. As
of March 31, 1986, US$498.7 million of this amount had been disbursed. The
IFC has invested in five firms in Ecuador, including a large textile company,
a sugar mill, a cement company, a mining enterprise and a development finance
company. As of March 31, 1986, commitments for these operations amounted to
US$28 million, of which IFC held US$5.2 million. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC operations as of March 31, 1986.
15.       Execution of Bank Group financed projects has often been hampered
by weaknesses in Ecuador's implementation capacity, reflecting the insuffi-
ciency of the country's public sector managerial and technical resources--a
constraint that is still a serious obstacle to Ecuador's economic and social
development. One effort directed at overcoming these weaknesses is the
Public Sector Management Project (Ln. 2516-EC), which focusses on fiscal man-
agement. Furthermore, in recent years, the Government and Bank staff have
worked together to step up disbursement of Bank loans. Among other initia-
tives, a Special Action Program for the country provided for revolving funds
in five projects. As a result of these general efforts, disbursements rose
from US$26 million in FY83 to US$83 million in FY86. The country has set up
a monitoring committee for all externally financed projects which should re-
inforce efforts to accelerate disbursements. The Bank is undertaking annual
portfolio implementation reviews to detect and resolve specific obstacles to
execution of Bank-financed projects; the first took place in November 1985,
and conclusions highlighted the delays caused by complex procurement pro-
cedures. The Public Sector Management Project will finance a study aimed at
streamlining these procedures.



-5-
16.       Bank and IDA lending in Ecuador was originally cpncentrated in
transport and power, where there were substantial bottlenecks to be over-
come. To date, approximately 22 percent of Bank Group lending has been for
infrastructure. Seven of the nine loans and credits extended for transport
were to improve the country's road network and two were to help finance the
expansion of the port of Guayaquil. Three power operations aimed at improv-
ing generation and distribution facilities in Quito; the fourth power opera-
tion aimed at improving efficiency of sector institutions. The first live-
stock development loan, approved in FY67, marked the beginning of a diversi-
fication in the Bank Group's lending program away from Infrastructure. Since
then, the Bank Group has made 11 other loans and credits for agriculture and
fisheries, nine loans to support industrial development, and two for pre-in-
vestment studies. These productive sector loans comprise 65 percent of total
Bank lending to Ecuador. Bank Group support for social sectors-education,
water supply and urban development-now accounts for about 13 percent of
total Bank lending.
17.       Turning to the future, the Bank strategy is to support Government
initiatives in macroeconouic and sector reforms over the medium term. This
will be achieved through a series of sector and project loans aimed princi-
pally at supporting policy improvements in energy, agriculture, and industry,
and developing social and economic infrastructure. In addition to the design
and adoption of adequate sector policies, Bank lending will emphasize the
generation of exports and employment. Besides the Agricultural Credit Pro-
ject recommended in this report, the Bank is preparing financial sector and
petroleum operations. In addition to Bank lending, the IFC is analyzing
several possible operations in agribusiness, fisheries, petroleum refining,
hotels and merchant banking.
18.       Substantial development financing has also been provided to Ecuador
by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the US Agency for International
Development (USAID) and, to a lesser extent, by other bilateral sources. IDB
has been the single largest lender to Ecuador. Loans outstanding (including
undisbursed) from IDB to the country as of December 31, 1985, totalled about
US$1.2 billion equivalent. Past IDB lending has been concentrated in the
power, agriculture, industry and transport fields.  Kost of IDB's loans to
the country have come from the Fund for Special Operations and normally carry
concessional terms. It is likely that IDB will remain Ecuador's major de-
velopment lender in the immediate future with power, agriculture and social-
ly-oriented projects continuing to account for a large share of its lending
program. By December 1985, USAID had about US$158 million in outstanding
loans to Ecuador (including undisbursed).  Its program concentrates on urban
development, agriculture, health and the private sector. In addition to
maintaining close contact with USAID, IDB and other aid agencies to assure
compatibility of programs, Bank staff have undertaken a full public sector
investment review which could serve as the basis for a meeting of Ecuador's
creditors, possibly by end-1986.
19.       As of December 31, 1985, the public and publicly-guaranteed medium-
and long-term external debt of Ecuador totaled about US$7.1 billion. Of the
former sum, the Bank group was owed 4.4 percent and the IDB 8 percent.
Through 1990, the IBRD share of Ecuador's outstanding and disbursed public
foreign debt is expected to remain below 10 percent, and the IBRD share of
total public foreign debt service is projected to remain about 11 percent.
