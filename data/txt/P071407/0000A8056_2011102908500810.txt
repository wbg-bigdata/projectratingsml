                         The performance of the SEED Project has varied over time and by component. Overall, it was slow to start, then improved after the 2008 restructuring and then deteriorated due to
                         intransigence on policy reforms & regulation in the tourism and mining industries.With only 2 months to project closure, the focus is on streamlining business licensing for the tourism
                         and mining industries (as part of GRZ's broader business licensing reform effort) and improving the tourism infrastructure in Livingstone and in Kafue National Park. To date the
                         Project has supported the development of the tourism and gemstone industries through both hard and soft infrastructure. SEED has completed the rehabilitation of selected tourism

                         infrastructure in Livingstone (roads, street lights, historical buildings, public park) while infrastructure rehabilitation is in progress in Kafue National Park (road maintenance equipment
                         and staff houses). In addition, SEED has supported activities that encourage an enabling business environment in these two industries, such as the provision of international best
                         practice and domestic consultations for critical legislation (Tourism & Hospitality Act and Mines & Minerals Act), policy (The Tourism Policy) and other measures to streamline
                         licensing (e.g. support for the mining cadastre and the One Stop Shop in Livingstone).
