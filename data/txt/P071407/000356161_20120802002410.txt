F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project's overall objective is to help reduce the vulnerability of the Zambian economy to
shocks by supporting the diversification of its sources of growth. This is to be achieved by
improving sector specific policy and regulatory frameworks and strengtheining the capacity of
Government agencies to implement them. The development objective will be supported through
selective public investments that stimulate private investments and by creating the condition for
increasing the contribution of gemstones, agribusiness and tourism sectors to GDP and export
revenues. In addition the project seeks to improve management of Kafue and Mosi-o-Tunya
National Parks to underpin the long term sustainable development of the tourism sector.

1.     Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.      Country economic context: Zambia is a relatively large (750,000 km2), landlocked
country, well endowed with natural resources across a diversity of ecosystems (forest, woodland,
grassland, aquatic and anthropogenic biomes). The country has large deposits of semi-precious
and precious gemstones, over 42 million hectares of arable land, ample renewable water
resources, with substantial potential for agriculture production, processing and trade. Taken
together this natural endowment offers the potential for a diversified and export-orientated
economy. A wealth of wildlife and a range of biodiversity areas suggest significant potential for
nature-based tourism. Despite the preponderance of natural wealth, and areas with the potential
for growth and investment, the country has not managed to reduce its dependence on the copper
sector, with copper exports continuing to account for more than 70 percent of Zambia’s foreign
exchange earnings. Economic growth remains strongly correlated with the international market
price for copper and is subject to volatility and external price shocks. Dependence on the copper
sector is further complicated by a continuous decline in Zambian copper production since 1970.
Through the course of the last fifteen years, diversification of the economy through enhancing
the performance of the tourism, agribusiness and gemstone sectors has been slow, in part a
consequence of an unfavorable investment climate, weak public and private sector agencies,
inadequate infrastructure (transport, communication) and relatively weak human capacity.

Rationale for Bank/GEF assistance

2.      Preparation and design: As a result of the copper crises of 2002 (a consequence of
declining copper prices, and disinvestment), the Bank focused its activities on the need for
economic diversification. The project was consistent with the then Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) that emphasized economic growth and diversification. The finalization of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) coincided with the withdrawal of Zambia’s largest copper
producer, Anglo-American in 2002, underlining the importance of reducing Zambia’s
dependence on copper extraction, and the stimulation of growth through diversification of both
production and exports. In light of Zambia’s rich and unexploited natural resources, the CAS and
PRSP both identified tourism, agribusiness and gemstones as potential sectors for growth.

3.      In 2003 the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GoZ) commenced the preparation of
a US$4 million Global Environmental (GEF) grant from the World Bank (WB) as well as
complementary funding from the Government of Norway (NOK; 80 million) and the
International Development Association (IDA; US$8.78 million) to enhance the potential for
nature tourism through: (a) improving biodiversity conservation and management of two
potentially high tourism value national parks, the Mosi-o-Tunya National Park (MNP) and the
Kafue National Park (KNP), (b) supporting the implementation of the Zambian Wildlife
Authority’s (ZAWA) first strategic plan with a shift towards Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
and a cost-center approach for its national parks, and (c) to foster Game Management Areas
(GMA) as part of a broader protected area management approach.




                                               1
4.      The principle objective was to improve Zambia’s capacity to conserve critical species,
habitats and ecosystems, and to support and improve the livelihoods of people living in
surrounding areas. The project design envisaged a holistic approach to park management,
integrating six park management themes/sub-components in KNP and MNP, while focusing the
largest share of funding towards improving management of the biodiversity-rich KNP. The
project’s interventions in each park comprised six support areas tailored to the needs of each
park: (i) park administration and management, (ii) wildlife research and monitoring, (iii)
resource protection, (iv) infrastructure development and maintenance, (v) PPP and business
development, and (vi) Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM). The
project’s life span would comprise an initial five-year implementation period with the potential
for a subsequent second five-year phase.

5.      The project was initially envisioned to address only tourism in protected areas (PA), but
was revised in order to accommodate Government’s objective to reduce economic vulnerability
through a diversification of its sources of growth. Sectors identified for development included
agribusiness and gemstones. The tourism component was expanded to include three inter-related
areas: (i) tourism national/regional (focusing on tourism licensing reform through legislative
reform and operationalization of a One Stop Shop in Livingstone), (ii) tourism infrastructure
improvement in Livingstone City and the (iii) tourism protected area sub-component in the KNP
and MNP. A US$2 million Project Preparation Facility was put in place for project preparation.
A World Bank technical team worked closely with the GoZ’s inter-ministerial project
preparation team (PPT) as well as members of the Government’s Diversification Task Force,
several donors and representatives of the private sector. A World Bank technical preparation
mission visited Zambia 30 June-15 July, 2003 to finalize technical discussions on the design of
the project.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.     The original PDO was to help reduce the vulnerability of the Zambian economy to shocks
by supporting the diversification of its sources of growth.

1.3    Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.    The original GEO was to reverse biodiversity erosion in Kafue National Park and Mosi-
o-Tunya National Park and its surrounding areas.

1.4    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
       and reasons/justification

8.     The revised PDO (2007) was to improve the business environment for (i) sustainable
tourism in the greater Livingstone area; and (ii) the gemstone sector.

1.5    Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
       and reasons/justification

9.     The GEO was not revised.

1.6    Main Beneficiaries

10.     The primary beneficiary group as identified in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD),
consisted of formal and informal enterprises (such as the private sector at the national level,
around Livingstone and MNP and KNP, identified mining areas) as well as communities living
in the communal areas and GMAs surrounding the KNP and MNP. Global benefits were
expected to accruess through the protection of universally valuable ecosystems and the
conservation of significant biodiversity species that, in the absence of the intervention, would
otherwise have become more endangered. Although ZAWA was not listed in the PAD as a
primary beneficiary, the project interventions targeted ZAWA directly as the most important
wildlife estate service provider and it aimed to improve ZAWA’s regional and park management
performance. Community beneficiaries would be targeted primarily through Community-
Resource Boards in the KNP surrounding GMAs.

1.7    Original Components (as approved)

11.    The original SEED Project consisted of four components:

12.     Tourism and Protected Areas: This component was, in turn, divided into two main
areas – tourism and protected area management. The tourism component was further divided into
three sub-components:

       (a) Policy, regulatory and institutional support to the Ministry of Tourism, Environment
           and Natural Resources (MTENR) and its agencies;

       (b) Investment in tourism and capacity building to support the tourism industry in the
           Livingstone area; and

       (c) Infrastructure development for Livingstone and institutional support for Livingstone
           City Council (LCC). The protected area sub-component covered biodiversity
           restoration in MNP and KNP and capacity building for ZAWA.

13.   Agribusiness Sector Development: This component was envisioned to increase the
competitiveness and value-add of the agribusiness sector by:

       (a) Supporting and accelerating the development of supply chain linkages from farm to
           market;
       (b) Improving quality and safety codes of practice; and
       (c) Encouraging new product development.

14.   Gemstone Sector Development: This component was comprised of two sub-
components:

       (a) Strengthening transparency and governance in mining through the formulation and
           adoption of a mining sector development policy; amending the Mining and Minerals
           Act and complementary regulations; strengthening the managerial and technical
           capacity, and the financial sustainability of mining bureaus in two pilot areas serving


                                                3
           emeralds and amethyst extraction, Kitwe and Livingstone respectively; providing
           formal training to small scale miners; and establishing a modern and transparent
           mining cadastre;
       (b) Strengthening supply chains through assistance to small-scale and artisanal mining
           organizations and dependent communities; establish the institutions to improve trade
           conditions for gemstones; and strengthening the representative industry organizations.

15.     Implementation and Capacity Building: This component provided support to the
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU).

1.8    Revised Components

16.     Poor engagement and low levels of demonstrated interest on the part of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives (MAAC), in the first year of project implementation, led to the
dropping of the agribusiness component in 2005 and its subsequent incorporation into the new
Agriculture Development Support Project (ADSP). It was also recognized that the comparative
complexity of the project was impeding implementation of the ADSP. Following project
restructuring, concluded in August 2007, funds from the agribusiness component were
reallocated to other components.

17.   The Tourism Component was simplified to focus all activities towards achieving a
more targeted PDO. The redesigned component incorporated three mutually reinforcing
subcomponents:

       (a) Improving the national business environment for tourism through the
           development, communication and implementation of the new Tourism and
           Hospitality Act and related statutory instruments. It was envisioned that the
           development of a robust legislative framework, and twinned capacity building
           essential for the successful implementation of the Act , would ease the cost of starting
           and operating tourism related businesses in support of achieving the PDO;

       (b) Improving the business environment for sustainable tourism in the Greater
           Livingstone Area: associated activities focused on supporting the rehabilitation of
           priority infrastructure for tourism in Livingstone, including the establishment of a the
           One Stop Shop (OSS) for licensing tourism businesses, and the development and
           implementation of a Tourism Plan. The focus on providing priority infrastructure,
           both “hard? (roads, street lighting, drainage and refurbishment of historical buildings
           and a park) and “soft? (improving the efficacy of the licensing process, enabling the
           development and implementation of a locally driven tourism plan, and supporting
           small businesses to gain access to the tourism economy), the project would facilitate
           the development of a more broad-based, competitive and sustainable tourism
           industry, with competent and strengthened industry associations; and

       (c) Facilitating development of sustainable tourism in Kafue National Park (KNP):
           This subcomponent continued to seek improvement of park infrastructure,
           management and biodiversity conservation to enhance the tourism potential of KNP
           and to attract private investment. KNP was one of the four potential flagship tourism


                                                4
           destinations whose development was identified as a priority under the Fifth National
           Development Plan. The restructured project only supported KNP, with MNP dropped
           from the revised sub-component.

18.    The Gemstone Component was retained in its original design. However, the key
performance indicators were revised in an effort to more accurately measure improvements in
support of the PDO. The outcome objective of his component was revised to “improving the
business environment for the gemstone sector?.

19.    The Implementation and Capacity Building component was restructured to become a
Project Management Unit Component. New implementation arrangements aimed to increase
accountability for results, improve project management and ensure efficient use of resources.

1.9    Other significant changes

20.    The project was extended by two years.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Strategic Approach

21.     Overall SEED. Project preparation for SEED initially envisioned a tourism project with
the concurrent goal of facilitating the development of the tourism industry and environmental
protection (zoning and protection of some national parks). As a result of the copper crises of
2002 (i.e., declining copper prices, pulling out of Anglo-American from the largest copper mine
in the country) the focus of the Bank shifted to the urgent need to support economic
diversification. As a consequence the project was significantly revised and it became an
ambitious flagship project incorporating the gemstones and agribusiness sectors, and solid waste
disposal in Livingstone. A SEED decision meeting in November 2003 noted that SEED as a
diversification project with four components and three sectoral areas (tourism, agribusiness and
gemstones), implementation would be significantly more complex and incorporate new risks to
the achievement of the PDO. The appraisal team also noted low levels of Government ownership
and capacity as a further risk to the project. The decision meeting also highlighted the impact of
the reorganization of the project on sustainability, especially with regard to the importance of the
role of the Livingstone City Council (LCC) with regard to the infrastructure sub-component of
the project, and the need for support to ZAWA under the protected areas sub-component.

22.    Protected Areas. Bank and GEF involvement was underpinned by the importance of the
nature-based tourism for Zambia’s economy and the importance of Zambia’s largest and oldest
National Park, the KNP and its biodiversity assets. The tourism and protected area component
was designed to rehabilitate the degraded national park, utilizing a holistic and integrated
approach to protected area management. As a consequence, the project focused simultaneously
on resource protection, park administration and management, wildlife resources research and
monitoring, as well as infrastructure development, tourism development and community
involvement in GMAs. By supporting two national parks, the KNP and the small MNP, the


                                                 5
project aimed to support the development of the so-called “Western Circuit? connecting the
Victoria Falls with the KNP, Government’s priority area for tourism development. Other SEED
tourism sub-components were intended to enhance private sector initiatives in the tourism sector
through the establishment of a OSS for the streamlining of licensing and other procedures
necessary for the establishment of new tourism enterprises, as well as improvements to public
infrastructure in Livingstone City to better serve the tourism industry.

Lessons Learned reflected in the project design

23.      Overall SEED. The ICR notes that the project was originally designed in line with the
priorities of the country and Bank at the time of preparation. A Quality of Supervision
Assessment (QSA) conducted by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) reached a similar
conclusion. Building on a Bank-supported initiative to encourage privatization in the copper
industry, the Government accepted the Bank’s advice to diversify the economy, and the SEED
project was envisioned as a flagship tool by the Bank and was approved despite clear
reservations relating to the complexity of the design. This factor, this ICR notes, precluded the
incorporation of some lessons learned in the project design. Thus the project turned out to be a
poor remedy for what ailed the economy at the time and with hindsight, the pulling out of Anglo
American and the design of the project should have been de-coupled. While the project drew on
limited lessons learned from work implemented through the mining component of the ERIPTA
project and various interventions under the auspices of Economic Sector Work (ESW) 1, more
attention should have been paid to issues around the political economy, especially around mining
and specifically the gemstone sector. Lessons learned were also incorporated from Norway’s
long-term support to ZAWA for the rehabilitation of the South Luangwa National Park where
incentive-based resource protection management systems were coupled with a detailed
monitoring system of the park’s resources. Lessons from other Bank/GEF projects in the tourism
sector were not referred to, as the limited number of comparator projects were all still in the
process of being implemented.

24.    Consistency. The project was fully consistent with Bank’s CAS and Zambia’s PRSP
which both emphasized economic growth and diversification, and identified tourism,
agribusiness and gemstones as potential growth sectors. The project was also consistent with
Zambia’s biodiversity and tourism development priorities, GEF’s operational programs on
biodiversity, and ZAWA’s first Strategic Plan (2003-2007).

25.      Risk assessment. Risk identification was comprehensive. However, the extent of these
risks was under-appreciated, particularly with regard to Governments’ poor commitment and
ownership of the project at a macro level, and ZAWA’s limited implementation capacity at
micro-level. The complexity of the project design in terms of multiple sub/components and
implementation arrangements was not identified as a risk to the project. Most risks identified at
project preparation were realized through the course of implementation, including: (a) a
restrictive administrative, policy, legal and economic environment for investment in the tourism
and wildlife sector; (b) limited participation on the part of the business community in tourism

development; (c) insufficient government commitment to the tourism and wildlife sectors, and to
ZAWA to the detriment of it’s the sectors financial sustainability and development; (d) poor
governance of the wildlife sector; and (e) low levels of participation and support from local
communities exacerbated by failures on the part of GMAs to distribute revenues. The PAD
articulated overall risk as modest (M); a more accurate assessment would have identified overall
risk as substantial (S). Mitigation measures should have been more clearly defined and more
rigorously monitored and reported.

26.     The design team tried to mitigate identified risks by: (a) establishing an inter-agency
steering committee; (b) the use and roll-over of the Zambia Economic Recovery and Investment
Promotion Technical Assistance Project’s (ERIPTA) PCU; 2 (c) ensuring supplemental training
for implementing agencies; and (d) supporting the development and implementation of business
plans by LCC and ZAWA to strengthen medium term financial independence and to bolster the
sustainability of programs associated with the project.

27.     Adequacy of participatory process. The preparation process was carried out in a
participatory manner, incorporating input from all key stakeholders including the Ministry of
Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENF), Ministry of Mines and Minerals
Development (MMMD), Ministry for Local Government and Housing (MLGH), Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives (MAAC), the LCC, ZAWA, development partners and the private
sector. The design team undertook a number of visits to Zambia including a technical preparation
mission in 2003 that worked closely with the Government’s inter-ministerial project preparation
team (PPT), met with senior GoZ officials, members of the Diversification Task Force, several
donors and representatives of the private sector. Local communities residing in GMAs
surrounding the KNP and the MNP were not directly consulted during project preparation, as the
project focused its primarily on supporting the national parks themselves. Moreover it was
envisioned that support to the GMA’s would primarily be derived from the Norwegian co-
financing as well as other partners (Denmark and WWF).

2.2        Implementation

28.    Project performance before restructuring. The first phase of project implementation of the
SEED project as well as the ZAWA-led tourism protected areas sub-component (September
2004 – early 2008), progressed in a moderately unsatisfactory manner. Implementation of annual
work plans was poor, as a consequence of low levels of capacity, especially with regard to
procurement and contract management, and overly ambitious work plans.

29.      The first SEED supervision mission, conducted in December 2004, identified poor
commitment and leadership on the part of government as a key impediment to the achievement
of the PDO and GEO. While the PDO, GEO and Implementation Performance (IP) rating were
initially rated as satisfactory, the PDO and IP indicators were downgraded in light of a
significant deterioration in performance to moderately unsatisfactory after the second supervision
mission in March 2005. At the time of the second supervision mission, only the gemstones

2
 Critically, the PCU was rated in the ERIPTA ICR as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Moreover there was no review of the PCU to assess its
performance prior to the extension of its life span under the auspices of the new project, undermining the relevance and impact of this risk
mitigation measure.




                                                                         7
component was assessed as ready for implementation. The draft aide memoire of December 2005
outlined the Bank’s concerns and highlighted the deterioration in implementation performance of
the PDO and GEO. While MTENR disagreed with the substance of the Bank’s observations with
regard to government performance, the MTENR attempted to resolve these issues by appointing
the Permanent Secretary of MTENR as chairperson of the SEED Steering Committee and
initiated weekly meetings on the part of the Steering Committee. The MTENR acknowledged the
need to restructure the project in order to resolve the situation.

30.     Project performance after restructuring. A formal restructuring process was initiated
in 2006 and completed in June 2007. The primary reason underlying the extended period
required for restructuring, was the extensive process of consultation with stakeholders to the
project buy-in and ownership of the restructuring process was deemed critical to successful
implementation. Subsequent to the restructuring, the GEO, PDO and IP aspects of the project
were more positively evaluated: GEO (S), PDO (MS) and IP (MS). The GEO rating remained
Satisfactory throughout the course of the projects life. However, the PDO indicator deteriorated
to MU and the IP rating improved to Satisfactory then deteriorated to MS through to the close of
the project. Disbursement levels increased substantially during the final year of implementation.
By project closure, 100 percent of the IDA credit and 99 percent of the GEF Grant had been
successfully disbursed.

31.     Quality of supervision assessment (QSA7). A QSA7 was carried out in September 2006.
The QSA rated overall supervision during the first two years (prior to restructuring) as
satisfactory, and the focus on development effectiveness as highly satisfactory. Supervision of
fiduciary/safeguard, the adequacy of supervision inputs, processes, candor and quality of the ISR
were all rated satisfactory. The QSA highlighted the ambitious and complex nature of the project
design. A specific concern related to the tourism protected area component which in turn
integrated six sub-components to be implemented in two national parks, under the diffuse
responsibility of the ZAWA HQ, the ZAWA HQ office for the Western Region and the Area
Management Units (in the case of KNP involving 2 AMUs). Quality at entry was evaluated as
unsatisfactory (5), quality of the results framework as moderately satisfactory (3),
implementation readiness at approval, moderately satisfactory (4), the PAD’s initial risk rating of
M as over optimistic, and the overall identification of risks at entry as unsatisfactory (5).

32.     Project management arrangements. The initial PCU, located within the Directorate of
Tourism under the legal authority of the MTENR, was tasked with overall SEED coordination.
As a result of project restructuring in 2007, the PCU was transformed into a project management
unit (PMU). The new PMU structure, and implementation arrangements were meant to foster
increased accountability for results, improved project management and ensure more efficient and
productive use of resources. The project institutional arrangements were mainstreamed, to the
extent possible at the time, within the three national implementation agencies (ZAWA, LCC and
the Directorate of Tourism/SEED PCU). The main features of the restructured PMU were:

33.     The existing PCU was changed to a PMU. Roles and responsibilities were modified to
ensure a single point of management and accountability for the entire project, and encourage the
effective utilization of resources to deliver project results.




                                                8
34.    The PMU was led by a Project Manager, who reported directly to the Director of Tourism
Development at the MTENR. The Director of Tourism Development served, additionally, as
Secretary to the Steering Committee. The Project Manager was made accountable for
management of all implementation activities and delivering results, including the supervision of
procurement and financial management services provided to SEED component managers.

35.     Project components and subcomponents mirrored this arrangement, with
component/subcomponent managers accountable for resource use and delivery of results,
reporting directly to the Project Manager.

36.    The Steering Committee was retained as defined in the original PAD, under the
chairpersonship of the Permanent Secretary for MTENR. The Project Steering Committee
comprised the Permanent Secretaries from MLGH, MMMD, and the Ministry of Finance and
National Planning (MoFNP), the Livingstone City Council Town Clerk, Director of Tourism,
and the Director of the Tourism Council of Zambia. The Project Steering Committee meetings
were planned to be held quarterly until project performance was upgraded after which meetings
were to be held on a bi-annual basis to (i) approve annual work plans; and (ii) review progress
towards outcomes.

37.     In analyzing the efficacy and efficiency of the transformation of the PCU into a PMU, it
is worth noting that restructuring of the PCU is positively correlated with improvements to the IP
rating: MU for the period spanning the commencement of the project through December 2007;
thereafter the rating improved to S, before a final assessment of MS at the close of the project.
Moreover the SEED MTR of 2009 cited significant improvement in the project’s Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) to the benefit of overall project management, albeit that M&E improvements
related mainly to monitoring expenditures and activities and not to impact monitoring. Project
management was rated as S at project closing. These improvements can be largely attributed to
the introduction of accountability for results regime integral to the restructuring of the PCU into
a PMU. Procurement functions similarly improved, although the overall procurement rating was
negatively affected by the procurement performance of ZAWA and MMMD. The initial and the
final implementation arrangements involving a separate Lusaka-based PMU were however,
judged by some implementers as inefficient resulting in perceived review delays and slowed
approval of project management documents (progress reports, annual work plans, procurement
plans, procurement etc). This could be attributed the higher degree of accountability enacted
through the new PMU as well as a concurrent perception of a loss of independence on the part of
some personnel under the new management arrangement.

38.     Mid-term review. A Medium Term Review (MTR) of the overall SEED project was
carried out in 2009. The MTR found that overall progress towards achieving the development
objective had improved slightly from MU to MS after restructuring in 2007. Progress towards
achieving the PDO remained at MS throughout the period following restructuring, but was
downgraded to MU in the final year of implementation. Implementation performance was
assessed as having improved from MU to S at MTR. Key recommendations arising from the
MTR included: (a) the creation of legal framework for streamlining and decentralizing licensing
for businesses; (b) the implementation of costed, time-bound action plans to expedite tourism
licensing, in a cost-effective and efficient manner; (c) the provision of additional support to the
cadastre unit; (d) the suspension (later lifted) of all support to the two mining associations until


                                                 9
the completion of all outstanding work; (e) the provision of tailored training targeting small-scale
miners; (f) the recommendation to conduct a post-implementation diagnostic review of the
mining cadastre; and (g) a recommendation to defer the establishment of a gemological institute
and the reallocation of such resources in support of the cadastre unit (this activity was later
cancelled altogether). While all the MTR recommendations relating to the gemstone component,
i.e., (e) to (h) were addressed by project end, the recommendations relating to the tourism
component had not been realized.

39.    A joint Norwegian-World Bank MTR of the Protected Areas component took place in
May, 2007. This independent review was carried out by consultants 3 funded by the Government
of Norway was integrated into the MTR.

40.   Staff Turnover. The project experienced a high staff turnover through the seven years of
implementation as demonstrated below:
      (a) Project Manager –three persons.
      (b) Financial Management Specialist –two persons.
      (c) Monitoring and Evaluation Officer –four persons.
      (d) Project Accountant –four persons.
      (e) ZAWA’s regional manager - three persons.
      (f) KNP’s park wardens per AMU – each held by two different persons.

41.     High staff turnover was driven by a number of factors including remuneration, non-
performance, poor management oversight and the overall quality of staff. The lack of
performance-based contracts and the absence of institutionalized mechanisms for performance
evaluation contributed to an environment wherein staff could not be held to account for non
performance. In the case of the departure of the project manager and M&E officer, turnover
resulted in higher quality staff being recruited to those positions towards the end of the project.
In other instances high performing staff were lost to other projects.

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

42.     Design of project M&E. According to the PAD, the PCU did not initially include an M&E
officer but earmarked limited financial resources towards M&E. The PCU was responsible for
carrying out M&E and for preparing quarterly progress reports. The project preparation manuals
did not include a specific M&E manual although reference to M&E was included in the project
implementation manual (PIM). In 2004, ZAWA designed its own M&E system but the SEED
PCU did not. The lack of a coherent and integrated M&E system project as a whole persisted
until restructuring 2007, severely undermining the ability of government to generate the
information required to effectively monitor progress with regard to outcome and intermediate
indicators. A comprehensive M&E framework designed and owned by Government, with
support from the World Bank was identified as a priority, and it was hoped that the restructuring
process would result in a new M&E framework, but the M&E Officer failed to follow through.
In 2008, a year following the restructuring initiative, a SEED M&E plan and manual was
developed. In 2009 a new M&E Officer, with significant skills and expertise, was recruited, and

the manual revised and streamlined. M&E of the tourism and gemstone components was carried
out by the PMU M&E officer working closely with the technical coordinators for tourism and
gemstones. The KNP subcomponent of M&E was entirely overseen by ZAWA. Following the
implementation of the new M&E framework in 2009, more detailed data became available for
tourism and mining license indicators (including total number, time taken per license and
average time) as well as improved measurements for the efficiency of the issuing of mining
license as a consequence of improved monitoring of the cadastre system. The frequent turnover
of the M&E officers served to weaken this function.

43.     Implementation and utilization of M&E in Tourism and Gemstone Components.
M&E for the tourism and gemstone components was coordinated by the PMU through its M&E
officer. Data on the national regional tourism subcomponent was obtained from SEED quarterly
reports, and through the tourism development advisor. Data on the LCC infrastructure
subcomponent was compiled by the resident engineer. M&E of the gemstone component
presented a particular challenge due to difficulties in collecting data relating to mining license
application-processing times and unutilized mining licenses. Delays in procuring this data were
primarily related to the lack of a functioning Cadastre. The 2009 MTR recognized the need to
strengthen the collection of mining license indicators and the need to monitor the efficiency of
the now functional cadastre system and the efficiency of the Mining licensing committee.
Towards the end of the project a significant improvement in M&E was achieved.

44.     Implementation and utilization of M&E at park level and GMA. M&E for the protected
area (PA) tourism sub-component was to be carried out on the basis of information collected and
compiled by each park warden before consolidation by ZAWA’s HQ research planning and
information directorate. ZAWAs monitoring was then intended to feed into SEED’s project
performance monitoring system. The private sector, moreover, was expected to participate in
M&E activities. The natural resource monitoring system established by the project (aerial survey,
vegetation survey, park revenue, fire monitoring, law enforcement, patrol coverage, etc.) assisted
ZAWA in building a park specific monitoring system based on the principles of adaptive
management and complemented ZAWA’s emerging monitoring program at HQ. Thematic
monitoring maps are now displayed in the park management control rooms and are utilized to
inform park operations. The project assisted in developing monitoring systems for ZAWA’s
protected area natural resource and resource use monitoring such as fire monitoring, fish
harvesting, safari hunting, vegetation monitoring as well as law enforcement effectiveness. Not
all of these systems were effectively implemented during the project lifespan, specifically with
regard to fish and partly with regard to fire monitoring systems. Additional monitoring systems
such as the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) were applied on an annual basis
but the quality of the assessment would have benefitted from a more rigid and formalized review
process involving external and internal park staff. ZAWA’s annual progress reports provided
detailed and adequate information on performance regarding defined indicators and annual work
plan implementation.

45.    Restructured results framework. The ICR team noted that the GEO and the KNP
contribution to the PDO were consistent in their rating. There was a divergence between the
GEO and KNP rating with the rest of SEED. Revisions in the results framework of the PA
tourism component was aimed at improving M&E of the structure of the PA tourism component
as a whole by focusing on park management, infrastructure development, and business


                                               11
development. This was included in the framework by adding concise intermediate impact
indicators for park management, wildlife monitoring and research and infrastructure
development. The restructuring process did not revise the GEO and thus the mention of MNP
was kept in the GEO even though there was no reporting of MNP indicators after 2006.

46.    Using identical reporting requirements. The project benefitted from a joint supervision
and reporting agreement concluded by ZAWA, the Government of Norway and the Bank.
During the lifetime of the project, ZAWA used only one results framework, issued one annual
progress report to the primary partners, and all supervision missions including MTR were carried
out and documented jointly by the Government of Norway and the Bank (including the ICR
process).

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

47.     Environmental Safeguards: The project was classified as environmental category B and
triggered the following safeguard policies: OP 4.01, OP 4.04, OP. 4.09, OPN 11.03 and OP 4.12.
The project complied with these safeguard policies.

48.    Environmental Assessment: The project has complied with all requirements under
OP/BP 4.01 including those for the methodology and content of the EA, the EA rating and
timing, and the EA consultation process. During preparation, an Environmental Management
Plan was prepared for the two parks.

49.     Natural Habitats: The primary purpose of the OP 4.04 is to ensure that Bank-supported
project cause no harm to natural habitats, and prohibits support for projects that lead to the
significant loss or degradation of any critical natural habitats as defined in the policy. There were
no identified project interventions that could cause any harm to, or loss of, such habitats.

50.     Involuntary Resettlement: The project developed a Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) for involuntary resettlement of residents of the two parks and a Process Framework for
local determination of any restriction on access to natural resources. A Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) was prepared to guide resettlement of the inhabitants of a village called Imusho located
within the MNP. Guided by the RAP, resettlement took place prior effectiveness. It included
adequate compensation as determined by a Bank social specialist. An additional Bank safeguard
specialist reviewed the safeguard compliance in the Namwala GMA in March 2011. In this
GMA people were displaced from the GMA conservation zone after an instruction issued by the
land chiefs. The Bank concluded that there was no issue of non-compliance with Bank
safeguards. According to the policy on Involuntary Resettlement of the World Bank, “the policy
does not apply to restrictions of access to natural resources under community-based projects? as
long as “all that it provides for identification of appropriate measures to mitigate adverse
impacts?, which was the case with Namwala GMA. A RAP of Mukuni Park was also
successfully carried out.

51.   Pesticide Management Plan: The plan was made obsolete because the agribusiness
component was dropped as a result of the 2007 restructuring.




                                                 12
2.5          Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

52.     Tourism Component. Despite the closing of the SEED project, there still exists a
substantial agenda for reform in both the Zambian tourism and mining sectors. In tourism, a
range of constraints impede the competitiveness of the tourism industry, and require urgent
attention if Zambia is to successfully compete with Zimbabwe and other countries in the region.
A continued priority is the need to enact and operationalize an enabling and transparent legal and
regulatory environment 4 and the need to encourage both domestic and foreign investment in
tourism through a streamlined and decentralized licensing regime. During the final
implementation support mission in November 2012, the government requested an additional
extension to the project and for the Bank to provide additional funding in support of the tourism
sector. This request from Government should be seen in the context of the new Government’s
declaration of Livingstone as Zambia’s Tourist Capital and its new plans to move the provincial
headquarters of Southern Province to Chomo in order to increase the focus of tourism to
Livingstone. The recent, unexpected withdrawal of support on the part of the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) to the KNP has left a large financing gap that Government is
anxious to fill. While the Bank completely endorses the GoZ’s commitment to tourism as a
means of job and wealth creation, the Bank will respond the request in the context of an ongoing
dialogue with government on a broader agenda (including finance and private sector issues) so as
to better understand its priorities and how best to support those priorities. In terms of the broader
business licensing reform agenda, the World Bank Group, through the IFC, is initiating a new U$
2.3 million Zambia Investment Climate Program to improve the legal and regulatory
environment for doing business in Zambia.

53.     Protected Areas Component. The project initiated important investments to KNP that
have delivered a number of important achievements. However, some important issues relating to
financial sustainability and infrastructure development will need to be improved upon. To sustain
the improvements in the management of KNP and an environment conducive to further
achievements in improved management, ZAWA will need to engage its partners in securing
further support including the following:

54.    Supporting the sustainability of KNP. Critical to the sustainability and development of KNP is
further consolidation and improvement of the park’s the Business Centre initiative. The
maintenance of the project supported KNP infrastructure investments (airstrips, staff houses,
gates, offices, bridge) will depend in large part on the revenues generated within KNP and
recovered by the KNP Business Center. By time of the ICR, the KNP 2011 revenues of US$
1.3m covered less than 50 percent of operational costs.

55.     ZAWA needs to successfully broker further partners in support of the management of
KNP, and generate further private sector tourism investment. In support of these ends it is
essential to properly invest in the rehabilitation of park infrastructure. Improving and expanding
the stock of all weather roads to accommodate and encourage increased tourism within the park
are fundamental.


4
    A group representing the tourism industry met in 2009 to identify key constraints and generate consensus about the reform agenda.




                                                                        13
56.     Support an effective law-enforcement system. A strong and consistent law-enforcement
system is crucial to the protection of KNP resources, and to the management of KNP ecosystem.
KNP’s wildlife, its diversity and abundance is the main driver of the tourism industry in the area.
The park has managed to build its resource protection team, and this will need to be to be
sustained. However resource protection is a complex activity, linked to a range of external and
internal factors including, but not limited to, wildlife laws, government support, community
support, access control, patrol coverage, monitoring of effectiveness, leadership and discipline,
the relationship with police and magistrates. Records from 2009 show a decline in patrol man
days, while the 2011 aerial survey demonstrated evidence of an increase in encroachment and
poaching activity, as well as increases in the population and development of surrounding districts
and villages. These challenges will require further strengthening of the KNP Resource Protection
Unit, allowing it to adapt and be prepared for the twinned pressures of poaching and
encroachment.

57.      Gemstone Component. The review and operationalization of a Mining and Minerals Act
– and subsidiary legislation/institutional changes - that would streamline the licensing process is
critical to the further development of the gemstone sector. Concurrently the mining cadastre
regulations need to be revised to enable the Mining Cadastre Department to retain a percentage
of the non-tax revenue it collects to finance mining operations and introduce transparent data
collection for effective monitoring of the licensing process. The Mining Basket Fund is
supporting further steps to finalize the draft Bill for parliamentary submission and develop
regulations to help support it, including cadastre regulations.

58.    The GoZ has communicated that a sustainability strategy will be included in its
2012/2013 budget. This strategy includes a review and operationalization of the Tourism Policy
and Tourism and Hospitality Bill, operationalization of the Livingstone OSS and
operationalization of the Mining Cadastre, in support of the tourism and gemstone sectors. The
LCC will need to maintain and sustain investments in infrastructure (roads, street lights,
sidewalks and drainages) initiated under the auspices of the SEED, and it is important that the
LCC generate sufficient revenue to enable such investments.

59.     Cooperating Partners: Strong partnerships were initiated in support of the tourism
component. USAID is engaged in ongoing support to the Patents and Companies Registration
Agency (PACRA), a key agency in business registration and licensing reform, which will be
responsible for operating the Livingstone OSS. DFID Zambia worked closely with the World
Bank on the Jobs, Prosperity and Competiveness (JPC) program that funded a tourism study to
reinforce the SEED PDO, as well as funding for studies of the mining sector, and additional
activities that supported the preparation of draft legislation. The Bank worked closely with the
EU in developing the gemstone component, specifically with regard to supporting the
development of the Mining Cadastre and support to small-scale mining enterprises. The Bank
worked closely with the IFC, encouraging and supporting their engagement on the broader
business licensing reform program. The Protected Areas component was co-financed by the
Bank and the Government of Norway, and was until recently working with the US Millennium
Challenge Corporation on a US$ 160million proposal for a “Greater Kafue Economic
Development Project? (GKED) to support infrastructure development in the greater Kafue
National Park (gKNP). The project was dropped in November 2011 by MCC in favor of a single


                                                14
compact for the Lusaka Water Authority. The decision to discontinue the preparation of the
gKED project is largely attributed to a weak policy and institutional environment that
undermines investment and expansion in the tourism sector (delays with the revision or
endorsement of Zambia’s wildlife policy and wildlife act as well as the tourism policy and
tourism act); an unsatisfactory cost-benefit analysis of proposed large-scale investments in KNP;
and an unrealistic implementation period of five years for the achievement of intended results.
The UNDP/GEF reclassification project (REMNPAS) has been extended until September 2012
and is supporting ZAWA’s institutional reform, ongoing capacity building and reclassification of
Zambia protected areas.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

60.     Original PDO. The Project's original PDO was “to help reduce the vulnerability of the
Zambian economy to shocks by supporting the diversification of its sources of growth? The PDO
relevant to priorities of the country and the Bank priorities at the time of project preparation. At
the outset, the project encountered several challenges in achieving the original PDO, reflecting
the general difficulties and challenges relating to the implementation of structural reforms and
poor government ownership of the process, capacity weaknesses and low levels of political will
and accountability. It could also be argued perhaps, that the challenges encountered in achieving
the original PDO might have been due to the fact that “reducing vulnerabilities to shocks? is a
short term macroeconomic issue that a project such as seed cannot address. This remains a
significant challenge to the diversification of the economy in Zambia. The design and
implementation of the project was also relevant in meeting the specific objective that it was
designed to address, i.e., to help reduce the vulnerability of the Zambian economy to shocks by
supporting the diversification of its sources of growth. Based on above, overall relevance rating
of original PDO is Satisfactory.

61.      Revised PDO. The PDO was revised through the course of restructuring in 2007 to read
“To improve the business environment for (i) sustainable tourism in the greater Livingstone
area; and (ii) the gemstone sector?. The revised PDO intended to focus implementation
activities on improvements/factors that could be realized within the scope of control of the
project and that were deemed achievable within its lifespan. The revised PDO remained relevant
to Zambia’s overall development objectives. Following the revision of the PDO, the agribusiness
component was formally closed (it had been dropped earlier in 2005), and the tourism
component was significantly redesigned. Some activities relating to supporting the development
of the Mosi-o-Tunya National Park and aspects of interventions under the scope of the LCC were
dropped (support for solid waste management system, business plan development and financial
plan and capacity building). The changes introduced to the project during restructuring and their
subsequent implementation demonstrated the project’s capacity to correct and improve its
development course, as demonstrated through improvements in work plan implementation.

62.     The new GoZ has expressed its intention to continue support to the tourism sector by
declaring Livingstone Zambia’s tourist capital and is supporting investments in Livingstone
ahead of its hosting of the 2014 World Tourism Organization Conference. This is in line with
first part of the revised PDO of improving the business climate for sustainable tourism in the


                                                15
greater Livingstone area. Tourism development is, moreover, given a prominent role in the new
Government’s manifesto and the mineral sector is recognized as an important sector for further
economic development and diversification. The overall relevance rating of original PDO is
Satisfactory. The overall relevance rating of revised PDO is satisfactory.

63.      GEO. The SEED GEO to reverse biodiversity degradation in Kafue National Park and
the Mosi-o-Tunya National Park and surrounding areas was highly relevant in design and
implementation to the Government of Zambia’s economic, biodiversity and wildlife management
priorities, particularly in the gKNP. This was demonstrated by the integration of the project’s
objective and outcomes into the Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP, 2011-2015). The
SNDP reconfirms tourism as a priority sector for development with a focus on infrastructure
development in three geographic areas including the KNP. It further aims at restructuring
ZAWA, improving the policy and legal framework for wildlife management, enhancing private
sector participation in wildlife management and supporting protected wildlife area management.
The submission in 2011 of a proposal for a follow-up large investment operation to build and
expand on the PA program further demonstrates the project’s relevance. 5 The relevance rating is
thus Satisfactory.

3.2          Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
             Objectives

64.     Project Development Objectives. The Project did not fully achieve its PDO of
improving the business environment for (i) sustainable tourism in the greater Livingstone area;
and (ii) the gemstone sector (see section 3.4 for achievement of PDO (efficacy) ratings).

65.     Improving the business environment for (i) sustainable tourism in the greater Livingstone
area: Tourism Component–National/Regional. The main objective of the subcomponent was to
streamline and decentralize the process for acquiring business licenses provided by the MTENR
for tourism. Success was to be measured by a reduction the number of licenses issues, and a
reduction in the time it takes to obtain such licenses through the establishment of a OSS in
Livingstone and by the adoption of new statutory instruments and regulations to the Tourism
Act. In terms of achieving outcomes, the number of days to process a tourism license worsened
from a baseline value of 90 days in 2004 to 135 days at the end of the project in 2011. The
Intermediate Outcome Indicator of piloting and establishing a “One Stop Shop? in Livingstone
was not met as the building envisioned to house the operation was constructed but was yet
operational at project closing. The Tourism Act that was enacted during the project made the
licensing process more difficult and discretionary. Widespread criticism of the new Act was the
main impetus for a revised draft Act, supported under the auspices of the project. The draft Act
was submitted to the Ministry of Justice, but not enacted, prior to project closure. However, a
number of positive intermediate outcome indicators were achieved, including the reduction of
the number of annual operating licenses issued for tourism businesses by MTENR five in 2004
to one at project closing. The number of beds for operational tourism concessions in KNP
increased from 104 in 2004 to 350 beds at project closing. The total ZAWA non-consumptive


5
    Proposal submitted to MCC in 2011 but the final decision by MCC favored the Lusaka Water Authority proposal.




                                                                      16
tourism revenue in KNP also increased tenfold, from US$60,000 in 2004 to US$614,000 in
2011.

66.     An independent review of the Tourism and Hospitality Act (THA) initiated by MTENR
in 2008 concluded that the current Act did not provide for decentralized licensing which was a
prerequisite to the implementation of the pilot OSS. The ongoing Business Licensing Reform
Program reached similar conclusions. Based on these recommendations, the SEED project and
GoZ proceeded to engage an international consultant to facilitate and draft a tourism license Act.
Thereafter, the project learned that government had a parallel legislative process that produced a
different Bill, which was subsequently passed into law. The new law centralized the issuing of
licenses and undermined some of the goals of the PDO. Immediate demands from industry for
changes to the legislation, followed the passage of the Act, and this generated momentum for
improved legislation. Building upon and in support of this momentum, the project facilitated a
consultative process, led by industry with input by an international lawyer, which drew on
international best practice. This participatory process was unique at the time and the Government
deserves credit for participating in the process and for sharing the draft legislation openly (the
working draft was shared with industry via email). However, despite this positive energy for
reform, no new legislation has been enacted. While the draft act was submitted to the Ministry
of Justice for formal drafting, it was not submitted to Parliament due to the general elections of
2011. However, the new Government has committed itself to reviewing the THA.

67.     Lack of progress in enacting and implementing tourism legislation inhibited progress in
the establishment of the OSS in Livingstone. While government supported the building of the
OSS, the Bank and industry were of the view that the OSS should only physically take form once
a legal basis was established for the OSS to operate. Without the enabling legislation being in
place, there was a real risk that the OSS would not serve a useful function to industry. In 2010,
Government stated its commitment to improving the THA and initiated measures to do so,
leading to an agreement to start procurement of the OSS civil works. These delays resulted in the
OSS only being commissioned and opened in February, 2012, four months after project closing.
However, even if the OSS had been commissioned prior to project closure, enabling legislation
has not yet been enacted, hence the OSS would not be servicing the purpose as per the PDO. It
should be noted that the focus on licensing reform, initiated by the SEED project, led to a
broader reform initiatives. Specifically, during the life of the project, the Bank/IFC and the GoZ
have embarked on a broader business licensing reform program that will support the work of a
number of government agencies. As a consequence, once operational, the OSS will provide a
wide menu of services to business people from a range of economic sectors and will not be
limited to its original mandate to service the tourism industry specifically.

68.     Improving the business environment for (i) sustainable tourism in the greater Livingstone
area: Tourism Component- Livingstone City Council. The intermediate outcome indicator of
establishment of Mukuni Park Management Trust was achieved and the Trust opened an account
and has started collecting revenue although operating cost recovery is yet to be achieved. The
Intermediate Outcome Indicator (IOI) target of fifty tourism SMEs in greater Livingstone for
which services can be booked and paid for online was exceeded. There were fifty-nine SMEs for
which services could be booked and paid for online at the time of project closing.




                                               17
69.     Improving the business environment for (ii) the Gemstone Sector. Lack of progress in
this component is due the fact that achievement of the PDO was contingent on streamlined
licensing in the sector. This goal was however not achieved as the number of days for processing
of small scale and large scale mining licenses actually significantly increased from a base line of
30 and 60 days in 2004 respectively to 120 and 270 days respectively in 2011. This worsening of
this indicator is explained by the mineral licensing moratorium that was put in place in 2009 and
lasted until March 31, 2011. This moratorium affected the processing and issuance of licenses
and therefore the measurement of the relevant indicators.

70.     In response to high copper prices and the desire to capture windfall profits, a new Mines
and Minerals Act was hurriedly introduced in 2008 with little or no consultation. The new Act
granted all powers for the issuing of licenses to the Mining Advisory Committee with the
concurrent effects of increasing the powers of the committee to the detriment of the cadastre,
resulting in extensive delays in the issuing of licenses. This development had a negative and
serious impact on the achievement of the PDO in terms of the number of days taken to obtain a
mining license. Recognizing that the new Act was counterproductive to the goals of the sector,
both industry and Government initiated a process towards drafting a new Act. A new Act was
drafted and GoZ has stated their intention to enact this draft. However, in order to avoid the
mistakes associated with the rushed process that underpinned the current Act, the project
encouraged GoZ to consult more widely. The project funded a third party review using a
consultant and further consultations resulting in a significantly improved Act in December 2010,
that effectively captured the needs of key industry stakeholders. However, just as the case with
the THA, this revised Act was not submitted to Parliament due to the general elections of 2012.
The new Government has, as the case with the THA, also expressed interest to review the Act.

71.     An independent diagnostic review of the cadastre was carried out in 2009 (support by the
project). A key recommendations arising from the review was that administrative/political and
financial independence of the cadastre was critical to ensuring the cadastre’s efficient operation.
Within a month of coming into office, the new cabinet, approved the establishment of the
cadastre as a department within the Ministry of Mines. The GoZ has also committed about ZMK
550 Million to the operations of the cadastre in its 2012 Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure.
The number of mining rights disputes has been significantly reduced as a consequence of the use
of software within the cadastre that has minimized overlapping licensing.

72.     The project encountered some challenges in supporting artisanal mining. Vandalism
(theft of pumps at the solar powered pumps) and the failure to properly maintain donor
equipment occurred in Mapatizya (Kalomo Mining Association). Although operational, the solar
power equipment for the police post and clinic had not yet been handed over to the relevant
Government ministries undermining the sustainability of this intervention. Handover delays were
also experienced at the ESMAZ Mining Association in Lufwanyama. However, measures
undertaken to educate artisanal miners and their families about HIV/AIDS were deemed very
productive.

73.     Global Environment Objectives: Rating: Satisfactory. The project achieved its GEO
objective of reversing biodiversity erosion in Kafue National Park and Mosi-o-Tunya National
Park and surrounding areas. The Protected Areas component achieved to a very large extent its



                                                18
expected objectives. The key outcomes achieved by the component in KNP as measured by the
outcome and intermediate outcome indicators include:

             (a) Rehabilitation of KNP, the largest, oldest but most degraded biodiversity hotspot and
                 national park in Zambia. The successful implementation of an integrated approach to
                 park management based on six defined support themes has resulted in KNP becoming
                 a reasonably well managed national park (as demonstrated by METT score of 63) and
                 an increasingly attractive tourist destination;
             (b) Increase or stabilization in numbers and distribution of selected indicator mammal
                 species within the gKNP as demonstrated by the series of aerial surveys and
                 confirmed by increased wildlife sightings by tourism operators although some areas
                 continue to face encroachment and related poaching threats;
             (c) Support to nine GMAs surrounding KNP, improved management structures including
                 the development of 7 GMA management plans, and the setting aside of an average of
                 79 percent of GMA land for wildlife management has enhanced local livelihood
                 opportunities, effective natural resource conservation and good governance;
             (d) Improved capacity for economic development and wildlife conservation through
                 rehabilitation and enhancement of park infrastructure, improved patrol and tourism all
                 weather access including road infrastructure and bridges, the establishment of a
                 communication system, up-grading of 3 airstrips to all-weather standards, the
                 improvement of working conditions and housing for staff through construction of a
                 regional park management office in Mumbwa, park gates and other staff houses;
             (e) Improvement of the park monitoring systems focusing on fire, wildlife, habitat,
                 research and management projects including a reorganization of KNP patrol and
                 investigating system aiming at key management needs; and
             (f) Development of a ZAWA-led PPP framework for KNP including a park revenue
                 generating strategy through private sector partnerships and business development
                 based on the project supported business plan, the approval of KNP as Business
                 Centre 6 as well as removal of non-performing concessions. KNP’s non-consumptive
                 tourism revenues have increased from USD 60,000 (2004) to USD 614,000 (2011).

3.3          Efficiency

74.     Efficiency Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Efficiency ratings were derived by
comparing actual results with project inputs. As noted in the PAD, the project had an overall
Economic Rate of Return of 31.6 percent. With the removal of the agribusiness component in
2006, which had the weakest performance of all the components (see below), the ERR improved
(as measured at restructuring) to 33 percent and the breakeven increased from 5.7 years from the
original PAD to 5.9 years after restructuring. EOP ERR was calculated at 32.4 percent.

75.    Tourism Component: This component had the highest ERR at appraisal (34.1 percent)
and the second shortest breakeven time (5.5 years). In terms of project cost estimates at
appraisal, the costs of the IDA Tourism component was US$17.3 million. This was adjusted to
US$18.7 million at restructuring and US$20.1 million at project closing. There was an overall 10
percent overrun in costs in terms of actual verses cost at restructuring on this component, most

    KNP and SLAMU are the only two national parks in Zambia that operates this model.



                                                                     19
likely as a consequence of works done under construction of the OSS, infrastructure in LCC and
KNP (the LCC and KNP civil works experienced procurement, works supervision problems and
delays in implementation). For the GEF financing, the project cost was not adjusted during
restructuring remaining at US$ 4 million and the actual at closing was US$3.9 million.

76.     As required for a full-sized GEF project, an incremental cost analysis was undertaken
during project preparation. The economic analysis in the PAD was not sufficient to cover the
details of the PA tourism component, in particular with regard to tourism related infrastructure
investments. No formal economic or quantitative analysis was done for the PA tourism
component over project implementation.

77.     The ICR team noted relatively high operational unit costs for resource protection in the
KNP, particular during the period when a bonus/incentive system was implemented (in should be
noted that this bonus/incentive system was supported by Norway and not IDA/GEF).

78.     A positive outcome of the PA program was increased efficiency in KNP revenues per
tourist: Throughout the implementation period, the number of tourists in KNP increased from
about 4000 to about 7000. ZAWA’s non-consumptive revenues in gKNP increased during the
same period from about US$60,000 to approximately US$614,000. Thus, the project input
resulted in increasing revenues per tourist from about US$15 to US$85.

79.     Gemstones Component: US$5.01 million was budgeted for this component at appraisal
and this amount was reduced to US$4.08 million at restructuring. US$ 3.88 million was actually
spent. The transparency and governance subcomponent which supported the cadastre among
other activities had a 14 percent cost overrun, reflecting the substantial support given to the
cadastre. The M&E subcomponent also had a cost overrun, likely due to an underestimate of the
M&E costs for the gemstone component which experienced better monitored M&E indicators
towards the end of the project.

80.     Only US$ 105,000 was spent on the agribusiness component which was dropped in 2005
and the balance was reallocated to other components after the restructuring in 2007. The PMU
increased significantly from the US$ 1.3 million cost at appraisal to US$ 2.9 million estimate at
restructuring and the actual cost was even higher at US$ 3.4 million. The cost escalation was
attributable to the change in the function of the unit from a co-ordination to a management
function after the restructuring carried out for the purpose of increasing accountability for results,
improving project management and ensuring more efficient use of project resources.

81.    It should be noted that while there were overruns in the tourism and project management
components, there were under runs in the Gemstones component. Overall, overruns were 2
percent of total costs at closure.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

82.     In light of revised OPCS/OED guidelines for rating projects outcomes against revised
objectives, the project’s outcome will be assessed against both the original and revised project
objectives. To arrive at an overall outcome rating, separate outcome ratings (against original and
revised project objectives) will be weighted in proportion to the share of actual disbursements
made for the periods before and after approval of the revision.

Original PDO

83.     As noted in section 3.1, the project’s objectives and design were consistent and relevant
with the country’s then development priorities and Bank strategy. However, during the period
prior to restructuring (2004-2007), the efficacy and achievement of the PDO was consistently
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Initial disbursement was poor, at 35 percent, which resulted
in slowed implementation and sub-optimal efficiency specifically on the part of the LCC, but
also to a lesser extent on the part of the KNP civil works. In weighing relevance, efficacy and
efficiency, the original PDO is designated a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Revised PDO

84.    Following the restructuring of the project in 2007, the revised PDO was consistent and
relevant to Zambia’s overall development objects. Post-restructuring ISR’s indicate progress
towards achieving the PDO and improving efficacy: a rating of Moderately Satisfactory was


                                                    21
generally assigned to overall progress; however, this reverted to Moderately Unsatisfactory in
the final ISRs. Implementation performance, as reflected in the ISRs, improved from Moderately
Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory following restructuring. In weighing relevance,
efficacy and efficiency, a rating of Moderately Satisfactory is assigned.

Overall Outcome Rating

85.    The original outcome rating has been calculated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. As per the
guidelines, this corresponds to an assigned a value of 3 X the proportion of actual total
disbursement (35%) = 3 X .35= 1.05.

86.    The revised outcome rating has been calculated as Moderately Unsatisfactory, coinciding
with an assigned value of 3 X the proportion of actual disbursement (65%) = 3 X .65= 1.95.

87.    The weighted overall outcome is 1.05+ 2.6= 3.65. While this rounded off would be 4, i.e.,
Moderately Satisfactory, it was the view of the ICR team that a value of 3, i.e., Moderately
Unsatisfactory was a more accurate assessment of the overall outcome rating.

88.     A number of institutional objectives were not achieved, specifically the establishment of
a fully functioning and operational OSS and Mining Cadastre. The lack of implementation of
tourism and mining sector legislation also negatively affected the efficacy of the project in
achieving its PDO. New laws introduced greater discretion to licensing procedures, negatively
affecting the outcome rating. The ICR acknowledges that the overall outcome rating should not
only be based on the high level outcome indicators and should take into account the performance
with regard to intermediate level outcome indicators (a number of these performed and were
rated very well). However the positive performance by a number of the intermediate level
outcome indicators was not sufficient to affect the overall outcome rating.

GEO Rating: Satisfactory

89.     Given the near achievement of the GEO outcome indicator and the reaching of attainment
for the intermediate outcome indicators, the project’s relevance and efficiency, the PA tourism
component overall outcome rating is deemed Satisfactory in achieving conservation of globally
important biodiversity in the KNP. The GEO was not revised during the life of the project unlike
the PDO.

90.     Regarding MNP, the ICR evaluation is limited to the period of 2005 and 2006. The MNP
outcomes for this period are rated moderately satisfactory considering actual outputs, relevance
and efficiency. Noteworthy is the fact that monitoring and reporting on MNP stopped in 2007.
The revised results framework did not include any new or revised indicator on MNP while the
GEO was kept unchanged.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

91.     While the Project was an economic growth project and did not therefore have a direct
poverty impact, the tourism component of the project attempted to address the problem of high
unemployment in Livingstone (estimated at 90 percent at the start of the project). Based on the
fact that there was no major economic activity in the area apart from tourism, it was envisioned
that the project would provide jobs to Livingstone and surrounding areas through construction
and community based projects. Opportunities in tourism related activities such as catering, hotel
services, tour operation, wildlife management and production of handicrafts would address the
three poverty criteria of incomes, basic needs and capability to acquire physical needs. In terms
of gender, care was taken to address this among the different components, especially in
consideration to prostitution, which the PAD recognized, can thrive in an environment of
poverty. Support for creation of economic activities was a way to mitigate these challenges, and
as a consequence the PA and tourism component tried to ensure that gender aspects were
considered. Under the gemstones component, a number of female small scale miners were
beneficiaries. Work was also done with SHARE on HIV/AIDS education for artisanal miners
and their families. Solar power was also supplied to community clinics and police posts and
houses as well as the provision of water pumps for community use. Regarding the CBNRM focal
area, most of the participants in community projects are women, but few women are represented
on the Community Resources Boards (CRB). Of 177 Board members, less than 20 women are in
leadership at the level of the CRBs. However, in the VAG committee there was a significant
increase in the participation of number of women. It is suggested that in the revised wildlife
policy, the issue of women and other marginalized groups are given particular attention to ensure
their active participation in the governance of the GMA resources.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

92.    In looking at institutional change/strengthening; the major focus of this section is with
reference to impacts on longer term capacity and institutional development.

Tourism Component
1.1.Tourism National/Regional

Capacity of tourism related private sector organizations and industry to lobby and demand accountability
on policy and legislative formulation strengthened.

During the life of the project, capacity was built in tourism related private sector organizations to lobby and
demand accountability on policy and legislation formulation. The passing of counter-productive tourism
legislation generated a reaction from the industry that led to momentum and demand for improved policy
and legislation. This process encouraged a participatory and consultative process that was positive for
capacity building and increasing dialogue.


Capacity of government agencies such as MTENR and Ministry of Justice to coordinate consultative
processes for policy and legal reform strengthened.

Demand for improved policy and legislation from the private sector and other players helped build
improved capacity within MTENR and the Ministry of Justice to better coordinate and lead consultative


                                                          23
processes for policy and legal reform with the Industry and other government agencies.


1.2. Tourism- Livingstone

1.2.1 Improving Service Delivery of Private Sector Tourism Associations.

A number of tourism associations were supported through the provision of vehicles, equipment, and
computers to improve their service delivery. These include Tourism Council of Zambia, Livingstone
Tourism Association, Choma Museum and Cultural Centre and the Hotels and Tourism Institute (HTTI). A
number of tourism stakeholders forum’s will be lead by LTA to increase collaboration and networking
activities among tourism service providers and other stakeholders in Livingstone (direct support ended in
2009). The Zambia Tourism Awards were held but unfortunately were not sustained

1.2.1 Capacity Building of Livingstone City Council to Improve Service Delivery.

The project supported the purchase of motor vehicles, heavy equipment, a cherry picker (for street light
maintenance) and training of staff. These interventions were to assist LCC development a capacity for
maintenance of infrastructure and well as strengthen their human and technical capacity in areas such as
engineering and financial management.

1.2.2 Rehabilitation of Mukuni Park and establishment of a Management Trust

Mukuni Park was rehabilitated and handed over in 2008. A Trust to run the park was established and a
separate Bank account was opened and revenue from the park and rent from the Mukuni curio-sellers is
being collected.

1.3 Tourism- Protected Areas

1.3.1 Capacity of Kafue National Park/ZAWA to better Manage Park Administration and Management,
Wildlife Research and Monitoring, Resource Protection , Infrastructure Development and Maintenance,
PPPs and Business Development

This was done throughout the life of the project. The project did focus directly on supporting ZAWA’s
capacity at park and regional management level and to a lesser extent at HQ management.

1.4 Gemstone

1.4.1 Capacity of Mining related private sector organizations and industry to lobby and demand
accountability on policy and legislative formulation strengthened

Capacity was built in mining related private sector and industry organizations to lobby and demand
accountability on policy and legislation formulation. The passing of a counter-productive mining legislation
generated a reaction from the industry that led to momentum and demand for improved policy and
legislation. This process encouraged a participatory and consultative process that was positive for capacity
building and increasing dialogue.

1.4.2 Capacity of government agencies such as MTENR and Ministry of Justice to coordinate
consultative processes for policy and legal reform strengthened

Demand for improved policy and legislation from the private sector and other players helped build
improved capacity of Ministry of Mines and Minerals and the Ministry of Justice to better coordinate and
lead consultative processes for policy and legal reform with industry and other government agencies.

1.4.3 Strengthening the Capacity of Regional Bureaux



                                                        24
This activity was supported to build the capacity of the mining bureaus at Livingstone and Kitwe so that
they could provide gemological, mining and environmental extension services to small scale miners.
Cutting and polishing equipment was procured for the Ndola Lapidary Centre.

1.4.4 Strengthening of Mining Cadastre System

The project supported human and technical capacity of the cadastre through study tours and helped
strengthen the operations of the cadastre through financing a cadastre diagnostic review that recommended
that the cadastre be independent and self financing. This recommendation was implemented in November
2012 through Cabinet approval of an independent cadastre department within the mining ministry. Support
was also provided for the installation of flex-cadastre system software to efficient processing of licenses.

1.4.5. Private Sector Associations Strengthened

The project supported two private sector small scale mining association in Mapatizya (Kalomo Miners
Association) and Lufwanyama (Emerald and Semi-Precious Stones Mining Association of Zambia
(ESMAZ). At Mapatizya, the project supported the rehabilitation and electrification of the clinic and police
post, procurement of a solar fridge for the clinic for storage of medicines, procurement of value addition
equipment for the mining centre and drilling and equipping of boreholes. The support in Lufwanyama was
for procurement of materials for the rehabilitation of culverts and a bridge, drilling of boreholes,
construction of a clinic and house and provision of office furniture and equipment for the associations
office.

The project also engaged Zambia Health Education and Communications Trust (ZHECT) to provide
HIV/AIDS counseling, training and VCT services. This led to the formation of community groups to
sustain the support and counseling of affected and infected groups.


3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

93.     In order to build ownership during the 2007 restructuring of the project, a consultative
process was initiated and stakeholder workshops held. The restructuring process commenced
with an independent diagnosis of performance by a Zambian consultant who reported directly to
MTENR (March to May 2006). A stakeholder’s workshop was held in June 2006 to discuss the
findings and agree on the way forward. A GoZ refocusing team, with participants from industry
and Government, was created to propose changes to the project design and concurrent
implementation arrangements. The refocusing team reported to a Steering Committee that guided
this process.

94.      Beneficiary stakeholder workshops were organized as part of the ICR stakeholder
consultations for the SEED components in Livingstone and Lusaka November 2011.
Representatives from ZAWA, CRBs, and the SEED PMU joined the ICR mission in February
2012. An additional meeting with KNP tourism operators was also held during the mission
(detail in annex 6).

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

95.     Overall Development Outcome Rating: The risk is rated as Substantial. While the
new Government has stated that it is committed to the review of suboptimal tourism and mining
legislation, operationalization of the OSS and Cadastre Department and the fact that it has
committed financial resources to fund these activities in its 2012 Estimates of Revenue and


                                                         25
Expenditure, based on the lack of progress on review of relevant legislation and improving the
overall enabling environment for tourism and mining, the risk to development outcome is
substantial.

96.     GEO Rating: Moderate to Significant: The risk to the KNP contribution to the PDO
and to the GEO rating is based on the assessment of (1) ZAWA’s overall financial viability; (2)
the financial constraints at gKNP which could impact its capacity to operate and implement its
GMP; (3) the completion of the Business Center; and (4) GoZ’s commitment to revise its
wildlife policy and legal framework. In light of the fact that for the next ten years or more,
revenues accruing to the gKNP will remain lower than its operating costs, the ICR team also
considered (1) the lack of direct GoZ counterpart funding to the national PA-Network and the
gKNP (only in 2010 KNP received direct funding in the amount of ZMK 800 million) and (2)
the lack of a follow-up operation to consolidate the achievements in gKNP for the rating. While
such a situation is common in other national parks in Africa, requiring longer-term support from
the Government, private sector and cooperating partners, the PA component achieved substantial
progress in the gKNP to attract continuous follow-up support. If progress in one of the above
cannot be achieved over the short-term, the project’s global environmental outcomes are at risk.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

97.    As noted by the QSA and the STAP reviewer, the Bank preparation team and
management agreed to design a very challenging (and to some extent, for the Bank probably a
very innovative) project. The project design responded well to the country and sector context but
the complexity of its components, implementation arrangements, fiduciary and monitoring and
evaluation arrangements complicated and challenged project implementation. Moreover,
linkages between the tourism PA component and the broader SEED project were not well
defined.

98.    Risk identification was comprehensive. However risks associated with the complexity of
the project design and ZAWA’s and other national implementing agencies comparatively weak
implementation capacity were underappreciated. The risks were under-evaluated in particular
regarding Governments’ commitment and ownership of the project at a macro-level, and
ZAWA’s implementation and management capacity at the micro-level. In addition, the political
economy risk for the mining sector and the gemstone sector specifically, was not recognized and
factored (the ICR notes that there was not sufficient analytical work, e.g., use of political
economy tools, to better design the gemstone component and identify the inherent risks) .

99.    The complexity of the project design in terms of components and implementation
arrangements was not incorporated into the assessment of project risk. Most identified risks were
encountered during project implementation, including: a) restrictive administrative, policy, legal
and economic environment for investment in tourism, wildlife sector, b) limited participation of


                                               26
the business community in tourism development, c) insufficient government commitment to the
tourism and wildlife sectors and to ZAWA undermining its financial sustainability and
development of the sector, d) poor governance of the wildlife sector undermining its credibility
and subsequent support, and e) a lack of support on the part of local communities in case of
disbursement failure of GMA revenues. The overall risk rating in the PAD was M (modest risk)
but should have been S (substantial).

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

100. The Bank team leaders, both specialists in respective project sector areas (private sector
development and biodiversity conservation/protected area specialists) were both based in Zambia
and supervised the project throughout project implementation. The Bank’s task team included
fiduciary colleagues based in the country office, with the exception of the social safeguard
specialist who commuted to the country. The Bank team was strengthened by tourism,
infrastructure and mining specialists who joined the team during missions. To supplement and
strengthen supervision expertise, the Bank’s task team was extended by a DED tourism specialist
seconded to the Bank for 3 years.

101. The Bank task team, complemented by staff from the government of Norway, conducted
a total of 16 supervision missions during the implementation of the project. Fifteen
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) were filed, capturing implementation progress and its
impact on the achievement of project objectives. Project filing for the GEF component has been
excellent during implementation as assessed by time of the ICR while filing and record keeping
of the overall SEED project has been less satisfactory, with a number of key documents not
being available either in the Bank system or in hardcopy.

102. The Bank carried out a very close and pro-active dialogue with MTENR, LCC, MMNR,
ZAWA and all project stakeholders including cooperating partners (particularly with Norway)
but also with private sector (including LTA, ZTB and KPOA).

103. The ICR rates quality of supervision as Moderately Unsatisfactory. While quality of
supervision was rated Satisfactory by a Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) which was
carried out in September 2006, with the team being recognized for their candidness, performance
after 2007 led to the ICRs assessment of Moderately Unsatisfactory. The decline in the
supervision rating is not only a reflection of the team but also of the quality of Bank
management, which failed to better advise and direct the team on a number of issues that were
raised for management attention in the project ISRs.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

104. As per OPCS guidelines on ICRs, Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
because both quality at entry and quality of supervision have been rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.


                                              27
5.2    Borrower Performance

Overall Borrower Performance Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

105. Borrower performance varied considerably over the life of the project. During the first
supervision mission held in December 2004, it was noted that the project lacked the necessary
leadership required to effectively drive implementation. Specifically, key officials at the
respective ministries/agencies (e.g. Ministry of Tourism, Mines & Minerals, Local Government
and Housing and ZAWA) did not hold the project accountable for results. Likewise, information
regarding the projects’ planned deliverables, on the one hand, and resources to fuel delivery, on
the other, were not shared with key stakeholders, who were consequently unable to hold the
project accountable for delivering results. A number of recommendations were made following
the initial mission including; (i) the need for a planning workshop to develop component level
log frames, indicators, work and procurement plans; (ii) the finalization and communication of
staffing decisions (component technical coordinators were yet to be recruited and there were
issues around salaries below market reference point levels); (iii) the need to build capacity
through training; and (iv) set clear goals for/and evaluate efficacy of project launch. A second
mission took place in March 2005 and found that project performance had deteriorated (during
this mission both the PDO and IP ratings were downgraded from Satisfactory to Moderately
Unsatisfactory). Only one of the three components, gemstones, was ready for implementation
and very few of the agreed actions had been implemented. It was also noted that there was no
clearly defined role for the PCU in coordination/facilitation project beneficiaries, specifically
with regard to information sharing. The PCU was not being held accountable for delivering its
mandate. The Bank at this point expressed concern that implementing agencies were not being
held accountable for project performance and that SEED required additional oversight.

106. In reaction to the concerns of the Bank, GoZ took some immediate measures to try to turn
the performance of the project around. These measures included the appointment of the
Permanent Secretary for MTENR as chairperson of the SEED Steering Committee and the
holding of regular weekly meetings. More importantly, GOZ recognized and acknowledged that
in order for the issues impairing the satisfactory implementation of the project to be adequately
addressed, there was a need to “refocus? or restructure the project. It is important to put the pre-
restructuring performance of the borrower in the wider country context at the time of relatively
weak public sector performance, a Ministry of Finance which was overstretched and was not
able participate in Steering Committee meetings, the refocusing workshop and implementation
meeting and poor inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination.

107. Post restructuring, there was a noticeable improvement in project performance and the
PDO and IP ratings were both upgraded from MU to MS soon after restructuring. To the credit
of GoZ, senior leadership at both the MTENR and MMRE took on a more proactive role in, for
example, pushing for improved legislation. The restructuring of the PCU into a PMU also helped
initiate greater accountability through improved procurement and M&E frameworks (although
this improved M&E was more related to monitoring expenditures and activities than impact


                                                28
monitoring as has already been mentioned elsewhere in the ICR) . However, given the fact that
the PDO was rated as MU in 9 out of 15 ISRs and that the IP was rated as either MU or MS in 12
out of 15 ISRs, Government performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Overall Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

108. The Tourism National/Regional, Livingstone infrastructure, Protected Areas and
Gemstone components were implemented by Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural
Resources (MTENR), Livingstone City Council (LCC), Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) and
Ministry of Mines, Minerals and Energy (MME) respectively.

109. Tourism National/Regional: MTENR was in the prime position to drive project
performance forward, yet this did not happen until the last six months of the project. The
Tourism & Hospitality Act that was enacted during the project’s life was counterproductive and
made the PDO more difficult to achieve. Given the nature of the PDO, a strong champion at the
Ministerial level was critical to achieving the project objectives, yet such a champion was not
forthcoming until the last year of the project. Further, the One Stop Shop was not operationalized
before project closing. MTENR performance has been rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

110. Tourism–Livingstone: LCC is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. All of the civil works
under the sub-component were completed in 2009 and recent activities have since focused on
maintenance of infrastructure, some of which was handed over to the Roads Development
Agency (RDA). LCC’s performance is noteworthy because it represents a dramatic turnaround
from the start of the project. During the first few years of the project, LCC had capacity and
accountability challenges, which were successfully overcome. Mukuni Park is operating with
new, much improved facilities. The Mukuni Park Trust is functional and opened its own account
and is collecting revenue from the park and rent from curio sellers.

111. Tourism-Protected Areas: ZAWA through its regional manager office, the AMU
management and the ZAWA HQ project coordination unit, has implemented the PA
subcomponent. The PA infrastructure subcomponent constituted the cornerstone of the PA
subcomponent, greatly influencing the performance and development of the other PA
subcomponent activities. While by end of the project many infrastructure investments had been
successfully completed, many were only achieved after overcoming significant implementation
delays. The project failed to fully complete some PA related infrastructure investments by
project closure (e.g. regional office in Mumbwa, river crossings in the northern section of the
spinal road). Despite substantial delays with the infrastructure development component and the
PPP component, the consolidated performance of ZAWA at regional and park level and to a
limited extent at HQ level over the 7 years of implementation is judged Moderately Satisfactory.
ZAWA’s performance has improved over time and particularly since project management
responsibility was transferred from the HQ to the RM office of the Western Region.

112. Gemstones: The rating of the implementing agency, the Ministry of Mines and Minerals
is Moderately Unsatisfactory in large part due to a failure to address legal and regulatory issues
that continue to undermine streamlined and transparent licensing. The ICR however recognizes


                                               29
the progress on the upgrading of the operations of the Cadastre and the creation of an
independent Cadastre department.

113. The performance of the PMU improved dramatically in the last few years of the project,
hence the overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory. Procurement and M&E were rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

114. Borrower performance is rated by assessing two dimensions: government performance
and implementing agency performance. In this case government performance was rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory while implementing agency performance was rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. Thus the overall borrower performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6.       Lessons Learned
Design

115. How do you make cross-sectoral projects work? Given the Bank’s new focus on
implementing fewer but more multi-sectoral projects, SEED offers some very useful lessons.
Multi-sectoral projects benefits are not necessarily incremental and cost-effective: The SEED
multi-sectoral approach was designed to increase relevance, efficiency and efficacy. However, in
reality the multi-sectoral was rather counterproductive and not particularly beneficial when
assessing final outcomes, overall implementation performance, ownership, efficiency and costs
of activities. As the project straddled more than one institution, effective management of project
activities became difficult as PCU/PMU lacked authority over staff in the other institutions,
undermining project accountability and ownership. The complexity and diversity of the project
required a substantially increased supervision bank budget (see annex 4) due to the need to
recruit additional sectoral specialists (in mining and tourism in this case) and consultants. The
SEED experience points to the need for strong involvement and coordination by the principal
borrower, the Ministry of Finance, from the very beginning of the project, who should be able to
hold implementing agencies accountable for their results.

116. PA program: Support to a protected area without core institutional strengthening shows
limited results: The project’s strategic choice was to build capacity of ZAWA mainly at park and
regional management level and not to provide support for policy, legal or institutional reforms at
ZAWA HQ level. While this approach is justifiable, it, in a way, negatively impacted on some of
the intended outcomes and outputs related to ZAWA’s establishment of KNP as a Business
Center, ZAWA’s PPP and TCA’s capacity to support the JMC approach under KNP’s business
plan as well as implementing its Strategic Plan. This reduced overall sustainability.

117. Streamlined donor support enhances project results, efficacy and efficiency: The
approach taken by the two corporate partners (WB and Norway) to have a single line of
command, to streamline the requirements for reporting as well as supervision mission (MTR,
ICR) resulted in excellent coordination and cooperation between partners and ZAWA. This


                                                30
relationship was conducive to relieving ZAWA and associated Ministries from multiple
reporting requirements and differing procedures. Such an arrangement requires joint effort on the
part of the client and the cooperating partners to reduce transaction costs for the client. As
indicated during the ICR mission, from ZAWA’s perspective this was a single project with no
duplication of plans, reports, indicators, or support missions (including the ICR mission) and no
diverging messages.

118. A PDO dependent on the streamlining of licenses that required legislative reforms to
achieve outcome indicators without any proper risk mitigation measures was risky and reflecting
poor project design. Legislative reforms in most cases are outside the control of a project,
especially where they result in loss of discretionary power for the agency responsible under the
law. The project should have used the restructuring process to refine the PDO, change outcome
indicators and put into place more effective measures to mitigate risk.

Implementation

119. Use of demand driven accountability by citizens. As mentioned in the ICR, the civil
works in Livingstone were delayed due to differing views on the contractual process. Through
the project, citizens were encouraged to engage and voice their views on progress. Demand for
accountability eventually brought pressure to bear for faster completion of the civil works and by
2009, the civil works were completed. In future, thought should be given to include the use of
billboards, newspaper articles and community radio stating what infrastructure would be built by
what date and at what cost to bolster accountability to the public, and foster greater public
demand.

120. A Monitoring and Evaluation framework and Plan should be in place at an early stage
of project preparation. A proper M&E framework was implemented in 2009. A clear M&E
framework and indicators for both internal (procurement, financial, M&E) and external function
(indicators for the project components) should hold both the PCU and component implementers
to account. Such a system would have highlighted poor performance by procurement staff early
in the project implementation process leading to more timely and corrective action.

121. The consistent MU rating for the DO and IP in 6 out of the first 7 ISR’s should have
alerted the team on the problems around the project. Based on these rating the project should
have been closed earlier. The lack of a robust M&E structure could have been a factor in action
not being taken earlier.

122.    Assessing competitive advantages of external contractors versus in-house civil works: A
lesson of the PA program is that the low cost option should not necessarily be the basic selection
method for infrastructure investments. The project lost time and resources trying to mobilize
engineering firms and contractor of which most underperformed. As an alternative strategy and
unfortunately after much delay, ZAWA was authorized to carry our civil work with road
equipment purchased or rented. It became evident that ZAWA’s civil works capacity was better
than contractors and the experiences contributed to better planning and supervision of similar
tasks. The important lesson is that in terms of infrastructure development in remote areas (in this
case Kafue National Park) and in countries where there are no contractors are able to carry out
medium-sized contracts, it may be more preferable to use procurement methods that allow for


                                                31
the building of in-house capacity for small to medium infrastructure development and
maintenance.

7.

(b)    Cofinanciers

124.   Not applicable

(c)    Other partners and stakeholders

125. During the ICR Overall SEED mission in November 2011, Tourism stakeholders
(Associations, Operators, Mukuni Park, Livingstone City Council, Curio Sellers, Government
Departments) from the greater Livingstone areas were consulted through a stakeholder’s
workshop the held in Livingstone. The following is a summary of discussions and views of
stakeholders

Lessons learned from Project

       (a) Public –Private sector partnership in tourism development is critical;
       (b) A conducive and vibrant business and regulatory environment is essential for tourism
           development to thrive;
       (c) A strong planning, coordination and M&E mechanism is indispensable if tourism
           development is to create expected impact;
       (d) Though not supported by the SEED Project, marketing and investment promotion are
           very important and were an evident missing link and national level;
       (e) Government should understudy initiatives undertaken by cooperating partners to
           ensure that viable intervention are adopted in national plans, budgeted for and
           implemented in a continuous and sustainable way even after donor funded projects
           are over;
       (f) Some sensitive activities such as touching on legislation are better championed and
           orchestrated by GOZ (Sector Ministries) itself in consultation with all stakeholders.

What Worked

       (a) The Establishment and Construction of One Stop Shop;
       (b) Production of Livingstone Tourism Development Plan;
       (c) Tourism Development Advisor was recruited;
       (d) Capacity Building of various institutions such: ZTB, LTA, Choma Museum,
           Livingston Museum and ZAWA – These institutions were provided with computers,
           motor vehicles, office equipment & furniture and some administrative support;
       (e) Increased Market Access to Tourism SMEs – some SMEs that were market ready
           where included on world wide web;


                                              32
       (f) Administrative support provided to the South West Regional Tourism Development
           Office;
       (g) Reintroduction of Tourism Stakeholder Forums;
       (h) Improved public – private relationship.

What did not work

       (a)   No handover notes or reports left by Tourism Development Advisor;
       (b)   Human capacity building was not done;
       (c)   Livingstone Tourism Development Plan was not disseminated;
       (d)   World hotel link market ready study was not well debated among stakeholders;
       (e)   Regional Office was left out on important decisions.


Infrastructure development had the following impact

       (a)   Improved the outlook of the city;
       (b)   Improved business environment;
       (c)   Reduced crime;
       (d)   Reduced Vehicle operating cost travel discomfort;
       (e)   Provided facility for entertainment;
       (f)   Provided sanitation facility in town.

126. During the ICR PA mission in February, 2012, tourism sector representatives from Kafue
Park Operators Association (KPOA) involved in KNP expressed the following personal views:

Infrastructure development

127. The project recruited less qualified construction companies to rehabilitate and build
infrastructure resulting in unsatisfactory performance that impacted their tourism activities and
undermined ZAWA park revenues.

ZAWA and PPP

       (a) Lack of communication between ZAWA and the private sector led to complications.
           Consequently tourism operators were “surprised? by sudden fee revisions without prior
           consultation or information undermining business planning and prospecting, and resulting in
           increased costs to doing business in an already difficult location.
       (b) The proposal for JMC as put forward by ZAWA and the contracted consultant raised
           concerns particularly in view of breaking up the integrity of KNP as a vast wilderness area
           into a series of smaller privately managed areas.

Law enforcement

128. Poaching pressure in the KNP seems to have increased over the years with the possibility
of KNP scout involvement, while law enforcement capacity to cover the park did not increase
substantially and thus areas remain inaccessible to ZAWA.




                                                 33
Sustainability

129. While the stakeholders agreed with the Business Center approach, stakeholders raised
their concerns regarding the ultimate use of those revenues (outside gKNP) and indicate the need
for increased transparency in the budget planning, management and reporting process.

As noted in the PAD, the project had an overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 31.6%. With the
removal of the agribusiness component in 2006 which had the weakest performance of all the components
(see below), the ERR improved (as measured at restructuring) to 33% and the breakeven increased from
5.7 years from the original PAD to 5.9 years following restructuring.

ASSESSMENT OF THE PDO, DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION & OPERATIONAL
EXPERIENCE

The original PDO, design and implementation arrangements were seen to be inappropriate
leading, to the restructuring of the project. The main constraining factors were:

        (i) Over-Ambitious Project Development Objectives. The original project design
              was a response to the copper crisis and attempted, under the auspices of a single,
              flagship instrument, to support and pilot approaches to diversification of the
              economy in general and within the tourism, gemstone and agribusiness sectors in
              particular. The original PDO, as a consequence, addressed higher level outcomes
              that were beyond the scope and capacity of what the project could achieve.
        (ii) Complex Project Design. To meet the PDO, the project design included three
              technical components that supported a broad array of activities at the national level
              as well as in targeted regions, resulting in an overly complexdesign that spanned a
              number of institutions and actions.
        (iii) Weak Project Implementation.               Project complexity required effective
              management and accountability at project level and across Ministries. The original
              implementation arrangements provided a coordinating function as opposed to a
              management function, and there was no single focus of accountability for results.
              As a result of these issues, project development objective ratings remained
              “marginally unsatisfactory? even after re-focusing.

Project Design: Although the design was changed the project still had spanned two ministries
which led to complications. Whereas the PMU was under the ministry dealing with tourism, it
was also held accountable for activities that were in the ministry dealing with mining.

Project Implementation: Despite improved performance following the refocusing of the
project, the planning of meetings steering committee to accommodate the schedules of all
members, proved almost impossible. Moreover, effective management was further undermined
as a consequence of the project spanning two ministries. While the Project Component
Coordinators could accurately assess the status of the project, other officers in the ministry did
not fully appreciate what the SEED Project was doing.

FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

Staff Turnover: The project experienced a high staff turnover during the period of
implementation. Nearly all positions were held by more than one person during the life of the
project as illustrated below:

                   (a) Project Manager – held by three different persons
                   (b) Financial Management Specialist – held by two different persons
                   (c) Monitoring and Evaluation Officer – held by four different persons


                                                49
                   (d) Project Accountant – held by four different persons

The reasons for staff leaving the project were varied although poor morale and low pay were
cited as main reasons.

Stakeholder Participation: Despite the intention to conduct extensive consultations during the
preparation of the project, consultations were not as extensive as hoped. This led to the situation
where two Acts, the 2008 Mining Act and the Tourism & Hospitality Act, were passed by
Parliament, only to be rejected by stakeholders because they did not address their needs, with
stakeholders calling for substantive revision of the Acts prior to implementation.

Ownership, on the part of the community, of interventions in the mining area of Mapatizya was
poor as the community claimed they had not been sufficiently consulted. Although the Kalomo
Miners Association was consulted, they did not represent the whole mining community.

Lack of Counterpart Funds: The project did not stipulate the need for counterpart funding.
This affected implementation specifically in the later stages of implementation when the World
Bank stopped payment of sitting allowances. This led to a situation where evaluation of bids and
reports, the review of draft Acts and other tasks were delayed because officers from the
Government would not be available particularly at times when they could attend an evaluation
elsewhere and get paid sitting allowances from a Project which was supported with counterpart
funding.

Delay in Issuance of No Objections: Delay in responding to the requests for no objections
resulted to some of the activities running behind schedule. In some cases the Bank withheld ‘no
objection’ due to activities that may not even be tied to the activity for which a ‘no objection’ is
requested. However with the introduction of the procurement system delays were minimized.

SUSTAINABILITY

The sustainability of results and outcomes achieved under SEED Project is important to ensure
continued development after the project closure. The Government has put in place a
sustainability strategy for all the interventions previously managed by the SEED Project. In its
2012 Estimate of Revenues and Expenditure an activity based budget prepared by the Ministry of
Finance and National Planning, the Government has incorporated in it the SEED Project
components costs.

Bank and Borrower Performance

There was close cooperation between the SEED Project Management Unit staff with the World
Bank team, although the relationship with the Ministry was not as good.

Bank Performance

Delay in Issuance of No Objection

Bank – Inflexibility: The Bank’s ‘rigidity’ can be blamed for poor performance with regard to
some activities. This is typical where the borrower would not determine (terminate) a contract
due to poor performance for fear that the Bank would not allow the Borrower to re-allocate
resources and re-advertise the contract to continue the works. This resulted in the Borrower
persisting with poor contractors to the detriment of project performance.

Bank – Micro Management of Project: Whilst the input of the Task Team Leaders is
appreciated, at times their intervention amounted to micro managing the project. For example the
non-renewal of contracts for some project staff was as direct result of the influence of the TTL.

Bank – Turnover Task Team Leaders and Bank Staff: The Task Team Leader oversaw the
design of the SEED Project departed from the team three months into effectiveness of the
project. In addition, Bank staff supporting the TTL, such as the Tourism Specialists and Mining
Specialists, did not stay through the duration of the project’s life.

Borrower Performance

Borrower – Lack of Commitment: A consistent observation and criticism leveled at this
project is poor ownership and leadership of the project on the part of Government. Government
did not own the process and was not fully invested in the activities undertaken. At times
borrower requested activities would not move forward unless sitting allowances and/or out of
pocket allowances were provided. Poor management and capacity on the part of the borrower,
for certain sub/component activities under their jurisdiction, resulted compounded delays and
poor performance.

Borrower – Stakeholder Participation: As the project neared finality, the borrower initiated
extensive consultation with key stakeholders, specifically in the private sector, with regard to
proposed revisions to the Tourism & Hospitality Act and Mining Act. Following withdrawal of
the MCC from the tourism sector, the ZAWA similarly met with various stakeholders, including
cooperating partners, NGOs and representatives of civil society, to gather input with regard to
proposals to improve the service delivery and operational capacity of ZAWA.
