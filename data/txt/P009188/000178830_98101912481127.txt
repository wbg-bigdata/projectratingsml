I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
1.01      The development of Yugoslavia's transportation sector has been
primarily influenced by the country's topography and its history. The broad
valleys of t02 Danube and Sava Rivers provided a natural corridor for road,
rail and river transport running from the northwest to southeast. The
southern and coastal mountains, on the other hand, have proved formidable and
costly obstacles to the development of cross-country links in the transverse
direction. This natural phenomenon has also contributed to the problems of
the less-developed regions by depriving them of easy access routes to the
coast or to the hinterland. Further, the historical influences that helped to
widen the gap between the developed and the less developed regions also had
their impact on transport development. The northwestern part of the country
achieved high levels of development in some sectors, including transport, on
a par with Western Europe. On the other hand, in the poorer regions to the
south, transportation was not adequately developed.
1.02      Yugoslavia's location makes it an important crossroads of Europe.
The trunk routes and international connections are of special significance
because Yugoslavia has borders with seven countries. Several international
land connections, particularly in the northwest, have acquired considerable
significance for tourism.
1.03      Following the considerable reconstruction required to repair the
ravages of World War II, Yugoslavia has engaged in a major development program
in the transport sector oriented towards opening up the less developed regions
in order to strengthen their integration with the rest of the country, to
improve its communications with Western Europe and to encourage the develop-
ment of international tourism. The attainment of regional balance in economic
development has always been an explicit objective of Yugoslavia.
1.04      Yugoslavia's economy has grown rapidly since World War II with per
capita income rising in real terms to about 6% per annum during the last decade.
Increasing economic activity and personal incomes led to a fairly rapid growth
in transport demand. Between 1960 and 1980, total freight traffic grew at
about 6% per annum and total passenger traffic by about 10% per annum as indi-
cated below (Table 1.1).

B.   The Transport System and the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH)
1.05      Today, Yugoslavia's transportation system is extensive and diver-
sified, comprising about 110,000 km of roads, 10,000 km of rail lines, 7 main
ports and 15 airports (10 of which handle international flights) and a size-
able network of inland (the main one being the Danube) and coastal waterways.
Pipelines have come into increasing use in recent years.
1.06      Roads and railways are the backbone of the transport system.
Together these account for about 90-95% of the total goods and passenger
traffic. However, the growth of traffic by different modes has been uneven.
During the last decade the freight traffic (ton-km) on railways increased by
about 2% per annum compared to an increase of about 8% per annum on highways,
while passenger traffic on railways remained practically unchanged, in con-
trast with an increase of about 11% per annum on highways. As a result, road
transport has replaced rail transport as the dominant carrier. The railways,
however, continue to be the main carrier of bulk materials needed by key
industries and the carrier of about 35% of the total freight. River transport
has retained an important and competitive place, carrying about 9% of total
freight traffic. The ports have more than doubled their cargo handling since
the early 1960s and currently handle more than 23 million tons per annum.
1.07      In the entire transport network of Yugoslavia, the corridor shared
by the TYH and the railway, spanning Yugoslavia from its Austria border in
the northwest to Bulgaria and Greece in the southeast, is the backbone of the
Yugoslav economy and within its influence areas lies most of the country's
industrial and commercial activity. The present traffic volumes on most of
this corridor range between 12,000 to 15,000 vehicles per day on the highway
and 80 to 100 trains per day on the railways. Annually, about 20 million
passengers and 15 to 20 million tons of freight use the existing rail and
road facilities. The TYH is the shortest route linking Europe with the Near
and Middle East. As such, the route has an international as well as national
significance, which has grown since 1973 with the rapid increase in oil
revenues of many Middle Eastern countries, and the attendant increase in
their trade flows. Although the TYH corridor passes through only five of
Yugoslavia's eight Republics and Provinces, all benefit from its use and are
affected when its operation is impaired or interrupted.
C.   Transport Policy and Coordination
1.08      Since the mid-1960s the administration of Yugoslavia has been
increasingly characterized by decentralization of decision-making, with
enterprises operating under workers' management in a market-oriented economy.
The transfer of authority to the "grass roots" agencies and transport orga-
nizations has increased the number of decision-making bodies, and has made
country-wide transport planing and coordination (especially between road
and rail) more difficult. Until recently, there has not existed an overall,
clearly stated transport policy, although the basic rationale for such a
policy has been implicit in the country's main economic principles: free
choice by users and competition in a market economy among autonomous transport
enterprises. In late 1976, however, with a view to creating the necessary



- 3 -
conditions for integrated development of transport, the Federation, the
Republics and the Autonomous Provinces mutually agreed to establish a long-
term transport policy for the country along the above lines. Since then
considerable progress has been made in this direction, and the authorities
have concluded Social Agreements on the various aspects of futi're transport
policy.
1.09      The basic principle of the transport policy and coordination has
been free competition in the market and the main policy instruments pricing
measures. For this reason, and to promote transport coordination, there has
been an increasing need for studies on road user charges and on railway costs
to ascertain any overt and hidden subsidies or cross-subsidies which might
exist. Accordingly, the Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU) included as an
important component a study of Road User Charges as well as a corresponding
Rail Cost Study. These two complementary studies are designed to establish an
appropriate basis for developing a policy framework (including tariffs), which
would permit the orderly economic development of the transport sector. The
Road User Charges Study is almost complete and some of the basic aspects,
highlighted by the study, are discussed below.
1.10      The total revenue earned from road transport, after deducting
general tax rates and customs duty rates, (figured at 23%) nearly equals the
expenditure on interurban roads in Yugoslavia during 1975-78, as indicated
in Table 1.2. Thus it appears that overall road transport costs are being
covered on a pay-as-you-go basis.

1.11      The Government has increased the price of motor fuel (both gasoline
and diesel oil) appreciably during the last five years (Table 1.3), but the
relative difference in cost of gasoline and diesel fuel still persists, though
to a lesser extent. The study highlights that existing road user charge
levels for different types of motor vehicles vary within a wide range; for



-4-
instance, the charge levels for 5 ton, 13.5 ton and 32 ton trucks are respec-
tively, about 9, 20 and 26 times, that of a car (Zastava 750 ccm). Still the
taxation on certain types of vehicles, particularly heavy, diesel-fueled
vehicles which inflict the greatest damage on the pavement structure, appears
to be inadequate to cover the resource costs of operation.

1.12      This study is a pioneering effort for Yugoslavia and the final
report of the study is expected shortly. In accordance with Loan Agreement
1377-YU, the Federal Committee for Transport and Communications will review
the main recommendations of the study with the Bank and will agree with the
Bank on recommendations to be implemented.
1.13      The complementary study on rail costs has also progressed well
and the consultants final report and recommendations have been accepted
by the Railway Enterprises. The study has been carried out in a thorough
and practical manner and the proposed costing system is being designed to
take account of the complex arrangement of separate and independent
operational units in the form of Basic Organizations of Associated Labor
(BOAL), which together make up railway transport enterprises in Yugoslavia.
The analysis puts emphasis on cost control, the separation of terminal
and line-haul costs and also on the determination of costs by lines
and sections. Such information in respect of different commodities
should be invaluable in the formulation of tariff policies. At present,
rail freight is subsidized by the Government. There is no special
justification for this subsidy/compensation (about US$300 million
per annum) and it should be reduced and ultimately eliminated following
proper pricing policies supported by other measures. The implementation
of the costing system will be started by the Railway Enterprises during
1980.
D.   Institution Building and Co-financing
1.14      In supporting transport infrastructure development, the Bank has
emphasized the need for improving coordination between subsectors at regional



- 5 -
and national levels as well as the need for developing adequate institutions
and appropriate policy framework. At the national level, the Bank has encour-
aged and supported the establishment and strengthening of important advisory
and coordinating institutions. Notable among these are the Federal Committee
for Transpou and Communications which oversees the total transport picture
in Yugoslavia, the Council of Republican and Provincial Roads Organizations
(CRO) which deals with nationwide standardization of engineering and design
criteria in the highway subsector, and the Community of Yugoslav Railways
(CYR) which deals with overall issues of the railways. f
1.15      In the past, one of the Bank's main objectives in Yugoslavia's
transport sector have been the development of local skills needed to operate
the modal institutions. Under the Third Highway Loan (Loan 608-YU) and Fourth
Highway Loan (Loan 678-YU), the laws and decrees related to the highway sub-
sector were reviewed, and the organizations for road maintenance and their
operations were overhauled and improved. Traffic counting, which earlier
had been rudimentary, was reorganized on a systematic and planned basis.
Subsequent highway and railway projects provided technical assistance in the
formulation of standardized guidelines for the preparation of feasibility
studies, action plans, highway master plans and other important studies
like road user charges and rail costs. The proposed project includes for the
first time a highway safety program as a project objective to focus on the
prevention and reduction of highway accidents on the TYH, and the concerned
Republican/Provincial authorities are receptive to this new Program and
the proposed loan provides funds for safety-related equipment, technical
assistance, physical improvements and training (Annex 1). The thrust of
future transport sector lending will be to consolidate progress in
institutional development and to foster intermodal coordination.
1.16      In the transport sector, the Bank has also acted as a catalyst in
aiding Yugoslavia in obtaining co-financing from other sources. The Bank was
instrumental in developing the concept of TYH as an integrated project (about
US$3 billion total estimated cost) and aided Yugoslavia in obtaining recogni-
tion, support and financial assistance from other agencies, both multilateral
and bilateral, and from private international financial institutions. The
Yugoslav authorities, based on the Bank's involvement in the preparation and
appraisal of the first TYH Project (Ninth Highway Loan 1535-YU, April 1978),
have already made significant progress towards identifying financing for the
high priority TYH sections. The Government enlisted the support of the
European Investment Bank (about US$30 million), the Bank of Kuwait (US$16
million), the Bank Financiere, Paris (US$20 million), and other investment
agencies (about US$24 million) to assist in the reconstruction of several
critical sections (Map IBRD 14675R) of TYR during the late seventies. The
Yugoslav authorities have further confirmed that they expect the proposed
second tranche of TYH assistance from the Bank will significantly improve the
receptivity of the international capital market, which is expected to provide
additional co-financing of more than US$90 million for the proposed project.
E.   Previous Projects
1.17      The proposed project would be the eighteenth in the transport sector
and the eleventh in highways. The Bank has lent US$1,004 million equivalent



- 6 -
to the transport sector, including US$504 million for ten highway projects,
US$348 million for five railway projects, US$108 million for two pipeline
projects and US$44 million for the Port of Bar Project. In addition,
earthquake rehabilitation assistance of US$85 million has been agreed to
restore the damaged roads, railways and port in SR Montenegro in FY80.
Out of the ten highway projects, six have been successfully completed and
the remaining projects are well in hand. Government's execution of the
highway projects has been generally satisfactory. Brief details of all
transport projects are contained in Annex 2.
1.18      In general, the main problem encountered in the highway projects
has related to land acquisition where unforeseen difficulties have delayed
construction. Authority has now been so decentralized that groups such as
the COIs can appeal and overturn decisions made at higher levels on alignment
and right-of-way. There appears no easy solution to this problem (Audit
Report No. 1632, dated June 1977), but greater consultation between all groups
concerned is being sought to achieve more soundly-based decisions. Further,
some Republics/Provinces are operating road sections financed by the Bank as
toll roads. The imposition of tolls on a relatively uncongested road can
inhibit its use to a suboptimal level. In Yugoslavia, therefore, the Bank has
consistently emphasized the need to study the probable effects of imposing
tolls, so that they may be set (if at all) at a level which would not impede
the optimum use of the roads (Audit Report No. 1385, dated December 1976).
The loan agreements for subsequent road projects have included a clause to
this effect where relevant. Other problems include the overseas training
program, where difficulties were encountered because of language problems
(insufficient candidates proficient in English). The desirability ot a more
carefully developed training program with adequate attention to local con-
straints has been stressed (Audit Report No. 2465, dated April 1979). Sub-
sequently, the training program was modified by inviting foreign consultants
and specialists to give EDI-type training courses in both English and Serbo-
Croatian in Yugoslavia in October 1978. This program was well received and is
likely to be repeated soon under the auspices of the CRO.
II. THE ROAD SUBSECTOR
A.   Traffic
2.01      Road transport in Yugoslavia has developed rapidly during the last
twenty years, with an estimated increase in the number of cars from 54 thou-
sand in 1960 to about 2.5 million in 1980 and an expected increase in the
number of buses and trucks five to sixfold in this period (Table 2.1).
Freight and passenger traffic (in ton-km and passenger-km) on the network
likewise increased about 15 to 20 times during the same period. Most of the
vehicle fleet increase was met from domestic production. Where a decade ago
local manufacture of cars and trucks was about equal to imports, now annual
domestic production is about three to four times higher than total annual
imports. Although private car ownership rose steadily as per capita incomes
grew, motorization in the different regions of the country varies widely, but



in line with their states of development. For example, Slovenia, the most
developed Republic has six inhabitants per car, whilst Kosovo, the least
developed, has about 100 inhabitants per car.

B.   Trucking Industry
2.02      The trucking industry is highly competitive.  At present, there
are about 300 specialized transport enterprises each with an average of 150
trucks and buses. These enterprises account for more than half of freight
traffic by road. Commercial and industrial enterprises operate their own
fleets of trucks in many cases, accounting for about 45% of total road freight
transport. The average haul of "own-account" freight traffic is about 25 km.
C.   Vehicle Regulations
2.03      Basic regulations controlling traffic in Yugoslavia are contained
in the 1970 Traffic Law. They are primarily safety-oriented and focus mainly
on speed and load limitations. The maximum permitted loading is 10 tons on a
single axle and 12 tons on tandem axles for vehicles using all inter-regional
and regional roads. If conditions of particular roads and bridges are sub-
standard, a special Republican/Provincial Commission can impose different
loading limits as appropriate. Similarly, on public roads except major
highways, maximum speeds are limited according to the different categories
of motor vehicles (80 km/hr for buses; 70 km/hr for trucks exceeding 7.5 tons,
80 km/hr for motor cars towing a caravan, etc.). On the motorways which are
reserved only for motor vehicles, speed is generally limited to 100 to 120
km/hr. There are also restrictions on the movement of trucks over selected
routes during weekends and holidays, especially during the main tourist season.
Recently, as part of measures taken to curb fuel consumption, restrictions
have been imposed banning cars with certain license numbers from the roads
on certain days. The speed limits mentioned above are obligatory for all
drivers--Yugoslavs and foreign alike. Other restrictions which are a part of
the measures for conservation of fuel, do not apply to foreign tourists.

D.   Administration
2.04      The main responsibility for highway administration is now centered
in the Republics and Provinces (para. 1.08), with the Federal Government
responsible for common policy and regulatory matters such as the control of
vehicle weights and dimensions, road safety, and the international aspects of
highway administration and road transport.
2.05      At the Republican and Provincial levels, authority for administering
regional and inter-regional roads outside the boundaries of communes (urban
and municipal areas) is vested in the Republican or Provincial Road Organiza-
tions. These organizations are governed by "Boards" on which are represented
members of various groups each with an interest in roads such as transport
companies, industrial enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, professional and
road user organizations. The membership of these Boards is usually large, so
the members elect Executive Boards which are responsible not only for day-to-
day administration, but also for the preparation of proposals for highway
development. Purely local roads are under the jurisdiction of local communi-
ties which have special departments for this purpose. In cities, the planning
authorities are viewing with growing concern the problems resulting from
increasing vehicle use, and are seeking ways and means to rationalize the use
of all transport facilities especially through the development of public mass
transport. In an effort to relieve urban areas of through traffic, recent
Bank-financed highway projects have included the construction of bypasses of
towns and cities.
2.06      Coordination among the Road Organizations (ROs) is provided through
the Republican Assemblies, the Federal Committee for Transport and Communica-
tions, and the CRO.
2.07      The organization of highway administration has changed repeatedly
during the postwar years. As an example, at present the physical planning
and administration of the road plans of Macedonia are handled by the Republican
Road Council, which replaced the Republican Road Fund about four years ago.
This Council is expected to evolve further to include road user groups and to
become an "Association for the Communities of Interest for Roads." The COIs,
it is understood, would further promote increased citizen and user organization
participation in the decision-making process.
E.   Planning
2.08      Five-Year Highway Plans are prepared by the ROs, coordinated with
the plans for other sectors by the Republican or Provincial Assemblies.
Inter-Republican roads are planned on the basis of agreements among the
respective Republics and Provinces.
2.09      Although no problems have arisen in these respects, during loan
negotiations assurances were obtained from the Borrowers that they will
continue to collect and record such technical, economic, and financial data
as shall be reasonable for the proper planning of the highway network and
continue to ensure that the dimensions and axle loads of vehicles using the
roads shall not exceed the design limits of the roads.

F.   Investment and Financing
2.10      Highway expenditures have increased steadily over the last decade
from about Din. 1.0 billion (US$80 million) in 1965, to about Din. 16 billion
(US$888 million) in 1978. However, inflation has eroded a substantial portion
of the increa ed outlay and in real terms the highway expenditures have not
kept pace with the rapid growth of highway traffic. Overall highway expendi-
tures for new construction and upgrading in 1978 amounted to about 73% of
total highway expenditures, with the remaining 27% earmarked for highway main-
tenance and administration.
2.11      The Federal Government's role in highway financing has been phasing
out since 1970. At present, the Federal Government's remaining contribution
to highway financing is only about 2% of the total expenditure. The main
source of highway financing is the revenue from taxes on gasoline and diesel
oil, license fees, and the revenues from taxes paid by foreign motorists on
entering Yugoslavia. A proportion (about 34%) of these revenues (para. 1.10)
is earmarked for road development and maintenance purposes. In the year 1977
(the latest year for which detailed data are available), earmarked revenues
covered only about 36% of the total expenditures, and the balance of the out-
lay on highway development and maintenance was made up from IBRD and domestic
loans (33%), contributions by the Republics, Provinces, Communes (18%), the
Fund for Less Developed Regions (6%), contributions by the Federal Government
(2%), and other sources (5%) (Table 2.2).

G.   Engineering
2.12      Preinvestment studies of highway projects are generally commissioned
by the ROs from either local or foreign consulting firms and are, from the
Bank's experience, satisfactorily executed. The subsequent design of the
projects and the supervision of their construction is usually carried out,
also satisfactorily, by the ROs who may enlist support of competent Yugoslav
consulting engineers and technical institutes.
H.   Construction
2.13      Road construction and improvement is normally executed by means of
unit-price contracts. As a rule, participation in bidding for locally financed
projects is limited to the domestic contracting industry, which is capable and
highly competitive, and sufficiently aggressive to continue winning contract
awards outside Yugoslavia. Contracts for Bank-financed projects, however,
are awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank "Guidelines for Procurement"; such bidding for past highway projects has
resulted in the participation as a joint-venture partner of one foreign
contractor only, an indication of the competitive edge the local industry
has on its own ground. Quality of construction work is generally of a high
standard.
I.   Maintenance
2.14      Road maintenance is carried out on the basis of yearly contracts
negotiated between the Road Maintenance Enterprises and the ROs. The Mainte-
nance Enterprises are deployed widely in each Republic or Province, enabling,
in general, prompt and effective maintenance to be carried out. Expenditures
for highway maintenance in 1978 amounted to about Din. 68,480 (US$3,650) per
km for the highway network maintained by the Republics and Provinces, an ade-
quate allocation. The generally satisfactory standard of road maintenance in
Yugoslavia indicates the capabilities of the ROs and Maintenance Enterprises,
and that adequate budgetary allocations for road maintenance have been made
during the last few years.
J.   Training
2.15      Yugoslavia is a country with well-developed educational and voca-
tional training institutions. The highway transport sector is staffed with
competent professionals and technicians. There is, however, need to spread
technical and professional skills to the less-developed areas of the country
and, a need to update the knowledge and skills of engineers and managers in
highly specialized fields andito provide economists with training in trans-
portation and in the preparation of feasibility studies.  Once trained,
Yugoslav personnel put their skills to effective use, and adapt their system
to appropriate technologies and analysis methods.
2.16      The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 751-YU) was the first to incorporate
a training element and this provision has also been included in later projects.
In the Fifth Highway Project, training was of two kind: (i) short-term (up



- 11 -
to four months) fellowships and seminars abroad for engineers and economists;
and (ii) on-the-job counterpart training through consultants in the prepara-
tion of feasibility studies. In the Sixth Highway Project, training included:
(i) further fellowships abroad; and (ii) seminars and courses in Yugoslavia
including an innovative EDI-type course with simultaneous translation ser-
vices in the Serbo-Croatian and the English languages.
2.17      The impact of training has been considerable on the highway orga-
nizations of Yugoslavia in developing their capabilities in preparing feasi-
bility studies, traffic analyses, transport costing, and highway development
programs in general. With the benefit of this learning they have recently
prepared detailed master plans for highway development.
2.18      Following the initial assistance from the Bank's EDI, the CRO hopes
to continue with EDI-type courses on its own on a regular basis.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Background
3.01      The proposed project is in response to Government's appeal to the
Bank in early 1976 for assistance in preparing a national program for the
development of the country's 1,100 km spinal trunk route, the TYH. The
Government's main purpose in soliciting Bank assistance was to expedite the
development of an integrated master plan, which could also provide a coherent
basis for seeking external financing from other multilateral, bilateral and
private international sources. At the Bank's suggestion, therefore, the CRO
commissioned a prefeasibility study of the entire route in order to determine
such a comprehensive program and an action plan for its implementation. This
study confirmed the urgent attention required for the reconstruction of the
present pavement of a large number of sections of the TYH to modern standards.
It further ranked the various sections by priority based on economic analysis.
3.02      The Bank, in its Ninth Highway Loan (Loan 1535-YU) to Yugoslavia in
April 1978, assisted in the development of four high priority sections of this
vital route. In addition, the Government of Yugoslavia enlisted the support
of other international agencies to assist in the reconstruction of four more
critical sections of TYH during the late seventies.
3.03      Although there are other pressing needs for investment in the high-
way sector, the importance of TYH to Yugoslavia is so great that this proposed
project deliberately focusses solely on the needs of this primary road as the
second tranche of Bank assistance, with adequate cofinancing from other inter-
national agencies assured by the Government. With the completion of the
section proposed for this project, about 470 km of the TYH will be constructed
in accordance with the Agreement on basic principles of the Social Plan of
Yugoslavia for the development of main roads during 1976-80.



- 12 -
B.   Objectives
3.04      This project is aimed at increasing the traffic capacity and improv-
ing the driving safety of Yugoslavia's main highway artery, a route of vital
importance to ehe economic life of each and every constituent Republic and
Province. Furthermore, this second tranche of the proposed Bank loan for TYH
is also designed to improve the receptivity of the capital markets towards
cofinancing. Last but not least, the proposed project will enable the Bank to
continue the constructive dialogue with the authorities on transport policy,
coordination, and institutional matters.
C.   Description
3.05      The project comprises:
(a) the construction of the following sections of TYH, totalling
about 164 km (Map IBRD 14675R) identified by the TYH, Prefea=
sibility Study where additional traffic capacity is most urgently
needed:
(i)  in the Republic of Slovenia, a new four-lane controlled
access highway on a new alignment from Naklo to Ljubljana
(28.8 km);
(ii) in the Republic of Croatia, two additional traffic lanes
and the reconstruction of the existing two lanes to provide
a four-lane controlled access highway from Lipovljani to
Okucani (35.9 km);
(iii) in the Province of Vojvodina, two additional traffic lanes
and the reconstruction of the existing two lanes to provide
a four-lane controlled access highway from Ruma to Popinci
(17.3 km); and
(iv) in the Republic of Serbia, two additional traffic lanes
and the reconstruction of the existing two lanes to
provide a four-lane controlled access highway from: (1)
the Vojvodina Border to Surcin (9.6 km); and (2) Deligrad
to Nis (37.1 km); and (3) Batocina-Cuprija (35.1 km);
(b) the procurement of equipment for road maintenance and load monitor-
ing, and technical assistance; and
(c) a highway safety program comprised of elements of training, tech-
nical assistance and procurement of equipment.
Road Construction
3.06      A detailed description of the project road sections follows.



- 13 -
3.07      Slovenia:- Naklo to Ljubljana (28.8 km).  The Naklo to Ljubljana
section of the TYH (Map IBRD 14675R) will be a four-lane controlled access
facility constructed on a new alignment since the existing two-lane section
of TYH, which serves the major traffic generating area of Kranj, is highly
congested and has poor operating characteristics as a result of ribbon devel-
opment along 75% of its length. This section will include 6 interchanges.
The existing highway will continue to serve local traffic while long distance
TYH traffic will divert to the new four-lane facility which by-passes the city
of Kranj. Both horizontal and vertical alignment reflect the environmental
standards now being applied in Slovenia and aimed at minimizing noise and air
pollution and the preservation of green areas.
3.08      Croatia:  Lipovljani to Okucani (35.9 km).  The Lipovljani to
Okucani section (Map IBRD 14675R) extends the TYH southwest from Zagreb to the
first major intersection with the major arterial network serving the Republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This link, by addition of two new traffic lanes to the
existing two-lane road, is designed as a four-lane controlled access facility
and includes two interchanges. Reconstruction of the pavement throughout most
of the existing two-lane road is necessary in order to effectively serve pro-
jected traffic and meet design standards for the four-lane facility.
3.09      Vojvodina:  Ruma to Popinci (17.3 km).  Construction of the Ruma
to Popinci section (Map IBRD 14675R) together with the construction of the
section Popinci-Vojvodina border, which is in the Vojvodina Master Plan being
financed by the Tenth Highway Project, will extend the TYH northeast from
Belgrade to a major intersection with the arterial network serving Vojvodina.
This link, by addition of two new traffic lanes to the existing two-lane road
is designed as a four-lane controlled access facility and includes two inter-
changes. Some reconstruction of the existing pavement is necessary to meet
design standards for the four-lane facility.
3.10      Serbia:  Vojvodina Border to Surcin (9.6 km).  Construction of the
link from the Vojvodina border to Surcin (Map IBRD 14675R) completes the TYH
improvement for the section from Ruma to Belgrade. This link, by addition
of two new traffic lanes to the existing two-lane road, is designed as a
four-lane controlled access facility and includes one interchange. Some
reconstruction of the existing pavement is necessary to meet design standards
for the four-lane facility.
3.11.     Serbia:  Batocine-Cuprija (35.1 km).  Construction of the link from
Batocina-Cuprija (Map IBRD 14675 R) will complete the TYH from Belgrade to Cuprija.
The Batocina-Cuprija link, by addition of the two new traffic lanes to the
existing two-lane road is designed as a four-lane controlled access facility
and includes two interchanges. Some reconstruction of the existing pavement
is necessary to meet design standards for the four-lane facility.
3.12      Serbia:  Deligrad to Nis (37.1 km).  Construction of the link from
Deligrad to Nis (Map IBRD 14675R) will join two sections constructed under
the Ninth Highway Project (Pojate to Deligrad and the Nis Bypass). The last
section of the TYH, Cuprija to Pojate, necessary to provide a four-lane
facility from Belgrade to the major interchange at Nis, where TYH traffic



- 14 -
splits, will be constructed by Serbia with their own resources. The Deligrad
to Nis link, by addition of two new traffic lanes to the existing two-lane
road is designed as a four-lane controlled access facility and includes one
interchange. Some reconstruction of the existing pavement is necessary to
meet design standards for the four-lane facility.
Equipment Procurement
3.13      The proposed loan would provide for the purchase of both portable
and permanent vehicle weighing scales to monitor and control axle loadings on
vehicles using the TYH and the arterial network serving the TYH. Additional
specialized equipment to facilitate road maintenance on the TYH would also be
included in this loan. The items shown in Table 3.1 were discussed during
negotiations and the borrowers have agreed to submit equipment quantities and
unit prices by May 1, 1980 for Bank approval.
Table 3.1:  ROAD MAINTENANCE AND TRAFFIC EQUIPMENT
Item
1.   Weigh Scales:      permanent
portable
2.   Automatic traffic volume counters (with spares)
with:
a. classification count capabilities
b. dynamic weigh scale capabilities
3.   "Cherry-picker" vehicle for bridge inspections
and safety light maintenance
4.   Profiler for monitoring road surface finish
5.   Asphalt coring and cutting equipment
6.   Equipment for noise measurement
7.   Salt and grit spreaders and loaders
8.   Sundry laboratory equipment
9.   Snow removal equipment
10.   Pavement thickness measuring device
3.14      Funds to the extent of US$100,000 are also being provided for
related technical assistance. This is expected to include programs related
to the operation and maintenance of the specialized equipment detailed in
Table 3.1, and also to provide funds for about 10 to 12 man-months of con-
sulting services for a toll study. This was discussed during negotiations
and the Borrowers have agreed to submit by May 1, 1980 updated terms of
reference for the toll study for Bank approval.
Highway Safety Program
3.15      The number of highway accidents in Yugoslavia, particularly on the
existing two-lane highway serving the TYH corridor, are high. For example,
in 1975, on a 94.5 km section of TYH between Batocina and Nis, there were 248
accidents, 25 of which had fatalities. The improvement of TYH to a four-lane
divided highway with controlled access will have some positive effect on



- 15 -
reducing the accident rate, but may increase the severity of each accident due
to higher travel speeds and a general unfamiliarity by the motoring public,
the police and the engineers with the operation of a freeway with interchanges.
To assist the authorities in the transition from two-lane highway to freeway
operation and the reduction of accidents, the Project includes a highway
safety program. The highway safety program would provide for the following:
(i) procurement of safety equipment necessary to ensure safe operation of the
facility and also equipment necessary to carry out accident studies, analysis
and monitoring, (ii) technical assistance in the areas of accident data col-
lection, analysis, and in design standards, and (iii) training curriculums
to cover the three "E's" of traffic safety: traffic engineering, driver
education, and enforcement. The size and scope of the program (Annex 1) was
discussed during negotiations and the Borrowers have agreed to submit, by May
1980, equipment, training and technical assistance requirements .for Bank
approval. About 40 to 50 man-months of consulting services could be involved.
D.   Engineering
3.16      Engineering, which is in accordance with the design standards of
Table 3.2, has been carried out by competent Yugoslav engineering consulting
firms (design institutes) and by institutes for geology, soil mechanics and
civil engineering. The data used in the preparation of the project and the
source material are listed in Annex 3.

3.18      Construction cost estimates are based on quantities from substan-
tially completed final designs, and on unit rates.
3.19      A 10% physical contingency has been included to allow for unforeseen
increases in quantities of work in road construction. Price escalation
has been calculated using annual rates for foreign costs presented in the
Bank's revised guidelines on expected price increases (January 7,1980). The
local cost escalation rate is based on EMENA historical and projected rates of
inflation (January 1, 1979).

Year                    Foreign Costs               Local Costs
1979                          12%                       12%

1982                         8.0%                       12%
3.20      The total foreign exchange component is estimated at US$232.7
million, based on the assumption, that as in earlier projects, local con-
tractors will win the awards for construction after international competitive
bidding. The foreign exchange component has declined from about 40% to the
present 29% of total cost over the past 10-15 years, indicating the country's
increasing self-sufficiency in this sector.
F.   Financing
3.21      The proposed Bank loan of US$125 million would support approximately
55% of the foreign exchange cost needed for the second tranche of the TYH,
with the remaining 45% to be cofinanced from other sources, with the exception
of the link Batocina-Cuprija in Serbia for which the Bank will finance 45% of
the foreign exchange costs and 55% will be cofinanced from other sources.
The Republics of Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia and the Province of Vojvodina
have agreed to cofinancing and are arranging financing assistance from both
multilateral and bilateral agencies as well as private international financing
institutions through a consortium of Yugoslavian banks headed by the Beogradska
Banka. It is expected that once the required funds are obtained for the
required cofinancing of the proposed project the individual Republics and
Province will secure loans from appropriate member Banks of the consortium for
the funds required for their particular road sections. The foreign exchange
component is approximately 29% of total costs.  Local costs of US$552.5
million will be borne by the Republics of Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia, and
the Province of Vojvodina. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan
would be that each participating Republic and Province has adopted regulations
authorizing the Borrowers to construct their respective road sections.
3.22      The loan would be made to the ROs of Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and
Vojvodina, guaranteed by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A
condition of effectiveness would be that the Government of each participating
Republic and Province will have provided a guarantee to cover the financing
including cofinancing arrangement of its respective section of the Project
Roads, as shown in Table 3.5, including possible cost overruns.

3.23      All borrowers have indicated that they are designing their sections
of TYH as a toll road. During loan negotiations, the Borrowers agreed as they
have done for earlier projects, that if tolls are imposed, they should be
applied flexibly and set at such rates as shall ensure an economic use of the
highway and alternative routes or means of transportation. The Borrowers have
also agreed to provide studies showing that sufficient ramp traffic is avail-
able at interchanges to warrant operation of a toll-booth facility (see
Section 3.06 of Loan Agreement).
3.24      The ROs of the four Borrowers concerned with civil works have all
participated satisfactorily in earlier Bank highway projects. Each entity
executes efficiently the annual program of work approved by its Assembly.

G.   Implementation
Responsibility for Implementation and Supervision
3.25      The KOs of the three participating Republics and one Province
would be responsible for executing their respective construction works. As
in earlier projects, the concerned Republican and Provincial Governments'
acceptance of these arrangements is expected without difficulty. Also,
as in earlier projects where such arrangements proved satisfactory, supervi-
sion of the construction work would be exercised by the Yugoslav consulting
engineers and technical institutes which designed the project roads. The
CR0 would act as fiscal agent for the project and as liaison on project-related
matters between the Borrowers and the Bank, and would coordinate requests
for reimbursement/disbursement on the Bank. The CR0 would also be responsible
for the procurement of road maintenance and load monitoring equipment, techni-
cal assistance and the highway safety program including equipment procurement
provided for under the loan. A condition of loan effectiveness would be
that the Borrowers will have delegated authority to CR0 to enable it to
discharge these obligations.
Procurement
3.26      Construction contracts based on unit prices and contracts for the
purchase of equipment would be awarded after international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement." Construction
contracts would be of such size as to encourage maximum participation of the
local industry, allowing firms to bid for one or more sections up to their
prequalified capacity. Contractors would be prequalified for the works.
Prequalification procedures will be initiated in January 1980; bids are
expected to be called for in April, with contracts awarded to the lowest
evaluated bidders in July 1980. Construction contracts will include satis-
factory price escalation clauses. Consultants services are contemplated to
provide technical assistance and training for the Highway Safety Program
(Annex 1) and for a toll study (para. 3.14). This was discussed during
negotiations and the Borrowers have agreed to submit their requirements for
consultants services by May 1, 1980 for Bank approval (para. 3.15). Between
50 to 60 man-months of consultants services may be required at rates of
US$8,000 to $10,000 per man-month.
Land Acquisition for Right-of-Way
3.27      The Borrowers are at present acquiring the land needed to build
the project road sections. Although no major problems are foreseen, assurances
were obtained during loan negotiations that the right-of-way will be avail-
able as needed for the timely implementation of the project, so as to avoid
problems encountered on previous projects (para. 1.18).
Project Implementation Schedule
3.28      The construction of the sections Vojvodina Border-Surcin, Batocina-
Cuprija and Deligrad-Nis should be completed by the end of 1981, and the



- 21 -
sections Naklo-Ljubljana, Lipovljani-Okucani, and Ruma-Popinci in mid-1982.
The procurement of road maintenance and load monitoring equipment and instal-
lation of the scales should be completed by mid-1982. The Project Implemen-
tation Schedule, Table 3.6, and appropriate progress reporting procedures
were discussed and confirmed with the Borrowers during loan negotiations.
The Borrowers will be required to prepare project completion reports within
six months of the Loan Closing Date for each of their project sections.

H.   Disbursements
3.29      Disbursements under the proposed loan will cover 16% of total
costs for road construction (civil works) for links Naklo-Ljubljana, Lipovljani-
Okucani, Ruma-Popinci, Vojvodina Border-Surcin and Deligrad-Nis; 14% of the
total costs *for road construction (civil works) for link Batocina-Cuprija; and
100% of foreign costs for road equipment, technical assistance and the highway
safety program. All withdrawal applications will be fully documented. (See
para. 3.30, Table 3.7 for estimated schedule of disbursement.)
3.30      Assuming the loan becomes effective in June 1980, the following
schedule of disbursements (Table 3.7) has been estimated. This schedule was
discussed and confirmed with the Borrowers during loan negotiations.

I.   Environmental Impact
3.31      There is little habitation along the alignment of the existing road
sections to which two additional lanes will be added and the design of the new
alignment in Slovenia considered environmental impacts. Studies were made in
Slovenia to provide landscaping along the new alignment for slope protection,
noise and dust abatement, decrease in air pollution, and to minimize the
effect of construction on the aesthetics of the area. Noise barriers will
be constructed in areas where housing is adversely impacted. There will be
little disturbance, therefore, to property owners from environmental impacts.
3.32      To the extent that traffic congestion along the project road sec-
tions will be obviated, reduction in noise and air pollution will result. In
Slovenia, the diversion of long distance traffic from the existing two-lane
highway to the new four-lane highway will reduce noise and air pollution for
properties in the areas of ribbon development.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
4.01      The proposed project aims at relieving the mounting congestion on
the most heavily trafficked TYH sections and at reducing the heavy accident
toll on life and property on this key highway. This arterial route is
connected at several points with other international highways and national
primary and secondary routes. The influenc-e area of this facility, therefore,
extends beyond its immediate corridor and affects travel in much of the
country. Economic activities in the TYH corridor generate about 35% of the
Yugoslavs' GDP and the corridor directly influences about 70% of the area of
the entire country. In the perspective of inter-country travel, TYH also acts
as a vital link needed to meet the growing demands of transport between Europe
and the Middle East. Presently, about 100,000 trucks and truck trailers
operate annually on TYH and carry more than a million tons of international
traffic.
B.   Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.02      The principal direct beneficiaries of improved road travel would be
road users which come from a wide range of sectors and income groups due to
the diversity of the traffic using the highways. Because of its interregional
character, the roads will benefit long distance as well as local traffic.
Several industrial centers which are directly served by TYH and which produce
the bulk of the country's output of construction materials, fuels, chemical
products, wood and wood materials will receive benefits in the form of reduced
transport costs. The favorable impact of the project will also be felt by the
farming communities along the proposed highway sections. The beneficiaries
will also include foreigners such as international truckers and tourists and,
as a result, the foreign exchange earning potential of the country will be
strengthened. Because the transport enterprises are highly competitive and
generally well-managed, it is expected that the benefits of the project,
initially accruing to truckers and other intermediaries, would be passed on
gradually to producers and consumers.
4.03      The proposed project would also generate additional benefits in
that it would assist the Government in fostering the implementation of safety
related measures on this trunk route. For the first time, a highway safety
program, which provides funds for safety-related equipment, technical assis-
tance, physical improvements and training, is included as a project objective
to focus on the prevention and reduction of highway accidents on the TYH.
C.   Economic Evaluation
4.04      The conditions and characteristics of the existing project road
sections are described in paras 4.12 through 4.17. The traffic projections
are based on past traffic trends, recent origin and destination studies,
planned increases in production, and growth in per capita income in the zones
of influence. The forecasts take into account normal traffic growth and,
wherever appropriate, the additional traffic generated by the proposed project
works.



- 25 -
4.05      The projected growth in traffic volumes on the various project
sections range from about 4-12% per annum. In general, the projections assume
that traffic growth on the project roads will gradually decline from about 12%
per annum at present to about 4-6% per annum during 1990-2000. These growth
rates are conservative when compared with the trends for the same roads as
well as other links of TYH during the decade 1965-75, which fluctuated around
15% per annum, when the road transport industry experienced rapid development.
The earlier high growth rates reflect the initial spurt in the development of
road transport following a more liberal transport policy in the sixties.
Until then, Government had emphasized railways as the principal transport
mode; thereafter, however, Government policy favored the development of all
modes of transport, initiating a climate in which road transport development
was given a great thrust. It is believed that road transport has largely
closed the gap in transport during the past 15 years and that its growth is
now stablized at an appropriate level to meet the growing transport demands of
the economy with due regard to the planned capacity increases in other modes.
4.06      The quantitative economic analysis of the project road sections
takes into account the savings in vehicle operating costs, passenger travel
times and road maintenance costs. To take social overhead and indirect costs
into account, time savings were valued at 1.1 times the average hourly wage
rate of travellers in the influence area for journeys made for business
purposes. Since the value of time savings for non-business trips are difficult
to establish firmly, they were estimated at one-fourth of average wage rates.
Benefits due to increased comfort, convenience and safety have not been
considered.
4.07      As regards savings in vehicle operating costs accruing to foreign
automoDile and truck operators, two calculations have been made. One includes
the benefits accruing to these groups and, as a result, the expected rates of
returns can be regarded as an upper bound. In the other calculation, these
benefits have been excluded and the resultant rate of return estimates may be
considered as lower bounds (para. 4.11). The extent to which Yugoslavia
recovers part of these benefits is determined by the present system of border
taxes or entry fees on foreign vehicles. The Government policy is not to
recover all the benefits since Yugoslav vehicles travelling in neighboring
countries gain benefits from road improvements in those countries.
4.08      The expected savings in vehicle operating costs per vehicle/km in
the opening year of the project roads vary between 11-21% for the passenger
cars, 21-25% for buses, and 12-28% for trucks and truck-trailers. Savings in
transport costs, excluding passenger time savings, account for 40-50% of the
total benefits for the road sections in Vojvodina, Croatia and Serbia and
about 25-30% in Slovenia. A considerable part of the existing two-lane high-
way between Kranj and Ljubljana in Slovenia passes through highly congested
and ribbon development areas which greatly impede the traffic flow and hence
passenger time savings become more pronounced for this road section.
4.09      In selecting the proposed investments, several alternative solutions
were evaluated such as improving or reconstructing the existing road, con-
structing a new one, construction of the ultimate four lanes by stages, etc.
For each project section, the most economic solution has been adopted.

4.10      The TYH corridor is shared by different modes of transport; only
two, road and rail, are, however, of major importance. The transport capacity
of both roads and railways on some parts of this corridor is near the satura-
tion point. A large measure of expansion will be called for in the coming
years both in railways and road transport and both systems of ransport will
have vital'and complementary roles. In determining the economic viability of
the proposed road works, the rational allocation of future freight and pas-
senger movements between road and rail facilities has been taken into account
with due regard to their service characteristics and total distribution costs.
D.   Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
4.11      Based on the most probable estimates of construction costs, vehicle
operating costs, travel time costs, base-year traffic and traffic growth, the
proposed investments on the project road sections produce economic returns
(ERs) ranging from 22-36%, including the benefits accruing to foreign vehicles.
In the extreme case where all benefits accruing to foreign vehicles are
excluded, the ERs range between 20-31%. The economic cost included all land
acquisition, construction, maintenance, engineering and operating costs and
was adjusted for taxes and duties. If adjustments are also made using shadow
prices of labor, foreign exchange, intermediate and investment goods, the
E.R.'s would not significantly differ from those given above, because prices
adjusted for taxes and duties are not significantly different from shadow
prices, and furthermore, the adjustments affect both cost and benefit streams
in the same direction. All sections yield first-year benefit ratios ranging
from 10-22% on the proposed investment. The weighted average ER of all the
civil works components, which account for about 99% of total project cost is
24% or 22% depending on whether the benefits due to foreign vehicles are
included or excluded. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the
effects of variation in construction costs and users' benefits on the above
estimates. Even under the unfavorable assumptions of a 15% higher construction
costs combined with a 15% reduction in users' benefits the ER remained within
the range of 16-23% (excluding all benefits accruing to foreign vehicles) with
an overall economic return of 17% which is still a highly acceptable level.
Naklo-Kranj-Ljubljana (Celovska) Section (SR Slovenia)
4.12      The proposed construction of a four-lane road along a new alignment
would relieve the existing highway of all through traffic and make it avail-
able for local traffic, pedestrian and slow moving vehicles. The new facility
would also provide a better and faster access to the city of Ljubljana. The
existing link between Kranj and Ljubljana is already carrying a near capacity
traffic load (ADT 15,000 vehicles) and runs through numerous ribbon development
areas. It would be uneconomical to substantially improve the existing road.
4.13      The proposed section would be contiguous to a previous Bank-financed
(Loan No. 1535-YU) highway section, the Ljubljana bypass (Celovska-Dolgi Most)
which is under construction. More than 8,000 vehicles would have used this
new link of TYH daily in 1979, if it had been built. With the planned recon-
struction of TYH and the completion of the Ljubljana bypass and the Karavanke
tunnel, it is estimated that the daily traffic on this section will be more



27 -
than 13,000 vehicles by 1985. A four-lane divided highway, following a new
alignment, clearly will be required in the near future. The question was
considered whether two new carriageways should be built at once or in two
stages. A comparison of these two alternatives indicated that construction of
both carriageways at once would be more economical than stage ccnstruction.
The resulting savings from reduced road users' cost along would yield an ER of
about 21% (excluding benefits accruing to foreign vehicles), amply justifying
the proposed investment.
Lipovljani-Okucani Section (SR Croatia)
4.14      In 1978, the average daily traffic volume was about 16,000 vehicles;
about 28% of this traffic consisted of trucks, heavy truck trailers and buses.
Under existing road conditions, the high proportion of heavy commercial vehi-
cles acts as a great impediment to the smooth flow of traffic, lowers the
operating speed and increases the traffic hazard. Although traffic growth
is expected to decline from 9-4% during the next two decades upgrading of
the existing two-lane road to divided four-lane standard would increase the
capacity of the road and would bring about considerable savings in vehicle
operating and travel time costs. Furthermore, the fact that work has already
progressed considerably on construction of satisfactory transit facilities
of Zagreb for through traffic and that a 78 km road section from Ivanja Reka
to Lipovljani towards the east is already under construction, will ensure
that the benefits expected from the project work should be fully realized.
The savings in combined vehicle operating costs and time costs are conserva-
tively estimated to yield an ER of about 20% (excluding benefits accruing to
foreign vehicles).
Popinci-Ruma Section (SAP Vojvodina)
4.15      This highway section is part of the main artery between Novi Sad,
the capital and the most important city of Vojvodina, and Surcin the nearest
airport. It, therefore, serves a large volume of passenger traffic. The
proposed improved facility would also be a significant inducement to the
development of agriculture and industry in the immediate vicinity of the
highway by substantially lowering transport, including congestion, costs. On
the average, about 12,500 vehicles per day were operating on this section in
1978. About 35% of this traffic consisted of heavy commercial vehicles.
Traffic growth is expected to decline from 12%-5% per annum over the next 20
year period compared to an annual growth rate of about 12-15% during the last
decade. However, the existing facility is badly congested and inadequate to
handle the traffic volumes, present and future. The proposed project which
is designed to add two lanes to the existing facility and to improve the
alignments where needed is expected to yield a satisfactory ER of about 23%
(excluding benefits accruing to foreign vehicles).
Surcin-Vojvodina Border (SR Serbia)
4.16      The addition of another two-lane carriageway on this short section
would eliminate one of the most severe bottlenecks on TYH. This section is
part of the Belgrade-Zagreb road and is also part of the link between Novi



- 28 -
Sad and the Surcin airport. The adjacent sections of this road, both towards
east and west, have already been widened or are being widened to four-lane
standard to cope with the mounting traffic congestion. During the past few
years, the level of traffic service on this section has deteriorated consider-
ably. In 1978, the average daily traffic reached about 15,250 vehicles. Heavy
congestion occurred throughout the year and particularly during the tourist
season. Much of the benefits provided by the widening of the adjacent sections
were lost due to the worsening bottleneck over this stretch. As a result, the
construction of the additional two lanes on this section will yield an ER of
31%, and a first year benefit of 22% even when excluding all benefits accruing
to foreign vehicles.                                                                          -
Batocina-Cuprija Section (SR Serbia)
4.17      The proposed improvement would tend to complete one of the most impor-
tant parts of the TYH section between Belgrade, the national capital and Nis,
a growing commercial and industrial center in Serbia. Traffic volume in 1978
was about 11,900 vehicles per day. Over the past few years, traffic conditions
on the existing highway have become steadily worse. There is heavy congestion
during the tourist season and traffic is further expected to grow, reaching on
the average 18,500 vehicles per day in 1985 and 35,000 in 2000. The project
provides for an additional two-lane carriageway and improvements of alignments
and gradients where needed. The resulting savings from road user's cost would
yield an acceptable E.R. of about 20%.
Deligrad-Nis Section (SR Serbia)
4.18      In 1978 the average daily traffic (ADT) was about 12,000, of which
more than 30% again were heavy commercial vehicles. This high percentage of
heavy vehicles, constrained to travel on many unfavorable gradients on this
section, slows the flow of all traffic and resulted in relatively high operat-
ing and travel time costs. Despite this situation, traffic on the existing
road has increased during the past five years at an average annual rate
exceeding 12%. With the planned development of Nis, an important commercial
and industrial center in Serbia and the expected growth of TYR traffic, it
is estimated that ADT on the proposed section would reach abbut 18,800 in
1985 and 24,500 in 1990 and 30% of this traffic would continue to consist of
trucks, heavy truck-trailers and buses. The proposed improvement would
increase the capacity of the road and would substantially reduce vehicle
operating costs and travel time costs. The resulting savings will yield
an ER of about 23%.
E.   Other Project Elements
4.19      Benefits could not be quantified for the equipment components
including the benefits from those items which were primarily safety oriented.
However, the procurement of maintenance equipment is essential to protect the
infrastructure in a cost effective manner. The weighing equipment is needed
to monitor the loadings of vehicles using the primary highway network. This
would help the authorities to ensure that the design and construction standards
of this highway network are not dangerously exceeded. The specialized items



- 29
of road maintenance equipment and the safety oriented equipment will assist
the authorities concerned in meeting their maintenance objectives and prevent
or reduce the number of road accidents and thereby reduce the losses to the
economy from the heavy accident toll on life and property.
F.   Project Risks
4.20      The proposed project would be the eleventh in the highway sub-sector
to be executed in Yugoslavia. Since previous projects have been completed
satisfactorily or are being built without undue problems, no special risks are
expected in the execution and implementation of the proposed project.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      The following items were discussed and confirmed during negotia-
tions:
(i) collection of data for planning and the control of axle
loads and vehicle dimensions (para. 2.09).
(ii)  the itemized list of road maintenance equipment and weigh
scales, to be procured (para. 3.13);
(iii) the technical assistance requirements (para. 3.14);
(iv)  the size and scope of the highway safety program (para.
3.15 and Annex 1);
(v) the project cost estimates (para. 3.17);
(vi)  the Implementation Schedule (para. 3.28); and
(vii) the schedule of disbursements (para. 3.30).
5.02      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
issues:
(i) that right-of-way will be available as needed for the
timely implementation of the project (para. 3.27); and
(ii)  if tolls are to be introduced on the project highways, such
tolls would be set after a study to ensure that the rates
would result in an economic use of such highways and alter-
native routes or means of communication, and that toll booth
facilities at interchanges will only be constructed when it
can be demonstrated that there is sufficient ramp traffic to
make such construction and operation financially viable (para.
3.23).



- 30 -
5.03      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that:
(i) The Republics/Province will have adopted regulations authorizing the
borrowers to construct their respective road sections (para. 3.21).
(ii)  Republics/Province will have given a guarantee covering the financ-
ing and cofinancing arrangements of their respective road sections,
including possible cost overruns (para. 3.22).
(iii) The Borrowers will have delegated authority to the CR0 to act as
fiscal agent for the project, as coordinator of disbursement requests
to the Bank and as liaison between the Borrowers and the Bank on
project-related matters. CR0 would also be responsible for the
procurement of road maintenance and load monitoring equipment,
technical assistance, and the highway safety program, including
equipment procurement (para. 3.25).
5.04      With the understandings indicated above, the project would be suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$125 million to the ROs of Slovenia, Croatia,
Vojvodina, and Serbia for a 15-year term including a three-year grace period.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
AN ELEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Transportation Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
Previous Projects
1.        So far the Bank has lent US$1004 million in total to the transport
sector, including US$504 million for ten highway projects, US$108 million for
two pipeline projects, US$348 million for five railway projects and US$44
million for the Bar Port Project. In addition, earthquake rehabilitation
assistance of US$85 million is being proposed for restoring damaged roads,
railways, and a port in SR Montenegro in FY80.
Highway Projects
2.        The First Highway Project (Loan 344-YU, US$35 million) in 1963
financed the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway
(422 km) and parts of the Belgrade-Nis road (174 km).  The Second Highway
Project (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million), financed in 1967, was for the improve-
ment of 367 km of roads connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway via Sarajevo
and Tuzla with the Adriatic highway. Both projects were completed within the
original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Third Highway Project
(Loan 608-YU, US$30 million), financed in 1969, comprised about 120 km of
roads in Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, and was completed in August 1974
with a 20-month delay, primarily due to delays in completing an access road,
but which did not impede the operation of the main highway. This project had
an 8% cost overrun, because of inflation and foreign exchange adjustments.
The Operations Evaluation Department's Project Performance Audit Report (No.
1385, dated December 10, 1976), highlights the completion of the Third Highway
Project with most of the civil works carried out close to the appraisal
schedule. The Audit Report (No. 1385), however, emphasizes the need to
adequately study tolls, so that their imposition does not impede the optimum
use of roads and this caution has been taken into account in later projects.
The Fourth Highway Project (Loan 678-YU, US$40 million) was financed in 1970
for the construction of about 220 km of roads in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo,
Montenegro, Serbia and Vojvodina. Because of expropriation problems in the
section of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the project was completed in December 1975 with
an 18-month delay. There was a 12% cost overrun due to inflation and foreign
exchange adjustments. The Audit Report (No. 1632, dated June 15, 1977)
highlights the difficulties encountered in securing right-of-way, even after
assurances were made to the Bank that right-of-way and location had been
settled before negotiations. Such difficulties, the Audit Report observes,
stem from the decentralization of authority in Yugoslavia, which enables
bodies such as COIs groups to appeal and overturn decisions on location and
right-of-way after they have been taken. There seems to be no easy solution to



_ 34 _
ANNEX 2
Page 2
this problem, but more communication between all groups concerned is being
sought to achieve better results. The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 751-YU,
US$35 million) became effective 8 months late due to Government administrative
delays.  The project comprises 153 km of roads in Kosovo, Macedonnia and
Slovenia, procurement of US$1.7 million worth of engineering equipment,
consultants's services and a staff training component to improve highway
planning and project preparation. All roads are open for traffic. The
engineering equipment has been delivered and the consultant's services were
completed satisfactorily. The staff training component was delayed because of
difficulties encountered in securing training of candidates in the head office
of foreign consultants and in foreign institutes and because of language
problems (insufficient candidates proficient in English). Consequently, a
restricted program was adopted. Because of the delay in training, the project
was completed by the end of 1977, involving a delay of about 15 months. This
project had an 8% cost overrun because of the combined effect of inflation and
foreign exchange adjustments. The Audit Report (No. 2465, dated April 1979)
emphasizes that, on the whole, the project has been successful and the Bank
and the Borrowers are generally pleased with the results. The Report, however,
reiterates the difficulties experienced in acquiring right-of-way and the need
to review the impact of tolls and their effect on traffic. Furthermore, the
report stresses the desirability of a more carefully developed training
program with adequate attention to local constraints. All these aspects have
been taken into account in later projects. The loan for the Sixth Highway
Project (Loan 990-YU, US$30 million) was made in May 1974 and became effective
six weeks later than estimated in December 1974. The project finances six
road sections in Bosnia-Herzegovina, totalling 150 km, the training of trans-
portation economists and road engineers and US$1.1 million worth of engineer-
ing and laboratory equipment. Requests for some changes in road alignments
were agreed in order to provide better service to two communities. Civil
works have been completed satisfactorily, and all roads are open to traffic.
In view of the difficulties encountered in the earlier project, a part of the
training program was modified by inviting foreign consultants and specialists
to give EDI-type training courses in both English and Serbo-Croatian in
Yugoslavia in October 1978. This program was well received. The project was
completed in June 1979, involving a delay of about 18 months, primarily due to
the modifications required in the training program. The loan for the Seventh
Highway Project (Loan 1143-YU, US$40 million) was made in July 1975 and became
effective in March 1976. The project comprises about 90 km of road construc-
tion in Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro, and US$0.1 million worth of technical
assistance to improve preparation of highway feasibility studies and to
provide a related training program. The Serbian road sections have been
completed and are open to traffic. Work in Slovenia and Montenegro is slightly
behind schedule because of expropriation problems and the challenging difficul-
ties presented by the swampy terrain in Slovenia. However, all road works
should be completed by the end of 1979, involving a delay of about 6 months.
The Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU, US$56 million) was made in April
1977 and became effective in September 1977. The project comprises about 130
km of roads in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo, studies by
consultants of road-user charges and rail costs and technical assistance for
the preparation of a highway master plan for Kosovo. All road contracts are



ANNEX 2
Page 3
awarded and work is satisfactorily in progress. The contract for the highway
master plan in Kosovo has been completed by the Consultant. The studies on
road user charges and rail costs are substantially complete. The Ninth
Highway Project (Loan 1535-YU, US$80 million) was made in April 1978 and
became effective in August 1978. The project comprises construcAion of four
highly-congested sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) in Slovenia,
Croatia and Serbia, totalling about 86 km, and the procurement of equipment
for maintenance and for monitoring loadings of vehicles using the primary
highway network, including TYH. All road contracts have been awarded.
Construction in Serbia is ahead of schedule and on schedule in Croatia.
Implementation of the project in Slovenia was delayed due to noise pollution
problems at the Celovska interchange. This has been resolved and construction
has started. Procurement of highway maintenance equipment and weighing scales
is on schedule. The loan for the Tenth Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU, US$148
million) was made in April 1979 and became effective in August 1979. All five
participating Republics and Provinces have awarded road contracts and have
established monitoring and evaluation units. Construction work for all ten
highway projects has been or is being satisfactorily carried out reflecting
the competence of the Yugoslav contracting industries.
Naftagas and Oil Pipeline Projects
3.        The loan for the Nastagas Prolect (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million) was
made in June 1973, but, due to organizational reform within the Enterprise,
became effective only in March 1974 after six month's delay. The project is
for the expansion of the gas transmission and distribution systems in Serbia
and Vojvodina by provision of gas field compressors, pipelines, treatment
plants and distribution rings. The supply of natural gas will come from gas
fields in Vojvodina and from Hungarian imports. Because of a substantial
increase in the project costs and a reallocation of priorities in the use of
natural gas which caused the elimination of some consumers, who withdrew their
finances from the project, the implementation of the project will be implemented
in 3 phases, only the first 2 being taken up at this stage. The additional
funds required were to be provided by agencies in Yugoslavia and by a supple-
mentary loan of US$11 million from the Bank under the Sarajevo Air Pollution
Control Project, Loan 1264-YU. Construction restarted in the latter half of
1976, but progress has been slow. Phase I was scheduled for completion by
December 1978 and Phase II by June 1979. However, because of procedural and
political difficulties completion of the project is likely to be delayed until
the middle of 1980. The loan for the Oil Pipeline Project (Loan 1173-YU,
US$49.0 million subsequently revised to US$48.5 million) was made in November
1975 and became effective in July 1976 after four month's delay. The project
comprises the contruction of an oil port on the Adriatic coast at Omisalj, near
Rijeka, as well as oil storage tank farms, pumping stations, and the pipelines
running from the port through Croatia and Vojvodina and to the Hungarian
border to transport crude oil to the refineries in Yugoslavia, and to Hungary
and Czechoslovakia. The project is to be completed in two stages: Stage I
to provide a yearly capacity of 16 million tons; and Stage II, 20 million.
Stage I was to be completed by May 1978 and Stage II by the end of 1978 but
due to problems of design and procurement, the project is roughly one year
behind schedule.

Railways
4.        The First Railway Loan (Loan 361-YU, US$35 million), made in 1963
to modernize a major railway line, was substantially completed and put into
operation in 1970, i.e., with a delay of about two years. The Second Railway
Loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million) was made in 1964 to help finance a Moderniza-
tion Program for the main lines. The Program, which covers electrification,
signallitig, telecommunications and marshalling yards, was to be executed
between 1964 and 1968, at an estimated cost of US$185 million, but due to long
delays, completion is not expected before 1979 at over twice the original cost
estimated in US dollar terms. The Bank loan was fully disbursed in November
1972 and completion of the Program is being assisted by the Fourth Loan
(below). The Third Railway Loan (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million) in 1968 helped
to finance the completion of 372 km of the Belgrade-Bar line. Completion was
originally scheduled for 1973, but geo-technical and other construction
problems in difficult mountainous terrain delayed the opening of the line
until 1976. The c6st estimate has increased from US$225 million to about
US$422 million. The Fourth Railway Loan (1026-YU, US$93 million) was made in
July 1974 and became effective by the revised date of February 1975. The loan
finances the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and certain related
investments, including-track rehabilitation and further signalling works,
which are needed to maximize the benefits of the program, all which were to be
completed by the end of 1976. There have been certain delays in project
execution due principally to financial and administrative difficulties.
Government efforts to combat severe inflation have caused rates to lag too far
behind the increase in railway costs.  The resulting financing problems and
other issues relating to the railways' efficiency are being addressed by newly
created Communities of Interest. The project is now expected to be complete
by the end of 1980. Considerable progress has been made on institutional
developments notably in planning and management of investments and strengthen-
ing the Community of Yugoslav Railways. The Fifth Railway Loan (Loan 1534-YU,
US$100 million) was made in April 1978; it became effective in September 1978
and has already been largely committed. The project covers the three year
1978-80 tranche of the railways 1976-80 Investment Plan with the principal
objective to modernize railway facilities in order to improve further the
efficiency and the competitive position of the railways.
Port of Bar Project
5.        The loan (Loan 1060-YU, US$44 million) was made in November 1974 to
finance port development and related railway facilities. The loan became
effective on June 13, 1975. Major civil works components are completed except
for a grain silo, for which final designs are awaited. Railway works outside
the port area, being undertaken by the Railway Transport Enterprise, Belgrade,
have been delayed-because of problems in expropriating private dwellings on the
needed land. The Loan Closing Date has been postponed to June 30, 1980.
