                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to: (i) help alleviate the current power supply shortfall in the Kurdish region through urgent repair work; (ii) strengthen the
                         capacity of local operational staff; and (iii) prepare for the subsequent rehabilitation of the Dokan and Derbandikhan hydropower plants. The reliability of both power
                         plants is very low and the effective capacity of each has been as low as 50 percent. Subsequent rehabilitation would restore their original capacity of 400 and 249MW
                         respectively.
