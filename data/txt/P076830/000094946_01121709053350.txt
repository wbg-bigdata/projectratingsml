JAMAICA
EMERGENCY ECONOMIC REHABILITATION LOAN
PROPOSED LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
BORROWER:           Jamaica
IMPLEMENTING
AGENCY:             Ministry of Finance and Planning
AMOUNT
AND TERMS:          US$75 million, US Dollar Fixed Spread Loan, repayable in 17 years including
five years of grace.
DISBURSEMENT:  The proposed loan will be disbursed on effectiveness in a single tranche.
DESCRIPTION:        The proposed Economic Emergency Rehabilitation Loan (ERL) supports the
Government's efforts to maintain a sound macroeconomic program and continue
its progress towards achievement of sustainable economic growth and further
poverty reduction in the face of multiple shocks which have impacted the
economy, especially the decline in international travel to and tourism in Jamaica
following the events of September 11, 2001. It would bridge part of the fiscal
gap generated by the shocks, help to maintain spending in key social programs
and rebuild damaged infrastructure, support private sector-led tourism and related
economic activities and improve overall governance in the country.
BENEFITS:           The proposed loan will help the Government avoid cutbacks in critical
expenditures, especially in social programs, which are crucial for social
cohesion.. Improved public expenditure control, rationalization, and governance
and transparency will increase administrative efficiency and improve the delivery
of public services. Reforms and actions to improve the framework for private
sector development, including a more flexible labor market, will stimulate
growth and create employment opportunities for the poor, particularly in tourism
and tourism-linked agriculture and manufacturing.
RISKS:              The reform program and the strategy it supports face three principal risks that
could lead to lower economic growth and, consequently, a reversal of the recent
gains in poverty reduction. The first risk would be a resumption of social unrest
and violence as occurred during July 2001. The sources of such tension remain
but the Government has had success in strengthening security arrangements
while introducing and expanding social and employment programs which have
helped to provide a productive outlet for a significant, young and largely
unskilled labor pool. Increased and sustained unemployment could exacerbate
social pressures and the risks of violence. Any future rounds of violence and its
impact on Jamaica's international image would depress the country's tourism
prospects further. This could well result in a vicious cycle of unrest and tourism
decline, placing the growth role of tourism in the economy in jeopardy.
I



Similarly, the second and interrelated risk would be the occurrence of an event or
events which would again significantly depress international travel, especially
from North America which accounts for the bulk of Jamaica's tourist arrivals.
While there is little the Government can do to directly address this risk, the
reform program and Bank financial support will assist the GOJ in tackling key
issues such as improvement of airport and domestic security, diversification and
promotional campaigns to increase Jamaica's tourism market share, and,
importantly, the need to guarantee adequate Government resources directed to
social services and jobs creation for works directly impacting the lives of the
poor.
Such additional shocks could lead to a low or no growth scenario and a
worsening of Jamaica's adverse debt dynamics. Given the already high primary
surplus and limited scope for further fiscal tightening, the Government could face
serious difficulties in maintaining macroeconomic stability without seeking
enhanced support from all International Financial Institutions (IFIs).
The last foreseeable risk concerns the pressures that could be placed on the GOJ
for additional spending and/or policy slippage given that elections are expected
in 2002. Thus far, GOJ has demonstrably resisted such pressures as evidenced
by its disciplined fiscal stance over the past one to two years, resulting in a 12
percent primary surplus in 2000/1. This performance combined with statements
made by senior policymakers following the September 11 economic shock
suggest that GOJ maintains a strong commitment to its reform program,
including continued sound macroeconomic management.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED
EMERGENCY ECONOMIC REHABILITATION LOAN
OF US$75 MILLION
TO
JAMAICA
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Emergency Economic Rehabilitation Loan (ERL) to Jamaica in the amount of US$75 million.
This operation has been prepared to assist the Government in managing the impact of multiple
recent shocks, the most important of which has been the fallout of the tragedy of September 11,
2001 in the United States on international travel and its severe effect on tourism and related
sectors in Jamaica. The loan supports the emergency response of the Govermment of Jamaica
(GOJ) to these shocks in the context of its medium term reform program which aims at:
maintaining macroeconomic stability; continuing to address poverty and social pressures,
especially those arising from the emergency; and further improving governance, efficiency and
accountability of the public sector. The loan would be made in US Dollars at the Bank's Fixed
Spread interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years including five years of grace.
I     ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT1
A.   Introduction
2.    As a small island nation with a population of about 2.6 million, Jamaica depends heavily
on a few sectors - agriculture, tourism (mainly from North America), bauxite mining and light
manufacturing - for the bulk of its income. GDP per capita in 1999 was US$2,430, substantially
lower than the Latin America and Caribbean regional average of about US$3,800 (Atlas method,
World Development Indicators 2001) but social indicators are comparatively high, reflecting
sustained commitment to education and health care since before independence in 1962. Life
expectancy is estimated at 75 years, enrollment in primary and lower secondary education is
currently near-universal and access to safe water and sanitary facilities are estimated to be 80 and
99 percent respectively. Poverty has been declining over the past several years despite slow or
negative GDP growth, from about 27.5 percent of the population in 1995 to around 18.7 percent
in 2000. It should be noted, however, that this latter figure represents an increase over 1998
when the lowest poverty rate of 15.9 percent was recorded. In terms of governance, too, Jamnaica
fares relatively well. Forrnal traditions of democratic participation and accountability are
apparently well-established within the framnework of a stable British-style parliamentary
democracy with two dominant political parties.

JM.

3.    Despite the achievements cited above, Jamaica faces a number of serious societal
challenges, not the least of which is a very high level of social tension manifested in high levels
of violence and crime, especially among inner-city youth. Deriving both from "push" factors
notably poverty, high unemployment and social exclusion as well as "pull" factors including
party-political rivalries and the lure of quick profits from involvement in illegal drug-trading, the
incidence of violent crime in Jamaica is one of the highest in the hemisphere.  Better
enforcement of law and order and, more broadly, fostering increased social cohesion, is thus a
high a priority for Jamaica, given the highly disruptive impact that these phenomena have had on
key determinants of development performance-including human capital development, investor
confidence, tourism development, and the country's image abroad. A recent reminder of this
linkage came in the shape of the July 2001 violence in Kingston, which had a perceptible
depressive impact on tourism.
4.    In the economic arena as well, Jamaica has faced (and continues to face) a number of
challenges. Average GDP per capita in Jamaica has been stagnant over much of the last three
decades, despite very high investment rates and active development partner engagement. For a
time, beginning in the mid-1980s, the Government's efforts to introduce broad-based reforms in
the trade and foreign exchange regimes, public sector, and financial system appeared to bear
fruit, stimulating average annual GDP growth rates of 3.4 percent over the period 1984-96 and
bringing about sharp declines in inflation and notable improvements in Jamaica's fiscal situation
and its external position. However, a severe financial sector crisis in 1996 over-shadowed these
reform efforts, and imposed huge costs on the economy.
5.    The financial sector crisis was largely attributable to financial sector liberalization that
was not complemented by a sufficiently robust prudential and regulatory infrastructure. A large
number and variety of financial institutions emerged, enabling regulatory arbitrage. By late
1996, there were compelling signs of liquidity and solvency problems of systemic dimensions in
several financial institutions, and a major build-up of inflationary pressures. The Government
responded by tightening monetary policy, maintaining a stable nominal exchange rate,
intervening in the financial sector through a full guarantee for all depositors, strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial sector, and re-capitalizing weak
institutions using Government-backed debt issued by a newly created failure resolution agency -
the Financial Sector Adjustment Company Limited (FINSAC). Through the interventions of
FINSAC, the Government largely avoided a melt-down of the financial sector but the cost of the
crisis was a massive and growing debt burden to the economy, in the form of FINSAC paper that
paid interest by issuing further FINSAC paper. Total FINSAC paper issued grew to a level of
about J$142.7 billion (about US$3 billion or about 43.5 percent of 2000 GDP) as of March 2001.
Taking into account the already high (non-FINSAC) public debt that existed before the crisis,
Jamaica faces a severe fiscal problem, with total debt/GDP ratio growing to 135 percent by end
2000/01.
B.    Economic Situation and Trends before September 11
6.    The realities of the financial sector crisis forced the Government to take strong steps,
foremost being corrective fiscal measures.  It raised the primary surplus of the Central
Government from 2 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to 10 percent of GDP in 1999/00. In June 2000,
it outlined its medium term macroeconomic program and requested IMF staff to monitor this via
a staff-monitored program (SMP) for the period April 2000-March 2002. Implementation of the
4



SMP was satisfactory in 2000/01, with the Central Government's primary surplus increasing
further to over 12 percent of GDP, and the fiscal deficit declining to 1.0 percent of GDP from 4.2
percent in 1999/00. According to the IMF, the public debt to GDP ratio stabilized at 137 percent
in 2000/01 (rising by only 2 percentage points, compared to an increase of 17 percentage points
in 1999/00).2  The real effective exchange rate depreciated by about 4 percent in 1999/00 and
about 2.5 percent in 2000/01, which helped the economy grow by 1.1 percent in 2000/01, after
four years of negative growth. Gross reserves rose from US$801 million to US$1386 million
during 2000/01 (16.6 weeks of next year's imports of goods and services). At the time of the
May 2001 Article IV review, the outlook for Jamaica for 2001/02 was quite positive as shown in
Table I below.

II. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF EXOGENOUS SHOCKS
A.   The Emergency
7.      Since the summer of 2001, Jamaica has been buffeted by a series of unanticipated shocks
which have complicated considerably the country's already-difficult economic situation. Among
these, by far the most important in terms of magnitude has been the dramatic drop in travel and
tourism to Jamaica (and elsewhere) following the tragic September 11 events in the US. In
addition, tourism was also adversely affected by the highly publicized July violence in Kingston.
2 This ratio was however 22 percentage points of GDP above the SMP target. See IMF Article IV 2001 Staff
Report, EBS/O1i73, Box 2 for reasons for this overshooting, including interest rates being higher than anticipated,
inclusion of previously off-balance sheet debt, higher than expected depreciation of the Jamaican dollar, accounting
treatment of FINSAC securities held by the Bank of Jamaica, additional debt guaranteeing, outstanding FINSAC
liabilities in the process of being redeemed using sales of the power company in March 2001, etc.
5



Most recently (in early November 2001), floods related to heavy rainfall associated with
Hurricane Michelle caused extensive damage to roads and crops, primarily in tourist areas in the
eastern end of the island. These shocks have occurred against the backdrop of the slowdown in
the US (and the world) economy which has been far more severe than had been expected when
Jamaica was laying out its economic program for GOJ fiscal year 2001/02.

8.      As summarized in Table 2, these shocks have affected key economic variables resulting
in a decline in current and anticipated net tourist receipts (23 percent compared to the SMP).
This, in turn, has meant a forecast decline in government revenues and an increase in
expenditures as Jamaica attempts to deal with the fallout of the shocks. The shocks will also
increase the current account deficit and increase unemployment, especially in sectors that cater to
the tourist industry. Finally, Jamaica's fragile growth recovery will be affected, with the growth
rate now anticipated at about 1 percent instead of the 3 percent growth anticipated at the start of
the year. More details on the impact of the September 1 1 events and other smaller shocks on
tourism and the rest of the Jamaican economy are provided in Sections B-D below.
B.   Impact on Tourism
9.      Jamaica's Tourism  Market. Jamaica, like many other Caribbean economies, is highly
dependent on tourism. Depending on the definition adopted, tourism could account for about
9 to I I percent of GDP.3  Many sectors such as agriculture, craft shops, bus operators, etc., eam

assumed to be 37 percent of travel inflows (based on a survey of the tourist industry-Source: Tourist Board), then

significant parts of their income from tourism. Tourist visitors to Jamaica are classified either as
stopover tourists or cruise ship arrivals-the latter spending only a few hours on land before
returning to their ships. Of the two groups, stopover tourists, primarily non-Jamaican, are by far
the most important from the standpoint of revenue generation, accounting for about 95 percent of
total earnings. Jamaican tourism depends to a great extent on tourists from North America, who
accounted for 71.3 percent of all stopover tourists during 2000 (30 percent from the Northeast,
including New York), a share that has been growing slowly over the last five years.
10.   Impact of Shocks on Tourist Arrivals.  Tourism  had been increasing steadily in
Jamaica over the past several years- for the period 1995-2000, the growth rate of tourist arrivals
averaged 4.7 percent over 1995-2000, and in 2000 the growth was as high as 10.8 percent
(6 percent for stopovers and 18.7 percent for cruise passengers). This growth was maintained in
the first four months of 2001 (Table 3), which saw an increase in tourist arrivals of 4.9 percent
over the same period in 2000. The rate of tourism growth began to slow in mid-2001, with a
slowdown in stop-over tourist arrivals during May-June 2001 which turned negative in July,
owing to the violence in Kingston. Hopes for recovery following a restoration of order were
subsequently dashed with the advent of the September 11 attacks in the US.

1. Actual data for April - October
Source: Jamaica Tourist Board
Current estimates indicate that Jamaica suffered a 20 percent decline in tourist arrivals in
September and nearly 21 percent in October, with projected declines for November-December
being even higher, going as high as 28 percent for December, despite efforts by the Jamaican
tourism would contribute about 9 percent of GDP. If imports are assumed to be 25 percent of travel inflows, then
tourism would contribute 11 percent of GDP.

tourism industry to respond with lowered rates even for the traditionally high November to
February season.
11.   While it is difficult to predict the precise course of tourist arrivals during the upcoming
high season, projections based on bookings and cancellations suggest that the projected decline
in the January - March 2002 quarter will be 17.4 percent.4  If this scenario materializes, the
decline in tourist arrivals is likely to be about 21 percent lower for the period September 2001-
March 2002 compared with the same period in 2000/01.5
12.   Taking all factors into account, the base case estimate of the decline in stopover tourist
arrivals for FY2001/02 is 11.8 percent compared to 2000/01, and 16.4 percent compared to the
May 2001 forecast. For FY2002/03, some recovery is expected towards the second half of the
year, based on positive expectations from promotion campaigns. A modest growth of 0.6
percent is projected for FY2002/03. (For impact of shocks on cruise passengers see Annex 3).
13.   Impact on Earnings.  Given the decline in arrivals, Jamaica's gross earnings from
tourism are now expected to decline substantially, by US$311 million, in 2001/02 compared to
the May 2001 forecast. This estimate is primarily based on the following assumptions:
*  The projected number of stopover arrivals is 1.18 million, about 16.5 percent lower than the
SMP forecast of 1.41 million. Based on exit surveys, the Jamaica Tourist Board has
determined that each stopover visitor stays about 10 days, and spends about US$ 100 per day
in Jamaica. This in turn indicates a decline in tourism receipts of about US$235 million.
* In addition, there is also a price decline, owing to the substantial discounting by hotels to
attract tourists, reportedly as high as 30-40 percent even for up-market properties. The
assumption is that the average expenditure per day (averaged over the year) is expected to
fall to about US$92 per day. This implies an additional decline in receipts of about US$20
million.
C.    Fiscal Impact
14.   With reduced economic activity, the Government's already fragile fiscal situation will be
further eroded. In May 2001, the authorities, in their SMP, projected a Central Government
fiscal deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP. On a passive basis, without adjustment measures, this
deficit could increase to over 5 percent of GDP. With active adjustment measure, the deficit is
expected to go down to 4.1 percent of GDP. These numbers are based on assumptions about
reduced economic activity in the second half of 2001/02 and the need for additional expenditures
to compensate for shocks, particularly the reconstruction of key flood-damaged infrastructure.
4 This is consistent with data from one of the well-managed, successful hotels in Montego Bay shows that it is
expecting a decline in occupancy rates from September 11 forecast levels of about 93 percent over January-March
2002 (actuals in 2000 for this period were about 98 percent), to November 6 forecasts of 57 percent in January 2002,
and around 73 percent in February and March 2002.
5 There are signs that tourists are reducing lead times between bookings and subsequent travel. If so, then any
future improvement in sentiment for tourism could improve tourist inflows in a relatively short period.
8



15.   Revenue Impact. In the aftermath of the multiple shocks, the Government expected a
revenue decline of over J$ 3.0 billion (about 0.8 percent of GDP), compared to the May 2001
SMP forecast. The largest impact is expected to be felt via the direct decline in international
trade. While the hotels and restaurants sector is one of the key affected sectors, the lower GCT
rate on tourism (6.25 percent versus 15 percent in the other sectors) means that its contribution to
tax revenue is much lower than its weight in the economy. The largest sources of expected
revenue decline include:
* The international travel tax ($725 million), arising from reduced outgoing travel of
visitors as well as Jamaicans.
*  Customs duties, as well as the general consumption tax (GCT) and special consumption
tax (SCT) on imports (about J$388 million), arising from reduced imports.
*  The levy on exports of bauxite (J$592 million), arising from reduced exports and prices
of bauxite, owing to reduced world and US growth rates.
* The GCT and SCT on local consumption (J$312 million), arising from reduced economic
activity.
*  Profit tax on bauxite processing companies (J$407 million).
* PAYE (Pay as you earn) tax (J$297 million), owing to a temporary rise in
unemployment.
*  Also, in order to ease the impact of the shocks on companies in good standing, the
Government has agreed to a three month deferment of statutory payments such as
education taxes.
16.   Given the already large fiscal deficit, the Government's recovery program includes
several measures to raise tax revenue for the remainder of 2001/02, such as fast-track
amendments to GCT legislation to close loopholes and combat tax evasion, improved tax
administration measures such as information sharing, registration, and a more aggressive audit
program for companies. These measures are expected to yield about J$1.5 billion. In addition,
the authorities will require public enterprises to transfer higher dividends to the Central
Government, which will contribute to the additional J$2 billion in non-tax revenue. Also, grants
from external agencies are projected to decline in comparison to the May 2001 SMP by J$550
million. As a result of the above, the overall decline in revenue in 2001/02 is expected to be only
J$390 million (0.1 percent of GDP).
17.   Expenditure Impact. On the expenditure side, the authorities expect to have to spend
over J$2.7 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) in the current fiscal year to cover the additional costs
associated with the July riots, the flood damage from the rains that accompanied Hurricane
Michelle, and the impact of September l1. Key additional expenditures foreseen by the
authorities relate to:
*  Additional security at ports and airports (J$664 million).
*  Expenditure on resort security (J$ 119 million).
*  Operation Grow, which involves further promotion of Jamaica as a tourist destination
(J$5 10 million), including 143 million capital expenditure.
*  Capital expenditure on flood-damaged roads, bridges and infrastructure reinforcement
(J$1082 million).
9



* Miscellaneous expenditures on product development, agriculture, victim support, and
housing.
(Additional expenditures on some of the categories above will continue into the next fiscal
year, but separate detailed estimates for those will be worked out by the Government closer
to its Budget cycle).
18.   In addition to the impact of the shocks, wages and salaries will increase faster than
anticipated in the SMP to the tune of J$2.3 billion, owing to wage negotiations proceeding faster
than anticipated. However, over a two-year period, the salary bill may in fact be no higher or
even lower than initially anticipated, since most unions have agreed to a four percent nominal
wage increase in each of the current and next fiscal years.6
19.   On a passive basis, the total increase in expenditures beyond the May 2001 SMP would
have been over J$5 billion. In order to accommnodate the large additional expenditures generated
by the shocks, the authorities have indicated that they will be cutting some of the previously
planned capital expenditures (the focus on capital expenditure reflects the very limited
maneuvering space that the Government's budget has, given the very high primary surplus that is
needed to pay the interest costs of existing debt). The total planned cuts amount to over J$2100
million, including J$1200 million in transport and works, and over J$300 million in the Cabinet
office, and over J$200 million in the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Technology. (The net
decline in capital expenditures will thus amount to only J$800 million, given the increases in
capital expenditures in other categories, arising from the shocks, see para 17 above.)
20.   Fiscal Outturn and Debt Dynamics. As indicated above, given the overhang of the
debt and the consequently weak fiscal situation, the Government has indicated that it would not
wish to accommodate all of the passive increase in the fiscal deficit. Reduction in the passive
deficit would depend on success in improving tax collections and reducing expenditures (see
paras 15 and 17 above). The 'active' fiscal deficit is projected to be about 4.1 percent of GDP in
2001/02 (2.8 percent in the May 2001 SMP), primarily because of forecast expenditures being
1.4 percent higher than the May 2001 SMP. The reduction in the deficit is about 1 percent
compared with the outtun in 2000/01.7 Thus, in spite of significant shocks, the authorities'
revised program still forecasts a continuation along the path of fiscal correction that they have
embarked upon since 1998/99 (see Annex 4).
21.   With the increase in the public debt arising from the financial crisis, the total debt to GDP
ratio rose from 79 percent of GDP in 1996/97 to 137 percent of GDP in 2000/01. With the
6 Apart from the above, a specific concessional interest scheme has been worked out for the tourism sector. This
requires commercial banks to use half of the additional funds released by the September decline (from 11 to 10) in
the statutory cash reserve ratio to finance working capital and other needs of the hotels sector, at concessional
interest rates. The scheme will only last as long as funds are available under this particular reduction of the CRR,
which is expected to generate about J$955 million. (The Government has committed to reduce the Statutory Cash
Reserve Ratio of commercial banks from 25 percent as of end-July 1998 to 9 percent by end-March 2002. The CRR
is currently 10 percent.)
7 The adjusted (which includes accrued interest on FINSAC paper) active fiscal deficit is forecast at 4.6 percent in
2001/02, compared with 5.7 percent in 2000/01 (see Annex 4, Table 1).
10



resumption of growth and the continuation of a primary surplus around 10 percent of GDP, the
debt ratio was forecast to fall to 127 percent in 2001/02. Even with the fiscal shocks and some
decline in growth (although not much in nominal growth), the revised program still sees the debt
ratio declining to about 132 percent of GDP. If, in spite of the shocks, the authorities can reduce
the debt to GDP ratio, it will demonstrate responsible macro policy, and should generate added
credibility in eyes of the IFIs and the rating agencies.
D.    Balance of Payments Impact
22.   Jamaica's external current account deficit has averaged over four percent of GDP in the
last four years, and was expected to be 5.3 percent in 2001/02 at the time of the May 2001 SMP.
With the decline in tourist inflows, and a somewhat smaller decline in exports, the deficit is
expected to increase to about 8 percent of GDP. Jamaica has a comfortable NIR situation, with
reserves at US$1.5 billion in October 2001, about 19 weeks of imports of goods and services.
Additional budgetary support by multilaterals will help to reduce downward pressure on the
Jamaican dollar, and to make it more likely that the forecast for NIR is unchanged compared to
the SMP (see Annex 4).
23.   The keyv features in the evolution of the Balance of Payments in 2001/02 are likely to be
the following:
* Decline in gross earnings from tourism by US$311 million, or 21 percent, compared to
SMP (decrease of about 14 percent compared to 2000/01). This arises from a combination of
declining arrivals and discounting by hotels. Overseas expenditure of Jamaican tourists also
declines by US$ 25 million. Thus, net tourist earnings decline by US$ 286 million.
* An increase in the merchandise trade deficit of US$47 million compared with SMP,
arising from a decline in exports of US$167 million, and a decline in imports of US$123
million (including fuel imports).
* The sizeable increase in current transfers in 2000/01 continued into 2001/02, even though
some slowdown in the pace of increase was seen by September 2001 (growth of 10 percent
compared with September 2000, higher in previous months). The May 2001 SMP forecast
for remittances was US$701 million. Current trends indicate that the year 2001/02 will end
with remittances of US$789 million.
* While net FDI will be affected by the world economic downtum, it is nevertheless
expected to be about US$62 million higher than the conservative SMP forecast of US$224
million, and will help to finance 45 percent of the current account deficit.
*  Part of the increase in the current account deficit is expected to be financed by additional
funding by IFIs, including the CDB, IDB, and the World Bank.
8  Of course, the changes in economic indicators after the May 2001 SMP owes not only to the September 11
events. The projected outcomes are a combination of changes occurring the SMP was finalized in May 2001, such
as the greater than anticipated slowdown in the world economy, the July violence in Kingston, the November floods
and, most importantly, the September events. Annex 5 (Methodological Note: Disaggregating the September 11
Impact) attempts a very simple decomposition of the different effects based on trends prevailing prior to September
11. For example, of the total decline of US$281 million in net tourist receipts between the May 2001 SMP and the
December projections, the model estimates that US$181 million arises from the September 11 shocks.
11



E.    Impact on GDP Growth
24.   Given the various direct and indirect impacts of the tourism fallout and the difficulties of
measuring these, the estimation of growth is likely to be subject to some degrees of error. The
Government's base case scenario now shows GDP growing up to 1 percent in 2001/02 instead of
3 percent originally estimated. The methodology and key assumptions for the forecast include:
*  Compared to SMP, the Government estimates that goods and non-factor services deficit
on the external account will increase by over US$3 10 million, an impact dominated by
the impact on tourism. This includes the fact that the decline in tourist expenditure in
Jamaica also means a corresponding 37 percent decline in tourism-related imports.
*  This decline in net exports of goods and non-factor services will have a one for one
impact on GDP, in the first instance. (Some price flexibility could help to reduce the
extent of the shock).
*  Part of this shock will be counteracted by the higher than planned expenditure by the
Government in 2001/02, financed to a large extent by the IFIs.
*  Also, in the first two quarters of the fiscal year 2001/02, the economy has been growing
at 4.5 and 3.4 percent, respectively. Some of this momentum is expected to be carried
forward in sectors not directly affected by the shocks, such as telecommunications.
Jamaica may see only a marginally positive growth in 2001/02.
*  The decline in nominal GDP is however expected to be only about 0.5 percent, owing to
inflation being higher than anticipated (arising from the depreciation of the exchange
rate).
25.   That the growth is expected to be even marginally positive in spite of severe shocks is
encouraging in itself. If this happens, it would be partly because of a recovery from low levels of
output in the agriculture and bauxite mining sectors. The other factor in positive growth
expectations is that stable and suitable macroeconomic policies including a significant level of
foreign reserves have meant that the shocks have not translated into a crisis of confidence.
F.    Impact on Employment
26.   Given Jamaica's high (about 16 percent) unemployment rate overall, and the high
concentration of unemployment among youth and young adults in particular, there is
considerable concern that loss of employment associated with the September 11 and other shocks
to tourism could not only cause economic hardship to many households, but further exacerbate
pre-existing social tensions. Particularly worrisome is the risk that lay-offs by the hotel,
restaurant and other tourism-related businesses of low- and semi-skilled workers in the lead-up
to Parliamentary elections next year could help spark a new round of civil disturbances and
violence which in turn could lead to a impoverishing vicious cycle of further tourism declines,
further job losses and increasing social unrest (see Annex 3).
27.   Apart from workers in the hotel and restaurant industries, others most affected by job loss
or the threat of unemployment include those employed in agriculture, manufacturing, and
transportation given their strong linkages to the tourism sector. Together, these three sectors
account for about 34 percent of total employment (21 percent, 7 percent and 6 percent
12



respectively), and including the tourist industries, account for about 56 percent9 of the employed
labor force. Given that unemployment rates are already high in some sectors (about 15 percent
in wholesale and retail, hotels and restaurant services; and 22 percent in manufacturing), any
firther redundancies may increase poverty, and may also lead to increased social tensions as
discussed above. It should be noted that the likely implications for agriculture are perhaps the
most serious from a poverty standpoint, given that there is already disproportionately high
poverty in rural areas (25.1 percent in 2000 compared to the Jamaica average of 18.7 percent).
Box 1 below provides more detail on the likely impact of the September 11 and other shocks to
tourism on the agriculture sector.
Box 1. Agriculture: The Impact of September 11
The agricultural sector accounted for 6.9 percent of GDP and almost one-fifth of total employment in 1999.
Three-quarters of the poor live in rural areas. The sector faces problems due to its vulnerability to drought
conditions and high costs/low productivity, which wil be exacerbated by the secondary shocks resulting from the
September 11 attacks and theflood rains.
The strong linkage of tourism to agriculture implies that much of the negative impact of September 11 affects the
agricultural sector. The main impacts in the short term will be (i) lower exports of agricultural products and
increased processing, handling and transportation costs of exports to North America and Europe and (ii) low demand
in the local tourism sector. Economic losses were further compounded by hurricane Michelle and the ensuing flood
rains during November which caused severe losses in domestic crops and export crops such as bananas and coffee,
and in livestock.
In the external sector, exports of fresh produce fell as a result of disruptions in transportation links and the
perishable nature of export products. The loss in agricultural exports is estimated at J$16 million in export revenues,
mainly due to spoilage as international transportation was brought to a halt for four days following the attacks'0.
At the domestic level, the agricultural sector will experience declines in the sale of fresh produce to the tourist
industry as the number of visitors decline. To gauge the impact on the local economy, the Government of Jamaica
has estimated that about J$176 million is spent monthly by the hotel sector on locally produced fresh foods". If
visitor arrivals are assumed to decline by 25 percent, the value of fresh food purchased is projected to decline by
J$44 million monthly, resulting in about J$24 million direct monthly losses to farmers. Another recent survey
shows that since September 11, the declines in purchases of agricultural produce in selected major hotels range
12
between 20-66 percent
In the future, the sector is expected to remain affected by the slowdown in tourism (reducing sales of fresh produce
to the local industry), increased security measures (causing delays in shipping produce), and the inability of some
exporters to supply orders (due to losses experienced and cash flow problems). However, a positive growth for the
sector is expected for 2001 due to the strong agricultural performance during the first half of the year. During
January-September 2001, agricultural output grew by 10.3 percent over the previous year. During the same period,
domestic crop production grew by 13.1 percent and export crop production by 9.2 percent.

restaurant services of October 2000.

G.   Macroeconomic Scenario in 2002/03
28.   The world economy is not expected to show much improvement in growth in 2002.
Indeed, in the case of the US, Jamaica's major export market and source for tourism, there may
even be a further decline in growth. In such a situation, an open economy like Jamaica's cannot
expect any significant boost for growth from the external sector, at least over the next 12 months.
In this context, the recovery program that the Government has put in place is essentially a
holding operation in the short-term, meant to preserve essential social and, to the extent possible,
capital expenditures while maintaining macroeconomic stability. This is expected to help the
economy to return to the path of incipient, and eventually, sustained growth.
29.   Assuming no significant new shocks, Jamaica would do well to maintain the rate of
growth that it is expected to achieve in 2001/02, wherein at least one half of the year was
"normal." In 2002/03, GDP growth is expected to be around 2 percent. Although a new SMP
for 2002/03 is not yet in place, the authorities have indicated that they expect to reduce the
Central Government fiscal deficit by about 1 percentage point of GDP from the expected
outcome in 2001/02. Crucially, the total debt to GDP ratio is also expected to decline, as a result
of lower interest rates, continued GDP growth and a high primary surplus. On the external front,
the current account deficit is expected to remain at about 8 percent of GDP in 2002/03.
Financing for this deficit is expected to come about through some improvement in FDI and
continued access to external financing, including external commercial borrowing. Reserves are
expected to stay around the levels of end-2001/02.
III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
30.  In response to the shocks described in the preceding section, the Government has
developed an emergency economic rehabilitation program comprising actions designed to: (i)
prevent a reversal of the fragile economic recovery of the past 18 or so months; (ii) protect the
most vulnerable population groups from the impact of the shocks; and (iii) undertake key
investments to facilitate the recovery of tourism and related sectors of the economy. In parallel,
and in keeping with the objectives laid out in its "Medium-Term Strategy (MTS) 2000-2002" for
development, the Govermment intends to continue to pursue its agenda of improving governance,
efficiency and effectiveness in the public sector. The main elements of this program are laid out
below in some detail as they form the background to the policy measures and other actions being
supported by the loan proposed in this report. The specific actions taken prior to Board
presentation are summarized in Section IV para. 57 below.
A. The Emergency Economic Rehabilitation Program
31.   Maintaining Macro-Economic Stability. As noted earlier, Jamaica's already fragile
fiscal situation has been further eroded due largely to the events of September 11, but also to the
(smaller) shocks related to the July riots and violence in Kingston, the slow-down of the US
economy and the flood damage to infrastructure as a result of Hurricane Michelle which affected
the area in early November. The combined impact of these events has meant both a reduction in
revenue and a need for a substantial increase in expenditures from those foreseen in May 2001 -
14



with the potential to increase the Government fiscal deficit by as much as 2 percent of GDP,
from 3.2 percent projected in May 2001 to over 5.2 percent.
32.   Given the overhang of Jamaica's high debt burden (about 137 percent of GDP at end-
March 2001) and the consequent fiscal fragility going into the summer/fall of 2001, the
Government fully recognizes that it cannot accommodate all of the passive increase in the fiscal
deficit. Rather, it is committed to a strategy of both increasing revenues, inter alia, via
continuing improvements in tax administration and better integration of the informal sector into
the formal economy, as well as cutting expenses where feasible/desirable. In this latter regard, it
should be noted that the room for maneuver is constrained, given the already-high primary
surplus which is being maintained to pay the interest costs of the debt (see paras 15-19 for an
elaboration of revenue and expenditure measures relating to the rehabilitation program).
However, there is an expectation that some savings can be achieved through accelerated
implementation of the recommendations of the strategic review of key ministries (including
National Security, Education, Health etc.) which was undertaken with the support of external
management consultants in 1998-99, with implementation initiated in GOJ FY1999/00. While
thus seeking to achieve cost savings via efficiency improvements in these sectors, the
Government is well aware of the importance of human development and maintenance of social
cohesion/order to the achievement of Jamaica's longer-term development goals. It therefore
remains firmly committed to ensuring that core health, education and security services are
maintained, that provision is made to protect the population's most vulnerable groups and that
critically-needed capital investments are not short-changed.
33.   The Government has just revised its macro-economic targets under its ongoing Staff
Monitored Program (SMP) which has been in place since April 2000. In addition, the
Government has reached an agreement with the IMF to negotiate a new SMP for 2002/03 .
34.   Protecting the Vulnerable. Two years ago, the Jamaican Government in cooperation
with a number of external partners (including the Bank) initiated a major overhaul of its social
assistance programs in an effort to reduce fragmentation and duplication of services, improve the
targeting and value of benefits and increase the coverage of the most vulnerable population
groups. This effort resulted in a reform proposal that included the elimination of some minor
programs and the merging of three larger transfer programs13 into a single conditional cash
transfer program - the United Benefit Program (UBP) aimed at providing meaningful cash
assistance to the most vulnerable members of poorest families (infants, children, youth, pregnant
and lactating women, the elderly and the disabled) linked to human capital investment, especially
through school attendance and preventive health care. At present, the UBP was piloted in one
parish (St. Catherine) and is expected to be expanded nation-wide in 2002 after successfully
competing the pilot. In line with its commitment to enabling the poorest members of society to
maintain at least a minimum level of consumption and allow them to continue the long term
investments in their human capital, the Government's emergency recovery program ensures that
sufficient budgetary funds are allocated to the UBP to enable full coverage of beneficiaries and
that benefit levels are established at a minimum average level of J$300 equivalent per month
(which is J$50 in excess of the original commitment made under the Social Safety Net project).
13 Some smaller programs linked to health and education are still being evaluated with a view to eventually
eliminating them or increasing their efficiency.
15



Further phased increases are planned for subsequent years, reaching an average level of J$500
equivalent per beneficiary per month by CY 2004. In parallel, the Government will seek to
better target, rationalize or phase out a number of in-kind social assistance programs including
remaining education-based transfer programs, feeding programs, and housing and
pharmaceuticals programs. A review of these programs is currently ongoing, in part with
assistance from IDB and DFID.
35.   While the UBP and other smaller social assistance programs are targeted to the poorest
(or structurally poor) and should help this group to maintain minimum living standards, the
Government also seeks to assist those who are able to work but whose efforts to gain
employment have been negatively affected by prevailing economic conditions including the
recent shocks to tourism and related sectors of the economy and pre-existing rigidities in the
labor market which have tended to depress job creation. Ameliorating high unemployment is
seen as a major priority not only because of the poverty implications for the unemployed and
their families, but also because of the strong correlation between unemployment and rising social
tensions, including crime and violence, especially in urban inner-city areas.
36.   At the same time, the lack of adequate basic and social services in poor areas has also
certainly contributed to civil disturbance in the past, especially within the inner cities. In this
context, the Government has established the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) as an
umbrella fund to provide needed infrastructure as well as employment opportunities for skilled
and semi-skilled workers in poor communities. Specific projects funded by JSIF are identified
via a participatory process involving community-based organizations and civic leaders. Recent
evaluations of JSIF sub-projects indicated that while the poor are indeed being reached, further
improvement can/should be achieved via improved targeting criteria -- including employment-
creation as an explicit factor in project selection -- and better coordination with line ministries to
ensure appropriate operation and maintenance following construction. As part of its emergency
recovery program, the Government, with support from international partners, is taking action to
address these identified concerns while also expanding the program to focus more aggressively
on inner-cities in addition to the poor rural areas which have received greater assistance in the
past.
37.  In parallel with expanding the JSIF as a key means of both improving services in poor
communities and increasing temporary employment opportunities for the local labor force, the
Government is also committed to continuing to address the key labor market structural issues -
including high informalization, outdated restrictions on working hours, rigid wage-setting
mechanisms, harsh and frequent labor conflicts and long settlement periods for dispute
resolution. These characteristics exacerbate the country's persistently high unemployment rates
(around 16 percent of the workforce) by encouraging employers to select more capital-intensive
technologies than warranted by Jamaica's underlying factor endowments. Efforts to address
these issues were begun in GOJ FY96/97 with the establishment of a Committee on Labor
Market Reforms. In the years since the Committee developed its recommendations, some
progress has been made in averting work stoppages via the establishment of social pacts in
selected sectors such as the banana and bauxite industries. Additionally, a Pre-Conciliation Unit
was established in the Ministry of Labor which has shown some success in reducing work
stoppages.  As part of this ongoing effort to address labor market structural issues, the
16



Government, following an extensive consultation process with unions, industry representatives
and civil society leaders (including church leaders) is moving forward with the next stage of its
reform agenda. This includes moving to a more flexible work week and specific amendments to
the Labor Relations and Industrial Relations Act, inter alia, to (i) widen the definition of
"worker" to cover contract workers; (ii) accord workers the right not to join unions; (iii) to make
provision for bargaining in good faith; and (iv) strengthen the authority of the Industrial Disputes
Tribunal.
38.   Maintaining Core Investment in Human Development. Besides protecting incomes
to the extent feasible, the Government's emergency economic rehabilitation program places high
priority on continued progress in human development, an area in which Jamaica has achieved
much over the past decades. Overall, social indicators for Jamaica are better than the regional
averages, reflecting the Government's sustained commitment to, and investments in, health,
education and safe water. In view of the fact that over half of Government expenditures
(excluding interest payments on the debt) are devoted to health and education, some savings in
these sectors will have to be sought as part of the effort to maintain a viable fiscal framework
despite recent shocks. Such savings will be chiefly achieved through acceleration of the
implementation of the improved efficiency measures in health and education which focus on
decentralization, rationalization of staffing and cessation of non-core activities (e.g., transport,
feeding programs and the like). However, to ensure that progress towards fundamental sectoral
goals remains on track, the Government will guarantee that real expenditures on basic health
programs - immunization and key maternal and child health programs - and on non-salary
expenditures for basic education (primary and lower secondary) are maintained at least at
FYOO/ I levels in real terms.
39.   Moreover, the Government intends to carry forward its plans for major new activities in
each of these sectors, including: (i) the launching of a major new initiative to prevent the spread
of HIV/AIDS - a disease which, if unchecked, is poised to spread rapidly throughout the
Jamaican population, potentially jeopardizing overall development goals; and (ii) the
universalization of upper secondary education by 2007. These goals are important not only as
core elements of future economic growth but also as important aspects of addressing the critical
issue of youth-at-risk which has been at the root of many of the social tensions (crime, violence
and the spread of drugs) threatening Jamaica as well as neighboring Caribbean economies.
40.   Facilitating a Rebound in Tourism. As noted in the preceding section (para. 9) the
vulnerability of the Jamaican economy to the September 11 shock was exacerbated by the
country's high dependence on the US, especially North-Eastern US, for over 70 percent of its
tourist arrivals. In looking to the future, the Government recognizes that a more diversified
tourist base would reduce volatility in the sector, helping to dampen the potential negative
impact of any future shocks affecting travel and tourism. To this end, the Government, in
cooperation with the Jamaican tourist industry, expects to launch a major promotional campaign
in traditional and non-traditional markets to help promote Jamaica's image as a safe and
hospitable destination for visitors from North America, Europe and Latin America.  The
campaign would complement a planned CARICOM initiative to promote tourism to the
Caribbean region as a whole.
17



41.   Along with this effort to promote tourism, the Government will take immediate steps to
improve and modernize security screening and related arrangements at the country's two main
international airports in Kingston and Montego Bay with a view to ensuring both passenger
safety and quicker processing of passengers. While thus attempting to support the efforts of the
tourism industry to attract additional visitors to Jamaica, the Government will also begin to phase
out a scheme put in place for hotels in the aftermath of September 11 to enable fully tax
compliant hotels and related establishments to defer payment of payroll taxes without penalty on
a case by case basis. Although the sums involved are not large, the Government recognizes that
even these small exceptions could ultimately undermine efforts to improve tax administration
and eliminate loopholes and is currently in the process of defining better the conditions under
which the scheme will be phased out.
42.   Mitigating the Impact of Natural Disasters. Recognizing that disaster preparedness
can have a substantial role in mitigating the adverse impact of natural disasters on individual
households and businesses, the Government has established an Office of Disaster Preparedness
and Emergency Management with assistance from the US Government as well as some UN
agencies. Under the aegis of this Office, a medium-term plan to identify vulnerable areas and
relocate communities living there is currently being formulated. Inter alia, the exercise will
involve hazard mapping in the areas surrounding each of Jamaica's five main rivers and all other
communities that are known to be prone to flooding. In the long run, it is intended that hazard
mapping will become an integral part of development planning, building on the experience of an
integrated hazard mapping/development planning pilot which has recently been put in place in
the Montego Bay area. Support for continuation and acceleration of the hazard mapping
program is a key element of the Government's Emergency Recovery Program as is the
rebuilding of infrastructure and provision of other assistance to communities affected by the
flooding in the Portland area as a result of the heavy rainfall related to Hurricane Michelle in
early November, 2001.
B.    Governance, Efficiency and Accountability
43.  Improving Public Sector Management.  The Jamaican public sector functions
satisfactorily in a number of respects relative to many countries in the Latin America and
Caribbean Region. However, the Government remains strongly committed to making further
improvements, seeking external assistance (including from the Bank via the Public Sector
Modernization Project, Loan No. 40830) where appropriate. Over the past four or so years, the
GOJ has registered a number of achievements in rationalizing the public sector in line with the
needs of a modern economy, including, especially, privatization of most large public enterprises.
44.  In the past 1-2 years, attention has been focused on remaining (generally smaller) public
entities within the framework of the Government's public sector restructuring program. As a
result of a recent DFID-assisted review of these entities, an action plan has been prepared for
implementation over the next 2 years to address issues relating to about 50 of these entities via
internal reorganization (32), mergers and transfers (6), privatization (6), and closure (8).
Progress in the implementation of the action plan has been adequate but the Government intends
to accelerate the process over the next year. In parallel, the Government is moving forward with
efforts to increase the accountability and transparency in the functioning of remaining public
18



enterprises and other public entities. To this end, new legislation has been passed in Parliament
- the Public Bodies Management and Accountability Act. Apart from its objectives of
improving the transparency and accountability of public entities, passage of the Act and
enforcement of its provisions is an especially high priority at present, given the Government's
efforts to maintain strict fiscal discipline throughout the public sector.
45.   Another, related, area which remains high on the Government's agenda is increasing the
efficiency of infrastructure assets, focusing initially on increased private participation in the
management of airports and ports. To this end, the Government has completed a tender for
private management of Montego Bay's Sangster International Airport and shortly expects to
complete negotiations with the preferred bidder. The tendering process for private management
of Kingston Port has also already been completed and a preferred bidder selected. Over the
medium term, the Government is expected to extend the private management model to airports
and ports, including Kingston's Norman Manley Airport and Montego Port. Moreover, it is
studying the feasibility of private management of water utilities for major metropolitan areas. At
the same time, recognizing the need for improved regulatory capacity to monitor increased
private participation in utilities and airports, the Government is moving forward with a program
of measures/actions to strengthen the Civil Aviation Authority and the Office of Utility
Regulation.
46.   Finally, as part of Jamaica's public sector modernization efforts, the Government intends
to move forward on further improvements to the public systems of expenditure control and
reporting and procurement, in line with the recommendations of the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment carried out in cooperation
with the Bank in fiscal year 2001.  While both reviews found that the GOJ has an adequate
foundation of transparency and accountability, action plans were agreed to further ensure the
transparent handling of domestic and international resources.  In the area of financial
management, the principal challenges to be addressed include the need for an eventual shift to
accrual accounting for Government operations and the replacement of outdated hardware and
software for integrated financial management. Moreover, there is a need to strengthen the audit
function, which though generally assessed to be independent and fair has been less than fully
effective due to a lack of adequate resources and continued reliance on outdated manual systems
of audit. The Government attaches high priority to addressing this set of issues and has already
begun to remedy identified deficiencies.
47.   Similar progress has been made in addressing some of the key deficiencies identified in
the procurement area.  Specifically, the Government intends to replace competing and
overlapping procurement legislation with a single legal and institutional framework governing all
public procurement.  Apart from establishing  clear rules and responsibilities for public
procurement, the new framework would, inter alia, improve safeguards the rights of suppliers
and contractors, promote greater competition by reducing reliance on approved lists of
contractors, decentralize contract award referrals from Cabinet to the National Contract
Commission (NCC) and increase implementing agencies' authority to approve contract awards,
and establish an independent appeals system and body. A policy paper outlining specific
changes in each of these and related areas has recently been approved by Cabinet. In parallel, a
' 19



practical handbook detailing procurement requirements and procedures has been completed by
the NCC and is currently being disseminated to all Government agencies and entities.
48.   Further Improving Financial Sector Transparency. Among Caribbean countries,
Jamaica was one of the first to comprehensively address the question of money-laundering with
the passage by Parliament of the Money Laundering Act in 1996. Supporting regulations were
issued in 1997 and Guidance Notes defining minimum standards required of an effective
program to detect money laundering were issued in July 2000. These notes, which are being
periodically updated, are comprehensive and set out policies and procedures as required under
legislation. Jamaica is also a member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF)
which recently undertook an evaluation assisted in part by: (i) the Bank's recent Bank
Restructuring and Debt Management Program Adjustment Loan (BRDP); (ii) the IDB's
Financial Sector Restructuring Loan; and (iii) the IMF-led independent team that assessed
Jamaica's compliance with the Basel core principles.
49.  In addition to these measures on improving transparency, the Government of Jamaica is
undertaking a comprehensive set of actions aimed at resolving the financial sector crisis that
occurred in the mid-1990s and strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework of the
financial sector. These efforts are being supported by the Bank through a series of two
programmatic adjustment loans of $75 million each, the first of which was approved in
November 2000. The second loan is currently under preparation. The IDB has also supported
these efforts through a two-tranche loan of $150 million, the first tranche of which was disbursed
in September 2000. The set of measures being taken by the Government include resolution of
intervened financial institutions, strengthening of the legal, supervisory, and regulatory
framework for banks and non-bank financial institutions, and improving the environment for
restarting bank lending to the private sector. Substantial progress has been made by the
Government to date. Concrete actions aimed at restructuring the liabilities arising as a result of
the Governrnent's intervention in the financial sector as well as the sale of one large financial
institution was supported by the Bank's first Bank Restructuring and Debt Management Program
Adjustment Loan (BRDP, Report No. P7397 JM). Further actions in resolving the remaining
intervened institutions as well as further improving the regulatory and supervisory framework
will be supported by the Bank's proposed BRDP II.  It is expected that upon the completion of
the actions envisaged under the two BRDP loans as well as actions being taken to address
money-laundering and financial crimes under the proposed emergency loan, Jamaica's financial
sector will be significantly strengthened, will operate under a regulatory and supervisory
framework that is broadly in line with internationally accepted standards, and that the financial
sector's vulnerability to future crises-will be reduced.
IV. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.   Loan Objectives and Description
50.   The proposed emergency ERL supports the Government's efforts to maintain a sound
macroeconomic program and continue its progress towards achievement of sustainable economic
growth and further poverty reduction in the face of multiple shocks which have impacted the
20



economy, especially the decline in international travel to and tourism in Jamaica following the
events of September 11, 2001. The proposed loan would support the Government's program
described in the preceding section. Specifically it would bridge part of the fiscal gap generated
by the shocks, help to maintain spending in key social programs and rebuild damaged
infrastructure, support private sector-led tourism and related economic activities and improve
overall governance in the country.
Link to the Country Assistance Strategy
51.   The latest Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Jamaica (R2000-200) covering Bank
fiscal years 2001-2002 was discussed by the Board on November 30, 2000. It was prepared
following the resumption of an intensive policy dialogue with the Bank and other multilateral
agencies and in response to the GOJ's strengthened macroeconomic and structural policy stance,
notably through fiscal tightening and by devising a strategy to address remaining financial sector
problems and to tackle the mounting public debt burden. The shorter-than-usual coverage of the
CAS period was intended to enable a broadening and deepening of in-country consultations and
further study and analysis of Jamaica's needs in order to maximize the effectiveness of Bank
assistance following several years of limited policy dialogue and no Bank lending. Since
presentation of the CAS, the Bank has approved operations totaling US$115 million for Bank
Restructuring and Debt Management (which in fact accompanied the CAS) and support to Social
Safety Nets. A project to support the reform of Secondary Education is under preparation.
52.   Given its emergency nature, this ERL operation was, of course, not foreseen in the CAS
but is within the base case lending scenario of US$150 million in adjustment lending to Jamaica.
Moreover, the program supported by the ERL is fully consistent with the objectives of the CAS
as it: retains a key focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring growth to avoid a
reversal of the recent gains in poverty reduction; ensures sustained support for social
expenditures and safety nets in light of multiple economic shocks to foster social cohesion;
supports improvement of critical governance, accountability and transparency functions of the
public sector; and supports strengthening of the framework and environment for private sector
investment and development. The ERL represents one part of a two-prong strategy to help the
GOJ address the impact of the recent shocks. In parallel, the Bank is preparing on a fast track
basis a National Community Development Project which will support employment creation and
provide urgent infrastructure works focused on those urban and rural poor directly or indirectly
affected by the decline in tourism and recent flooding.
53.   The second Bank Restructuring Loan of US$75 million in support of the GOJ's actions to
strengthen financial intermediation, which had been included in the CAS, is now expected to be
presented to the Board around mid 2002. It would be accompanied by a new CAS or CAS
update which, inter alia, will report on progress under the SMP, developments in the tourism
sector and progress on the agreed future actions planned under this operation.
Coordination with the IMF and Other Donors
54.  IMF and IDB representatives participated in the preparation/appraisal mission for this
operation and close cooperation is expected to continue through implementation of the program.
21



The GOJ and IMF have reviewed and agreed on revised targets under the ongoing Staff
Monitored Program (SMP) which runs until March 2002. The IDB expects to provide a similar
amount of fast-disbursing assistance through modifications and advances of its operations for
social safety nets and the financial sector. It will also be preparing assistance for responding to
the damages from the recent floods from Hurricane Michelle. The Bank is also coordinating
closely with CDB, which has agreed to provide support of about US$25 million, complemented
by some co-financing for the small works and employment project being prepared by the Bank in
parallel with this loan. CDB has taken other actions on its portfolio to assist the GOJ.
B.   Loan Amount and Tranching
55.  Jamaica would borrow an amount of US$75 million. The loan would be disbursed in one
tranche upon effectiveness.
C.   Reforms Supported by the ERL
56.   The main elements of the Government's program are set out in the Letter of Development
Policy (to be presented at negotiations) and summarized in the Policy Matrix (Annex I).
57.  Jamaica has completed the following reform actions prior to the presentation of the
proposed loan to the Board:
D Developed and put in place a program for correcting the emerging imbalances (especially
fiscal) resulting from recent shocks as demonstrated by: (i) satisfactory completion and
agreement on revised SMP indicators for 2001/02, including fiscal deficit and primary
surplus targets; and (ii) agreement reached with IMF to negotiate an SMP program for
FY 2002/03.
* Real expenditures on immunization and key maternal and infant/child health programs
maintained at least at 2000/01 levels.
* HIV/AIDS strategy and work plan approved by Cabinet.
- Maintain non-salary recurrent expenditures for basic education (including early
childhood education) at 2000/01 levels in real terms.
* All public sector secondary schools to have commenced distributing core textbooks to
students in grades 7 to 9, including those who have not paid rental fees.
* Completed action plan for a tourism promotion strategy aimed at: (a) diversifying and
expanding client base in North America and Europe; and (b) complementing Caribbean
Tourist Organization-led initiative for tourism promotion to the Caribbean.
* Prepared a fully-funded plan for improved airport security at the two main international
airports.
* The Public Bodies Management and Accountability Act 2001 passed by Parliament.
* Completed implementation of key recommendations referred to in the CFAA prepared by
the World Bank including: (i) introduction of accrual accounting for financial reporting in
8 executive agencies; (ii) transfer of the Financial Management Information System
(FMIS) to Fiscal Services Limited; (iii) upgrading of budget information system (JABIS)
to improve budgetary format and reporting; (iv) strengthening of Internal Audit of
Central Government through provision of training, IT equipment, standardized working
22



papers and quarterly reviews; (v) establishment of five audit committees in five
ministries, including Industry, Commerce and Technology; Finance and Planning;
Agriculture; Education, Youth and Culture; and Transportation and Works; and (vi)
strengthening the capability of the Auditor General to conduct computer assisted audits,
called ACL.
*  Policy paper on public sector procurement approved by Cabinet.
*  Initiated introduction of legislative amendments needed to Jamaica's statutes in order to
address tax evasion and the financing of terrorist activities in compliance with United
Nations Security Council Resolutions 1373 and 1377, as committed by the Prime
Minister to the UN Security Council, through completion of legislative review by the
Attorney General's Department.
*  Financial Crimes Unit (FCU) to investigate and prosecute money-laundering offences
established and adequately resourced.
D.   Implementation Arrangements
58.   The Borrower would be the GOJ represented by the Ministry of Finance and Planning
(MoFP). The Financial Secretary (FS), reporting directly to the Minister of Finance and
Planning, will be responsible for all activities required for the implementation of the proposed
loan. A project coordinator and support staff under the FS would provide the required support.
The proposed arrangement was reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.  Project
implementation is expected to be completed by the end of June 2002.
59.   Disbursements and Financial Management. Disbursement arrangements will follow
the Bank's standard simplified procedures for structural adjustment loans. The proceeds of the
loan will be disbursed against satisfactory achievement and implementation of the reform actions
prior to Board presentation. Upon Board approval, the GOJ will be required to open and
maintain a Deposit Account in its Central Bank. Upon tranche release, the borrower will submit
a simplified withdrawal application against which the Bank will disburse the loan proceeds into
the Deposit Account.
60.   Audits. Financial and technical audits will be required within six months following the
release of the single tranche disbursement. The objective of the audits is to report to the GOJ
and the Bank on the eligibility of expenditures and confirmation of compliance with the tranche
release conditions. The auditors will be appointed and paid by the GOJ. The auditors must also
be acceptable to the Bank and their terms of reference cleared by the Bank. The audits will
comply with the standards for special audits as defined by International Standards of Auditing
issued by the International Federation of Accountants. The GOJ will provide the auditors with
the background documentation necessary for an appropriate understanding of the objectives of
the loan, a description of the systems, procedures and documents used to ensure that Bank
requirements are met, and receipt and payment documentation summarizing the transactions of
the Deposit Account through the duration of the loan.
23



E.    Environmental and Social Aspects
61.   No major environmental or social issues are foreseen under the project. No issues related
to social safeguards apply to this project.
F.    Risks
62.   The reform program and the strategy it supports face three principal risks that could lead
to lower economic growth and, consequently, a reversal of the recent gains in poverty reduction.
The first two fall in the category of exogenous shocks, while the last one relates to a risk of
policy slippage.
63.   The first risk would be a resumption of social unrest and violence as occurred during July
200 1. The sources of such tension remain but the Government has had success in strengthening
security arrangements while introducing and expanding social and employment programs which
have helped to provide a productive outlet for a significant, young and largely unskilled labor
pool. Increased and sustained unemployment could exacerbate social pressures and the risks of
violence. Any future rounds of violence and their impact on Jamaica's international image
would depress the country's tourism prospects further. This could well result in a vicious cycle
of unrest and tourism decline, placing the growth role of tourism in the economy in jeopardy.
64.   Similarly, the second and interrelated risk would be the occurrence of an event or events
which would again significantly depress international travel, especially from North America
which accounts for the bulk of Jamaica's tourist arrivals. While there is little the Government
can do to directly address this risk, the reform program and Bank financial support will assist the
GOJ in tackling key issues such as improvement of airport and domestic security, diversification
and promotional campaigns to increase Jamaica's tourism market share, and, importantly, the
need to guarantee adequate government resources directed to social services and jobs creation for
works directly impacting the lives of the poor.
65.   Such additional shocks could lead to a low or no growth scenario and a worsening of
Jamaica's adverse debt dynamics. Given the already high primary fiscal surplus and limited
scope for further fiscal tightening, the Government could face serious difficulties in maintaining
macroeconomic stability without seeking enhanced support from the IFIs.
66.   The last foreseeable risk concerns the pressures that could be placed on the GOJ for
additional spending and/or policy slippage given that elections are expected in 2002. Thus far
GOJ has demonstrably resisted such pressures as evidenced by its disciplined fiscal stance over
the past one to two years, resulting in a 12 percent primary surplus in 2000/1. This performance
combined with statements made by senior policymakers following the September 11 economic

Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Letter of Development Policy
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn
The Government of Jamaica has made considerable progress in stabilising the economy over the last
three years. This was reflected in the strong effort in fiscal year 2000/01 which resulted in the
stabilisation of debt/GDP ratios, a resumption of growth and increased confidence in the Jamaican
economy by domestic and international investors. Macro-economic developments up to September
2001 were consistent with the achievement of more rapid growth in GDP, an improving fiscal
operation and an easing of monetary conditions. Satisfactory progress was made in the calendar year
through September.
The strong fiscal effort has been accompanied by prudent monetary policy which has led to the
maintenance of single digit inflation and facilitated an orderly adjustment of the exchange rate.
Public Sector reform has continued and there has been further restructuring of the financial sector.
The Govetnment's economic programnme which is being monitored by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) staff has therefore successfully met its targets through to September 2001. The
Government intends to continue these sound macroeconomic policies.
The consequences of the terrorist attacks on the United States of America have adversely affected
Jamaica's tourist industry. Tourism is the country's major foreign exchange earner, makes a
significant contribution to employment and grew by over six percent in 2000/01.  Its inter-sectoral
linkages with agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, entertainment and other sectors make
27



ANNEX 1
Jamaica's tourism a most critical industry. Recent flood rains associated with Hurricane Michelle in
November 2001 in areas which are involved primarily in eco-tourism and agricultural production
have served to exacerbate the situation. Preliminary estimates put the damage at close to J$3B. The
flood damage, in addition to the September attack, is projected to reduce tourism earnings by
US$300M.
Consequent on this, the Government has embarked on an overall recovery and rehabilitation plan
which will put the economic programme back on track. In support of this, the Government
requests funding for an Emergency Economic Rehabilitation Loan of US$75M from the World
Bank.
In support of this request, this letter describes the macroeconomic policy framework and the
initiatives which the Government intends to take as part of the economic rehabilitation programme.
The loan is intended to be used for fiscal support, enabling continued spending in critical areas.
This will assist in the improvement of the tourism product, the diversification and expansion of the
tourism market, and the rehabilitation of infrastructure to pre-flood levels, which will contribute to
economic growth and generate employment. It will also help in enhancing protection for the poor
and vulnerable, who will be adversely affected by the recent shocks to the economy. It will also
enhance security at the points of entry to the island.
Macroeconomic Developments
For the calendar year to September 2001, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have
been 3.4 per cent higher than the corresponding period of 2000. However, the outlook for the
remainder of the Calendar Year 2001 and Fiscal Year (FY) 2001/02 will be negatively affected by
three shocks: the events of September 11 in the United States of America, the flood rains in
November and the violence in west Kingston. These shocks have occurred within the context of a
slowdown in the US and the world economy.
The major impact has been on the tourism sector. Tourism accounts for just under 14% of GDP
and is totally integrated in the economy with linkages to agriculture, manufacturing, distribution,
entertainment and transportation. In addition, the flood rains have impacted adversely on the
prospects for domestic and export agriculture as well as on physical infrastructure. These factors
have reduced growth prospects, as well as negatively affected fiscal, monetary and balance of
payment targets for the year.
In an attempt to minimize the impact of these shocks on the long term prospects for growth in the
economy, the Government has implemented a number of measures. These measures are aimed at
ensuring that its economic program gets back on track while ensuring that there will be some
measure of protection for the most vulnerable groups. Projections indicate that real GDP should
fall by between 1.0 per cent and 2.2 per cent in the final quarter of the calendar year, compared with
the similar period in 2000. Real GDP growth for 2001 is projected to be in the region of 2.0 percent
- 2.5 percent. For FY2001/02, the projected growth is 1.5 percent.
In order to correct the imbalances that have arisen and regain the momentum achieved under the
Staff Monitored Program (SMP) , the Government has taken action to reduce the passive fiscal
deficit from over 5% of GDP to 4.1% of GDP. This will be achieved by a reduction in capital and
28



ANNEX 1
recurrent expenditures, additional revenue enhancement measures and dividend payments from
public enterprises reflecting in part lower oil prices. The primary surplus target will only be reduced
by 0.8 percent of GDP to around 10 percent.
External borrowings limit under the SMP will be increased by US$50m to reflect plans for
Registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission but it is agreed that we
may approach the market to finance some of next year's budgetary requirements if market
conditions permit. All other targets under the SMP remain unchanged. The achievement of the
targets set under the modified SMP will imply that the public debt to GDP ratio will nevertheless
decline. We intend to maintain this decline as Central Government guarantees (contingent
liabilities) on the borrowings of third parties will be limited. The Government is also committed to
the adoption of any additional measures to achieve the targets under the SMP.
The Government has also requested the Fund to monitor its economic program under a new SMP
for 2002/03. In this regard, the Government plans a reduction in the Central Government fiscal
deficit of approximately 1% of GDP in 2002/03 to 3% of GDP and an inflation of 5-6 % while
maintaining the 2001/02 level of Net International Reserves.
Social Protection and Human Development
Sustained investment in human capital has resulted in Jamaica's achievement of high social
indicatots. Despite the fiscal pressures, the Government is committed to the protection of the
vulnerable in society. The Government has recently completed negotiations with the IADB and the
IBRI) for the imnplementation of programs designed to restructure existing programmes for the
poorest. In response to the shocks, the IDB has just approved an enhanced social safety net loan
totaling US$60 million. With additional support from the World Bank, the Government will further
enhance the programme.
The shocks have affected persons who are of extremely low income such as subsistence farmers in
the flood-prone areas and workers in the tourist-related entities. This fall out in employment comes
in the context of an already high unemployment rate concentrated among youth and young adults.
In an effort to ensure that the loss of unemployment caused by the three shocks to the economy will
not exacerbate preexisting social tensions, the Government has embarked on implementation of the
following programmes:
1.      A Public Works Program estimated to cost J)$11Om.
2.       The modification of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund USIF) to include employment
generation as an explicit additional criterion for project selection.
3.       Work to rehabilitate the infrastructure damaged by the flood rains will also generate
employment in the affected areas.
The emergency recovery program will also continue to accord high priority to expenditures in
health, education and potable water in order to ensure that gains that have been made in
immunization, key maternal and child health programs and in basic education at the primary and
lower secondary education levels are maintained. The Government gives its commitment to the
maintenance of real expenditures for the current and next fiscal years at the FY 2000/01 levels for
maternal and child health programmes and on non-salary expenditures in basic education, i.e.
primary and junior secondary levels.
29



ANNEX 1
The Government recognises that the disease of HIV/AIDS if left unchecked, could spread rapidly
throughout the population and so impact on overall developmental goals. The Government has
therefore developed, with the assistance of the World Bank a major new initiative to prevent the
spread of the dreaded disease.
Under the ROSE II program which is currently being developed, (also in cooperation with the
World Bank) the Government will seek to provide universal secondary education by 2007. This is
in recognition that education is a core element in future economic growth and will help to address
the problems associated with youth unemployment, such as crime, violence and drugs. Further, most
schools have commenced the distribution of books to all students who have not been able to pay
for the rental fees for such books.
The Government intends to continue to improve on its efforts to provide better income protection
of the structurally poor, improve school and clinic attendance and increase employment
opportunities for unskilled workers. In addition, the health indicators will be maintained, and the
education campaign to increase public awareness of HIV/AIDS will be intensified. In this regard
adequate funding will be provided for these programmes over the medium term.
Tourism
Continued downturn in the economies of the major tourist markets worldwide presents a
formidable challenge to Jamaica. The tragedy of September 11 has further exacerbated an unstable
travel environment. This is reflected in a forecast of a decline of about 20 percent in visitor arrivals
for the 2001/02 winter season.
In order to reposition the tourist industry on a path of growth and development, significant
work will be required in improving the product, and in this regard, the Government has developed a
tourism action plan.  This will involve minimising incidents of harassment, improving waste
management and rehabilitating infrastructure to pre-flood levels. There will also be additional focus
on areas which offer eco-tourism in order to attract additional visitors who are interested in this
aspect of the market.  In addition, Jamaica proposes to launch a major marketing campaign in
traditional and non-traditional areas in order to promote Jamaica's image as a safe and hospitable
destination for visitors from Europe, North American & Latin America.
To ensure that security at airports and ports complies fully with newly strengthened
international standards, the Government will also take steps to improve security screening at the
Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston and the Sangster International Airport in
Montego Bay to ensure passenger safety and the swift processing of passengers. This will involve
the acquisition of more sophisticated X-ray equipment, and enhanced staff training.
Disaster Mitigation
The Government is aware that disaster preparedness is critical if successful mitigation of the
adverse impact of natural disasters is to be minimized.  Consequently, the Government has
improved the capability of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management to
develop a medium term plan which will identify vulnerable areas and a plan to relocate the
population which resides in flood prone areas. This exercise will involve hazard mapping in the
30



ANNEX I
areas surrounding Jamaica's five main rivers and flood prone communities.  Support for hazard
mapping is a critical element of the Government's emergency rehabilitation program. The
Government has commenced rebuilding the infrastructure in the recently affected areas in the
eastern end of the island and has sought assistance from ECLAC to assess the overall damage.
Governance, Efficiency and Accountability
The Government remains strongly committed to making further improvements in public sector
management. As part of the continued effort to improve efficiency an action plan has been
prepared for implementation over the next two years to address issues relating to fifty public sector
entities. Under this plan, thirty-two of these entities will be subject to internal re-organisation, six
will be merged to existing activities or transferred back to central government and eight will be
closed. The Government intends to accelerate the process over the next two years.   The
maintenance of strict fiscal discipline throughout the public sector is also being given high priority.
Consequently the Public Bodies Management and Accountability Act has been tabled in Parliament.
This Act will provide the legal framework within which accountability and transparency of the
remaining public enterprises will be enhanced. The Act has been passed by the Lower House and
passage is expected by the Upper House before Parliament recesses for the Christmas period.
In order to increase efficiency in some areas the Government has decided to invite private
participation in the management of one of the two international airports and the Kingston port.
The management of Sangster International Airport was put to tender and negotiations have
commenced with the preferred bidder. The tendering process for the management of the port of
Kingston was completed and a preferred bidder selected. Over the medium term the feasibility of
the private management of other facilities and utilities will be studied. However, before the program
can be expanded the existing regulatory authority has to be strengthened in order to improve its
capacity to mnonitor increased private sector participation in these facilities. In this regard action is
being taken to strengthen the Office of Utility Regulation and the Civil Aviation Authority.
In addition, the Government intends to continue to improve its public sector systems of
expenditure control and reporting and procurement in line with the recommendations of the
Country Financial Accountability Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment carried out
with the support of the Bank in fiscal year 2001. The Government has approved a Procurement
Policy which will be adopted throughout the central government. While the present system is
transparent, it will be enhanced by the implementation of an action plan as enunciated in the
recently designed Handbook on Procurement
Improving Financial Sector Transparency
The Government is committed to strengthening the financial sector, imptoving financial
intermediation and increasing effectiveness in tackling money laundering. As part of this, the
Government has embarked on a comprehensive set of financial reforms which includes resolution
of intervened financial institutions, strengthening of the legal, supervisory, and regulatory framework
for banks and non-bank financial institutions and improving the environment for bank lending to
the private sector. This effort is being supported by the World Bank, IDB and CDB.
31



ANNEX 1
Consequent on the fall-out in the financial sector the Government has made further significant
progress in improving the regulatory framework. In its continued effort to address the problem of
money laundering the Government of Jamaica has established the Financial Crimes Unit which will
investigate and prosecute money laundering offences. This Unit is fully staffed and funded.
Finally, the Government of Jamaica, as member of the Security Council, is in full support of the
various United Nations resolutions passed in respect of terrorist activities. In order to give effect to
these resolutions and to address tax evasion and the financing of terrorist activities, a number of
legislative changes are required. The Attorney General's Department has already initiated the review
of the relevant legislation with a view to recommending to Cabinet the required changes.  The
legislative process to facilitate the changes will be completed over the medium term.
Yours sincerely

Cruise Passengers
Cruise arrivals showed gains in the first four months of 2001, negative growth thereafter,
and substantial declines starting with September. Cruise passengers were down 14 percent in
August 2001 compared with August 2000, and 24 percent down in September 2001 (see Table 2).
However, for the year 2001/02, a decrease in passengers of 0.3 percent is projected (actual decline
April-November 2001 was 4.7 percent). This compares with a growth rate in arrivals of 17 percent
in 2000, and the SMP forecast growth rate in 2001/02 of 13.4 percent.
The longer term impact on cruise passengers is not immediately obvious. One view is that
Jamaica may gain from the redirection of cruises from regions that may now be considered more
volatile. Of course, given the very small share of cruise tourists in total tourism earnings, tourism
earnings can only be marginally influenced by such passengers.

The Impact of the Shocks on Workers
At the end of September 2000, there were about 15,731 employees in large tourist establishments
(hotels, rooming houses and lodging places). Given that most hotels are projecting levels of
occupancy ranging between 10-50 percent in the near future, this is likely to have a significant
impact on the levels of employment in the sectors affected by the downturn in the tourism sector
and reduced export demand. Also, the tourist industry directly or indirectly employs 25 percent of
the labor force.
A recent survey shows that in the aftermath of the shocks to the economy, 41 percent of hotels
sampled had made staff redundant and about 26 percent expected to make staff redundant in the
near future 4. Hotels are also resorting to putting staff on rotation and on a 3-4 day work week'5.
In the manufacturing sector the employment situation varied in the companies sampled. A coffee
company laid off 67 percent of production staff for 3-4 weeks, while a pharmaceutical company cut
employment by 25 percent. A company in the chemicals industry resorted to redeployment and
another manufacturing plastic containers to shorter production shifts.16
4 Survey carried out by the Jamaica Tourist Board in November 2001.
15 One hotel in Montego Bay made about 24 percent of its 380 staff redundant, and the rest were put from a 6 day week
to a 5 day week and finally onto a 3-4 day week.
16 Survey carried out by the Jamaica Manufacturers' Association in November 2001.

ANNEX 3
Also, according to the above survey of manufacturing companies, there has been a contraction in
demand for durables such as furniture. As a result, production has declined by 40 percent in the
furniture companies sampled.
Hence, while measures are being taken to mitigate the impact on workers, the overall impact on the
workforce has been significant.

ANNEX 5
METHODOLOGICAL NOTE: DISAGGREGATING THE SEPTEMBER 11 IMPACT
A first look at the economic evolution in the first half of 2001 reveals that all major sectors of the
Jamaican economy registered significant growth in activity. In the tourism sector, total visitor
arrivals were 2.5% higher than in the same period of the previous year, and earnings were US$18
million higher according to the PIOJ. In particular, the agriculture, mining, and transportation
sectors were poised for growth until June 2001. Overall, the Jamaican economy was pretty much in
line with the objectives set in the SMP, in particular the requirements to accelerate GDP growth
from 0.8% in 2000 to a sustained 2-4% p.a., maintain a stable real exchange rate to protect export
earnings, limit the external current account deficit to approximately US$450 million and increase
Net International Reserves by US$100 million. These favorable prospects were however disturbed
by the social unrest of July 2001, after which economic activity started to decline, most noticeably
in the tourism and manufacturing sectors.
A pertinent question to ask therefore, is whether the slowdown registered in Jamaica's major
economic indicators is not just a perpetuation of this downward trend already present before
September 1 1 . A major difficulty in analyzing this questions lies in the very limited data set
available to (i) fully understand the impact of the terrorist attacks so far, and (ii) build time-series to
perform a regression analysis to assess the impact of the terrorist attacks. To overcome these
difficulties, the Bank of Jamaica has developed a simple model which disaggregates the various
elements of the current economic trend and tries to provides some preliminary answers to the
impact issue.
The BOJ model is based on a linear extrapolation of all balance of payment items on a monthly
basis until end of the Jamaican fiscal year 2002 (i.e, 31 March 2002). Three types of trends are
considered: (i) the trend reflected in the SMP, (ii) the trend observed from April 1st to September
10, 2001, and (iii) the trend after September 11. The total variation of the year-end figures in
relation to the SMP estimates is then broken down accordingly:
(Y3 - Yo)    =     (Y1 - Yo)    + (Y2 - Y1)  + (Y3 - Y2)
with
Yo = Target agreed in SMP for fiscal year 2002
Y, = Estimated year-end value using SMP trend and after actualization of base figure
Y2 = Estimated year-end value using trend from April to August 2001
Y3 = Estimated year-end value using trend after September 11, 2001
The first term in the equation (Y3 - Yo) represents the total deviation of the year-end values from
the SMP figures. This change is decomposed in the variation due to changes in the SMP base (Y1 -
YO), the variance due to existing trend from April to August 2001 (Y2 - YI), and the variation due to
the trend observed after the terrorist attacks (Y3 - Y2), or in other words the isolated effect of
September I 1.
Applied to the recent evolution of tourism income, for instance, the model suggests that the terrorist
attacks will lead to an overall decline of US$195.6 million in total revenues in comparison to the
previous year. "Other" events such as an unanticipated slowdown in the world economy will lead
to a decline of US$90 million. In the model's decomposition, the impact of the September 11
events reduces the number of non-national visitors by 11.3%, compared with a total decline of
16.4%. In contrast, the terrorist attacks seem to have had a positive impact on the number of cruise
45



ANNEX 5
ship passengers (+2.7%), probably because of the increased risks perceived in association with air
travel.
Other interesting insights of the model relate to alumina exports and net factor income from abroad.
First, the model suggests that while alumina exports are projected to decrease in 2001/02, this is just
a continuation of the pre-September trend. By contrast, the September 11 events are significant
linked to the reduction in imports of fuel and consumer goods.
Although most of these results look very plausible, they are based on a simple linear extrapolation
of the very limited data set available since September 11. As such, the results can be subject to
large degrees of error if there is a change in the linear trend.
