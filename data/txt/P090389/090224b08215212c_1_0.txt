                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The World Bank team visited Kiev during the week of October 21 to 25th, 2013, to monitor the developments, review results indicators, and clarify the next steps on project
                         implementation. This followed an amendment to the Loan Agreement (LA), to include new covenants linked to progress in implementing the Public Financial Management System
                         (PFMS) implementation (Part 2.c in Schedule 1 of the LA) (April 5, 2013). Between April and October the Government satisfied the first of the three covenants in the Loan
                         Agreement, by initiating the bidding process (ICB-4) for the development of the PFMS solution. Despite the recent progress made in implementing agreed actions the overall project
                         performance was maintained as marginally unsatisfactory, taking account of the high level of risks and the many further actions that need to be taken to ensure a successful outcome.
