Amount:            US$7.6 million (including capitalized front-end fee)
Terms:             Seventeen years including four years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:   The Borrower would relend up to an estimated $7.3 million
to Devlet Yatirim Bankasi (DYB) on the same terms as the
Bank loan. DYB would onlend the equivalent of about
$3.0 million to TKI, $2.4 million to Sumerbank and
$1.0 million to TCDD-ADVAS, all for periods of seventeen
years including four years of grace, at an interest rate
equal to the Bank's standard variable rate plus an
administration fee of 0.5 percent. The beneficiaries would
bear the full foreign exchange risk. Allocation of about
$0.9 million would be decided later by agreement between
the Borrower, DYB and the Bank.
Project            This is a pilot project aimed principally at assisting
Description:       selected State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) to improve their
operational efficiency. It provides for the financing of
technical consultancy services in the areas of management
information and control systems, productivity improvement,
manpower planning and training. The project would also
finance the procurement of related equipment for the SEEs
and the training of staff in implementing new systems. The
*                           project would, in addition, finance technical assistance to
the Borrower to strengthen its external debt reporting
system.
Benefits and       The project would enable the selected SEEs to increase the
Risks              efficiency of their operations through the improvement of
specific and critical areas of management. Success of the
project could serve as an example to other SEEs of the
efficiency improvements that can be achieved. The project
would also strengthen the Government's ability to compile
and evaluate external debt data rapidly and accurately.

Benefits and       The main risk the project may face would be a weakening of
Risks:              the Government's resolve to grant greater autonomy to the
(contd.)           SEEs, with a resultant loss of motivation on the part of
the SEEs to improve performance. This risk is considered
small in view of the fact that SEE reform is a major
component of the Government's structural adjustment program.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND dEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT FOR STATE ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a propcsed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$7.6 million to help finance
technical assistance to selected Etate Economic Enterprises for increasing
operational efficiency and to the Covernment for strengthening its external
debt reporting system. The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4
years of grace, with interest at the standard variable rate. The Government
would onlend up to an estimated $7.3 million to Devlet Yatirim Bankasi (DYB -
State Investment Bank) on the same terms as the Bank loan.  The equivalent of
about $3.0 million, $2.4 million and $1.0 million would be relent by DYB to
Turkiye Komur Isletmeleri (TKI), Sumerbank and Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Devlet
Demiryollari-Adapazari Vagon Sanayii Muessesesi (TCDD-ADVAS) respectively, all
for periods of 17 years including 4 years of grace, at an interest rate equal
to the Bank's standard variable rate plus a fee of 0.5 percent. Allocation of
about $0.9 million would be decided later.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report, in addition to analyzing Turkey's
medium-term prospects and overall creditworthiness, presents a synthesis of
earlier special economic reports on aspects of Turkey's adjustment process.
The report of the mission to review the financial system, entitled: "Turkey:
Special Economic Report - Policies for the Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU),
was distributed in September 1983. An economic mission visited Turkey in
January 1984 to review the economic developments of 1983, the 1984 Annual
Program and selected structural adjustment issues. The findings of this
mission are reflected in this section.
3.       Turkey is about as large as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 46 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1540 in
1981. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 45 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
countries.  Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about i8 percent. There is, however,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable worsening in income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings. Educational enrollments have expanded greatly but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.

the Industrial Training Project (P-3660-TU), dated March 5, 1984.

Backcground
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration in the terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the
share of investment in GDP. This was financed initially by workers'
remittances and, following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by
short-term borrowing. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as
the massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in
creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial
production with a rise in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic
inflation had also become an issue of critical importance.
5.       The Turkish authorities' response to the crisis of the late 1970s was
a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. Policies were
adopted to expand exports and increase workers' remittances which, together
with liberalization of imports, encouragement of foreign investment and
prudent external debt management, were aimed at alleviating the balance of
payments constraint and import shortages. On the domestic front, the
objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
four structural adjustment loans so far, involves far-reaching changes in
attitudes, institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which take
time and are difficult to put in place. In view of the severity of the crisis
in 1979, and the urgent need to bring down inflation and stabilize the balance
of payments as quickly as possible, the Government accepted the need for a
temporary sacrifice of growth and social objectives. Major structural changes
were made in the operation of the exchange rate regime, the tax system,
interest rate policy, export strategy, the SEE sector and public investment
policy.
7.       The implementation of the program was carried out by a military
regime which assumed power in September 1980 following a period of sustained
unrest. Subsequently a Consultative Assembly was set up to draft a new
constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed in a nationwide referendum in
November 1982. New election and party laws were then promulgated, and
parliamentary elections completed in November 1983. A new Government assumed
office in December 1983.
The Structural Adjustment Process - 1980-83
8.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual performance met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. By contrast, results in 1983 proved to
be mixed, due in part to adverse economic developments on the external front,
slippages in the monetary program, and Government inertia in the face of
upcoming elections.



9.       Real GNP, after falling for two consecutive years, expanded by
4.2 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982. Crowth was mainly export-led,
with less than one-quarter of the growth in 1982 due to domestic demand.
Demand for consumption increased by 3 percent while fixed investment grew at a
modest 4.1 percent (both in real termis) in 1982, and depletion of inventories
helped to expand supply. Public investment grew at a slower rate than private
investment, thus reversing the trend of previous years. However, unemployment
continued to grow as employment opportunities did not increase fast enough to
absorb the expansion of the labor force. GNP growth slowed down in 1983 to
about 3.2 percent as against the target of 4.8 percent, due in large part to
the effect of adverse weather conditions on agricultural production.
Industrial value added is estimated to have registered a growth of 6.6 percent
as against the program target of 5.5 percent. Total fixed investment
increased by about 4.2 percent. As in the previous two years, private fixed
investment grew faster than public fixed investment (5.7 percent versus
3.2 percent).
10.      The Government has been remarkably successful in reducing the rate of
inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and income policies,
although the downward trend was reversed in 1983. After peaking at
107 percent in 1980, the annual average rate of increase in the wholesale
price index declined to 37 percent in 1981, and around 25 percent in 1982,
which was the program target. In 1983, it rose to 31.4 percent, as against
the program target of 20 percent. The rise was fueled by an expansion of
Central Bank credits to firms and commercial banks in difficulty during the
second half of 1983. The resulting liquidity expansion, in conjunction with a
lowering of nominal deposit interest rates, encouraged consumption at the
expense of savings (consumption increased by 4.2 percent).
11.      Commercial bank interest rates which were deregulated in July 1980
have increased substantially and are now markedly positive in real terms. As
a result, total bank deposits increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and
in 1981 this trend accelerated, with total deposits growing by 104 percent and
time deposits by 263 percent. Growth in deposits slowed somewhat in 1982 and
1983. The bankruptcy in late June 1982 of a major non-bank financial
institution shook depositor confidence and was followed by a shift of funds
into the larger banks. The Government averted an immediate crisis in the
banking sector and undertook actions to reform and strengthen the financial
sector as a whole. A new banking law was enacted in June 1983. It covered
many of the recommendations made by the Bank's report on the financial
sector 1/, including measures to reduce the undercapitlization of banks, place
limits on the real assets and investments of banks, link the establishment of
branches to the level of a bank's equity, reduce the interlocking between
banks and corporations, introduce a deposit insurance scheme and increase the
role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the banking sector. The
Government also took a major step towards reducing the cost of intermediation
and strengthening the inter-bank market by reducing the level of the financial
transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent in December 1983. Separately,
the Government has reduced the level of withholding tax applicable to interest
payments on deposits and bonds from 20 percent to 10 percent.

12.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. The current real interest
rate for non-preferential credits is about 30 percent, and there is
considerable disparity between the cost of preferential and non-preferential
credits. The high interest rates, together with the limited availability of
credit, have led to considerable liquidity problems for the private business
sector, particularly Eor businesses supplying the domestic market. In order
to reduce real interest rates, measures are also needed to lower the operating
costs of banks which are well above prevailing levels in comparable countries,
in addition to a reduction in the inflation rate.
13.      In the fiscal area the most notable feature is a marked retrenchment
of the public sector. The budget deficit to GNP ratio, which stood at
4.6 percent in 1980, decreased to 1.2 percent in 1982, while SEE transfers as
a percentage of GNP showed a steady decline from 4.8 percent in 1980 to
2.8 percent in 1982. The public sector accounts continued to show improvement
in 1983. Although there was a shortfall in tax revenues, this was more than
offset by savings in expenditure, so that the ratio of budgetary deficit to
GNP further declined to about 0.5 percent. Transfers to SEEs as a percentage
of GNP also registered a decline to 2.6 percent in 1983. However, total
profits of SEEs at TL 52 billion were somewhat lower than expected, implying a
slight increase in the ratio of the SEE financing requirement to GNP.
14.      On the external account, the flexible exchange rate policy under
which the Turkish lira has been adjusted daily since May 1981, contributed to
an unprecedented export growth in 1981 to $4.7 billion, or 63 percent higher
in dollar terms than the 1980 level. The increases were concentrated in
manufactured goods (a rise of nearly 120 percent). Product groups with the
largest increases included textiles, clothing, cement, iron and steel, and
non-electrical equipment. Exports in 1982 reached $5.75 billion, about
22 percent above 1981, despite a significant decline in export prices,
particularly for agricultural products. Manufactured exports were the major
source of expansion, as exporters continued to make inroads into markets in
the Middle East. In 1983 exports grew by an estimated 13.6 percent in volume
but their value remained unchanged compared with 1982 at $5.8 billion, because
of a sharp downward movement in export prices.
15.      A new and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange is income earned
from construction contracts in the Middle East and North African countries
(with a gross value of around $12 billion in 1983). These activities are
expected to add to the normal flow of workers' remittances, which remained
strong throughout 1981 but declined in 1982 and 1983, reflecting the
appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis European currencies as well as the
impact of the recession in Western Europe.
16.      The shortfall in earnings from exports and workers' remittances in
1983 was partially offset by a less-than-expected increase in the value of
imports, which reached $9.0 billion as compared to the programmed level of
$9.7 billion. The net result was a substantial increase in the current
account deficit to $1.8 billion in 1983 (3.5 percent of GNP) as against
$1.0 billion in 1982 (1.9 percent of GNP).

The New Economic Program
17.      The new Government announced its economic program in December 1983.
The major structural measures are in line with the objectives contained in the
1980 reform prograun. They are designed to push the structural adjustment
process firmly forward, and to reaffirm the Government's will to pursue
policies designed to open up the economy and reduce distortions. Export
growth and inflation control remain central to the new program. The measures
include:
(i)    a reorganization of the Government's administrative machinery,
including a reduction in the number of ministries and the
simplification of procedures;
(ii)    a substantial import liberalization which eliminates
approximately 78 percent of quantitative restrictions in
trade-weighted value terms, reduces significantly the tariffs on
a large number of items, and imposes a levy on luxury goods
imports aimed at feeding a low cost housing fund;
(iii)    a reaffirmation of the need to export;
(iv)    a substantial liberalization of the foreign exchange regime
through simplification of procedures and freeing of restrictions;
sv)    an interest rate policy designed to provide a real rate of
return thereby encouraging savings, while at the same time
freeing the lendjzg rates set by the commercial banks with the
exception of the rates on certain preferential credits;
(vi)    a major step towards reduction in the inordinately large spread
between deposit and lending rates by lowering the withholding
tax on interest payments from 20 percent to 10 percent and the
financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent; and
CVii)    a reaffirmation that the State Economic Enterprises will, with
some exceptions, be free to set their own prices according to
the requirements of the market.
Medium-term Prospects
18.      Preliminary projections prepared by the recent Bank Economic Mission
indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization program until 1985,
followed by a growth strategy aiming at about 5.5 percent per annum GDP growth
consistent with a manageable balance of payments. 1/ Two basic assumptions on
the sustainability of export growth and on fiscal discipline have guided the
projections. The continued growth of exports is based on the view that the
conditions that made possible the 1981-82 upsurge are not temporary.
1/ The Fifth Five Year Development Plan (1984-88) was postponed by one year
until the new Government took office. According to the present schedule,
the new Fifth Five Year Plan, which will cover the period 1985-89, will be
ready in draft form by mid-1984.



- 6 -
Specifically, the projections assume continuation of a flexible exchange rate
policy, export incentives and import liberalization. They also assume that
the monetary and fiscal policy restraints will not be relaxed to a point that
will revive inflation, thus disrupting the basic shift in development strategy.
19.       The projections of key economic variables for the period 1984-1990
are presented in Table 1. Merchandise exports are projected to continue to
grow at 9 percent in real terms into the late 1980s, with manufactured exports
projected to grow at 11 percent per annum. The scenacio assumes an
improvement in the pace of import liberalization in order to reduce the profit
bias against exports. Merchandise imports are projected to grow by
5 to 6 percent annually in real terms through 1984 and then to pick up to an
average of a little over 7 percent for the 1985-90 period in line with the
growth of demand.

20.       The current account balance, under these assumptions, would show a
deficit for 1984-85 in the $1.6-1.8 billion range. As higher rates of growth
are achieved, the trend would be reversed for the 1985-90 period, and Turkey's
current account deficit would increase again. The terminal year 1990 would
show a deficit of $2.1 billion (1.7 percent of GNP), as compared to a 1985
projected deficit of $1.8 billion (2.6 percent of GNP).

21.      The capital account would remin manageable throughout the projection
period, in line with the need to restrain the growth of debt and maintain a
reasonable debt service ratio. This would permit Turkey to meet the
amortization and interest payments arising from the $9.2 billion of debt
rescheduled between 1978-82 and maintain foreign exchange reserves equivalent
to two months' imports.
22.      The projections indicate a GDP growth of 4 percent per annum for
1982-85 (stabilization period), and a higher figure of 5.4 percent per annum
for 1985-90 (growth period). The achievement of these growth rates will be
necessarily dependent on the growth of the productive sectors, namely
agriculture and manufacturing. Private investment is expected to grow at an
average annual rate of 7.1 percent during 1982-85 and 11 percent during
1985-90. As a corollary, the growth of public investment is expected to slow
down from a high of 7.8 percent per annum in real terms during 1980-82 to a
more moderate 3.3 percent during 1982-85 and eventually to 3.1 percent per
annum for 1985-90. This is consistent with the framework of achieving the
medium-term goal of an approximately equal balance in private and public fixed
investment by 1990.
23.      Turkey's medium-term prospects, which are highly dependent on export
sustainability, are linked partly to exogenous factors such as the world
economic outlook and movements in world prices. For example, if the annual
average export growth during 1985-90 reaches only 7 percent 1J rather than the
assumed 9 percent, it will lead to a ore difficult but manageable balance of
payments situation which may necessitate more external borrowing and may
result in a lower growth rate of imports (between 5-6 percent per annum), as
well as a lower growth path (GDP growth of 4.5 percent per annum) and a higher
debt service ratio (26-27 percent per annum).  Rather than projecting a
stabilization period followed by a return to a normal growth path, this
scenario suggests that lower growth rates will continue throughout the
period.  Under these conditions there would be very little chance of absorbing
the unemployed. However, given the Government's emphasis on export promotion,
there is presently good reason to support the more optimistic scenario
described in paras. 18-22.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
24.      At the end of 1978, Turkey's debt reached $7.5 billion in short-term
debt and $6.8 billion in medium- and long-term debt. Service payment
obligations (mostly on short-term debt) were $5.1 billion   icluding arrears),
or nearly three times the value of merchandise exports in 1977. Between 1978
and 1980, Turkey rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations
through a series of rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and
commercial creditors. Approximately $6.0 billion of short-term debt,
including $2.6 billion in convertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers
credits and $1.2 billion of non-guaranteed suppliers credits, were
consolidated into medium-term loans or partially converted into Turkish lira
obligations.
1/ An average of the 5 percent historical growth rate (1960-1979) achieved
prior to the adoption of an outward-oriented strategy and the 9 percent
growth rate projected in para. 19.



25.      Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from
official sources - major creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank
and the IMF. Of the total debt outstanding of $18 billion at end-1982,
87 percent constituted-medium- and long-term debt. Based on the growth
scenario outlined earlier, debt outstanding and disbursed as a percent of GDP
is projected to fall from 34 percent in 1982 to 31 percent in 1985 and
26 percent in 1990. Short-term debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding
fell from 51 percent in 1978 to 13 percent in 1982.
26.      Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the coming
years. The debt service ratio increased to 23.7 percent in 1982 and about
24.3 percent in 1983 from about 14 percent in 1981, as a result of a large
repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier OECD agreements.
The projections show a debt service ratio of 24.6 percent in 1985 and
24.1 percent in 1990. The debt burden should remain manageable provided
current policies are successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained,
and Turkey continues to receive further support from international commercial
and official sources. There are some recent encouraging signs of Turkey's
ability to enter the commercial market for medium-term loans.  In July 1983
the Central Bank of Turkey received a $200 million five-year syndicated loan
for balance of payments needs. Negotiations are under way to raise an
additional $350 million medium-term loan this year from commercial banks with
increased participation of European banks.
27.      Turkey continues to be in good standing with the IMF. A three-year
standby arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 1,250 million was approved
by the IMF's Board and became effective on June 18, 1980. The Government
purchased the full amount authorized under the arrangement. The Government
also purchased SDR 56.25 million against the one-year standby arrangement for
SDR 225 million approved by the Fund in June 1983. Negotiations are nearly
completed on replacing the current arrangement by a new one-year standby
arrangement to commence in April 1984.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUPKEY
28.      Through September 30, 1983 the Bank and IDA have lent
$4,595.8 million 1/ to Turkey, through 75 projects.  Agriculture accounts for
18 percent of funds lent, industry and DFCs for 29 percent, power for
16 percent, structural adjustment and program loans for 29 percent, and urban
development, transportation, education and tourism for the remaining
8 percent. As of September 30, 1983, IFC commitments to Turkey totalled about
$240 million, of which about $81 million were still held by IFC. Annex II
provides a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as
of September 30, 1983.
29.      The execution of Bank-financed projects in the public sector has been
slow, due in part to weak management, limited coordination amongst ministries,
staffing problems, and the serious external and domestic financial crises from
1977 to 1979. There has been notable improvement since September 1980.
Nevertheless, problems persist in many cases, reflecting difficulties in
staffing the public sector at current salaries, over-centralized bureaucratic
structures and continuing constraints on the availability of local funds. The

high interest rates for working capital combined with depressed domestic
demand and reluctance of investors to take the foreign exchange risk have
affected the implementation of private sector projects and led to slow
commitments under DFC lending.  Disbursements for all sectors combined average
43 percent of appraisal estimates (excluding structural adjustment loans), as
compared to 52 percent for Tunisia and 46 percent for Morocco.
30.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. These objectives also include
increasing domestic savings and reorienting a restrained public investment
program to reflect the Government's priorities of completing ongoing projects
faster and emphasizing quick-yielding new investments with positive balance of
payments impact.  The main vehicle for the Bank's operational discussions with
the Government has been the structural adjustment lending (SAL) program. Four
SALs have so far been approved, the last on June 23, 1983. The success of the
SAL program has highlighted the need to develop sector policy lending vehicles
for continuing the policy dialogue at the sectoral level.
31.      Agriculture, industry, energy and transportation will continue to be
the key sectors for Bank lending with the accent being placed on improving the
management of projects. In agriculture, the emphasis will be on irrigation,
credit, and reform of the extension and research services. In industry
(including DFCs), it will be on the promotion of exports, employment, and
increasing operational efficiency. Energy projects under preparation will
focus on power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite resources, as
well as enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas exploration. Future projects
will emphasize the power, coal/lignite and oil/gas sub-sectors. Lending for
the transport sector will focus on developing the infrastructure necessary
to facilitate exports and improve the efficiency of operations. Projects for
industrial training, urban development and public utilities may supplement
these efforts.
32.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work undertaken recently includes studies of the agricultural and financial
sectors. Topics likely to be covered in the future include a review of the
next five-year development plan, including a review of major public sector
projects, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustment, a review
of transport investments and studies of the engineering and agro-industries.
33.      This is the second loan to Turkey to be presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year   Other projects being processed include
agricultural extension and applied research, highway rehabilitation and a
proposed fifth SAL.
34.      The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was about
13 percent in 1982, and is expected to grow to about 15.4 percent by 1985; its
share of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about
9 percent in 1982 to about 14 percent in 1985.
35.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings and tourism. It has also invested in the Industrial

Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for overseas
contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
The StaLe Economic Enterprise System
36.      The State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) in Turkey were established
starting 50 years ago to fulfill needs not adequately being served by the
private sector, primarily in developing basic industries and
infrastructure 1/. Over the years, they have coste to play a dominant role in
the economy, in industry as well as in traditional public utilities,
transport, and agricultural marketing and supply. The SEEs currently account
for a substantial share of investment, GDP and non-agricultural employment.
In industry, SEEs have a virtual monopoly in petroleum refining and basic
metals, and have a large share in steel, fertilizers, pulp and paper, cement,
coal, sugar, machinery and chemicals. Total fixed investment in the SEE
sector during 1983 is estimated at TL 678 billion, and amounted to 52 percent
of public sector fixed investment and 31 percent of total fixed investment.
Broadly defined, in terms of the law as it stood until its recent amendment
(para. 38), SEEs were enterprises which had more than one half of their
capital owned by the Government, although within this definition they could
assume several legal forms, including being set up as a private company.
Those SEEs which were fully Government-owned were entitled to create separate
legal entities called Establishments which were, in many cases, independent
branch operations. Every SEE, along with its Establishments, was under the
control of its related Ministry. Supervision of SEE operations was the
general responsibility of the related Ministry and the specific responsibility
of the High Control Board, an auditing organization, which reported directly
to Parliament. Financial SEEs were also audited by a department of the
Ministry of Finance. The Government provided the SEEs with the credit and
capital needed to sustain operations and to m-ke new investments, within the
framework of the Five Year Plan and the Annisal Programs.  SEE project
proposals were vetted by the State Planning. Organization (SPO) before being
submitted for inclusion in the annual financial and investment programs, which
were approved by the Council of Ministers. Although the respective roles of
the SPO, the State Investment Bank (DYB) and the Treasury in the approval of
SEE investments were not clearly demarcated, the Government decided in 1981
that budgetary funds for loans for invest-emut in profit making SEEs would in
principle be channelled only through DYB, after scrutiny of the proposals by
SPO and the Treasury. Non-profit making SEEs, on the other hand, would
continue to receive funds directly from the budget to avoid compromising DYB's
financial standing, but the funds would be transferred only after scrutiny of
the project by DYB and under DYB's supervision during implementation.
1/ A detailed account of State Economic Enterprises in manufacturing may be
seen in the report of a special Bank mission, entitled "Turkey:
Industrialization and Trade Strategy" (No. 3641-TU, dated February 18,
1982), Chapter 6.



- 11 -
Although this change in the system has not yet been fully implemented, there
has been a significant reduction in direct budgetary transfers to the SEEs;
direct transfers to manufacturing SEEs, for example, fell from about
TL 61 Lillion in 1981 to TL 47 billion in 1982.
37.      Since the late 1970s, the operating losses and growing investment
demands of the SEEs have placed substantial burdens on the budget and added to
inflationary pressures. While some SEEs were well run and profitable, in
aggregate they showed increasing losses through 1980. Since then, as a result
of certain measures taken by the Government, primarily relating to
liberalization of output prices and holding down wage and salary increases
below the rate of inflation, the financial picture has changed significantly,
and the SEEs showed an overall net profit of nearly TL 67 billion in 1982.
The financial results of the operational SEEs are provided in Annex VII and
summarized in Table 2. However, while there has been some progress in
reducing over-staffing through hiring freezes in some SEEs, there has been
little overall improvement in SEE efficiency. Consequently, the burden of
economic and technical inefficiency is in many cases merely being reallocated
from the budget to consumers.

The majority of the problems afflicting the SEEs have arisen from the fact
that while the enterprises have formally been organized as economic entities
with the objectives of efficiency, productivity and profitability, they have
been subject to constant intervention by the Government in pursuit of
different and often conflicting objectives.  The causes of poor performance in
the past have included price controls, uneconomic investments, overstaffing,
lack of autonomy, weak management, low operational efficiency, frequent
changes of management, inadequate salaries for managerial and technical staff,
internal organizational problems, excessive centralization of decision making
and a confusion between economic, social and political goals. The present
project is directed at securing improvements in managerial and operational
efficiency in selected SEEs, and complements other measures being taken by the
Government to improve SEE performance (para. 42).
38.      SEE reform is a major goal of the Government's structural adjustment
program. During 1980-82, the Government implemented a number of interim
measures to improve short-term financial performance, redirect the SEEs'
investment programs and finance them increasingly from non-budget sources, and
undertake the necessary legal steps to institutionalize these changes. The
Government realized, however, that a more systematic effort was needed to
improve SEE performance on a permanent basis. Sustained improvement in the
operations of the SEEs would, by reducing the claim on outside sources of
funds for their investment, permit more resources to flow into the private
sector. Basic structural reforms, with the overall objective of having a
viable SEE sector more responsive to market forces, were expected to be
introduced in 1982 through a comprehensive SEE reform decree. The passage of
the legislation took longer than anticipated, and the reform decree was
eventually enacted in May 1983. The decree was later formally replaced by a
law (Law 2929) in October 1983.
39.      The new law deals comprehensively with the organization, structure
and operations of State enterprises. In some areas it essentially reiterates
the existing provisions, e.g. in the procedures for approval of investment
programs and in the freedom of SEEs generally to set their own product prices,
while in other areas it introduces important changes. The law classifies
State enterprises into essentially two categories, namely State Economic
Enterprises, which will be operated on commercial principles, and Public
Economic Establishments (PEEs), which include State monopolies as well as
enterprises providing basic goods and services, with a preponderant public
service aspect. The law places the existing enterprises in one or the other
of the two categories. The SEEs and PEEs can set up fully owned, legally
independent establishments as well as joint ventures with financial
participations of twenty six percent or higher. The law lays down uniform
principles relating to the composition, appointment and powers of Boards of
Directors, the tenure of Directors and the qualifications required of
Directors and top management. The Board of Directors will in particular have
the power to appoint Assistant Directors General and other higher level
managers; this is significant, since appointments of assistants to the General
Manager were previously made by the Council of Ministers on the proposal of
the Minister concerned.
40.      The annual overall investment and financing programs of the SEEs will
be decided by the Council of Ministers on the recommendation of SPO and the
Treasury, and after taking into account the resources and capacities of the
SEEs. Within this framework, the Board of Directors will have the power to



- 13 -
approve operating budgets as well as certain categories of investments. The
law reiterates that SEEs will be Eree to set their own product prices; if for
any reason the Government establishes prices, the loss, if any, to the
enterprise will be made up by the Government in accordance with a prescribed
formula. SEEs will be required to allocate a specified percentage of their
profits to build up reserves, before distribution of dividends. Employees of
the SEEs and PEEs will no longer be subject to the employment regime
applicable to Government employees (Law 657), but will be governed by a new
personnel regime to be announced in the near future, which is expected to give
greater flexibility to SEE managements in determining wages and salaries. In
addition, as in the past, bonuses can be awarded to SEE personnel (including
managers) generally, as well as to particular individuals, for meritorious
performance. Audit of SEEs will be carried out by the Supreme Board of Audit
of the Prime Ministry. In addition, the SEEs will be subject to the overall
supervision of the concerned Ministries. Coordination among SEEs and PEEs and
monitoring of their performance will be the responsibility of a Supreme Board
of Coordination for Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister and
including the Ministers concerned with the major enterprises, which will meet
at least once every quarter. The setting up of a Supreme Board of
Coordination under the Prime Minister formalizes the arrangements that have
been in force since 1981. The new law, in effect, replaces the old laws
relating to SEEs (principally Law 440 and Law 657), but until all its
provisions are implemented, especially those relating to reorganization,
capital structure and the personnel regime, the relevant previous law or
regulation will continue to apply. The special laws relating to individual
enterprises have since been reviewed and amended where necessary to be in
harmony with the new law.
41.      A comparison of the new law with Law 440 shows that while certain new
provisions have been introduced, the legal framework under which the SEEs
operate has not been changed significantly. It must be borne in mind,
however, that Law 440 was by no means fully implemented in the past. A
reaffirmation of its basic provisions is therefore of value in signalling the
Government's strategy towards SEEs, which is to bring about greater efficiency
in SEE performance through decentralization of responsibility, greater
management autonomy and competition. The ultimate objective is to place the
SEEs in an economic environment where they would compete with private sector
firms, especially with regard to output prices, factor inputs and credit. The
Government recognizes that the challenge is to change deep-rooted attitudes,
not merely laws, and the test for the Government in the months and years ahead
will be how the new law is used to grant a substantial measure of managerial
autonomy to the SEEs and improve overall SEE efficiency.
42.      The present project for technical assistance aimed at improving the
performance of selected SEEs, through better management combined with improved
manpower planning and training and productivity improvements, must be viewed
as a part of this wider Government effort. It complements the initiatives and
actions being taken as part of the Government's structural adjustment program,
which is being supported by the Bank's Structural Adjustment Loans, as well as
the organizational restructuring and management improvement measures at the



- 14 -
level of individual SEEs being supported by Bank project lending. 1/ It must
be emphasized that the present project is designed to address only a limited
number of operational efficiency issues in the SEEs selected and is not
intended to be a comprehensive reform exercise. The approach of selecting a
sample of SEEs and focusing a project on efficiency improvements in the
enterprises is being tried in Turkey for the first time. The aim of this
pilot project is to develop and test at the enterprise level a number of
important changes that would be replicable elsewhere. The project would thus
be the first step in encouraging expansion of managerial responsibilities in
the SEEs. With this in view, it has been agreed that starting in 1985, the
Government and the Bank would carry out a joint annual review of the
experience of this project so as to apply the experience gained to other SEEs
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).
Role of the State Investment Bank
43.      The State Investment Bank (DYB) was established in 1964 under Special
Law 441 to provide long-term cred:ts, guarantees and other services to SEEs.
As a State Economic Enterprise itself, DYB is also subject to the provisions
of the recent law (previously 440) regulating the constitution and operations
of SEEs. DYB's parent ministry is the Prime Ministry (previously the Ministry
of Finance). Its authorized capital was recently raised from TL 50 billion to
TL 250 billion, of which about a fifth is paid in and held by the Treasury.
In addition to its equity capital from the Government, DYB's resources are
obtained mainly from the sale of bonds to the Social Security System and
Pension and Retirement Funds, as well as from foreign borrowings and loans
from the Government. DYB takes lending decisions under guidelines laid down
in Law 441, which are basically indicative, and functions within the
administrative procedures prescribed for provision of investment funds to
SEEs. 2/
44.      The Bank has so far made three loans to DYB.  The first two were DFC
lines of credit for $50 million (Loan No. 1024-TU) and $70 million (Loan
No. 1379-TU) respectively. The third loan, also for $70 million (Loan
No. 1998-TU), was designed to enable DYB to finance the foreign currency costs
of completing six specific, high priority SEE projects. In addition, DYB was
the channel for a part ($7.9 million) of the loan of $44.1 million under the
1/ A series of actions to address structural issues facing the SEEs form part
of the Government's program under SAL IV (Statement of Development
Policies - 1983, Report No. P-3543-TU, Annex IV-A, pp. 9-10). As examples
of technical assistance being provided as part of project lending may be
mentioned the loans approved in FY 1983 for the Agricultural Bank of
Turkey (Report No. P-3593-TU) and for the Turkish Electricity Authority
(Report No. P-3542-TU).
2/ Under the State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project (Loan No. 1998-TU),
the Government is to carry out a study of DYB's future role and provide a
copy of the study to the Bank for its comments. The study is to address,
in particular, DYB's role in the selection, financing and supervision of
investment projects of SEEs, DYB's relationships with the Treasury and
SPO, and its organizational, financial and staffing requirements to carry
out its responsibilities. Commencement of the study, which was held up
for the passage of the SEE decree, is expected shortly.

Second Fertilizer Rationalization and Energy Saving Project (Loan
No. 2131-TU), for financing investments for rehabilitation of a public sector
plant providing raw materials for fertilizer production. After initial delays
in signing of contracts with engineering firms and finalization of procurement
under international competitive bidding, implementation of the ongoing
projects is now proceeding satisfactorily.
The Beneficiaries
45.      Several considerations determined the choice of beneficiaries in this
project. Foremost among these was the need to select SEEs whose managements
were strongly committed to the objectives of the Government's SEE reform
effort and saw the need to utilize technical assistance to improve their
operational efficiency.  It was also considered useful to identify SEEs
covering a variety of situations obtaining in the Turkish public sector. The
coal and lignite industry and the railways are characterized by weak financial
performance and low productivity, and have been a drain on the budget. Two of
the beneficiaries were chosen from these sectors. The overall performance of
the third beneficiary, Sumerbank, has been comparatively better. It is
playing a significant role in the export drive, and is an example of an
industry in competition with the private sector. The effort here is to improve
its efficiency further, particularly as the Government intends to devote less
public sector resources to manufacturing (especially consumer goods) in the
future. A further brief description of each of the SEEs is given below, with
additional technical and financial details provided in Annex IV.
46.      Turkive Komur Isletmeleri (TKI):  TKI is responsible for about 90
percent of the lignite production in Turkey (16.2 million tons in 1982). 1/
TKI consists of a headquarters office with a staff of about 640 and twelve
subsidiary operating establishments employing a total of about 21,000 people.
While TKI's subsidiaries are directly responsible for exploiting their
concession zones, certain functions are centralized in the headquarters
office. Amongst these functions are the procurement of importetc goods,
machinery and services, revenue collection and cash management, feasibility
analysis and investment program formulation, decisions concerning the staffing
levels of subsidiaries and the formulation of training programs.
47.      TKI's lignite production has risen at an average rate of 11.5 percent
per year over the last six years as a greater number of lignite-fired power
stations have been commissioned. Current plans are to quadruple lignite
output by 1990. Of this approximately 50 million tons per year (mt/y)
increase in capacity, 20 mtly are expected to come from the Bank-financed
Afsin-Elbistan open-pit mine. The rest of the increase is to come from
completion of onguing projects and about thirteen new projects.
48.      Attainment of the above production goals, on which much of the
Government's energy development strategy rests, will be extremely difficult.
TKI suffers from serious management and staffing deficiencies which have
resulted in an inability to carry out its projects in a timely manner. TRI's
1/ Until 1983 TKI was also responsible for all hard coal production in Turkey
through its subsidiary Eregli Coal Enterprise (EKI). As part of the SEE
reform, EKI was constituted into a separate SEE, independent of TKI.



- 16 -
subjection to the State Personnel Law and consequent low pay levels has led to
high staff turnover and left the institution with a high proportion of
inexperienced engineers; many of the employees who have remained in the
company for longer periods of time need training to meet the new challenges
TKI now faces. In addition to these problems, shortages of funds (until 1982
TKI received a net operating subsidy) have hampered project progress and,
combined with lengthy procedures required for the procurement of spare parts
and machinery, led to a history of production shortfalls.
49.      To date, the Bank's relationship with TKI has concerned the Elbistan
thermal power project and associated lignite mine, under which TKI and the
Turkish Electric Authority (TEK) were the beneficiaries of a $148 million Bank
loan (Loan No. 1023-TU). This project has been subject to serious delays.
While some problems remain on the power side, it is expected that the first
unit will be ready for start-up in mid-1984 and for commercial operation by
the end of 1984. On the mining side, however, progress remains slow in
establishing acceptable project management, an acceptable project scheduling
and monitoring unit, and adequate arrangements for maintenance of the mining
equipment. The Bank is currently discussing with TKI the remedial actions
that would have to be taken by the company's management to improve performance
and ensure an adequate supply of lignite for the power plant. The activities
proposed under the present project would be supportive of the specific
measures required at Elbistan.
50.      In addition to a supplemental loan for Elbistan, Bank financing for a
2.3 million ton per year open-pit lignite mine near Izmir has been requested
by the Government, and a project proposal is now under discussion between TKI
and the Bank.
51.      Sumerbank:  Sumerbank was founded in 1933 as one of the original
conglomerate SEEs with operations in banking, manufacturing and retailing.
Sumerbank has set up a number of independent SEEs over the years. Until
recently, it manufactured a variety of products including building materials,
ceramics, leather goods, chemicals and vegetable oil, besides operating a
small banking division. However, its main business has always been textiles,
which typically accounted for about 80 percent of its total sales revenue
(60 percent from cotton, 20 percent from wool). After the reorganization
introduced under the new SEE law, Sumerbank's future operations will be
limited to its banking and textile operations (in cotton, wool and garments),
leather manufacturing and related retailing, while other existing operations
(e.g. chemicals, ceramics) will be transferred to other SEEs. Sumerbank will
also acquire a few existing public sector textile mills which are currently
operating outside its management. The company's retail division, which also
sells some private firms' products, has about 470 shops throughout Turkey,
mostly in rural areas. Like other SEEs, Sumerbank has suffered from frequent
management changes, inadequate compensation and incentive systems, shortage of
competent managerial personnel, overstaffing, and overcentralization of
operation and investment decision-making at the senior management and board
levels. In addition, coordination between headquarters, the production units
and the retail division is weak. While operational efficiency has shown some
improvement as a result of Bank-financed technical assistance and supply of
spare parts under the ongoing project (para. 52), it is still low and many
mills suffer from unbalanced production capacities, outdated equipment and
lack of spare parts.

52.      The Bank made a loan of $83 million to the Government of Turkey in
1980 (Loan No. 1847-TU) for the first phase of Sumerbank's Cotton Textile
Rationalization and Modernization Project. The main objective of the Phase I
project is to increase the overall efficiency, capacity utilization and labor
productivity in the cotton plants operated by Sumerbank's Cotton Textile
Division, in order to achieve a significant increase in production volume,
reduction of production costs, upgrading of the product mix and improvement in
product quality. Under tCe project, Sumerbank's Cotton Textiles Division has
assumed increased responsibility for marketing its production domestically and
abroad, product development, and coordination between production and
marketing. Project completion is now expected in mid-1985, one and a half
years behind the appraisal estimate. Good progress has been achieved in
increasing production as well as labor and machine productivity, and in the
areas of procurement, maintenance practices, quality control, and introduction
of components of an improved management information and control system
(particularly cash management and costing). Other areas where technical
assistance will be provided during the remaining period of the project include
training of plant technical and management personnel, upgrading of Sumerbank's
training facilities, production planning, inter-mill comparison systems,
project cost control, and product rationalization. To the extent possible,
local consultants are being recruited and are working closely with expatriate
consultants.
53.      In textiles, Sumerbank's priority task is to increase efficiency of
its operations in the manufacturing of wool textiles, including wool
garments. This would require rationalization and modernization of six wool
textile mills and the headquarters organization, similar to the progress
already being made in the cotton textile operations. 1/ Sumerbank has
indicated keen interest in utilizing technical assistance under the proposed
project to initiate this task, as well as to improve its sales and retail
organization and to improve its management information and data processing
systems.
54.      Turkive Cbmhuriyeti Devlet Demiryollari - Adapazari Vazon Sanayii
Muessesesi (TCDD-ADVAS): TCDD-ADVAS is one of three main
workshops/manufacturing establishments belonging to the Turkish State Railways
(TCDD) that are responsible for the manufacture, repair and maintenance of
TCDD's rolling stock. TCDD-ADVAS, located at Adapazari, specializes in the
manufacture, repair and maintenance of passenger coaches. (Two other
establishments, at Eskisehir and Sivas, are responsible for locomotives and
freight wagons respectively). TCDD-ADVAS was established in 1951 originally
as a workshop for repair and maintenance of passenger coaches. In 1962, its
operations were expanded to include manufacture of passenger coaches. Its
current product mix consists mainly of pullman coaches, self-propelled
electric motor trains for commuter traffic and postal coaches, with a capacity
of about 70 units per year, depending on the specific product mix. In
addition, it is responsible for the overhaul and repair of TCDD's fleet of
about 1,300 passenger coaches. It currently employs about 2,700 persons.
1/ The Government has recently requested Bank assistance for a Phase II
project following completion of the ongoing Rationalization and
Modernization Project.



- 18 -
55.      TCDD-ADVAS's production program and prices are determined by TCDD on
an annual basis. TCDD-ADVAS's prices for sales to TCDD are based on estimates
of the expected production and overhead costs plus an agreed margin. TCDD
feels that there is substantial scope for improvements in TCDD-ADVAS's
productivity and cost efficiency. However, TCDD-ADVAS's management does not
as yet have an adequate basis on which to determine the standard costs of its
various operations, based on appropriate underlying norms in terms of material
and labor inputs. It also does not have any system at present which would
enable it to monitor periodically the progress of various operations against
budget and operational plans. TCDD-ADVAS carries a large inventory of raw
materials, spare parts and components, but its present manual inventory
control system is cumbersome and time-consuming and does not provide timely
and accurate information for efficient inventory management and control. Its
design and research capabilities also need to be strengthened to enable it to
upgrade product quality. Further, the company's production and repair
facilities have changed over the years in an ad hoc manner in response to
changes in its activities and the management recognizes the need for
streamlining operations with a better definition of roles and responsibilities
between the different facilities. Similarly, the present plant layout is not
optimal with regard to work flow and ease of operations.
56.      The workshops at Adapazari, Eskisehir and Sivas are fully-owned
establishments of TCDD, which acts through a management committee for each
establishment. Although each establishment is a separate legal entity, its
operations are subject to TCDD's review and approval. However, it is part of
TCDD's objectives to give TCDD-ADVAS greater autonomy in its operations.
Towards this end, TCDD and TCDD-ADVAS's management have indicated interest in
utilizing technical assistance in the areas mentioned above with a view to
improving operational efficiency. This would also help to prepare ADVAS for
an envisaged expansion of its manufacturing capacity by 1990 to a level of
about 120 units per year. The Government has agreed to cause TCDD to take all
measures necessary to enable TCDD-ADVAS to fulfil its obligations under the
Project Agreement (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01). Based on the experience at
TCDD-ADVAS, the technical assistance to be provided is expected to have
additional benefits through application in TCDD's other establishments at
Eskisehir and Sivas.
External Debt Management
57.      Turkey's debt service obligations are likely to rise significantly in
the mid- to late-1980s, largely on account of the repayments of debt
rescheduled during 1978-81. At the same time, in light of anticipated
reductions in concessional aid, Turkey would need greater access to medium-
and long-term credits from commercial sources if its growth projections are to
materialize. This in turn will be dependent on Turkey establishing her
creditworthiness. For these reasons, there is a need to formulate a set of
clearly defined debt management policies. Short of this, the recent
encouraging performance on the external front may not restore adequate
confidence among international lenders.
58.      An essential prerequisite for formulating an overall external debt
management policy is the establishment of a debt reporting system that can
compile and evaluate debt data rapidly and accurately. The rapid upsurge in
borrowing from 1973 onward had brought about a marked deterioration in the



- 19 -
quality and coverage of 'jurkish debt statistics. This was exacerbated by the
arrears buildup and subsequent implementation of successive rescheduling
arrangements. The method followed by the Ministry of Finance and SEEs of
recording debt service payments at the time of transfer of Turklsh lira
counterpart funds worked well during periods of timely external payment, but
broke down completely when the appropriate foreign exchange transfers were not
being made. In order to facilitate data handling, the Bank supported a
program under SAL I for the Ministry of Finance to undertake the
computerization of Turkey's debt reporting system. Although a system was
designed by the Ministry of Finance with the help of an external consultant,
subsequent evaluation showed it did not deal adequately with the complexity of
Turkey's debt structure. The Government has therefore approached the Bank and
the Fund for assistance in designing an improved system. It is proposed under
the project to provide technical assistance for this purpose to the External
Debt Division of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade, to
complement the assistance separately being provided by the Fund.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
59.      The proposed project was identified in December 1982 following a
request by the Government and appraised in March-April 1983. A sumnary is
provided at the beginning of this report and Annex III contains supplementary
project data. There is no separate Staff Appraisal Report. Negotiations were
held in Washington on February 6-10, 1984. with a Turkish delegation led by
Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Counselor for Fineicial and Economic Affairs, Embassy
of the Republic of Turkey.
Project Obiectives
60.      The major objectives of the proposed project are as follows:
(i)    to assist a selected group of SEEs to improve their efficiency,
through better management and operations combined with improved
manpower planning and training; and
(ii)    to establish a coordinating committee in the Prime Ministry
(Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade), with suitable
representation of the agencies involved, to oversee the project
and serve as a focal point of contact with the Bank, so as to
enable the experience gained from it to be transferred to other
SEEs.
The project has been conceived as a modest first step in the challenging task
of demonstrating the economic potential of SEEs in Turkey and thereby helping
to change deeply-ingrained attitudes towards their role and responsibilities.
Project Description
61.      Technical assistance would be provided under the project primarily to
meet specific needs identified in the beneficiary SEEs. The project is
expected to be implemented over approximately a three-year period. Its
various components are described below.



- 20 -
62.      Turkiye Komur Isletmeleri (TKI):  The project would assist TKI in the
several areas that are deemed most critical to the company's improving its
performance.  These are:
(a)    redesign and improvement of management information systems;
(b)    streamlining of procurement of equipment and spare parts;
(c)    training, including training of managers, and manpower planning;
and
td)    lignite mine operations management.
Two studies would be carried out by consultants, covering areas (a), (b) and
(c) above; for (d), a small group of mine management consultants would provide
operational assistance to the Western Lignite Establishment (GLI), the
establishment responsible for TKI's largest mining districts, Seyitomer and
Tuncbilek, which currently account for 56 percent of producLion. The object
of this assistance is to demonstrate the productivity gains that may be
achieved without significant investment in new facilities.
63.      The management information system (MIS) and procurement study would
address five main areas:
(a)    information systems for project construction, including cost
monitoring, construction reporting, critical path method
systems, capital expenditure budgeting, and equipment and
material tracing systems;
(b)    information systems for operations, including cost accounting
and control, purchasing and inventory control, analytical
techniques related to production activities, and financial
planning;
sc)    reports for top management;
Cd)    development of a strategy for MIS automation (TKI currently
makes very little use of computers, and accounting at
headquarters is completely manual); and
(e)    a review of the procedures used to procure equipment and spare
parts with the object of determining where changes may be made
that would shorten acquisition times (typically 6 months to 2
years), particularly for emergency spare parts that are required
to maintain production levels.
The study would concentrate on TKI's headquarters and the largest operating
enterprises and would take into account TKI management's long-term plans for
the decentralization of responsibilities to the enterprises. The resulting
MIS would be able to provide proper and timely information to enable TKI's
management to monitor the progress of new mines and projects under
development, monitor operations and activities related to mines in commercial
production, and perform its strategic planning function in an improved
manner. Included in the technical assistance would be the training of TKI



- 21 -
staff in the implementation and use of the improved MIS and procurement
procedures, the design of instruction manuals, and the installation of a micro
computer with appropriate software to improve TKI's financial planning
abilities rapidly. The consultants would assist TKI in procuring the
equipment necessary to implement the MIS.
64.      The objectives of the second study would be to develop manpower
planning and training proprams that would enable TKI to make its beat efforts
to meet the Largets of th. lignite development program. The study would be
split into two phases. During the first phase the consultants would study the
current organization and nature of manpower planning and training activities
and develop proposals for their restructuring and improvement. The second
phase of the study would formulate details of manpower and training
requirements in the medium-term future. Plans for the upgrading of TKI's mine
training center at the Western Lignite Establishment would be developed and
its equipment requirements specified. Internal and external (to TRI) training
courses would be identified, and outlines drawn up for courses to be
administered within TKI. The loan includes a provision for the purchase of
training equipment.
65.      While the older TKI operating establishments have a base of competent
personnel and managers who combine to produre satisfactory performance, there
are many untapped opportunities for improvement in all phases of operations.
The objective of the mine operations management component is to assign a small
team of management consultants to work with the management of the Western
Lignite Establishment, the largest TKI subsidiary, in order to identify
opportunities for improvement, define the costs and benefits of, and time
required to implement, the recommended actions, and carry the recommendations
through the implementation stage with the support of the enterprise
management. It is expected that the technical assistance would be required
for 21 months, of which six would require the consultants' full-time presence
followed by about 15 months of part-time participation.
66.      For the above tasks, it is estimated that a total of 219 man-months
of consultancy services would be required including about 54 man-months of
local consultancy services, together with the necessary equipment and
training. About half of the consultancy man-months are expected to be
required for the MIS Study. These services would be financed under the
project, together with the necessary office and training equipment. Selection
of consultants and negotiation of contracts are expected to be completed by
December 1984. Draft reports recommending improvements in procurement
practices and in the MIS, and on manpower planning and training, are expected
to be available by the third quarter of 1985. Implementation of the ensuing
recommendations on procurement and MIS would continue through the fourth
quarter of 1986 after consultations between TKI and the Bank. Recommendations
on improved mine operations managenvmnt are expected to be developed in
mid-1985 and implemented thereafter over a period of about one year. More
detailed schedules for all studies are provided in Annex V.
67.      Sumerbank:  The project would finance technical assistance in the
areas of strengthening of management and management systems, organization
planning, corporate and investment planning, and training. In particular, the
technical assistance would cover:



- 22 -
(i)    reorganization and rationalization of Sumerbank's sales and
retail organization including: (a) the preparation of a study
to analyze Sumerbank's present sales and retail organization and
activities and to recommend action programs-in this area to
improve the organization and management structure, rationalize
the distribution and retail network and transport facilities,
develop appropriate incentive systems for management and sales
personnel, develop guidelines for further development of the
retail network, and prepare a training program for Sumerbank
marketing and sales personnel in modern marketing and sales
practices; and (b) implementation of the training program
developed in the study.
(ii)    improvement of Sumerbank's management information and related
data processing systems, through: (a) the preparation of a
study which would analyze Sumerbank's current management
information system (MIS), its organization and information needs
in selected areas, and make recommendations for the design of an
overall new MIS concept and organization; (b) the preparation of
a detailed MIS design for selected pilot units in Sumerbank,
including Sumerbank headquarters, the sales and retail
organization with related selected district centers, warehouse
and retail stores, selected banking branches, and three selected
cotton and wool textil- plants; and (c) implementation of the
detailed MIS concept in the pilot units, including establishment
of a new MIS organization, procurement and installation of
equipment, preparation of software, testing and start-up of the
new system and training of system users and operators;
(iii)    preparation of a feasibility study foz the rationalization and
modernization of Sumerbank's wool textile operations, including
woolen and worsted yarn, fabrics and garments, blankets and
carpet manufacturing, including strengthening of management
systems, and capital investments required to modernize and
rationalize the production facilities in light of the current
and projected market for wool products in Turkey and abroad; and
(iv)    provision of selected data processing, comunuications and office
equipment related to the implementation of the proposed new MIS.
For the above tasks, it is estimated that a total of about 205 man-months of
foreign and local consultancy services would be required, together with the
necessary equipment. Specific training requirements and their implementation
arrangements would be identified in the studies covering the first phase of
items (i) and (ii). The feasibility study for the wool operations is expected
to be started by early March 1984, while the studies under the other two
components are cxpected to be initiated by August 1984. Completion of the
wool study is expected by July 1984, while implementation of a training
program for the sales and retail organization, and of the improvements in the
management information systems, are expected to be completed by early 1986 and
end-1986 respectively (Annex V).



- 23 -
68.      TCDD-ADVAS:  The technical assistance package for TCDD-ADVAS is
designed to assist TCDD-ADVAS in increasing productivity and efficiency while
providing TCDD-ADVAS's management with better instruments for planning and
controlling-operations -more effectively through necessary improvements in
areas with identified weaknesses, e.g. plant organization and layout, design
and research, operations planning and control, cost estimation, and inventory
management and control. The technical assistance package would include
(a) consultant services to help TCDD-ADVAS to identify the necessary
improvements, including training of TCDD-ADVAS personnel, and thereafter to
implement them; and (b) supporting equipment including an appropriate computer
system and associated software. Major elements in the package would be:
(i)    provision of an improved basis for cost estimation by extending
and improving TCDD-ADVAS's current system by an appropriate
breakdown of operations by activities and work stations;
(ii)    improvement of the existing operations planning and scheduling
systems and provision of a management information system to
enable monitoring and control of the progress of operations
against plans;
(iii)    strengthening of TCDD-ADVAS's planning, design and research
departments to undertake more advanced designs and to upgrade
product quality;
(iv)    improvement of the efficiency of the current manual inventory
management and control system by introduction of more automated
systems; and
(v)    improvements in work organization and layout in the production
and repair facilities.
For the above tasks, provision has been made for an estimated total of
80 man-months of foreign and local consultancy services, together with the
cost of support equipment and training. The first phase of the work
consisting of studies for identifying tbe necessary improvements and
determining the consultants' work plan for the implementation phase is
expected to be initiated around August 1984 for completion in the second
quarter of 1985. The implementation phase of the work, including procurement
and installation of support equipment, is expected to commence soon thereafter
with completion in the second half of 1986. Further details regarding the
implementation schedule are given in Annex V.
69.      The three SEEs described above have been identified in consultation
with the Government for inclusion in the proposed project. It has also been
agreed that the project would include a limited amount of contingency
financing, to allow for financing of technical assistance for additional
beneficiaries that may be identified as the project proceeds. The additional
beneficiaries to be assisted and specific items of technical assistance
to be financed would be approved by the Government, DYB and the Bank by
June 30, 1985 (Loan Agreement, Schedule 2).
70.      External Debt Management:  It is proposed under the project to
finance the services of an external consultant to the Undersecretariat of
Treasury and Foreign Trade for a period of up to 18 months, to assist in



- 24 -
defining user needs, establishing standards of data accuracy and setting up an
operational data flow system. This work would cover all agencies utilizing
external credits, including the SEEs. The services of a consultant are at
present -being-financed by the. Fund in the first. phase of a project, which
consists essentially of an assessment of the system of data flows and the
development of input and output formats. The consultant to be financed under
this project would join the consultant in the field as part of the second
phase to set up and test an appropriate computerized debt system for Turkey.
As part of their task, the consultants would be expected to make
recommendations regarding the choice of hardware and software. The systematic
training of counterparts would be a substantial component of the work programs
of the consultants, and their selection would be based both on their expertise
as advisers and on their suitability as trainers.
Proiect Organization and Execution
71.      Each SEE would be responsible for implementation of its own component
of the project, including selection and recruitment of consultants. Terms of
reference for the various studies to be undertaken under the project have also
been agreed with the SEEs (Annex VI). Qualified project coordinators have
been appointed in each SEE. In addition, each SEE would designate suitable
staff, under the project coordinator, to work with the consultants in the
study and implementation phases of the project. Where appropriate, foreign
and local consultants would work together, but with a single firm carrying the
prime responsibility. It is intended that consultants would be appointed only
after the SEEs nave appointed the project coordinators and their project
staff, and provided support staff and related office facilities. Assu.ances-
have been obtained that these counterparts would be maintained in their places
to work with the consultants to ensure continuity of effort (Project
Agreement, Section 2.02). The consultants would be required to submit
inception reports recommending any required changes to their work plans which
would be jointly reviewed by the beneficiaries and the Bank. Final results of
the studies leading to recommendations for implementation would also be
jointly reviewed by the beneficiaries and the Bank prior to implementation
(Project Agreement, Section 2.07).
Proiect Costs and Financingt
72.      The cost, net of taxes, of the proposed project is estimated at about
$8.8 million, including a foreign exchange component of about $6.9 million.
Costs are based on end-1983 prices. Physical contingencies of 10 percent of
base cost have been provided. Price contingencies in US dollar terms have
been calculated at 7.5 Dercent for 1984, 7.0 percent for 1985 and 6.0 percent
for 1986 onwards. The proposed loan of $7.6 million would finance the foreign
cost element, as well as 85 percent of the total costs of local consultants
(para. 74). Assurances have been obtained from the SEEs and the Government on
the availability of funds to cover other local costs and possible cost
overruns (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 and Project Agreement, Section 2.01).
Onlending Arrangements
73.      The loan would be made to the Government of Turkey, which would
relend to DYB, under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement and on the same terms as the
Bank loan, the amounts intended for the use of the beneficiary SEEs. DYB



- 25 -
would in turn onlend the funds to the selected SEEs through Finance
Agreements, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The
onlending rate would be the Bank's prevailing variable interest rate plus an
administration fee of 0.5 percent (DYB Agreement, Section 2.01). Execution of
the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and DYB, and Finance
Agreements between DYB and the three beneficiary SEEs, is a condition of loan
effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01). The foreign exchange risk would
be borne by the beneficiary SEEs for the respective amounts utilized by them.
Withdrawal applications truld be channelled through DYB to the Bank by the
SEEs and disbursements would also be made through DYB.
Procurement and Disbursement
74.      Consultants would be recruited in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Detailed terms of reference for the consultants and their contracts would be
approved by the Bank. Equipment would be procured through ti) international
competitive bidding (ICB) for major packages over $100,000 (mainly computers);
(ii) limited international bidding on the basis of quotations from at least
three qualified suppliers for packages between $5,000 and $100,000; and
(iii) local procurement procedures of the SEEs for packages below $5,000. All
packages for equipment over $100,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior
review of procurement documentation. Furthermore, the Bank would carry out a
prior review of the initial bidding packages for each beneficiary to ensure
that a satisfactory procurement process is established. The balance of the
contracts would be subject to random post-review by the Bank after contract
award. The Bank loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of the foreign
exchange costs of foreign consultants, 85 percent of the total costs of local
consultants, 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs or local costs
(ex-factory) of equipment, and 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of
training. The disbursement percentage for local consultants is calculated to
be approximately equivalent to the percentage resulting from covering the
foreign exchange costs of foreign consultancy contracts.
Supervision and Monitoring
75.      To ensure high level supervision and monitoring of the project, a
coordination committee of officials has been set up in the Prime Ministry
(Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade), with representation of SPO,
DYB and the ministries responsible for the SEEs selected. Assurances have
been obtained that the committee would be maintained during the life of the
project (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03). The SEEs would furnish quarterly
reports to the Bank and the committee on the progress of project
implementation.  The Bank would maintain regu'ar contact with the committee as
well as with each beneficiary SEE during project supervision and carry out
joint annual reviews of the experience of the project.
Accounting and Audit
76.      Under the provisions of the new SEE law the accounts of all the SEEs
will be audited by the Supreme Board of Audit of the Prime Ministry. Such
accounts, including separate accounts of expenditure under the project, would
be submitted to the Bank annually within six months of the end of each fiscal
year.

Benefits and Risks
77.      The proposed project would enable the selected SEEs to initiate steps
to improve the efficiency of their operations through the improvement of
specific and critical areas of management, and thereby enable them to adjust
rapidly to the greater managerial autonomy that is the goal of the
Government's strategy. Success of the project would serve as an example to
other SEEs of the measures that can be taken and the efficiency improvements
that can be achieved. Improved performance of the SEEs would reduce their
dependence on external resources for financing investment, thereby permitting
more resources to flow into the private sector. The project would also
strengthen the Government's ability to compile and evaluate external debt
data, including data relating to SEEs, rapidly and accurately. The main risk
the project may face would be a weakening of the Government's resolve to grant
greater autonomy to the SEEs, with a resultant loss of motivation on the part
of the SEEs to improve performance. This risk is considered small in view of
the fact that SEE reform is a major component of the Government's structural
adjustment program, and that the beneficiary SEEs have been selected by the
Government taking into account the commitment of their managements to the
objectives of the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
78.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank,
the draft agreement with Devlet Yatirim Bankasi, the draft Project Agreement
with the three beneficiary SEEs and the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Features of special
interest are listed in Annex III of this Report. Execution of a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement between the Government and DYB, and Finance Agreements between
DYB and the three beneficiary SEEs, are special conditions of loan
effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01).
79.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
80.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

TURKEY - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT FOR STATE ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
I. TURKIYE KOMUR ISLETMELERI
A.   Background
1.01      Turkiye Komur Iletmelori Kurumu (TKI - Turkish Coal Enterprise)
is responsible for about 902 of all lignite production ln Turkey, the
remaining 10 being produced from numerous small privately-owned mines.
TKI was set up in 1957 as a public limited company and expanded through the
successive nationalization of lignite mines in the rrivate sector. Until
1983 TKI was also responsible for all hard coal production through its
operating enterprise, the Eregli Coal Enterprise (EKI). In 1983 the five
mining districts managed by EKI were constituted into a new state
enterprise, Turkiye Taskomuru Kurumu (TTK--Turkish Hard Coal Enterprise),
independent of TKI. In 1982 employment in hard coal operations, all in
underground mines, was about 47,000 compared to 21,000 in the mainly open
pit lignite mines; hard coal run-of-mine production In 1982 was 7.2 million
tons while lignite production was 18.8 million tons. This financial and
organizational separation of TKI and TTK should have a beneficial impact on
TKI's ability to concentrate its resources, both human and financial, on
accelerating the development nf the nation's lignite resources.  All
references to TKI In the succeeding sections are to the enterpriso as it
exists after the reorganizat.on of 1983.
B.   Organization and Management
1.02      TKI consists of a headquarters staff in Ankara numbering about
640, ten mining enterprises scattered throughout the country, and a sales
and distribution enterprise that manages all stockpiles and lignite sales.
TKI's board of directors is chaired by TKI's Director General and consists
of four members nominated by the Government. The functions of the
headquarters are to assist and provide guidance to operating enterprises
and to handle all contacts with the Government and financial institutions.
In addition, the headquarters carries out project feasibility studies,
formulates the TKI investment program for approval by the Ministry for
Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and SPO, >rocures all major equipment,
sets budgets (for Government approval) and production targets, handles all
funds management and approves the employment -f all professional staff in
the enterprises. The headquarters also plays a direct role in project
implementation in those cases where new operating enterprises lack
sufficient competent personnel to operate in an efficient manner. Though
there is logic in centralizing certain financial functions, investment
planning and contacts with Government, the headquarters' excessive control
of procurement and project implementation has contributed to overall slow
progress in developing lignite deposits.
1.03      The environment in which TKI operates has a strong impact on the
quality of its management. Low pay levels, in comparison to the private



- 36 -
ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 18
sector, and lack of an incentive system for professional and managerial
staff, have resulted in high turnover and a concentration of inexperienced
or insufficiently qualified staff within the Cumpany. Decision-making
authority lies in the hands of a relatively few experienced managers with
little delegation of authority. This situation is unlikely to change while
TKI remains subject to civil service pay scales and structures. Overall
management is weak and lacks a commercial approach as Government policy is
to compensate TKI for any operating losses incurred under
Government-administered lignite prices.
C.   Operations
1.04      TKI's ten mining enterprises cover a wide variety of operations,
from the Western Lignite Enterprise (GLI) producing 9 million tons per year
(Mtpy) of lignite with a workforce of 6,700, to the Southeast Anatolia
Asphaltite and Lignite Enterprise (GAL) which prodtces about 0.8 Mtpy of
asphaltite by using contractors. Only three enterprises--GLI, Aegean (ELI)
and Bursa (BLI)-currently produce more than one million tons per year.
GLI is the parent company in the lignite subsector and operates the two
largest mines - Tuncbilek (4 Mtpy saleable) and Seyitomer (5 Mtpy
saleable). ELI was created in 1978 to operate three mining districts that
had been operated by GLI or by the private sector. In terms of economics
the most attractive undeveloped lignite deposits lie within ELI's area of
operations. Current ELI output is 2.6 Ktpy saleable. BLI produces about
1.4 Mtpy of saleable lignite using contractors. Total saleable (TKI)
lignite production during 1978-1982 was as follows:
('000 tons per year)
1978    1979     1980      1981     1982
9,326   11,065   13,639   15,050   16,160
1.05      The mining enterprise which, potentially, could become the
largest producer is the Afsin Elbistan Lignite Enterprise (AELI),
established in the mid-1970s to develop a 20 Mtpy open pit mine which will
feed a 1,360 MW power plant now under construction by the Turkish
Electricity Authority (TEK). Mine and power plant are being partially
financed by a Bank loan of US$148 million (Loan 1023-TU, June 1974). The
joint power plant and mine project was originally conceived to provide base
load generating capacity additions during 1978-1980; due to serious
managerial and technical problems at both the mine and the power plant the
project is now some seven years behind schedule. The lignite to be mined
is of low quality (1050 Kcal/kg; 17% ash; 55% moisture). The main mining
equipment consists of six large bucketwheel excavators and a system of
cenveyor belts to deliver lignite to the power plant and dispose of
overburden. Currently, five excavators are operable though AELI only has
sufficient staff to run three. When operating at design capacity, each
bucketwheel should excavate 1.5 million bank m3 per month but the maximum
achieved to November 1983 was 0.8 Mbm3/month. The principal factors behind
poor project performance are:
(a) Unexpectedly large boulders in the overburden which have required
blasting and removal using bulldozers and trucks; large rocks
have also damaged conveyor belts.



- 37 -
ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 18
(b)  Delays in workshop construction resulting in a lack of
maintenance and repair facilities. No planned maintenance
program has been implemented.
(c)  Absence of proper inventory control and procurement planning and
consequent lick of spare parts.
(d)  Insufficient numbers of skilled workers and managers.
(e)  Inadequate project management, particularly in the areas of
contracting, remedial action and scheduling and monitoring.
(f)  Centralization of project control in Ankara, where managers have
not demonstrated the knowledge and interest necessary to
formulate and implement effective solutions to Elbistan's
problems.
1.06      Under current project management arrangements, it is highly
unlikely that the mine will be able to meet power plant feed requirements.
Provision of supplemental financing for both mine and power plant by two of
the original project financiers (IBRD and KfW) has been made contingent
primarily on exposure and monitoring of the layer of clay (gyttja) that
overlays the lignite and on the establishment of acceptable arrangements
for:
(a)  project management and implementation;
(b)  project scheduling and monitoring; and
(c)  equipment maintenance.
1.07      TKI's open pit mining operations are hampered by poor maintenance
practices and by the use of equipment that is too small. Approximately one
third of all major mining equipment and one quarter of the auxiliary
equipment was out of order in 1982. The problem was particularly severe at
the large GLI mines, where half the dump trucks were out of order- As a
result, 60Z of all overburden removal in 1982 was carried out by
contractors. Lower production costs could be achieved were TKI to divert
some of the resources allocated to opening up new mines to the
rehabilitation of existing ones. The closing of uneconomic underground
mines would also help to improve TKI's overall viability.

a/ Though TKI was responsible for hard coal production during the period
shown here, the data refers only to lignite operations.
TKI's financial position was very poor during the mid- to late-1970s but
has improved in recent years due to real increases in lignite prices, the
covering of operating losses by Government subsidies since 1978, and
Government equity contributions. Subsequent to the extensive
nationalization of the subsector in 1978, TKI's average revenue rose to
$18.4/ton in 1982 compared to $9.3/ton in 1977, with the result that TKI
had a positive net income before subsidy of $67 million in 1982 compared to
a loss of $114 million in 1977. Three of TKI's smaller enterprises that
operate underground lignite mines, however, still showed a loss in 1982 and
received subsidies totaling $24 million. TKI has severe problems in
collecting payments from customers (226 days of receivables in 1982) and
operating subsidy payments from the Government. In addition, TKI's cash
flow has been used in large part to finance the operations of the hard coal
operations (TTK), with which it was merged until 1983. Until 1979, TKI's
equity was negative due to successive years of heavy losses and absence of
significant Government contributions; by the end of 1982, due to the
improved conditions described above, equity comprised 43% of total
liabilities and the debt/equity ratio stood at 53X/47Z.
1.09      Historically, the major sources of financing for TKI's
investments have been the State Investment Bank (DYB) and the Treasury,

both providing subsidized credit. Recently, however, major sources of
financing of foreign costs have been foreign loans related to the
Afsin-Elbistan and Mugla Yatagan projects. At the end of 1982 outstanding
debt stood at $354 million, mainly related to the Afsin-Elbistan project.
TKI is currently contracting approximately US$218 million of suppliers'
credits through the US Eximbank for the purchase of equipment for its major
open pit projects. Given TKI's current financial situation, it will have
to rely on Government-guaranteed loans for project financing at least in
the medium term future.
E.   Investment Program
1.10      TKI's 1984-88 investment program includes expenditures on 15
major lignite projects totaling 51 Mtpy of run-of-mine production, of which
20 Mtpy will come from the Afsin Elbistan project. Most projects are
associated with power plants under construction, or to be constructed, by
TEK. The total estimated 5-year cost of the program is $2.1 billion (1983
prices, excluding escalation), of wlich 75% is for new mines and 25Z for
equipment renewals in existing mines. The average expenditure rate of $429
million per year envisaged exceeds thv. investment rate of about $200
million (1983 prices) over the last three years. It is likely that project
implementation will be slower than forecast by TKI and, consequently, that
investment expenditures will not reach the levelp projected, mainly as a
result of TKI's lack of project implementation experience and the
difficulties it has in attracting qualified staff. In addition, shortage
of local cost financing is likely to contribute to project delays. Whereas
TKI foresees completion of all 15 projects by 1988, the likelihood is that
at most half of the projects would have reached the production phase.
1.11      TKI's investment planning procedures and mechanisms for
coordinating lignite mine development with TEK's associated power plants
are weak. The lignite investment program contains a number of projects
that are uneconomic when compared with the option of importing steam coal
to fire coastally located power plants. However, lignite investment
decisions are made on the basis of competitiveness with fuel oil-fired
power stations, which are a more costly alternative than imported coal.
Improvements in TKI's planning techniques are required in order to avoid
investments in uneconomic mines.
F. Lignite Prices
1.12      Lignite prices are regulated by the Ministry of Finance and HENR,
in line with the designation of lignite as a 'basic commodity.'
Currently, pithead prices are set for each grade of lignite by reference to
its calorific value and its form (run-of-mine, washed/unwashed and lump
size). Additional charges are levied for transportation to urban
stockpiles and delivery to consumers' premiees. A two-tier price structure
is in force, with lignite sold for domestic (heating) use priced about 40%
below that sold to industry.
1.13      As noted above (para 1.08), there have been substantial increases
in lignite prices subsequent to the nationalizations of the late-1970s.
The Government's current policy is to eliminate the operating subsidies



- 40 -                           ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 18
paid to TKI enterprises while protecting domestic consumers, which account
for 36% of sales, from rapid price rises. In June 1983, lignite for
industrial use was priced at about 55% of the estimated landed cost of
imported steam coal, on a heat equivalent basic, while lignite for domestic
use was priced at 332 of this cost. There are sound economic and financial
reasons for raising lignite prices in real terms. However, this issue
should be addressed in the context of a study of the opportunity cost of
lignite in Turkey and a review of TKI's investment plans and planning
procedures (para 1.11).
G. Need for Technical Assistance
1.14      TKI needs technical assistance in several areas if it is to
operate its mines eff'ciently and expand output rapidly to meet the lignite
feed requirements of existing and planned power stations. The priority
areas for such assistance are outlined below.-/
(a) Manpower Planning and Training. Given the restraints on its
operations caused by insufficient numbers of qualified employees
(para 1.10), a more structured approach to manpower planning and
training is required. This would involve identifying manpower
requirements based on long-term corporate plans, identifying the
likely sources of manpower and developing training programs
designed to meet the needs for skilled workers, staff and
managers.
(b) Operational Planning and Intra-Company Coordination. Both TKI
headquarters and establishment mine managers lack the basic
information and analyses that would help them in improving the
planning and management of operations. The accounting system is
not well suited for analytical and control purposes and no
analysis of the financial implications of alternative production
and investment strategies is carried out. A thorough review and
upgrading of TKI's management information systems in all areas of
its operations needs to be carried out.
(c)  Mine Operations Management.  TKI could take advantage of modern
management techniques to reduce operating costs and increase
output to the maximum extent possible. Examples of areas which
could benefit from expert assistance are: goal-setting and
follow-up, scheduling of stripping operations, more effective use
of contractors, better scheduling and control of auxiliary
personnel, improved utilization of engineers, maintenance
planning and control systems, and inventory control. Most of the
changes require little investment and have potential for high
payback.
(d)  Project Preparation and Investment Planning.  Project feasibility
work could be improved through consideration of a wider range of
technical alternatives and analysis of their cost implications at
1/   Detailed terms of reference for the technical assistance are provided
in Anrex VI.

ANNEX IV
Page 7 of 18
the design stage. In addition, overall Investment planning and
selection procedures need improvement with the imported coal
option being used as a benchmark where justified (para 1.11).
(e) Project Implementation and Management. TKI's skills in this area
are weak and insufficient to implement the large number of
projects in the investment program within the time scale
envisaged (para 1.10). More decentralization of decision-making
and financial authority to the project implementing enterprises,
including authority to contract external assistance, is
required. Use of such assistance, in conjunction with improved
project management structures, could augment TKI's project
implementation capacity and lead to a transfer of know-how.
(f) Pricing Policy. Lignite pricing policy is not based on firm
economic and financial principles and, consequently, is not
integrated into the investment decision process (para 1.13). TKI
and the Government could use technical assistance in developing a
sound pricing policy based on the opportunity cost of lignite,
the financial requirements of TKI and the prices of other forms
of energy.
1.15      The technical assistance to be provided under the proposed
Project will cover items (a), (b) and (c) outlined above. The manner in
which the needs of other areas identified (items (d) to (f)) should be
addressed will be discussed with TKI and the Government in the context of
further loans to TKI.

II. SUMERBANK 2/
A. Background
2.01      Sumerbank (SB) was founded in 1933 as one of the original State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs) in Turkey with operations in banking,
manufacturing and retailing. Until recently it manufactured a variety of
products including textiles, building materials, ceramics, leather goods,
chemicals and vegetable oil, besides operating a small banking division.
After the reorganization of SEEs in Turkey, Sumerbank's future operations
will be limited to banking, textile operations (in cotton, wool and
garments), leather manufacturing and related retailing. Apart from its
headquarters in Ankara, the company operates some 19 cotton and 8 wool
textile mills, 6 shoe and leather manufacturing mills, 44 banking branches,
and a retail organization with 17 district centers with related warehouses
and about 470 retail shops throughout Turkey; the company employs about
36,000 persons.
2.02      Like most other SEEs in Turkey, SB has had to satisfy a number of
sometimes conflicting objectives. In addition to profit maximization, it
has also been charged with social goals such as the provision of
mass-consumption goods (mainly textiles) to the rural and urban poor
segments of the population; stabilization of prices; provision of
employment in underdeveloped regions; and training of industry personnel
sometimes beyond its own requirements. The conflicting objectives have
exacerbated management problems and have affected operating efficiency and
financial performance adversely. Low salaries (less than half of those in
the private sector), limited management autonomy and overstaffing have
contributed further to these problems. Under the new framework of SEE
reform, however, SB is expected to be more oriented toward its business
objectives, including efficiency improvement and profit maximization.
B. Organization and msnagement
2.03      SB is fully owned by the Government and operates under the
framework of SEE laws and regulations described in the President's Report
(para 38). It is subject to overall supervision by the Prime Minister's
office and its activities and financial position are reviewed and audited
by the Supreme Board of Audit. SB's investment and financing plans are
approved yearly by the Council of Ministers, while SB's Board (para 2.05)
makes recommendations regarding the company's operating budgets.
2.04      SB operates like a holding company with a headquarters
organization in Ankara, which controls all operating enterprises
(para 2.01), including 28 wholly owned and 3 majority owned companies. In
addition, SB has minority participations in some 40 other companies. Its
banking operations are placed directly under its headquarters organization
and perform the holding function of SB, by holding a major portion of the
2/   Further details on Sumerbank are available in the Staff Appraisal
Report on Sumerbank Cotton Textile Rationalization Project, April 1980
(Report No. 2887-TU) and in Industry Department files.

Page 9 of 18
company's equity and channeling most of the short- and long-term debt to
the operating enterprises largely in the form of inter-company receivables.
2.05      Since the recent SEE reorganization, SB is headed by a
five-member Board of Directors comprising a chairman, who is also the
company's General Director, and four members, who are appointed by the
Government. The new Board is intended to be more policy-oriented with less
involvement in day-to-day operations than was previously the case.  Three
Assistant General Directors, who are appointed by the Board, report to the
General Director. The operating enterprises are separate legal entities
and profit centers and are governed by management committees which are
appointed by the SB Board.
2.06      The new organizational structure of the company, which will
reflect the provisions of the new SEE law, is still under review and should
be finalized shortly. It is expected that the role of the headquarters
organization (HQO) will be reduced somewhat with a delegation of authority
to the operating enterprises. The HQO will be primarily involved in
overall coordination of SB's operations, including policy formulation and
overall planning and control. As a result, staffing of the HQO would be
limited. The company's management has decided also to reorganize its
marketing organization, including sales. In marketing, headquarters would
have the authority for establishing the overall marketing strategy, sales
planning and pricing, and overall coordination for such marketing functions
as sales, sales promotion and product development. As part of the
reorganization, SB's present Sales and Purchasing Division (ASH), which
operates the company's retail network, would implement the company's
marketing strategy and strengthen its present sales functions. ASK's
purchasing function would be separated and transferred from Istanbul to
Ankara HQO, and it would be responsible only for sales, including retail,
export and public sales, sales promotion and market research as the
company's new Sales and Retail Division (SRD).
C. Recent Operations and Financial Situation
2.07      SB's main emphasis has always been on textile manufacturing, both
cotton and wool. In the early 1980s, textiles accounted for about 80% of
SB's sales revenue, and for 15-20% of the country's textile production. SB
also accounted for about 19% of investment in the textile sector, 17% of
value added and 13% of employment. Unlike the private sector, SB sells
most of its textile production thro,-gh its own ASM retail network to
low-income groups in urban and ruil areas. Consequently, there is little
direct competition between SB and the private sector whose production is
generally aimed at higher income groups. The other SB manufacturing
operations, now limited to leather products, have had less impact on the
Turkish economy. Likewise, SB's banking operations with some 44 branches
throughout Turkey is comparatively small and serves essentially to provide
banking facilities to SB personnel and to channel credits to SB
manufacturing facilities (para 2.04).
2.08      Production of SB facilities was fairly stagnant during 1978-81 in
most product groups, but improved in 1982 as can be seen from the following
table:

2.10      Financial performance deteriorated between 1979 and 1982 as shown
above.  SB's cottonI operations were. the major reason for declining
profitability.  The mainl factors included a depressed textile market which
forced SB to sell off its large inventories below cost, as well as the
general level of sellLng prices lagging behind cost increases; increasing
labor costs without accompanying productivity increases; and higher
interest pavments dtue to increaseis in working capital and investment
requirements. In 1983, however, SB's financial performance improved
substantially due in large part to a favorable turnaround in cotton and
wool operations (both in domestic and export markets) with a profit
expected for the year.3/' The overall financial struccure of SB throughout
the early 1980s has been quite satisfactory with current ratio above 1.0
and debt/equity ratio below 50:50. Further improvements are expected
following the cutiversion of Treasury and Central Bank debt of about
TL 45 billion into equity carried otut as part of the recent SEE
restructuring, as well as a revaluation of assets recently carried out by
SB. The Government also increased SB's nominal capital to TL 70 billion.
Historically, SB financed much of its financial needs through low interest
government funds mostly on a short-term basis. Following the Government's
new policy, howeve., such funds will not be available and SB will require
greater financial discipline.  The new SEE framework should provide greater
freedom for SB to achieve this, including the setting of its own selling
prices and increased incentives for realizing efficiency improvements.
D. Rationalization and Modernization Program
2.11      In 1983, SB with Bank assistance prepared a comprehensive
Rationalization and Modernization Program (RMP) which included a physical
rehabilitation program for its cotton textile operations and related
organizational improvements of the company. The RH? was designed to:
'i) increase efficiency and capacity utilizaticn of existing cotton plant
facilities; (ii) reduce production costs; (iii) improve product quality;
and (iv) improve tne institutional and management framework of SB's cotton
textile operations. The RMP will increase SB's cotEon production without
engaging in any real capacity expansion, but rather by more economic use
and modernization of existing facilities through provision of spare parts
and modern machine assemblies, replacement of obsolete equipment, increase
in standardization in certain plants, and improved maintenance practices
through training. Furthermore, the RMP includes a technical assistance
program to improve management effectiveness through improvements in
operations, quality control, financial systems, incentive systems, the
establishment of an autonomous Cotton Textile Division (CTD), and
improvements in marketing and pricing. The Bank is financing through a
$83 million lcan the first phase of the RMP whose total cost is about
$131 million and which covers the period 1980-85. The project has been
designed to provide a base for the second phase of RMP which would
conclude the modernization of the remaining facilities; result in further
production increases and improved labor and machine productivity; and would
address longer term structural changes, notably in finishing and garment
manufacturing.
3/   After 11 months, profits before tax for cotton and wool operations
amounted to TL 2.3 billion, as against a loss of TL 1.2 billion in
1982.

2.12      The Phase I project is expected to be completed by mid-1985,
which represents a delay of about one and a half years from appraisal
estimates due to delays ir Bank loan effectiveness and staffing of the
Project Implementation Unit. Progress under the project has been
satisfactory; all engineering work has been completed and it is expected
that all contracts for spares and equipment will be placed before mid-1984,
with delivery stretching through the first quarter of 1985. Urgently
required spare parts have already been delivered and appear to have had a
beneficial effect on the quality and volume of production as well as export
performance. No cost overrun in US dollar terms is expected, although
local costs in Turkish Lira terms are substantially higher than appraisal
estimates due to higher than estimated domestic inflation.
2.13      The technical assistance program under the project includes
assistance in project management (mostly for engineering, scheduling,
procurement and erection, and project cost control). Furthermore
substantial operational technical assistance (OTA) is provided for training
of plant technical and management personnel; upgrading of SB's training
facilities; improved production planning; product development; the
establishment of a system for inter-mill comparison; and a study of labor
incentive systems. The financial technical assistance (PTA) provided under
the project has focussed on the establishment of a cash management system
for the company; the introduction of an improved cost accounting system in
a pilot mill which is planned to be introduced in other mills as well; and
an analysis of SB's budgeting systems. Overall implementation of technical
assistance has been hampered by the lack of sufficient counterparts and
qualified local consultants. Concerning the establishment of a Cotton
Textile Division, foreseen under the project, its functions are now mainly
included in a new Textile and Garment Industry Division in SB Headquarters.
E. Areas for Further Technical Assistance
2.14      Further areas for technical assistance for SB which will be
addressed under the Technical Assistance Project include (i) modernization
and rationalization of sales and retail organization; (ii) improvement of
management information systems; and (iii) a feasibility study for
reorganization and modernization of wool operations.4/
2.15      Inprovements in the organization and operation of SB's sales and
retail functions are now required. Although the large retail network of
SB's present retail and purchasing division (ASM) rhould, given its reach
and its possibility to make use of economies of scale in warehousing and
distribution, constitute a major advantage over the private sector textile
industry, which sells mostly through independent wholesalers, the system
has been costly and inflexible. This is the result of the lack of proper
planning and control of shipments and inventories, an inadequate market
information system, a poor organization of warehousing facilities and
retail stores, inadequate geographical distribution of stores, and a lack
of sales promotion. Furthermore, as a result of Sumerbank's policy as an
SEE to provide its products at low prices to the poor, it is supporting
41   Detailed terms of reference for these three components are provided in
Annex VI.

numerous retail shops in rural areas, many of which are operating at a
loss, and is also contributing to logistical problems. The lack of an
incentive system for its sales personnel has further contributed to these
problems. As a result of the above deficiencies and an increased
competition, Sumerbank's customer image has deteriorated, its market share
for its main products has fallen (e.g., for cotton textiles from 30X in
1970 to 15% in 1982), leading to high inventory levels, low turnover,
misshipments and increasing costs of distribution and retail. In order to
address these deficiencies and Improve efficiency, the project includes
technical assistance to modernize and rationalize SB's sales and retail
organization. This task will also benefit from the introduction of an
improved management information system (para 2.16).
2.16      To strengthen efforts for upgrading of management systems under
the ongoing RMP (para 2.11), the project will include technical assistance
to assist SB in identlfying and implementing necessary improvements in its
management information and related data processing systems both at the
headquarters level and in the manufacturing units, banking and retail
operations. Presently, the development of appropriate Management
Information Systems (MIS) is at an infant stage In Sumerbank and the
present MIS operates almost totally on a manual basis. Furthermore,
Sumerbank's existing management information system is not selective in the
presentation of information and burdens higher level management with
excessive data that is not geared to information requirements at the
different levels in the organization to support decision-making and
control. Finally, the organization for the development and management of a
proper MIS in Sumerbank is inadequate. To address the above deficiencies,
Sumerbank has decided to develop and implement an improved MIS. The
overall improvement of SB's HIS will be carried out in two phases,
including a first pilot phase and a second phase which will extend
implementation of the MIS to other parts of the company. The project will
cover work to be carried out in the pilot phase during 1984-86.
2.17      Following the modernization of SB's cotton operations under the
RMP (para 2.11), SB's main priority in textiles is now the modernization of
its woolen and worsted textile operations. Sumerbank accounts for about
12% of Turkey's production of wool products which are manufactured in 8
plants. Sumerbank employs about 7,200 persons in its wool plants.
Sumerbank's present wool operations are constrained by outdated and
worn-out equipment, poor maintenance and quality control, and inadequate
management control systems, which has resulted in low productivity,
underutilization of capacity and poor quality. The project includes
technical assistance for the execution of a feasibility study to modernize
SB's wool operations.

III. TURKIYE CUMHURIYETI DEVLET DEMIRYOLLARI
ADAPAZARI VAGON SANAYII MUESSESESI (TCDD-ADVAS)
A. Background
3.01      TCDD-ADVAS, located at Adapazari, is one of three main
workshops/manufacturing establishments belonging to the Turkish State
Railways (TCDD) that are responsible for the manufacture, repair and
maintenance of TCDD's rolling stock. It specializes in the manufacture,
repair and maintenance of passenger coaches. Two other establishments, at
Eskisehir and Sivas, are siiailarly responsible for locomotives and freight
wagons, respectively.
3.02      TCDD-ADVAS was established In 1951 originally for the purpose of
repair and maintenance of passenger coaches and freight wagons. In 1962,
its activities were extended to include manufacture of passenger coaches.
Subsequently, its repair activities for freight wagons were gradually
phased out. Currently, TCDD-ADVAS's principal activities are the
following:
(a) manufacture of passenger and mail coaches;
(b) periodic repair and maintenance of TCDD's entire fleet of
passenger coaches, and
(c) manufacture of spare parts and sub-assemblies needed for repairs
of passenger coaches for supply to the various regional operating
units.
B. Organization and Management
3.03      TCDD-ADVAS is a fully owned establishment of TCDD.  Under
TCDD-ADVAS's statutes, it is a separate legal entity from TCDD. However,
major aspects of its operations and management are subject to TCDD's review
and control. Thus, TCDD determines TCDD-ADVAS's annual work program,
budget and the prices of its products. TCDD's prior approval is also
required for (i) any loans from individuals or financial institutions;
(ii) hiring of any personnel other than temporary staff; and
(iii) promotions and bonuses given to personnel. Purchases and sales of
goods and services by the establishment are to be made in accordance with
the appropriate laws, regulations, guidelines provided by TCDD and relevant
decisions of TCDD's Board of Directors. TCDD's Directorate of
Establishments supervises TCDD-ADVAS (along with the two other
establishments at Eskisehir and Sivas).
3.04      TCDD-ADVAS is managed by a five-member Managing Committe..  The
Director and two Assistant Directors (in charge of technical and
financial/economic matters, respectively) are appointed by TCDD. The other
two members include a senior officer of the Company and an elected labor
representative. The Committee is responsible for the day-to-day operatio:-s
of the Company within the relevant TCDD guidelines and regulations
applicable in its case and for making recommendations to TCDD's Board of
Directors in case of the major aspects indicated in para 3.03 above.

C. Operations and Financial Situation
3.05      TCDD-ADVAS's production facilities conslat of a main plant
building (enclosed area about 52,500 22) divided Into areas for component
manufacture, now pasonger coach manufacture, component repair and
passenger coach repair. The main plant building is supported by auxiliary
facilities including an adminimtration building, social facilities, power
plant, material storehouses, compressed air plant, oxy-acetylans generator
plant, wood mill and upholstery shop. The plant produces passenger coaches
of welded construction with an annual capaclty of about 70 units depending
upon the specific product mix. Since 1979, the Company has also been
manufacturing self-propelled electric motor train units (EMU.) for commuter
traffic under license rrom Alathom (France). Domestic content in its
production varied from 65Z (EMUs) to 95X (passenger coaches). The
construction of new passenger and other coaches is carried out concurrently
with the construction and rehabilitation of component parts and the
repair/malntenance of exiating passenger coaches (annual capacity around
1,200 coaches). The plant also provides new and repaired component parts
for repairs to passenger coaches to various operating units of TCDD at
other locations. Component manufacturing includes a variety of cutting,
forming, machining and finishing operations on metals, wood, fabrics and
plastics. Most of these operations are performed on manually operated
machines and tools. Practically all products umade by the Company,
including bogies, are fabricated. There are no facilities for forging and
casting. Specialty items such as air brake controls, axle roller bearings,
electrical equipment and buffers are purchased. The Company employs about
2,700 persons of whom about 120 are technicians.
3.06      Selected aspects of TCDD-ADVAS's performance since 1979 are
summarized in the following table:

Annual production of passenger and other coaches has generally varied
between 44 to 52 units since 1980 (though, depending upon the product mix,
the plant has an annual capacity of about 70 units). This has included
production of between 24 (1982) to 42 (1980) units of EMUs. In addition,
the Company has also been repairing, on average, about 1,000 passenger
coaches per year.
3.07      The Company's revenues in 1982 were about TL 3,253 million
(US$20 million equivalent), of which its manufacturing activities
contributed about 52Z and its repair/maintenance activities about 48%, and
were projected to reach about TL 4,662 million (US$21 million equivalent)
in 1983. Net income was negative during the period 1979-82 with a small
loss of about TL 30 million (US$0.2 million equivalent) in 1982. Prices of
TCDD - ADVAS's products are determined by TCDD on the basis of projected
production and overhead costs plus an agreed margin (currently, around 2%).
D. Development Plans
3.08      TCDD - ADVAS's development plans include an expansion program to
expand its manufacturing capacity to about 120 units per year by 1990 for
which plans are currently being made to expand the area of the
manufacturing/repair facilities by about one-third. Concurrent with the
envisaged future expansion of its manufacturing activities, its
repair/maintenance activities are expected to be gradually decreased as new
facilities are created for this purpose. (A new facility for passenger
coach repair is being constructed at Afyon with completion expected around
1987. A second facility was planned to be constructed at Malatya but its
implementation is being reviewed and may be delayed).

E. Need for Technical Assistance
3.09      TCDD - ADVAS's productivity and operating efficiency are being
adversely affected by a number of constraiurs that are sought to be
addressed through the technical assistance being provided under the
Project.5/
(a) Facility Organization and Layout. The main plant building is
generally divided into areas for component manufacture, new
passenger coach manufacture, component repair and passenger coach
repair/maintenance which a-tivities are all carried out
concurrently. The work areas are congested and the flow of
ope:ations can be considerably improved with improvements in
layout and in operational techniques and procedures;
(b) Operations Planning and Scheduling. Improvements are needed in
(i) systematic planning and control of manufacturing and repair
operations; e.g. repairs involve all types of passenger coaches
and there is no attempt to run a program by repair stations nn a
production basis and repair work appears to proceed on a random
basis with essentially all types of repairs being performed at
one location; and (ii) operations monitoring and control against
plans that tuld permit the timely identification of deviations
and their causes and the undertaking of appropriate remedial
action;
(c)  Cost Estimation and Work Study.  The operations planning and
scheduling group is relatively new and is in the process of
establishing work flow and job standards; consequently there is
no reliable basis, at present, for cost estimation and operations
planning/scheduling; such a basis needs to be urgently developed;
(d) Planning, Design and Research. The planning, design and research
group is mainly involved in the production of working drawings
for passenger and other coaches and assemblies with little
emphasis on more advanced design and research for future
production; assistance is also required in determining measures
to deal with certain persistent problems, e.g. corrosion of
passenger and other coaches, difficulties in painting of coach
bodies and in design of improved screen couplers;
(e) Inventory Management and Control. Material inventory control is
performed manually with a stockbook and card index system and
there is scope to improve this by appropriate automation. The
present system is cumbersome and time-consuming, and given the
Company's large inventory of raw materials, spare parts and
components, does not provide timely and accurate information for
efficient inventory management and control; and
5/   Detailed terms of reference for the technical assistance are provided
in Annex VI.



- 52 -
ANNEX IV
Page 18 of 18
(f) Training Facilities. Training of personnel is largely restricted
to training of apprentices to skilled trades at a vocational
school established by the Company but needs to be strengthened
for other personnel.
3.10      At present, the Company does not have a computer system.  The
technical assistance to be provided is expected to determine an appropriate
computer system and the associated training of the Company's personnel
required to support the planned improvements in items (b), (c), (d) and (e)
above.

TURKEY - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT FOR STATE ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
This Annex contains shortened versions of the Terms of Reference
(TORs) for the technical assistance to be provided under the Project to
TKI, Sumerbank and TCDD-ADVAS (the complete TORs are available on the
Project Files). The TORs below set out the objectives of the technical
assistance, scope of work to be undertaken, time schedule, consultant
manpower requirements, and counterpart staff and facilities to be provided
by the beneficiaries. Background information on each beneficiary was given
earlier in Annex IV.
I. TURKIYE KOMUR ISLETMELERI (TKI)
I.1 TKI-Terms of Reference for Management Information
Systems and Procurement Practices Study
A. Objectives
1.        The purpose of this study is to assist TKI in the upgrading of
the management information systems (HIS) of its operating enterprises and
headquarters office and to improve TKI's procedures for the procurement of
equipment, materials and spare parts. The study should address the
situation from tbree points of view:
(a) The MIS requirements of TKI's operating enterprises,
concentrating on the largest enterprises;
(b) The MIS requirements of TKI's headquarters, taking into account
TKI management's long-term plans for the decentralization of
responsibilities to the individual enterprises; and
(c) Procurement, approvals and receiving processes at Tm 'a
headquarters and at operating enterprises.
The resulting MIS should be able to provide proper and timely information
that:
(1) Monitors the progress and costs of new mines and investment
projects under development;
(ii) Allows more effective evaluation of TKI's operations and
activities related to mines in commercial production;
(iii) Permits evaluation of activities relating to maintenance and
to the supply of materials and equipment;
(iv) Supplies information on cash flows;



- 57 -
ANNEX VI
Page 2 of 27
(v) Allows the development of appropriate lignite pricing
procedures and policies; and
(vi) Improves the basis for decision-making in strategic planning
and enhances the planning process.
The upgraded MIS design should be capable of accurately recording the
various cost inputs from all aspects of TKI's operations and should readily
provide the wide range of data needed to assist management in planning
operations and in making financial decisions. In addition, the MIS should
include information that directly addresses those factors that TKI's top
management judges to be critical to the success of the enterprise. The
system must also have the flexibility to adapt as circumstances modify
those factors.
2.        The review of procurement practices would have as its objective
the preparation of detailed recommendations for streamlining the
procurement process on emergency spares and on all equipment or spare
parts.
3.        During the study, the consultant groups will assist TKI in the
implementing as much of the new MIS as is practical, and of implementing
the improved procurement regulations after their approval by TKI, within
the time limits planned for the study. This assistance will include: (i)
training TKI staff in the new procedures for developing information and for
utilizing system outputs, and (ii) preparing instruction manuals describing
system operation and detailed procedures. The manuals will be in Turkish
and in English, as will all reports produced during the study.
4.        Because TRI has a largely manual MIS system at present, it is
highly unlikely that this study will result immediately in an automated
system relying heavily on computers. However, the study should provide
guidance for the eventual automation of the system and should assist in
some appropriate first steps toward broader use of computers.
Specifically, the study should include:
(i) Development of a strategy for eventual transition to
increased use of automation in the MIS system; and
(ii) Recommendation of the appropriate microcomputer and software
to assist TKI in the rapid improvement of its financial
planning techniques, and assistance in implementing the use
of the microcomputer.
B. Scope of Work
5.        The study will be performed in two phases.  During the first
phase, the consultants shall conduct a detailed analysis to determine TKI's
current practices in the areas of financial planning, general and cost
accounting, operations information systems during project execution and
during normal commercial operations, lignite pricing and procurement.
Three months after contract signature, the consultants will present a



- 58 -
ANNEX VI
Page 3 of 27
report detailing their findings and proposing any necessary changes to the
subsequent work plan. During the second phase of work, the consultants
shall develop a detailed MIS system design, with appropriate documentation,
develop recommendations for improved procurement procedures, and assist TKI
in implementing the system and procedures to the fullest extent practical
during the duration of the study. The work shall address five major areas:
accounting for project construction, accounting for ongoing commercial
operations, reports for top management, strategy for automation, and
foreign equipment and spare parts procurement.
(1) Information Systems for Project Construction
6.        The consultants will investigate the controls and accounting
procedures currently applied in TKI's subsidiaries for the construction of
new projects, determine those areas in which improvements can be made, and
specify the improvements. The consultants' work should cover, but not be
limited to, the following topics:
(a) Project cost monitoring systems for accurate and timely recording
of construction costs, taking into account the recording of
commitments entered into, expenditures against commitments, and
the uncommitted amount in comparison with the approved
construction budget;
(b) Construction reporting systems to advise on the physical progress
of projects;
(c) Critical Path Method (CPM) systems used to analyze project
progress, the mechanisms to update these analyses and methods for
determining trade-offs between costs and time;
(d) Preparation and maintenance of updated capital expenditure
budgets as needed by enterprise managements and TKI's
headquarters management;
(e) Development of a material and equipment tracing system to
determine the status of procurement, shipping and delivery of all
material and equipment required for investment projects.
(2) Information Systems for Operations
7.        The consultants will investigate and redesign, where necessary,
the information systems currently used by TKI to monitor normal commercial
operations. The topics to be covered are:
(a) The adequacy of TKI's financial accounting system and the
timeliness of the information it supplies to TKI's management;
the consultants will review the components of the current system
and the formats in which information is presented by the
operating enterprises to their management and within TKI's
headquarters to its management. Procedures and mechanisms for
increasing the timeliness of accounting information and for



- 59 -
ANNEX VI
Page 4 of 27
improving the use of analytical techniques in the timely
collection of accounts receivable, the settlement of accounts
payable, pricing practices and other identified areas will be
examined.
(b) TKI's cost accounting and control system, which classifies
accounts into production-related and period costs and details
cost centers.  The cost accountlng system should be able to
generate information for assigning responsibility, for measuring
labor and input productivity against standards, for the analysis
and control of cost variances from standards, and for determining
TKI's level of profitability so that pricing decisions can be
taken with the full knowledge of costs.
(c)  KST's 1/ billing procedures and their related information
flows. Recommendations for improvements in these procedures
should be made that will lead to reduction in the billing cycle
and, hence, the level of accounts receivable, and to more timely
information on the geographical pattern of lignite demand. The
benefits of increased billing automation should be investigated.
gd) Purchasing and inventcry control systems for materials, equipment
and spare parts. Include recommendations for a comon TRI-wide
parts numbering system; reports on stock status, usage analysis,
order cycle time analysis, purchase order status, vendor
capabilities and performance, and procedures for establishing and
adjusting target stock levels, re-order points and re-order
quantities. Include any modifications needed to apply these
systems at new mine projects.
(e) Analytical techniques related to production activities, linking
the sales activities and the coal stocks situation to coal
production activities in the operating enterprises. This area
should be upgraded to provide management with timely relevant
information on actual and planned production levels, actual and
forecast coal sales levels, coal inventories, coal quality,
transportation requirements, materials and input requirements,
and their financial implications.
(f) TKI's financial planning system, including the preparation and
use of the annual operating and investment budgets. TKI's
financial planning procedures should be improved through the
design and implementation of a financial forecasting system
involving the preparation of rolling multi-year operating and
investment plans for each operating company and headquarters.
This system should be integrated with TKI's system of accounts to
permit reconciliation of forecasts with results. The annual
operating expense budget and capital expenditure budget systems
should be examined for compatibility with existing and
1/ XST is the enterprise responsible for sales and distribution of all
TKI lignite.

ANNEX VI
Page 5 of 27
recommended accounting practices and Integration into the
financial planning system. The methods TKI currently uses to
gather and compare actual financial results with the budget, and
the frequency with which the budget is updated should be examined
and improvements recommended, if necessary. As part of the
process of upgrading financial planning, the consultants should
provide TKI's financial staff with training on the use of a
microcomputer and associated software to be purchased as part of
the technical assistance project, and which will permit rapid
improvement of financial planning and provide TKI with experience
in automation of management information processing.
(g)  Analytical reports and models for operations managers, providing
routine summary information on performance of organizational
units and equipment and more detailed information and models for
analysis of problems. This information might include items such
as:
') Working, idle and downtime hours and production for each
piece of equipment;
(ii) Overall mechanical and electrical availability of equipment,
specific causes for breakdowns, reliability of major
equipment components, etc.;
(iii) Activity by area, such as meters of advance in underground
developments or cubic meters removed in each stripping
project;
(iv) Absenteeism, overtime, and other personnel records;
(v) Safety data; and
(vi) Mine planning, ventilation system design, truck assignment,
railway simulations, hydrology and other engineering models.
(3) Reports for Top Management
8.        The top management group at TKI is likely to need information
that is (a) different and/or (b) highly condensed and summarized when
compared to the reports and information that will be generated in the
mainstream of an MIS system. Accordingly, the consultant group shall
address the information needs of top management as a discrete effort.
A major part of this effort will be to identify the few factors that top
management judges to be most critical to the success of TKI and then to
develop information and reports on the status of those critical factors.
A second part will be to recommend appropriate formats and contents for
reports to summarize trends in key performance indicators that have
long-term significance. The consultants shall also recommend procedures to
see that reports for top management are modified (and unnecessary reports
deleted) as the list of factors critical to success changes over time.

(4) Developing a Strategy for MIS Automatlon
9.        The consultants wlll evaluate the desirability of increasing the
use of autouaced data processing and telecommunications equipment at each
Establishment and at TKI hesdquarters. Assuming such Increased use does
seem desirable, the consultants will recommend a strategy for automating.
This strategy will address the following issues, and others as appropriate:
(a) What systems or sub-systems are most appropriate for automation,
and In what priority?
(b) How should data processing responsibilities be divided between
TII headquarters and the Estsblishments?
(c) What controls, if any, are needed over the purchase of data
processing hardware?
(d)  What coordination is needed to ensure that desirable
compatibility in the development of software and in
communications protocols is developed?
(e) What mixes of equipment (main frames, microcomputers, terminals,
etc.) are likely to be most suitable?
(f) What actions should TKI take to ensure that an effective database
management system is put Into place at each Establishment and
between Establishments? and
(g) What schedules for automated system development and
implementations are feasible, assuming different levels of
funding for the automation effort?
10.       While developing the strategy recomendations, the consultant
will bear in mind the long-term goal of decentralizing TKI and will review
tentative options with TKI management to ensure that options and
recommendations are consistent with funding levels available and with other
practical considerations.
(5) Equipment and Spare Parts Procurement Procedures
11.       In parallel with the larger review of management Information
systems, the consultants will review procurement practices at TKI with
particular emphasis on the procurement of imported equipment and spare
parts so as to determine where changes may be made to procedures that will
shorten acquisition times. The main tasks envisaged for this study Till be
to:
(a) Define the present TKI procurement, approvals and receiving
process;
(b) Determine the processes used by other SEEs and by the private
sectors;



- 62 -
ANNEX VI
Page 7 of 27
(c) Evaluate the magnitude of the louses now caused by TKI's system;
(d) Recommend detailed procedures and policies for lmprovlng the
procurement process, within the current legal constraints, with
appropriate differences based on cost, item class and urgency;
and
(e) Assist in implementing the recommendations after approval by
TKI's management.
(6) The Major Tasks (Phase I and Phase II)
12.       The major tasks in the study will include, but not necessarily be
limited to, the following lLst:
Phase I
13.       During Phase I the consultants will:
(a) Review the present MIS systems at operating mines, TKI

C. Time Schedule and Manpower
15.       Final reports on procurement practices and management information
systems are expected to be completed 10 and 14 months, respectively, after
contract signature (including review of draft reports by TKI and the
Bank). Assistance in implementing the recoimendations of these reports is
expected to extend over a period ending 24 months after contract
signature. The study and implementation assistance are estimated to
require about 124 man-months of effort, of which 24 man-months of local
consultant services.
D. Personnel and Facilities to be Provided oy TKI
16.       TKI will designate a project coordinator, from the Science and
Investigations Department, and competent staff from other departments
concerned to work with the consultants. TKI will provide the consultants
with an office in its headquarters building but the consultants will be
responsible for providing the ancillary office equipment and staff
requir-d, personnel accommodations (except during field visits) and
transportation.
1.2 TKI--Terms of Reference for Training and Manpower Planning Study
A. Objectives
1.        The objectives of the study are:
(a) To assess the present needs for training and manpower development
within TKI and to evaluate existing capabilities to meet these



- 64 -
ANNEX VI
Page 9 of 27
needs. This will involve: (i) the determination of the
appropriate divisions of responsibilities for training activities
between TKI headquarters and the operating companies; (ii) a
comparison of the skills and experience levels needed in key jobs
with the typical qualifications currently available in the
workforce at each Establishment; and (iii) an evaluation of the
training and development programs at each Establishment;
(b) To define the manpower needs associated with TKI's planned
expansion of lignite production and to develop projections of
TRI's buman resource needs for five-year (1984-1988) and ten-year
(1984-1994) periods. These projections should specify the annual
manpower requirements by skill, experience and education in each
job category at each Establishment and at TKI headquarters.
Estimates of annual training needs should include projected
growth, attrition and internal reassignment of persornel; and
(c) To develop five-year (1984-1988) and ten-year (1984-1994)
training and manpower development programs. The five-year
program should specify training courses to be given, additions to
training facilities, new training aids, and audio-visual
materials and other elements needed to training and develop the
quantities of skilled personnel needed at all levels of the TKI
organization. This program should provide specific course
outlines and identify any courses or programs outside TRI that
should be included. Detailed estimates of annual costs for all
these activities are to be made for the five-year program. The
final product of this five-year program will be a plan with
enough detail to be readily implemented by TKI management. The
ten-year program will cover the same topics and will identify
longer-term needs, but will not be developed in such detail.
B. Scope of Work
2.        The study will be carried out in two phases.  During the first
phase, the consultants will review TKI's current manpower planning and
training organizations and practices. This review will include interviews
with key training and management personnel in Ankara and at a few of the
Establishments and visits to training facilities. In addition, the study
team will obtain TKI's lignite development program, to serve as a basis for
manpower projections and recommended development and training programs. At
the end of the first phase, no later than two months after contract
signing, the consultants will present to TKI a report of the findings in
this phase, including any recommendations for immediate action by TKI, any
proposed changes in the scope of work for the second phase, and a detailed
work plan for the second phase.
3.        The second phase of the study will consist of the development of
detailed manpower staffing plans and of detailed programs for manpower
development and training. Specific tasks to be carried out in the second
phase are:



- 65 -
ANNEX VI
Page 10 of 27
(1) Manpower Planning
(a) Determination of the major functional job categories for
professional staff and for vorkers. These categories would form
the basis for specifying the manpower requirements associated
with the development plan;
(b) Development of coefficients and ratios for projecting the
manpower required in each job category. These coefficients
should recognize the differences in staffing needs that will
relate to mine size, equipment mix, stage of development, mining
plan, etc. The coefficients should take into account current TRI
staffing levels, Turkish personnel laws and policies, and
realistic possibilities for changes in productivity. TXI's
headquarters staff and the headquarters of each of the operating
companies (Establishments) will be included to enable analysis of
the effects of the expansion plan on their staffing needs;
(c) Evaluation of the potential for reassignment of professional,
technical and/or hourly workers from one Establishment to mother
within TKI as development or production work increases or
decreases over time. This analysis should include a review of
the feasibility of obtaining employees' agreements to relocate,
the applicability of skills at other mines and the relative costs
of transfer versus carrying redundant employees at mines whose
oaLtput is declining;
(d) Determination of likely employee turnover rates for each job
category based on TKI experience vith well-established and newly
developed mines;
(e) Based on the foregoing analysis and the expansion plan defined in
the Phase I report, development of a manpower staffing plan for
the 1984-1994 period, taking into account the existing manpower
situation at TKI headquarters and operating companies and any
planned changes in the division of responsibilities between
headquarters and the operating companies. The plan should also
take into account the reassignment of workers and staff within
the TKI group. The plan should show the number o' positions
needed on a year-by-year basis for each job cate:gory and
experience level. Where it appears likely that jobs will have to
be filled with untrained workers, a lead time to allow for
training should be included. In addition, the plan should show
an estimate of annual recruiting needs, to reflect net additions
and anticipated turnover. The plan should reflect the
possibilities of changes in productivity from current levels and
of variations from the plan in the timing of new project
development or phase-out of old mines; and
(f) Development of an estimate of the total needs for graduating
mining engineers within Turkey and an estimate of the percentage
of these engineers that TKI is likely to be able to attract.



- 66 -
ANNEX VI
Page 11 of 27
These estimates are not to be based on detailed studies of
Turkey's non-coal mining activities, but must be realistic enough
to form a basis for comparison of TKI needs vith the capability
of Turkish universities to meet those needs.
(2)  Training
(g) Identification, review, and assessment of the existing training
activities, programs, and facilities both within TKI and in other
institutions of relevance to the lignite sector, in terms of
their qualitative and quantitative ability to satisfy present
and projected training requirements. Visits to each of the
Establishments and outside training institutes should be made in
order to review the following:
(i) the typical skill and competence levels of employees now in
each job category within TKI;
(ii) the present curriculum of training courses for each job
category;
(iii)  course content;
(iv) effectiveness of presentations;
(v) adequacy of facilities, training aids and audio visual
materials;
(vi) problems with translations of technical materials;
(vii)  effectiveness of work/study programs;
(viii) practical relevance of university courses to TKI problems;
(ix)  instructor numbers and qualifications-technically and as
trainers;
(x) possibilities for centralized courses in some subjects;
(xi) opportunities for and benefits of overseas tours and/or
internships for engineers and managers
Cxii)  possibilities for adapting existing courses to Turkish;
(xiii) opportunities for increased use of equipment vendor training
programs and/or for increased translation into Turkish of
vendor technical literature;
(xiv)  relevance of tests as measures of job competence; and
(xv) others as appropriate.



- 67 -
ANNEX VI
Page 12 of 27
(h) Analysis of each major job category to define tasks and determine
the specific skills required. Comparison of present skills of
incumbents with the requirements for competency and mastery;
(i) Development of estimates of the costs of ineffective training, in
terms of lost output and/or excessive use of labor, material and
capital resources;
(j)  Development of a comprehensive training program for both
professional staff and workers for the period 1984-1988, taking
into account identified manpower needs, existing training
capabilities and constraints. The program should detail the
investments required in facilities and materials, the internal
and external training courses needed, and the requirements for
instructors. Preparations should also be made of: course
outlines for courses to be administered within TKI; outlines for
the tests to be administered to determine job competence and
skill levels; cost estimates for the development of each module;
recommendations for development priorities for program modules;
and progress measures for use by TKI management in checking
implementation status; and
(k) Definition of the training needs of TKI beyond 1988 and
identification of new programs that might be required and/or
modifications that might be appropriate for the 5-year period
after 1988.
C. Time Schedule and Manpower
4.        A final report on zmapower planning and training is expected to
be completed 15 months after contract signature (including review of the
draft report by TKI and the Bank). The study is estimated to require about
63 man-months of effort, of which 18 man-months of local consultant
services.
D. Personnel and Facilities to be Provided by TKT
5.        TKI will designate a counterpart project coordinator, from the
Science and Investigations Department, and counterpart staff from the
Training Department and other departments concerned, to work with the
consultants. TRI will provide the consultants with office space but the
consultants will be responsible for providing the ancillary office
equipment and staff required, personnel accommodations (except during field
visits) and transportation.
I.3 TKI-Terms of Reference for Mine Operations Management Consulting
A. Objectives
1.        The objectives of this study are:



- 68 -
ANNEX VI
Page 13 of 27
(a) To identify opportunities for improving operating and management
techniques and effectiveness in any or all aspects of GLI. This
will involve a thorough review of mine operations, maintenance
programs, planning, administrative procedures, supply and
procurement programs, government regulations, training, and all
other factors affecting mine production, productivity and
production costs;
(b) To work with GLI's management to define the ehanges nerded to
realize the full potential of the improvement opportunLties and
to set goals and priorities for implementing these changes.
These goals and priorities must be set based upon a realistic
assessment of benefits, capital or other costs of implementation,
and the practical difficulties that might be encountered during
the implementation process;
(c) To work with the management of the Establishment to implement the
agreed-upon changes in a manner that will promote improved
operating results at the Establishment and strengthen the
abilities of the Establishment organization to develop and
maintain high levels of productivity and effectiveness over the
long term. The responsibility for implementation of the
improvement program will lie with M-1 and with TKI. The
consultants' role in this phase will be to: (i) monitor
progress, (ii) idenrify problems with implementation and suggest
practical solutions, (iii) provide guidance and counseling,
(iv) assist in preparing analyses for GLI and TKI management, and
(v) do whatever else is necessary to facilitate the successful
realization of the improvement program; and
(d) To prepare reports and presentations that can be used to document
the improvements actually achieved and to provide training for
managers from other establishments.
B. Scope of Work
2.        The study will be carried out in two phases.  During the first
phase, the consultants will perform an in-depth analysis of operations at
GLI and will work with management to develop a program for improvement.
This work will be completed within 6 months after contract signature.
During the 12-month second phase, the consulting team would spend no more
than about 30% of its time on the project.
3.        The specific tasks to be completed during each phase of the study
are listed below.
Phase I
(a) Review all aspects of mine and washing plant operations. Become
familiar with personnel, practices and equipment. This review
should include observations of mine operations over periods
adequate to provide representative samples of cycle times, move



- 69 -
ANNEX VI
Page 14 of 27
distances, operations sequences, blasting practices, etc.
Projections of reserves, mine plans and records of past
performance should also be analyzed. For the coal washing
operation, the review should include an analysis of the product
flows, the process equipment used, process controls, yield and
efficiency of product recovery;
(b) Review the maintenance programs for mine and plant equipment.
This reviLW should include an analysis of records on equipment
utilizations, downtime and availability. It should also include
an analysis of preventive maintenance schedules, inspection
and/or lubrication procedures, and the degree of compliance with
the preventive maintenance program. Review the systems used for
planning and scheduling maintenance repair work and the equipment
and procedures used in completing repairs;
(c) Review the spare parts and supplies procurement and inventory
control systems. This review will not include an analysis of the
steps in the procurement cycle outside GLI, i.e., at TKI
Headquarters or though any Government agencies. (That review is
to be a part of another study.) This study will focus on GLI's
processes for forecasting needs, ordering on a timely basis, and
controlling materials on site;
gd) Review the practices of GLI managers and supervisors with regard
to planning, setting objectives, making assignments and following
up on actual performance. This review will include interviews
with managers, supervisors, engineers, foremen, technicians and
others at all levels of GLI. Also, it will most likely include
observations of some of the routine meetings at GLI;
Ce) Review the reports and other information available to managers
for assessing costs and performance in meeting plans and
objectives. Document the forms used, the sources and the nature
of the information provided. This will include manual and
computer-produced inf3rmation. Note that this same type of
information is being assessed on a TKI-wide basis as part of
another study. However, the consultants on this study should be
familiar with the management information system in use at this
Establishment; the two consulting efforts should be
complementary;
(f) Review personnel administration practices and regulations,
recruitment and training, pay and promotion policies, safety and
health statistics and employee turnover data;
(g) Review any other aspects of management, administration or
technical activity at GLI that seem to have a bearing on
performance and/or costs;
(h) Based upon the analyses in the preceding steps, develop for GLI's
management a summary of the areas with potential for improvement



- 70 -
ANNEX VI
Page 15 of 27
and estimates of the degree of improvement possible (in terms of
equipment availability, cycle times, unit costs, production,
etc.) and the costs and/or problems likely to be associated with
implementing the improvements. After a review of these findings
with management, develop a proposal for a program of actions in
all areas appearing to have significant potential for improvement
and to have a realistic chance of being successfully
implemented. The program should specify objectives,
responsibilities for actions and target dates; and
(i) The approved program of action for implementing improvements will
be the final written product of this first phase of the study.
However, it is expected that implementation of some improvement
activities will begin early in the study. As opportunities are
identified and appropriate actions defined and agreed upon,
implementation should begin; the objective is to take advantage
of opportunities as quickly as is practical. The written program
of actions will be submitted to GLI and TKI management for their
approval.
Phase II
(j) Review progress in implementing the program of action. Where
there are delays and/or problems, bring these to the notice of
GLI masqa-zent and assist in developing remedies for the problems
or alternative approaches to implementation plans;
(k) Provide guidance and advice to managers or engineers at all
levels as needed to assist in any aspect of implementation;
(1) Prepare analyses, documents or presentations as appropriate to
assist GLI management in securing any needed approvals or
assistance from TKI Headquarters or from the Government;
(m) Provide periodic documentation of status, results and any
problems in implementation; and
(n)  At the end of the 12-month implementation phase, prepare a report
describing the overall approach to the project, analytical
techniques employed, opportunities identified, implementation
strategies and results. This report will document the results
and effectiveness of the consulting assistance; more importantly,
it will also serve as a basis for transferring the techniques
used and the lessons learned during the study to other TKI
Establishments. This report will be submitted La CLI and TKI
management for their approval.
C. Time Schedule and Manpower
4.        A detailed program of action is expected to be completed 6 months
after contract signature, followed by a 12-month period during which the
consultants would provide implementation assistance. The consultants'



- 71 -
ANNEX VI
Page 16 of 27
final report would be available 21 months after the start of the project.
The assistance is estimated to require about 32 man-months of effort, of
which 12 man-months of local consultant services.
D. Personnel and Facilities to be Provided by TKI
5.        The consultants will work directly with the senior management of
GLI and a counterpart staff working group will be formed to assist the
consultants. GLI will provide the consultants with office space,
accommodations and transportation, but the consultants will be responsible
for providing ancillary office equipment and staff required.
II. SUMERBANK (SB)
II.1  SB-Terms of Reference for Modernization and Rationalization
of Sales and Retail Organization
A. Objectives
1.        The overall purpose of the technical assistance is to assist
SB management in preparing an action program for modernizing and
rationalizing the management and oytrations of its sales and retail
organization to be established under its new Sales and Retail Division
(SRD) and to carry out training for SB headquarters and SRD staff in modern
marketing and sales practices in order to increase efficiency and to assure
continued and timely supply of products to its customers, while achieving
turnover and profitability targets. The technical assistance, which will
be implemented alongside a project for improvement of management
information systems in SB including SRD (Section II.2, para 1), is geared
at (i) improving SRD's management structure; (ii) rationalizing SRD's
retail and distribution network and transport facilities; (iii) developing
incentive systems for management and sales personnel; (iv) developing
policy guidelines for further development of SRD's retail network; and
(v) developing and implementing a training program for SRD staff.
B. Scope of Work
2.        The technical assistance will be provided in two stages.  The
first stage will comprise a study of Sumerbank's present sales and retail
organization and practices, and the dev'!lopment of recommendations for
improvement to be considered by SB management. The second stage will
involve the implementation of seminars for top management and a training
program of marketing, sales and retail personnel developed in the first
stage. The first stage should be finalized within four months of the
initiation of the work, while the establishment of a properly functioning
and ongoing training program should be realized in another year.

organization, an analysis of the existing management organization,
structure, and operations of SRD, followed by the development of specific
action programs in the following areas:
(a) Development of an appropriate organization structure for SRD at
different levels in the organization, including main office,
district centers, and retail outlets, in order to decentralize
relevant marketing and sales activities to districts and retail
stores, and to strengthen and develop important marketing
functions such as pricing (including mark-ups, discounting and
product costing), market research, demand forecasting, sales
promotion and product development, in support of the marketing
strategy functions in SB headquarters. The study should include
an analysis of including new regional management levels in the
organization to improve span of control, and include detailed
recommendations for the proposed organization, including
structure and job descriptions for personnel;
(b)  Recommendations for rationalizing SRD's retail and distribution
network and transport facilities to improve the distribution of
goods through the network and to eliminate loss-making outlets.
The analysis should concentrate on:
(i)  present and projected capacity utilization and profitability
of facilities;
(ii) recommendations for expansion, closure or relocation of
present facilities;
(iii)  analysis of transport facilities;
(iv) analysis and recommendations for organization, management
and staffing of warehouses and retail stores; and
(v)  recommendations to improve distribution of products from
SB mills to retail outlets in order to shorten delivery
periods and minimize inventory levels while maintaining
continuity of product supply;
(c)  Developing incentive systems for management and sales personnel
in order to improve performance, which should be based on an
analysis of the present remuneration systems in SB followed by
recommendations that can be implemented under Turkish legislation
applicable to SB. The analysis should also indicate where such
legislation could be improved to stimulate performance;
(d) Developing policy guidelines for further development of SRD's
retail network in line with SB's corporate objectives, including
recommendations concerning location, shop profitability, types of

(e)  Preparation of seminars for top management and a trainfug program
for SB and SRD marketing management and sales and retail
personnel to improve basic knowledge of modern marketing and
sales principles including such topics as general marketing
concepts, adaptation of concepts to SB and SRD, marketing
strategy and planning, sales planning, pricing, product costing,
market research, sales forecasting, product development, sales
promotion, and export marketing, including possible provision of
foreign training. For sales personnel, additional training would
be required in public and customer relations, advertising and
publicity, and sales statistics. The development of the program
should lay the basis for a continuing program which should,
following an initial period of technlcal assistance, be continued
by SB personnel.
4.        Recommendations for action programs developed in the study
covering the above areas should be specific, including recommendations for
implementation, costs, staffing and hardware requirements, time schedule,
and requirements for further technical assistance. The work to be carried
out under these terms of reference should be closely coordinated with the
activities under the project for improvement of SB's management information
systems (Section II.2, para 1). Following a review with SB management of
the study and its recommendations, the consultants will implement in the
second stage of technical assistance the training program developed in the
study and agreed vith the company.
D. Time Schedule and Manpower
5.        It is estimated that the work program described above can be
completed within about one and a half years after initiation of the work,
of which four months for finalization of the study (Stage 1), and one year
for implementation of the training program (Stage 2).
6.        The technical assistance for the two stages is budgeted to
require about 140 man-weeks of consultants' time, of which 80 man-weeks are
for the first stage and 60 man-weeks for the second stage. It is estimated
that local firms could be involved for about 25 man-weeks in the first
stage and 15 man-weeks in the second stage.
7.        SB shall designate a counterpart project team under the Research,
Planning and Coordination Department (RPCD) in SB headquarters, including
representatives of SRD, to work with the consultants during the study and
implementation of the training program. The counterpart team vill consist
of a coordinator and five personnel from SRD main office and district
offices. The consultants and counterpart team will work in close liaison
with the marketing manager in SB headquarters. The SB counterpart staff to
be assigned during the implementation of the training program are expected
to carry on the program following the finalization of consultant's work. A
steering committee in SB headquarters with representatives of various
departments involved, which will meet at least monthly, will supervise the
progress and implementation of the work and decide on future action to be
taken. In addition, SB will provide necessary support facilities in

Page 19 of 27
respect of the consultants' work, including office accommodation, ancillary
office equipment and support staff.
II.2 SB--Terms of Reference for Improvement
of Management Information Systems
A. Objectives
1.        The purpose of the technical assistance is to assist SB in the
implementation of the first pilot phase of its overall planned improvement
of Management Information Systems (MIS) for its headquarters office and
operating enterprises. The resulting MIS should be able to provide
management both at headquarters and the enterprises with proper and timely
information that allows more effective control and evaluation of SB
operations, financial position and progress on investment projects, and
should improve the basis for decision-making for planning purposes. The
technical assistance should also provide the basis for further development
of the MIS in other parts of the company following the completion of the
pilot phase.
B. Scope of Work
2.        The consultants' work should cover the basic design for an
overall improved MIS for SB, including overall hardware requirements and
capital costs, and the detailed design and implementation of a pilot
project for such improved MIS including related data processing
facilities. The work will be executed in two stages. In the first stage,
the consultants will prepare a detailed study which will analyze SB's
current HIS and information needs in selected areas (para 1), and make
recommendations for the design of a new overall MIS for SB including its
configuration, hardware and software requirements, cost, and arrangements
for imjlementation including a training program and strengthening of MIS
organizacion to manage the MIS appropriately. The design stage would be
split into (i) preparation of the basic design of the system for SB as a
whole and an appropriate organization of MIS management, and
(ii) preparation of detailed design for the MIS to be introduced in
selected pilot units in SB. Before embarking on the detailed design stage,
SB's top management would be involved to reach agreement on the
desirability of the proposed system. In the second stage, the consultant
will implement the detailed MIS concept in selected pilot units agreed with
the company, including assistance in preparing tender documents for
procurement of hardware and in installation of equipment, preparation of
software, testing the new systems and training of system users and
operators. This implementation stage would be completed when the system is
operating satisfactorily.
3.        The pilot project should cover (i) SB's headquarters; (ii) three
selected cotton and wool textile mills; (iii) ASH main office including a
district office and related warehouse and retail stores; (iv) two banking
branches; and (v) the relevant information flows among these units. The



- 75 -
ANNEX VI
Page 20 of 27
proposed systems would cover, but not necessarily be limited to, the
relevint information needs in the following areas: financial accounting,
cost accounting, financial planning and budget control, personnel
statistics and payroll, purchasing and inventory control, production
scheduling, production-related statistics, project cost monitoring, sales
statistics and forecasting, cash management system, and inter mill
comparison of operations.
4.        More specifically, in Stage 1 the work should involve the
following main activities:
(a)  Analysis of information requirements in the areas given above,
for different levels of management in the various selected
organizational units. It would involve the analysis of the
present MIS and a definition of information needs to be met by
the proposed system, including format, volume, frequency, and
distribution;
(b)  Development of basic MIS concept for SB as a whole which
could involve development of various alternatives to be
considered by SB management, including an analysis of centralized
versus decentralized systems. This step will involve the
development of a basic design of proposed MIS, including hardware
requirements, capital and operating costs;
(c)  Recommendations for appropriate organization of MIS management
and operations at headquarters and operating units;
Cd)  Presentation of basic MIS concept and organization to SB
management for approval, including seminars for top management on
merits of proposed MIS, as well as selection of units to be
involved in pilot project; and
Ce)  Detailed design of proposed pilot MIS project in selected units
including:
(i) logical systems design, which will define the relationships
between users, operators, equipment, Input, output, and
processing, as explained in appropriate systems and
programming flow charts. This step will include detailed
output design (content, form, frequency and medium of
output), input design, process design, file design and
coding;
(ii) physical systems design including definition of hardware
configuration and software needs;
(iii) capital cost and operating cost analysis, including
recommendations to buy or lease hardware, and software
requirements;
(iv) preparation of detailed implementation schedule of MIS; and



- 76 -
ANNEX VI
Page 21 of 27
(v) preparation of detailed training plan for users and
operators of the proposed system, Including provision of
possible foreign training.
Based on the above analysis, the consultants will prepare a draft report
with recommendations for the implementation of the proposed pilot MIS
project which will be reviewed by SB management and the Bank, and finalized
by the consultants thereafter.
5.        Following approval of the proposed MIS by SB management, the
consultants will implement with Sumerbank the pilot MIS project (Stage 2)
which will involve:  (i) establishment of the appropriate organization
set-up for management of the MIS; (ii) preparation of specifications and
procurement documentation; (iii) follow-up of equipment delivery and
installation; (iv) organization of seminars for top management and training
sessions for appropriate personnel, including preparation of training
manuals, and supervision of training programs for users and operators of
the system to be provided by eiipment suppliers; (v) testing and start-up
of operations of new MIS; and (vi) defining recommendations for further
implementation of SB's MIS following this pilot project. Technical
assistance under this project will be required until the pilot MIS operates
satisfactorily. Further implementation of the overall MIS would be
continued by qualified SB personnel.
D. Time Schedule and Manpower
6.        It is estlmated that the technical assistance program described
above could be completed within two and a half years after initiation of
the work, including 10 months for completion of Stage 1, and 18 months for
Stage 2.
7.        The technical assistatce for the two stages is budgeted to
require about 560 man-weeks of consultants' time, of which 175 man-weeks
would be fnr the first stage and 385 man-weeks for the second stage. The
team providing the technical assistance will ideally be composed of a team
leader (management and MIS expert), MIS experts, and system analysts. It
is estimated that local firms could be involved for about 90 man-weeks in
the first stage and 255 man-weeks in th second stage.
8.        SB shall designate a counterpart project team under the Research,
Planning and Coordination Department in SB headquarters including
representation of the Electronic Data Processing Centre to work with the
consultants during the study and implementation phases of the project. The
counterpart team will ccnsist of a coordinator and five counterparts at the
start of work, which number will increase to 20 counterparts at the start
of the second stage (implementation). Other staff will be made available
at the units in which implementation will take place. A steering committee
in SB headquarters with representatives of various departments involved in
the introduction of the improved MIS, which will meet at least monthly,
will supervise progress and implementation of the work and decide on
further steps of implementation. In addition, SB will provide necessary
support facilities in respect of the consultants' work including office
accommodations, ancillary office equipment and support staff.

TCDD-ADVAS-Terms of Reference for the Study
A. Objectives and Scope of Work
1.        The purpose of the technical assistance is to assist TCDD-ADVAS
in identifying and implementing appropriate improvements in its plant
organization, facilities, and operations that would enable it to achieve
increased productivity and efficiency. While the primary focus should be
on areas already identified by TCDD-ADVAS for study, namely, cost
estimation and work study, operations planning and scheduling,
strengthening of TCDD-ADVAS's planning, design and research capabilities,
inventory control, and plant layout/organization, the consultants should
also identify and recommend other possible improvements to organization,
facilities, and operations as appropriate to reinforce and complement those
already specified.
2.        The consultants shall conduct detailed studies (as specified
below in paras 3-9) with regard to TCDD-ADVAS's current systems for cost
estimation; operations planning and scheduling; planaing, design and
research; inventory management and control; and facility organization and
layout, supplemented by additional work as appropriate in the context of
other possible improvements identified during the course of the work.  The
work will be conducted in two phases: the first phase will include a
review of the current situation at TCDD-ADVAS, evaluation of alternatives,
recommendation of necessary measures for implementation including



- 80 -
ANNEX VI
Page 25 of 27
appropriate support equipment (e.g. a suitable computer system) to support
the improvements, and the consultants' recommendations and detailed work
plan for their implementation. These findings should be incorporated in a
draft report to TCDD-ADVAS to be submitted within four months of inception
of work. TCDD-ADVAS and TCDD, in consultation with the World Bank, will
promptly review and comment on the report. The consultants should then
finalize the report in six weeks after receipt of the comments. In the
second phase, the consultants will assist TCDD-ADVAS in selecting
appropriate support equipment, including a computer system, and in
implementing the recommendations accepted by TCDD-ADVAS and TCDD. During
f            the implementation phase, the consultants will be expected to remain at
TCDD-ADVAS or to pay regular visits as necessary to ensure successful
implementation of the program including the necessary training of
TCDD-ADVAS's personnel. The work to be carried out in the areas specified
earlier in this paragraph is further elaborated below.
3.        Cost Estimation and Work Study.  TCDD-ADVAS currently utilizes a
work study based on up to 50 work-station classifications as a basis for
operations planning and cost estimation. However, this study is not fully
developed, and TCDD-ADVAS's management and TCDD feel that there is scope
for improvements therein. The consultants shall review cud analyze the
existing material available at TCDD-ADVAS, conducting such tests and
observations as necessary for this purpose, and modify/further develop the
study as appropriate in the liL1ht of achievable improvements in
productivity and efficiency in terms of materials, labor, and overhead
inputs, and thereby provide TCDD-ADVAS with an improved and more reliable
basis for cost estimation and operations planning.
4.        Operations Planning and Scheduling.  The consultants shall review
and analyze TCDD-ADVAS's current operations planning and scheduling systems
and determine necessary improvements to increase productivity and
efficiency, including the design and implementation of an appropriate
management information system to monitor and control progress of operations
against plans, to determine causes of deviations, and to take corrective
action as necessary in a timely manner.
5.        Inventory Nanagement and Control.  TCDD-ADVAS currently e-ploys a
manual inventory management and control system. The consultants shall
review and analyze the current system and determine the necessary
improvements including, in particular, the possibility of installing an
appropriate computer system for the purpose.
6.        Organization and Layout.  The consultants shall review the
organization and layout of TCDD-ADVAS's facilities and make recommendations
for necessary improvements to improve work flow and ease of operations. In
making the recommendations, the consultants shall distinguish between
changes that can be made in the short run without major invesements and
other longer-term changes involving more substantial investments. The
consultants shall also review TCDD-ADVAS's organizational structure and
make recommendations as appropriate for improvements aimed at increasing
efficiency with a clearer definition of responsibilities and division of
work between the different fac'lities.



- 81 -
ANNEX VI
Page 2--of 27
7.        Planning, Design and Research.  The consultants shall review
TCDD-ADVASIs current capabil'ties for undertaking planning, design and
research work in the context of the changing needs for improved designs in
passenger coaches and in other TCDD-ADVAS products and assist TCDD-ADVAS's
planning, design, and research departments in strengthening their
capabilities to undertake such work. The consultants should also
specifically assist TCDD-ADVAS in (a) determining measures to deal with
corrosion problems to passenger cars; (b) improved design of wagon screen
couplers with better resistance to buffing impact; and (c) sanding
problems.
8.        Computer System.  The consultants shall evaluate alternatives
for, and recommend, as appropriate, a suitable computer system in support
of the improvements in the various areas specified above, taking into
account the question of necessary compatibility with the existing TCDD
computer network. The consultants shall develop equipment specifications
for the system, assist TCDD-ADVAS in procurement/installation of the
system, including the necessary software, and thereafter assist TCDD-ADVAS
in implementing the system including provision of the necessary training of
personnel and modifications/development of software.
9.        Other Improvements.  Apart from the areas specified above, the
consultants, in the course of their work, may determine other possible
improvements to organization, facilities, equipment, operations, and
techniques that could reinforce the improvements to the areas under
consideration.  While the primary focus should be on the areas specified,
the consultants should also make recommendations as appropriate for such
supporting improvements.
B. Implementation
10.       In carrying out the above work, especially in respect of the
areas spe_ified in paras 3 to 8, the consultants' work will include both
the identification/evaluation/recommendation of the necessary improvements
including training needs of TCDD-ADVAS personnel, and, thereafter,
assistance to TCDD-ADVAS in their implementation including the necessary
training of TCDD-ADVAS personnel and preparation of appropriate
documentation/manuals in this regard. This would require the consultants
to remain at TCDD-ADVAS or to pay regular visits as appropriate during the
implementation phase of the work.
C. Estimates and Time Schedule
11.       It is estimated that the project should be implemented within 24
months of contract signature and would involve about 80 man-months of
consultants' work including around 35 man-months of local consultants' work
should they form a part of the consultant team. The consultants submitting
the proposal should, however, feel free to offer and justify any
amendments.
D. Administrative Arrangements
12.       TCDD-ADVAS shall designate a project team, including a team
coordinator (the Director of TCDD-ADVAS), appropriately constituted in

Page 27 of 27
terms of the areas to be covered in the consultants' work, to work with the
consultants during the study and implementation phases of the project. The
TCDD-AD'VAS counterpart team will consist of at least seven appropriately
qualifie.. members with at least one from each of the departments
responsible for the areas covered in the study. The individuals and their
functional responsibilities will be clearly specified. In addition,
TCDD-ADVAS will provide necessary support facilities in respect of the
consultants' work including residential, transport, and office facilities.
TCDD will designate a section with a coordinator familiar with TCDD-ADVAS's
operations and its role in TCDD's system and development plans to monitor
the project and to interact with the consultants as necessary.
13.       During the course of the work, it may be necessary for the
consultants to confer with appropriate TCDD personnel and/or to visit
related facilities for information/discussions in connection with their
work at TCDD-ADVAS. TCDD will promptly enable and facilitate such visits,
and provide such information as the consultants may reasonably request.
