8. Compensation cost for property loss due to reservoir inundation and land
occupation of headwork and canal system is 29.1134 million RMB yuan, among
which 13.4640 million RMB yuan is for reservoir inundation losses, and 15.6494
million RMB yuan for land occupation of headwork and canal system.
9. Based on the planning, resettlement cost for rural population is 23.8903 million
RMB yuan, among which productive resettlement cost is 14.0893 million RMB yuan,
Living resettlement cost is 5.1876 million RMB yuan, and transfer transportation cost
is 243,900 RMB yuan. Therefore, the resettlement cost for rural population is
basically balanced with the compensation cost of 23.9023 million RMB yuan for rural
resettlers.

1.1.1. Staff
Staff on resettlement at all levels amounts to 154 persons, among which 3 are from
Daqiao General Hydropower Development Corporation , 2 from Liangshan
Prefecture Government, 10 from relevant counties, 49 from local townships ( 7 from
each concerned township ), 90 from villages ( 5 from each concerned village ).
Besides, the leaders of various concerned village production groups should cooperate
with concerned sections to implement resettlement programs.
1.1.2. Cost
Cost for resettlement organization operation is calculated as 3 percent of resettlement
compensation cost, totally 748,600 RMB yuan, which is listed under implementation
management cost and integrated into resettlement compensation budget.
1.2. Responsibilities
1.2.1. When the resettlement action plan is approved, the resettlement agencies of
governments will act as the legal representatives of the resettlers, and will be
responsible for protection of their legal rights and improvement of their living
standard. As the organizations with special tasks entrusted by the State, they will be
responsible for finishing the resettlement program of this project in time, in order to
ensure the project's benefits mav be achieved on time.
The scope of work involves:
(1) to follow various national polices on resettlement and to implement the
resettlement action plan for this project.

2. Legal Framework, Principles and
Preferential Policies
2.1. Legal Framework
2.1.1. The resettlement, surveys of properties to be lost and compensation for land
loss will mainly follow the Regulations on Land Requisition and Resettlement for
Large and Middle Scale Water Resources and Hydropower Developments and
National Land Administration Law issued by the People's Republic of China, and as
well as Specifcations of Compensation for Land Requisition and Resettlement of
Large Scale Hydropower Developments issued by the Government of Sichuan
Province and the Sichuan Provincial Specifications on Implementation of Land
Administration.
2.1.2. Resettlement planning and implementation will follow the World Bank's
Operational Handbook: OD 4.30.
2.1.3. Land distribution alternatives and standards are identified according to the
Specifications of implementation of Land Administration issued be the Liangshan
Yi Nationality Autonomous Prefecture and the relevant regulations of various
counties (/municipality).
2.1.4. Management of resettlement programs and resettlement fund use and
management will follow the Couiting Law. Budget Law and Audit Law issued be
the People's Republic of China.
2.1.5. Environmental protection for the inundation area and resettlement areas will
follow the Environmental Protection Law issued by the People's Republic of China.
2.1.6. Treatment of letters from resettlers and complaining will follow the
Administration Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China.
7



2.2. Resettlement Principles
2.2.1. For resettlement of this project. the policy of "productive resettlement" and
"Agriculture and Land Strategy" will be applied. According to concerned stipulations
of resettlement regulations, in combination with the natural characters of receiving
areas, local natural resources superiority and economic development conditions, it is
necessary to develop lands available, to improve middle and low-yield fields, to
increase science input for conducting   scientific cultivation. In order to build
essential material foundation for resettlers to recover production and living levels,
rural resettlement should be supported mainly by agricultural cultivation in
combination with husbandry, processing, diversified economy, etc. The principle of
relocation in various ways should be followed.
2.2.2. In order to help resettlers "transfer and reinhabit successfully, keep or improve
present living level, develop as soon as possible and reach the target of long period of
peace and order", the principle of compensating and subsidizing at earlier stage and
supporting at later stage will be adopted in the course of resettlement.
2,3. Preferential Polices
Up to date, the preferential polices issued by the governments at all level in the
Liangshan Prefecture earlier or later are listed as follows:
2.3.1 The resettlers will be free of agricultural tax, charge for production water and
charge for adding capacity of living power in the first three years after moving to new
residence.
2.3.2 The children from displaced families are free of charges for transferring school
and will be treated equally to local residents in employment in enterprises or
govermnental departments and joining army.
2.3.3 By using local building materials for resettlers to build houses, the charges of
8



timber cultivation and management of river sands or stones are both free.
2.3.4 The areas of productive land, house-plot and family plot for each resettler
should be equal to those of the host residents in receiving area, and the quality of land
should be good.
2.3.5 In order to help resettlers to familiar with the techniques and skills of cultivating,
breeding and increasing yield of crops in new residence, agricultural department
should arrange free technical and skill training regularly.
2.3.6 For such enterprises as breeding and processing developed by resettlers, , tax
departments will reduce, retard or remit their taxes for 3 - 5 years.

3. Reservoir Inundation and Land Occupation
of Canal System
3.1. Identification of Inundation Limits
The reservoir inundation limits cover the areas below the normal water level 1,614.5
m of the reservoir and to be flooded temporarily when floods with various
frequencies occur.
According to the Norm for Design of Reservoir Inundation Disposal for Water
Resources and Hydropower Development, flood standards for various inundated
objects are the following:
.Cultivated land: once-two-year flood (p=50%) with a peak flow of 930 m3/s;
.Population, Houses and Special Facilities: once-ten-year flood (p=10%) with a
peak flow of 1,120 m3/s;
Torested l: wave freeboard of 0.5 m plus the normal water level of the
reservoir is considered.
The surveys of various material objects are conducted within the area of reservoir
inundation limited by 0.5 m wave freeboard above the back water of above flood
standards and the normal water level.
3.2. Survey Method
The surveys are conducted by a team, which is composed of the staff members from
resettlement agency of Miannin8 County, cadres from various townships, villages and
groups, and professional engineering and technical personnel from the Sichuan
Provincial Water Resource and Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute. This
job follows the Operational Outlines and is directed by govemment of Mianning
County.

The population survey takes household as a unit, distinguishing rural population from
non-rural population, and registering and compiling one by one according to sex,
education degree, age. All the persons which are out of birth control, directive
enrollment students bound to return home, as well as compulsory servicemen, persons
receiving reeducation or reformation through labor, whose permanent registered
residence are transfer out temporarily, are included in the rural population listed on
the documents.
According to various structures, the houses and the Attached buildings are measured
by household on the spot, following the document No.27 of the Urban and Rural
Construction and Environmental Protection Ministry, 1984.
Based on annual counting reports of townships (towns), villages and groups, and in
combination with topographic map of reservoir area on the scale of 1/2000, the
cultivated land area is surveyed by group on the spot. For the headwork (including
left general trunk canal) and left trunk canal, surveys are conducted and made sure on
the spot referring to the topographic map on scale of 1/500 and the landscape map of
ribbon shape on scale of 1/2000.
Survey of woods is conducted by household, sorting and counting on the spot
according to categories, mature or young.
As for special facilities, including aqueducts, canals, power transmission lines and
telecommunication lines, etc., their length, range, quantity, concemed characters and
present conditions are all investigated and registered.
3.3. Property Losses
3.3. 1. Reservoir inundation
The reservoir inundation area involves 6 groups of 3 villages. They are the first,
second, third and fifth groups of Anning Village of Lugu Town, the first group of
II



Xihe Village of Manshuiwan Town and the first group of Nanshan Village of
Xianfeng Township.
There are 162 persons living in the reservoir inundation area, and 498 persons have to
be resettled due to land loss. According to a natural growth rate of 13.7%o/, it is
calculated that there are 696 persons to be resettled by the year 2000.
The area of various houses to be inundated by the reservoir is 7,770.9 m2 , and that to
be affected is 26,728.49 M2. Besides. there are some Attached buildings.
There are cultivated lands of 453.05 mu in the inundation area, of which 297.24 mu is
paddy field. In additional, because reservoir impoundment raises underground water-
table, 192 mu of cultivated land will be affected by immersion. Due to that, 837
persons need to be resettled in production.
Special facilities inundated by reservoir are: 35 kV transmission line 1.24 km/pile,
380 V power line 0.6 km/pile, 220 kV lighting line 0.85/pile, a transformer and-
distribution station of 50 kVA, tractor road 1 .18 kmn, canal 1.93 km, village telephone
line 0.6 kmi/pile, an aqueduct 110 m and flood protection dyke 2,875 m.
3.3.2. Some 1,279.5 mu cultivated lands will be permanently occupied bv the
headwork and irrigation canals, with 8.0 mu house-plots and 319.5 mu wastelands.
Some 1,239.1 mu cultivated lands will be occupied temporarily during construction
of the project. Some 178 persons have to be relocated. Due to permanent land
occupation, 1,169 persons must be resettled in production, 7,000 in2 houses will be
rebuilt and 26,054 commercial trees will be inundated.
Losses of properties due to reservoir inundation and land occupation of the headwork
and canals are shown in Table 3-1.

3.4. Effects of reservoir inundation  and  land  occupation  of canal
system on local townships
All together, some 3,314.35 mu land will be occupied by the reservoir and the canal
system of the Manshuiwan project, of which 319.5 mu are wasteland. The area of
land temporarily occupied by the project is 1,239 mu ( not requisited, and will be
recovered after completion of construction of the project ). According to countings.
after land requisition or occupation. the conditions of lands to be redistributed or to be
changed are as follows:
In the NMianning County, the total area of cultivated land is 228 thousand mu (1.3 mu
per capita). 840 mu cultivated land will be requisited. which makes up 0.37 % of
the total, and the area of cultivated land for each person will be reduced by 0.005 mu.
14



In the Xichang Municipality, the total area of cultivated land is 301 thousand mu,
1.03 mu per capita. 1,020 mu cultivated land will be occupied, making up 0.34% of
the total. The decrease for each person is 0.003 mu.
In the Dechang County, the total area of cultivated land is 89.8 thousand mu, 1.09 mu
per capita. 216 mu cultivated land will be requisited, occupying 0.24% of the total
and the decrease is 0.002 mu for each person.
The data above mentioned indicates that the effect from land occupation of the
project on local social-economy is not significant.
The Table 3-2 indicates that the area of land to be occupied only makes up 0.3%-
5.2% of the total of various townships, and grain yield decreases by 0.3%-5.2%
(See Table 3-2). Land occupation of the project will have some effects on the local
social economy, but the range of effect in general will not be significant. After
completion of the project, its benefit on local economy, especially on agricultural
economy, will be enough to compensate for the losses due to construction of the
project.
3.5. Some Issues On Temporary Land Occupation
As to temporary land occupation, according to plan, principally the time from starting
occupation to recovering cultivation is less than two years. During these two years,
compensation will be paid as living allowance to the farmers who manage the lands
according to unit output value of cultivated land. When construction of the project is
completed, the temporarily occupied cultivated lands should be returned to the
farmers to manage.

The inundation area lies in the valley of middle reaches of Anning River, wvhere
nature conditions are relatively good. In this area, annual rainfall is 960 mm, long-
term average temperature is above 14°C, maximum temperature is between 34 'C to
39.9'C. In reservoir region, yellow mud with sand and yellow mud with stone are the
main soil which is neutral or acid with shortage of organic matter, poor quality of
colloid, small absorption capacity, high erosion intensity due to steep slope. low
alkali saturation degree of salt, poor ability of retaining water, low humidity, and
distinguished wet or dry climate characters. The crops are ripe twice one year. Here,
Some sub-tropical plants such as Chinese prickly ash and various fruits are suitable
for growing. Rice, maize, wheat, potato, bean and broad bean, etc., are main crops.
The two villages of two towns in the inundation area have 3,127.5 mu cultivated
lands in all, i.e. 0.91 mu per capita. The agricultural production is main source of
income, assisted by side occupation. And the net income is 940 RMB yuan per capita
or so, above the average level of county of 788 RMB yuan. The basic conditions of
relevant townships are shown in Table 4-1, and the conditions of the families from
the reservoir area are shown in Table 4-2.

4.3. General description  of social-economic  conditions  in  the
irrigation area
The irrigation system  involves 18 townships (towns) under the Mianning  County,
Xichang Municipality and Dechang County on the left side of the middle reaches of
Anning River. They are the Manshuiwan. Yuehua, Lizhou, Xingsheng, Xixiang,
Anning, Xiaomiao. Gaoxian. Chuanxing. Hainan. Mfadao, Jingjiu, Xixi. Huanglian.
Huangshui, Mali and Dezhou. The total population is 295,200, of which 248,000 are
rural population. In the irrigation area there are 240.600 mu cultivated land totally.
Among total population, 22,600 are minority nationality, making up 7.68% of the
total. However, no minority nationalitv is affected bv land occupation along canals.
The irrigation  area is the main  agriculture area of Anning  River Basin. Due to
advantageous natural geographical conditions. abundant resource of light and heat,
good nature base is provided for growth of various crops. Rice, maize, potato, wheat,
rape, sugarcane and vegetables are main crops. Generally the crops reap twice one
year or fifth two years, in some areas short of water for irrigation only once a year.
20



The total cropping area is 425,700 mu in the 18 townships (towns) of irrigation area
in 1996. The grain growing area is 332,100 mu with gross yield of 122,100 tons, i.e.
538 kg per capita. The husbandry develops in coordination with crop planting, mainly
breeding pig, cow, goat and sheep. According to the countings of 1996, the net
income is 935 RMB yuan per capita. tor details, see Table 4-3.
21



calculation for groups, on account that the natural population growth rate of 13.7%o,
696 people have to be resettled by 2000. The result is shown in Table 5-1.

The 141 people due to ground water immersion of 192 mu cultivated land must be
resettled in production.
5.3.2. The headwork (including left general trunk canal with a length of 8.1 km)
The headwork will permanently occupy 321 mu cultivated land .130 people will be
moved and 208 people have to be resettled in production.
5.3.3. Left trunk canal
The left trunk canal will occupy permanently 958.7 mu cultivated land, 48 people will
be moved and 961 people have to be resettled in production.
5.4 Selection of resettlement areas
Local land resources and agricultural-land strategy are main factors in the choice of
resettlement areas. In both Lugu and Manshuiwan towns located in inundation area,
land resources are limited and not enough for moving backward. To ensure resettlers
24



work and live happily, improve resettlers' living level and keep good circulation in
ecology, as well as not increase the burden of villages and groups located in
inundation area, only 132 people will be moved backward. The others, including 113
households with a total of 564 people. will be resettled in five townships benefited by
irrigation under the Xichang Municipality. The five townships benefited by irrigation
are Yuehua, Lizhou, Xinshen, Anning and Xixiang. For 192 mu cultivated land
affected by immersion, earth-fill and drainage measures are taken to reform the land,
thus 141 people may be resettled. Some 1,279.37 mu cultivated lands are occupied
along the headwork and canals. Big as the quantity is, these lands distribute in limits
of 137.6 km of the Mianning, Xichang, Dechang, 9.3 mu per km in average, and have
no important effects on local villages and groups. Besides, the villages along the
canal are benefited area of the project, and the project construction may affect
positively on field irrigation and improving yield. So only 178 persons due to the land
occupation along the canal are to be resettled nearby, the 1,169 persons affected by
permanent land occupation will be resettled in production in their original villages by
readjusting cultivated lands.
5.5. Analysis of environmental capacity of resettlement areas
The Yuehua, Lizhou, Xingsheng, Xixiang. Anning townships of Xichang
Municipality in the resettlement area are the richest regions of Anning River Valley,
and will enjoy most benefit from the project. In the areas, the soil is fertile, climate is
temperate , sunshine is sufficient, heat and rainfall is abundant, traffic condition is
convenient. and the level of agricultural production is high .According to the
countings by the end of 1996 ,there are 85.3 18 persons of rural population ,83,558 mu
cultivated lands in these regions .The average cultivated land per capita is 0.98
mu .The total yield of crops is 49.242 t The per capita yield is 577 kg. Among the
farming lands, there are 22,064 mu areas with middle-low yield due to lack of
irrigation system. In the resettlement areas, the reserve land resources are rich, arnong
which ,there are 324 mu wastelands suitable for reclamation .After Manshuiwan
headwork, left trunk canal and right trunk canal have been built, the water
conservancy condition will be improved. Because these areas have great agricultural
production potential, they could become a good agriculture base with high yield and
efficiency.
25



The resources of wasteland suitable for reclamation are enough to resettle 564

5.6. Production Arrangement
There are three methods to relocate resettlers. They are moving backward, moving
farther for concentrated resettlement and scattered arrangement.
5.6.1. Removing Backward in the Reservoir Region
The 273 people in inundation area will remove backward. Among them, there are 141
persons affected by ground water immersion.
For 141 persons necessary to be resettled due to reservoir immersion, it is planned to
restore agricultural land through reforming, immersed land, such as excavating
drainage ditches and filling earth. etc. The soil for these measures is taken from
alluvial flat of Anning River and in inundated agricultural land with good structure
and fertility, so in the very reforming year the original production level of agricultural
land will be restored. By counting the quantities reforming those immersed land
64,000 m3 is needed, and the investment is 320.000 RMB yuan.
26



The 132 persons removed backwards in reservoir region, are planned to relocated in
the same township by reforming 140 mu wasteland reclaimed roughly. These lands
are mainly dry and cultivated sloping lands. The soil fertility of the lands is low with
intensive soil erosion, and it is difficult to increase the yield because of the shortage
of water. So, the local counting documents of the township do not take it into account.
The measures of reforming these lands are described as follows.
(1) Through terracing slopes to prevent from soil erosion and to increase the ability of
soil keeping fertility. According to the demands of crop cultivation and growth, the
surface width of reforrned terraces should not be less than 3 m and the height is
limited within 1.5 m.
(2) To build necessary field facilities combined with the land reclamation. According
to the natural circumstance conditions, the land irrigation is entrusted mainly by
building some small scale storage ponds. In the light of experiences in many dry areas,
this kind of ponds has obvious effects on resolving the water use for land.
(3) To improve the physical and chemical characters of soil. According to the type of
soil and it's physical and chemical characters, respectively adding sands or mud and
heavily applying organic fertilizer will move extemal soil in to improve and fertilize
the original soil.
By these measures the soil erosion may be effectively prevented and soil fertility
heightened. After 1-2 year cultivation it will become agricultural land with high and
stable yields.
The investment of reforming wastelands reclaimed roughly is about 1,200 RMB yuan
per mu, so 168,000 RMB yuan is necessary for 140 mu. There are 15 storage ponds to
be built, with total storage capacity of 300 m3, and the cost is 18,000 RMB yuan. The
cost of soil improvement is 28.000 RMB yuan. 200 RMB yuan per mu. So, the total
investment is 214,000 RMB yuan.
As mentioned above, there are 273 persons in reservoir region to be removed
backwards, the productive rearrangement will cost 534,000 RMB yuan, per capita
27



cost is 1,956 RMB yuan. Furthermore, 194,000 RMB yuan is needed to invest for
townships (towns) resettlement in order to develop economic and increase income by
improving field irrigation facilities of receiving areas and reforming lands. According
to the calculation based on this basis, totally it needs 728,000 RMB yuan to invest for
productive rearrangement to relocate the resettlers backwards in reservoir region.
5.6.2 Relocation to the Xichang Municipality
The 113 households with 564 persons in reservoir inundation area need to be
transferred out to the Xichang Municipality, including concentrated resettlement and
scattered resettlement. The concentrated receiving area is the Yuehua Township, in
which 47 households and 230 persons will be relocated concentratedly. The
resettlement measure is to reclaim wasteland which is fit for cultivation. The other 66
households with 334 persons will be scatteredly rearranged by adjusting cultivated
lands according to the conditions of different villages and groups in receiving area.
The resettlement plan of receiving areas is shown in Table 5-3.

_ Limits for Land Reclamation
The land with slope degree is less than 15° can be reclaimed as paddy field. The
surface width of planned terraces should not be less than 4 m, and the height of field
ridge less than 1.5 m.
The dry land can be reclaimed on the land with slope between 15° and 20' . The
surface width should exceed 4 m and the land slope less than 15°

In order to resolve the irrigation of new cultivated lands, one pump station is planned
to be founded. Its pumping lift is 25 m, and the flow is 0.18 m3/s. Two water pumps
are installed with power 2x75 kW. Additionally, in order to ensure each field piece to
be drained and irrigated desperately, the field irrigation and drainage system should
be built, which mainly include sublaterals, back ditches and side ditches, etc. Thus,
the cross irrigation and new soil erosion can be protected.
- Soil Improvement
The new reclaimed land has low soil fertility and contains very few organic matters
and other trace elements. Therefore, manure mixed up with soil, which contains lots
of organic matters, should be applied during the course of land leveling. Then,
organic fertilizers, such as manure of pigs, cows and peo'ple should be applied year by
year to increase the soil fertility.
- Cost Estimation
According to the reclamation information of wasteland fit for cultivation in the
Liangshan Prefecture in recent years, the per mu investment for reclaiming wasteland
is about 1,200 RMB yuan, that of attached facilities is 300 RIMB yuan, plus the land
improvement cost of 200 RMB yuan, the total cost is 1,700 RMB yuan per mu. The
investment for reclaiming 230 mu wasteland is 391,000 RMB yuan, and that for
building pumping station is 368,000 RMB yuan. So the productive rearrangement
will cost 759,000 RMB yuan totally.

5.6.2.2 Scattered Resettlement
Some villages of receiving area have relatively profuse land resources, and in some
areas, more and more agriculture labors engage in industry, business or service sector.
so, some lands are abandoned or cultivated roughly, and there are quite many residual
cultivated lands can be adjusfed to resettles. It is planned to adjusted 313 mu
cultivated lands to rearrange 66 households with 334 persons. The quality and
irrigation condition of the cultivated lands which are readjusted to resettles should be
equal to that of the cultivated lands of the farmers in receiving area.
The fund for readjusting cultivated land will be derived from the compensation cost
for land loss due to reservoir inundation and canal occupation. It will be brought with
resettles into the receiving areas, and used for improving field conveyance system
(for example irrigation canal), reforming middle and low-yield fields and improving
quality of existing cultivated land in the receiving areas. Calculated by 5,870 RMB
yuan / mu, 1.8373 million RMB yuan will be needed for readjusting 313 mu
cultivated land.
5.6.3. Removing Backwards along the Irrigation Canals
The 1,169 persons live along the irrigation canals, and must be resettled in production
due to land occupation. Though that is a big number, the persons are scatteredly
distributed in various villages and groups along the canals. So, it is planned to
rearrange them in their original villages and groups by readjusting cultivated lands.
For this purpose, 1,170 mu cultivated land will be readjusted. By the unit price of
5,870 RMB yuan, the total cost is 6,867,900 RMB yuan. Furthermore, both the living
subsidies for temporary land occupation (2.038,400 RMB yuan) and the fund for
restoring cultivated lands (1,858,700 RMB yuan), will be allocated to various
concerned villages and groups to use.
The total cost of productive rearrangement measures above mentioned is 14,089,300
RMB yuan.
31



5.7. Living Rearrangement
There are 696 persons from the reservoir area and 178 persons from the area where
the cultivated land will be occupied by headwork and canal system, who have to be
transferred and resettled. To rearrange these persons, houses building are necessary.
Considering the principles of convenient traffic and saving cultivated lands, these
resettles will be concentratedly or scatteredly rearranged near the production lands as
possible. Among the resettlers, 132 from the inundation area will move backwards
nearby, 334 persons will be transferred to the Xichang Municipality and rearranged
scatteredly, 230 persons are relocated concentratedly in the Yuehua Township, and
178 due to headwork and canal are scatteredly moved backwards.
5.7.1. Relocation of Houses
The compensation of houses and the attached facilities of the resettles should be made
on the basis of material objects concerned by reservoir inundation and project effects.
All the compensation fund of 4,570,400 RMB yuan should be paid to resettles
themselves or to receiving area for building with unified plan.
The leveling cost of house plots for scattered arrangement is taken as 120 RMB yuan
per person. There are 644 persons to be transferred, and the fund is 77,300 RMB yuan,
which should be paid to the resettles themselves to handle.
5.7.2. Water Supply
The attached facilities construction of domestic water for resettles should be
conducted synchronously with house building. As the receiving area is located along
Anning River bank with rich ground water, whose host residents have the domestic
water use by means of a water compressing well for each family, for the scattered
resettles also a water compressing well is constructed for each family according to
resettlement planning, that is constructed by unified organization of township
government in receiving area. The construction cost is estimated as 100 yuan per
capita, so the total cost is 64,400 RMB yuan for 644 persons (132 persons moving
backward, 344 persons far relocated and 178 persons resettled due to canal
32



occupation).
5. 7.3. Power Supply
The domestic power of scattered resettles will be joined nearby in relocation places.
Calculating on the basis of 20 m external line and 15 m internal line per person, 12.88
km of extemal transmission line and 9.66 km internal line are needed, and the total
cost is 138,500 RMB yuan.
5.7.4. Concentrated Receiving Area (Yuehua Township)
In the concentrated receiving area Yuehua Township, 47 households with 230
persons are planned to be relocated, 15 mu lands are planned to be occupied as
residential area, 1.5 km power transmission line of 10 kV, and power transmission line
of low voltage of 380/220 V are needed to be erected, transformers and one
distribution station are to be established. Meanwhile. in order to satisfy the resettles'
demand for traffic&1.2 km of tractor road is planned to be built. As far as domestic
water of the resetttrs is concerned, it is investigated that the daily water volume used
by human beings and animals is about 120 1. In receiving area, there are 230 persons,
and the total daily need of water is 27.6 tons. One storage pond with capability of
55m3 ( that is twice as much as daily water need ) is planned to be built, attaching
water pipeline of 1.5 km.
According to that, it is calculated that in the concentrated receiving area Yuehua
Township, 337,000 RMB yuan is needed to form a complete set of infrastructure. The
fund is included in the compensation budget, together with house-plot leveling, drink
water, and power supply of resettlers displaced scatteredly. For details, see Table 5-S.
Totally, the cost of living rearrangement above mentioned is 5,187,600 RMB yuan.

5.L Programs for Restoring Production and Living
After the resettlers remove to receiving area from their original residential area, there
is a course of adapting to the new circumstance. In order to help them restore their
production, to develop economy and increase living quality after being transferred
and relocated, following measures are to be adopted according to the nature
conditions in receiving area.
5.8.1 Land exploitation for resettlement
5.8.1.1 It is necessary to exploit reformed cultivated land 562 mu for resettlement of
Manshuiwan Project, of which 230 mu reclaimed wasteland in Yuehua receiving area,
140 mu reformed wasteland reclaimed roughly in reservoir region, 192 mu cultivated
land effected by immersion and filled with earth. The land exploitation is planned to
conduct in two phases in accordance with project construction schedule and
resettlement planning.
In the first phase from June to Nov. of first year after project starting, 140 mu
wasteland reclaimed roughly for moving backward in reservoir region is reformed
and 230 mu wasteland suitable for agriculture in Yuehua concentrated receiving area
reclaimed respectively. The general requirement for land exploitation is: reforming
sloping area into horizontal terrace field and terrace land, reclaiming in band along
contour, forming land massif as great as possible. making the terrace surface with
slope inward 30 and draining water away with back ditch. The land is reclaimed by

and 230 mu wasteland suitable for agriculture in Yuehua concentrated receiving area
reclaimed respectively. The general requirement for land exploitation is: reforming
sloping area into horizontal terrace field and terrace land, reclaiming in band along
contour, forming land massif as great as possible, making the terrace surface with
slope inward 3 0 and draining water away with back ditch. The land is reclaimed by
34






internal excavation and external filling along contour and retuming surface soil to the
original condition. In this period the necessary field facilities is needed to construct,
such as irrigation and drainage canal, field passage, earth bank reinforcement, back
ditch, side ditch, pump station, pond, etc.
After land leveling it is necessary to ameriorate soil and apply earth sundry fertilizer
and organic manure for supplementing soil nutrient. Before resettles' relocation the
reclaimed land in reservoir region can be transfered to them for cultivation, while that
in Yuehua receiving area can be cultivated temporarily by host residents to be
favourable to mellowing.
In the second phase from Jan. to March of third year after project starting, 192 mu
cultivated land affected by immersion in reservoir region is reformed by taking
alluvial flat and surface soil of inundation cuitivated land to fill on immersed land and
in same time excavating drainage ditches in field to lower water table.
Till April of third year, the resettles of reservoir area have been removed completely
and all exploited land transfered to resettles to use. In this time, the new reclaimed
land has been cultivated 1-2 vears that is mellowed preliminarily, and it will be
mellowed completely farther through two years cultivation to become fertilized field.
5.8.1.2 Land exploitation executive organs
The land exploitation of Yuehua concentrated receiving area is supervised by
Xichang Municipality Resettlement Agency and executed by Yuehua Township
government. The land exploitation and reformation on reservoir region are supervised
by Mianning County Resettlement Agency and executed by Manshuiwan Township
government.
5.8.1.3 Cultivated land adjusting planning
Excepting 503 persons in reservoir region in reservoir region resettled by wasteland
reclamation and reforming cultivated land, there are also 334 person is needed to
resettle by adjusting cultivated land in receiving area. 100 persons from them are
35



resettled in Lizhou Town adjusting 78 mu cultivated land, 81 persons in Xingsheng
Township adjusting 81 mu 90 persons in XiXiang adjusting 89 mu and 64 persons in
Anning Township adjusting 65 mu. The distribution of adjusted cultivated land must
be supervised by resettlement organs and executed by township government of
receiving area in light of pricipe 1reating equally without discrimination [io ensure
that the resettles will gain mellowed field and land with the same quality and quantity
as the host residents and avoid the events happening that the poor field and land are
adjusted to resettles.
5.8.2 Development planning of receiving area
The Manshuiwan receiving area involves 5 townships: Yuehua, Lizhou, Xingsheng,
Xixiang and Anning in Xichang Municipality, which are both the received and
beneficial area. After completing construction, excepting 83,558 mu cultivated land
able to irrigate, there are also 3.240 mu wasteland suitable to agriculture to reclaim.
The land compensation fund amounting 8.7052 million yuan bringing in receiving
area by resettles becomes the part of fund source for exploiting these wasteland and
reforming middle and low yield lands. In the light of being beneficial to environment
protection, rational exploitation and use, and increasing economic benefits, by unified
planning the 3000 mu wasteland suitable to agriculture will be exploited step b) step
with total input 3 million yuan. Along with water passing in left trunk canal, the
farther input 5.7 million yuan for constructing necessary field facilities, such as
secondary and field canals, etc. of 80 thousand mu cultivated land in receiving area
will bring the Manshuiwan Project into full play. It not only founds conditions for
increasing yield and income of resettles in irrigation area, but also lays a sound
foundation for agricultural production and economic development in receiving area.
5.8.3. Skill training and technical aid programs
5.8.3.1 Skill training programs
The inundated area by reservoir of the Mianning County and the receiving area of the
Xichang Municipality both belong to the middle reaches of the Anning River, but
some difference exits both in nature resource conditions, such as climate, soil. etc..
36



and in cultivation skill, administration pattern and level of agriculture production. So
according to the characteristics of climate. soil fertility of receiving area, training in
several aspects should be developed, such as training of technical adaptability, of key
member of technical personnel, and of specialized household and resettlement cadres.
(1) Resettlement cadre training
The resettlement cadres are working personal for resettlement, whose quality affects
directly on that of resettlement work. Therefore, before resettlement work beginning
first the resettlement cadre training needs to be conducted. The training subjects are
learning national laws and regulations, polices, concerned business handbook of
world Bank for resettlement work. resettlement schedule of the project and
experiences for resettlement works of other projects. The training is intended for
resettlement cadres of these townships. villages and groups with time in a week,
which is organized by Resettlement Agency of Liangshan Prefecture.
(2) Skill training for resettlers
Training resettles is prescribed on basis of construction schedule of project and
resettles' relocation planning, generally arranged before removing and concentrated in
site of reservoir area with time a week for each class, mainly conducted for labors
from resettles. The training subjects are mainly the applicable skills in field with
universality and significant, such as selecting fine varieties, seeding time applicable
manure, protecting diseases, killing pests and weeding, etc, for such crops as rice,
wheat, rape, corn, broad bean, etc. as well as fruit tree growing, breeding skill, etc,
leached by technical personnel invited from agricultural and forestary departments.
The concrete training time is arranged as follows:
a. The first term is arranged in October of the first year after construction of project
starts. All together, there are 146 resettles in this term, 88 persons are planned to be
trained in one class-time.
b. The second term is arranged in March of the second year after the project's
beginning. 362 persons are relocated in this term, 217 of which are planned to be
37



trained in three class-timnes5
c. The third term is arranged in November of the second year. The number of resettles
of the term is 188, and 1 13 persons are planned to be trained in two class-times.
The first term for training resettles is organized by Resettlement Agency of Mianning
County for those moving backward in reservoir Region. The second and third terrn is
organized by Resettlement Agency of Xichang Municipality for those resettled far to
Xichang.
All the cost of resettle training is 124,800 RMB yuan, which is including in
compensation budget.
5.8.3.2 Technical aid
After completion of resettlement activities, the governments at all levels in the
receiving areas should organize professional and technical personnel to visit to the
site and interview with the resettlers, to know what kind of technical problems that
the they meet, and to show them how to resolve the problems, and to introduce and
reconmmend new practical and useful techniques and skills of comprehensive
economies including agricultural plantation, cultivation, processing and services to
them in time.
5.8.4 The government applies several favorable polices to resettles, including some
supporting polices. For examples, agriculture taxes, increasing capacity charges for
water and power uses and charges for transferring children to another school are free
in three years, taxes of breeding and processing enterprises developed by resettles are
reduced, retarded or remitted in three to five years.
5.8.5 Production prospect prediction for moving resettles
As the receiving areas is located in downstream valley plain area of resettlenient area,
either the climate or the production conditions, such as light and heat, are more
excellent than in resettlement area. Even in the Yuehua concentrated receiving area,

(3) The resettlement agencies and monitoring and evaluation panel should often go
onto the spot and know the resettlers' opinions and ideas, hold discussions and
symposiums regularly with participation of resettlement groups and representatives
from mass on problems occurred in resettlement, resolve these problems in time,
improve resettlement programs as possible. Thus, resettlement plan can be carried out
successfully.

even some host residents have no farnily plot, the distribution standard of family plot
of 0. 1-0.2 mu for each displaced person will be applied principally.
6.4. If resettlement has negative influences on the host residents' living and
production, and need improvement of existing infrastructure (such as water supply,
power supply and roads) and service facilities, relevant departments will coordinate
and treat these problems in order to avoid negative influence.
6.5. There are 29 persons of 7 households as weak masses in the reservoir area, such
as single parent, sick cripple and / or poor families, shown in Table 0-2. During the
process of resettlement, expect enjoying preferential policies, they will be supplied by
better living and productive conditions and special cares separately. Major measures
include:
(1) The sites for resettling weak households should be selected near highways and
towns with convenient conditions for living and production in order to provide more
opportunities for increasing their income.
(2) The poor families will be recorded on cards. and paid attention.
(3) According to reality, civil administration departments will give subsistence to
these families.

9. Resettlement Ound Use and Management
The resettlement fund is a special kind of compensatory cost, which affects the living
of resettlers directly. So, how to make a good use of the resettlement fund is a
essential question. It concerns whether this project and the Resettlement Action Plan
can be carried out successfully or not.
[E11. Resettlement [lund Ose
It is necessary to use the resettlement fund according to the limits, the compensation
standards and the items prescribed in the Resettlement Action Plan. It is forbidden
that the special fund is occupied or transferred by any organ or person for other uses.
Once someone breaks the rules for using the resettlement fund and brings bad
consequences onto resettlement action, he has to answer for it.
LJ2. Resettlement [und Management
9.2.1. Strengthen planning management of the fund, and manage it according to the
items, time and sum of cost demanded by the schedule.
9.2.2. Strengthen financial management. That is, the resettlement fund must be
accounted and deposited individually, examined and improved by certain person,
checked regularly and examined separately.
9.2.3. Apply the system of management responsibility, and control payment of the
fund strictly. The payment order of the resettlement fund of this project is: the
Daqiao Hydropower Development Corporation General (owner of the project)
the Resettlement Agency under the Liangshan Prefecture    the Resettlement
Agencies under the Xichang Municipality and Mianning County   the resettlement
areas (township financial section )   resettlers of various villages and production
groups. The higher level govems the lower level, and the lower is responsible and

renders account to the higher.
9.2.4. Depending on supervision and management of resettlement fund by legal
departments, the owner of the project should cooperate actively with the relevant
banks, financial departments, audit departments, discipline inspection departments
and supervision departments to supervise and trace the use of the resettlement fund
regularly or non-regularly. Once problems are found, they must be resolved and
handled in time.

10. Cln Elironmental Protection of Inundation
Area
10.1. In order to ensure safe operation of the water resources and hydropower project,
to prevent water quality pollution, to protect public health of the population
distributed along the margin of the reservoir and in lower reaches and to develop
tourism, the bottom of the reservoir to be constructed must be cleaned three months
before impounding. Reservoir bottom clearing involves dismantling and clearing of
buildings, sanitation clearing, wood felling and clearing.
10.2. Dismantling and cleaning of buildings. All the houses and Attached buildings in
the limits of clearing should be dismantled. The wall of houses should be pulled down,
and the waste materials buoyant and unavailable for reuse should be bum up on the
spot. All the buildings and their attached facilities that hinder the safe operation of the
reservoir must be dismantled, including roads, transmission lines, telephone lines and
broadcasting lines, as well as water resources and hydropower projects, and their
equipment and waste materials should be transported out of the reservoir. Large
obstacles, such as bridge piers, should be removed by explosion. The structures like
wells and pits in the reservoir area should be treated according to the geological
conditions by means of blocking up, covering or so.
10.3 Sanitation clearing. The pollution sources in the reservoir area, such as lavatories,
manure pits, animal pens and piles of rubbish, etc., must be cleaned up. Their
pollutants should be transported out of the reservoir area as possible. If it is difficult
to transport them out. they should be laid on the ground in thin layer and completely
exposed to the sun for sterilizing. The pits should be sterilized by quick lime. The
tombs of the men died from infectious diseases and the places where dead animal.
from diseases are buried should be cleaned and treated under the guidance of local
public health departments.
10.4. Forested land clearing. All the woods growing under the maximum water level
62



of the reservoir should be cut down along the ground surface and transported out of
the reservoir area. After cutting, the stumps left have to be less than 0.3m above the
ground. The buoyant remains, such as branches, dead woods and soil carbon , etc.,
should be born up on the spot or kept from floating before impounding the reservoir.

11. Resettlement ImElementation Schedule
11.1. Preparation for resettlement implementation
In order to implement resettlement schedule smoothly and successfully, it is
necessary to carry out various preparations before start of construction of the main
job, especially, a detailed implementation schedule should be prepared.
Firstly, resettlement organizations and staff should be determined half year in
advance before first year of the construction preparation period of starting project. All
the jobs will be conducted by the resettlement agencies under the governments of the
Mianning County and Xichang Municipality in combination with the resettlement
programs of the Daqiao Reservoir. The public affairs section of the Daqiao General
Hydropower Development Corporation and the resettlement groups of concerned
townships and villages will cooperate with these resettlement agencies.
11.1.1.   To    make   the    detailed   implementation    schedule,   a
should be
prepared firstly by the departments responsible for resettlement in consideration of
the characteristics of resettlement of this project.
The
should
describe concretely: the construction conditions of the project ,the necessity and
possibility of resettlement, the national resettlement laws and regulations, the
resettlement policies of governments at different levels, the principles and standards
of compensation planning, implementation methods of resettlement, the removing
plan of resettlers, the appeal procedure of resettlers, rewards and punishment for
breaking the rules, etc. For the resettlement, there must be laws to obey, basis to be

third year. The resettlement action must be completed thoroughly before impounding
the reservoir, in order that the project may realize its profits in time. The resettlement
implementation schedule for the Manshuiwan project in three phases is shown in
Table 11-1.

(in2)
11.3. According to the construction schedule of the projectand in consideration of the
potential effect of resettlement on construction schedule, the schedule for
implementing resettlement is prescribed as the following.
11.3.1. In the first phase, from November 1988 to March 1999, the 146 persons
inhabiting under the maximum water storage level 1,614.5 m of the reservoir or in the
area where the headwork locates. will be relocated firstly, who will be affected
directly by reservoir inundation or construction of the headwork. The resettlers are
arranged first, who have good conditions for moving backwards or less difficulties to
be distributed into the villages and groups of the receiving areas and better production
and living facilities.
Furthernore, the earlier stage preparation for roads and power supply in the Yuehua
concentrated resettlement area will start.
For the 146 resettlers planned for the first phase, the suggestion is: 132 of them
should be resettled by moving backwards in the Manshuiwan township, and the rest
14 persons should be resettled into the village Lizhou in the beneficial area of the
project.
11.3.2. In the second phase. from  April 1999 to November 1999, the remained

and completed by December 200 1.
11.6. Cost Allocation in years for Resettlement due to reservoir inundation and land
occupation of canal system
According to the resettlement implementation schedule, the costs allocation in years
due to reservoir inundation and land occupation of canal system are calculated, and
shown in Table 11-3.

11.7. In order to help the resettlers adapting to the living habits in the receiving area,
recovery production and catching up with the living level of the host residents as soon
as possible, a skill training and technical aid program for the families resettled in the
first phase will start at the beginning of the second-phase resettlement on the basis of
climate conditions and soil fertility of the receiving areas. This program will be
sustained tntil the whole resettlement program is completed and the resettled families
are accustomed to the living and production circumstances of the receiving areas.
I ].8. Throughout the resettlernent process. the resettled families wVill be supported to
con,duct agricultural production between their original and newly received lands in
order to increase income as far as possible. After the resettlers are relocated and
before the reservoir is impounded. the original cultivated lands in the reservoir area
