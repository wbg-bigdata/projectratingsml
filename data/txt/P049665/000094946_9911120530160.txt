Environmental Impact Assessment Report.
FOREWORD
.1
An environmental impact assessment report was developed by the PPMO in Chengdu, and was
translated into English during Pre-Appraisal of the project in October 1997. The report was
reviewed by the Bank mission and some modifications incorporated by the PPMO. The revised
document was presented to the Project Appraisal Mission in June 1998 incorporating all of the
~1      changes that were requested by the Bank mission.
All processing plants on the project are covered in the report including Agro-Industries and
1       Sericulture components, and there are separate data sheets for each processing plant.
GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.
The project would not be expected to produce any detrimental environmental impacts in the project
area. Each company has detailed the environmental aspects of their component, and indicated that their
proposal is within the National environmental guidelines and regulations.
There is no component of the project that poses an environmental risk. The processing plants have a
limited potential for localised water, air and noise pollution within and around the plant buildings, but
procurement specifications for processing equipment would :include full environmental protection
measures to maintain pollution within national EPB standards.
Waste Water.
The project proposes to treat the effluents of all processing plants and administrative and marketing
buildings in septic tanks where necessary, or to discharge effluents to municipal sewers where
possible. The design objective would be in compliance with Chinese standard GB8978-88 for
discharge of effluents, stipulating minimum discharge standards of: BOD5 200 mg/l and SS 200
mg/I.
The combined effluent at all seven project processing plants is estimated to be < 3,000 m3/d with BOD
concentration of 3 50-500 ppm. The capital cost of environment protection is included in the
investment costs for equipment and civil works for each enterprise. The unit cost of treating the
effluent is included in the general power consumption requirerments for each enterprise and has been
included in the financial analysis of the project.

Air Emissions.
Design of boilers and processing systems would provide for compliance with the relevant particulate
emission standard. Cyclone dust collectors would be installed on all seed and rice handling systems to
maintain particulate matter discharge <10 mg/m3.
Solid Waste.
The domestic heating system boilers and grain and seed dryers will generate ash and clinker, and it has
been standard practice to use this in road construction and as an extender in brick manufacture. The
disposal of theses negligible volumes of ash and clinker should not pose any problem.
Water softening plant sludge, boiler blowdown sludge and septic tank sludge would be negligible in
volume, and would be generated in widely dissipated locations. Disposal of sludge would be on local
agricultural land.
Chemicals.
None of the processing plants use strong acid or alkali chemicals or materials with a high
concentration of COD. The Xicheng seed processing plant will use seed coating chemicals in very
small volumes, but this is a common chemical used throughout the seed industry in China, and is not
likely to be discharged from the plant in any way, other than as a component of the finished products.
Agricultural chemicals. The fertilisers and agricultural chemicals used in the production of seeds,
rice, grain, fruit and vegetables would be standard fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides etc., as used in
major agricultural economies for similar type of agricultural and horticultural production. All farm
chemicals procured through the project would be Bank approved products. Optimal farm chemical use
will be determined during the project with the aid of technical assistance, and would be Bank approved
products where relevant.
Noise emissions.
All equipment procured for the project would be specified to be within the National Standards for
noise emission.

LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION.
The project would acquire a total land area of 2.0 ha for commercial activities, all of which for the
Xicheng Wholesale Market and is located about 0.5 km from Xicheng city centre. It is currently
agricultural land, and has 15 farming families (about 75 persons) using the land for income and
sustenance. Details have been provided of the land to be acquired, compensation arrangements, and
families affected by the project, and this data is summarised in Table-18 : Land Acquisition attached.
Non-Agricultural Land.
All enterprises have been requested to select land for commercial development that is not designated
as agricultural land, and that does not currently have any occupants or dwellings. Xicheng Panxi Foods
have selected such land for the rice mill and seed processing plant, where they already own the land.
The four silk reeling mills will mainly expand their operations by upgrading existing buildings and
installing modem processing machinery, and will not need to acquire additional land for these
operations.
Land Purchase and Compensation.
Crop Compensation and Relocation Expenses: The crop compensation and relocation expenses
paid to farmers would be in line with local regulations, and is dependent on the current crop being
produced, and the crop value. The total crop compensation costs to be paid under the project would be
Y1.2 million for 2 ha of land, an average of Y600,000 per ha, and relocation expenses 0.15 million.
The Xicheng municipal government are committed to ensure that relocated farmers receive land that is
at least as good quality as their existing land. This will be quite simple to achieve as the project will
develop large tracts of land around Xicheng under the irrigation and land base developments of the
project.
Land Purchase: Land purchase prices vary depending on the location, but the project would pay a
total land purchase price of Y4.65 million for 30 mu of land near down town Xicheng for the
wholesale market.
Building Compensation: None of the enterprises has any buildings on acquired land that will need
to be compensated.

4. Solidl dnte production
The uidustial solid waste in the mill will be mainly come from fuel consumption and domestic soLid
waste willl be mainly come from households of the company.
The amnount of industrial solid waste pr oduction will be estimated as I t/d. The inidustrial soLid waste
from the milL together with the collected dust mentioned above. will be brought to outside for road
constmnction.
The amount of domestic solid waste from the mill will be given as 150 kgld, which consists of waste
from households and has a high content of vegetables and other organic matters. The domestic soLid
waste xvill he transported to a municipal dump site for disposal.

Environmental Impact Assessment on
Xicheng Wholesale Market.
Summary
1. Environmental background
Xicheng Wholesale Market would be located in a new development zone of Xicheng city.
This would replace the existing wholesale market that is congested, and has been identified by
the Bank's marketing consultant to be a serious constraint to expanding fruit and vegetable
production and marketing in Liangshan Prefecture. The market could handle over 900 tons per
day of agricultural and horticultural produce and would become the major wholesale market in
the Anning Valley, and would be owned by Xicheng Municipal Government.
The market would be constructed on a 30 mu site located about 0.5 Km from the down-town
area of Xicheng, and would include an integrated cool store and ventilated store for fiuit and
vegetables. The overall market structure area would be approximately 7,000 m2 including
6,000 m2 covered market floor. The building would be completely open at both ends, but
closed at both sides by a row of stores and offices running the length of the building. These
would be arranged with cool stores and ventilated stores at ground level, with offices and
communications center above. Four site entrances would each be 30m wide, and the front
boundaiy would incorporate a block of shops and offices. The rear boundary would
incorporate public toilets, and trash removal bins. The design is for the market to be doubled in
covered area at some time in the future.
The selected market site opens on to a main highway out of the city, and would not cause
congestion on the highway. In fact the new market would relieve congestion at the
existing market site. There is frequently a fresh wind in. Xicheng city, the average wind
speed throughout the year is 6-7 km/h
2. Waste water discharge and pollution load
The wastewater discharged from the market would be only wash water at the end of each
day, and sewage from the public toilets and washing facilities, with an estimated discharge
amount of 15 t/d from each of these two sources. The pollution load of domestic
wastewater will be be in the following range:
BOD         5-9kg/d
COD         5-7kg/d
NH3-N       0. 5-1.0 kg/d
SS          200 - 450 kgld



The waste water will be pre-treated by septic tank after which it is discharged into
municipal sewage pipeline system.
3. Waste gas discharge and pollution load
There will be no boilers or incinerators at the market, and no waste gas or industrial dust
emissions are expected.
4. Solid waste production
Relatively large volumes of solid waste can be expected at the market. Vegetable matter
from trimming operations, fruit and vegetable discarded when over ripe, packing materials
and the detritus of several hundred farmers and traders will produce a significant load of
solid waste materials.
The total solid waste production should be based on a proportion of the daily throughput
of the market, and is dependent on the efficiency of the operation. Waste levels of 1.0%
would be a very conservative estimate, and 10% a very high estimate. Assuming these
extremes and a peak daily throughput at the market of 900t/d of produce, we should
expect the solid wastes to peak at 9 - 90 t/d. If the average market throughput is closer to
600t/d then the solid waste would be in the order of 6 - 60 t/d.
Most of the organic materials will be bought as compost by local farmers, and inorganic
wastes will be disposed at the city landill tip.
5 - Noise
The noise in the market will be mainly from transport and people. Neither of these can be
mitigated by investing in environmental control equipment, but building designs can
reduce the spread of such noise, and this will be investigated at the time of designing the
market.

The wasle gas wiUl be treated by dust remover installed on the boiler. The existing dust remover is
warer-screen type, through which a lot of pollutions in waste gas can be reinoved. The wash water
from the dust remover will be treated in a sediment tank- before discharge. and the sludge from the
tank will be treated together with the solid waste mentioned below.
4. Solid waste production
The industnal solid waste in the mill 6ill be mairdy come from fuel consumption. and the domestic
sobd waste will be mainly come from households of the mill.
The total anmount of industial sold Nvaste production will be estimated as 3 t'd. The induistrial solid
waste from the rnill (clinker and ash). together with the shldge from sediment tank mentioned above,
wvill be brought to outside for road constiuction.
The amount of domestic solid waste will be given as 500 kg/cd, which consists of waste fiom
heuseholds and has a content of vegetables and other organic matters. The domestic solid waste xill
be transpoiled to a municipal dump site for disposal.

good, wiuclh means that the river water quality can meet class III National Water Qualit)y Standard.
There is usually a fresh wind in Huidong county, the average wind speed throughout the year is 5-6
nm'sec.
2. Wastewater dischargo and pollution load
Thie wastewater discharged from the mill is mainly come from silkworm cocoon processing Asytem
with a discharge amount of 980 Mrn/dl, and household buildings with a discharge amouwit of 120 Vd.
The pollution load of process wastewater will be as follows:
BOD:   46.8 kg!d
NHJ-N: 32.9 kgkd
SS:      37.4 kuJ/
Tlhe pollution load of domestic wastewater will be as follows:
BOD:    24 kgd
COD      4S kg/d
SS:     6.4 kg/d
NH3-N: 4.S kg/d
The wastewater from processing system uill be treated bv bio-chemnical treatment method before it
is discharged into Canyu river. The concentrations of pollutant in treated wastewater can meet
Sichuan Provincial Wastewater Discharge Standards.
The doniestic wastewater will be pre-treated by septic tank before it is dischiaIged into municipal
sewage pipeline system.



3. Waste gas discharge and pollution load
Thie waste gas discharged from the compan wvill be mainly come from fuiel combustion for steam
supply. The pollution load of waste gas will be as follows:
SO2: 16 kg/h
TSP: 90 kg/d
The waste gas will be treated by dust remover mistalled on the boiler. The existing dust remover is
uater-sreen type, through which a lot of pollutants can be removed. The wash water from the dust
remover will be treated by a sediment tank before discharge. The treated water is rew%ed for dust
rermoval and the sludge from the tank- will be treated together with solid waste mentioned below.
4. Solid waste production
Thne industiial solid waste in the mill will be mainly come from fuel consumption. and domestic solid
waste wAll be mainly come from households of the mill.
Tlte total amount of industrial solid waste production will be estiniated as 2.4 t'd. includinu solid
waste of clinker and ash. The industrial solid waste from the milla together widt the sludge mentioned
above, will be brought to outside for road construction.
The amount of domestic solid waste will be given as 700 kg/d, wvhich consists of waste from
house holds and has a content of vegetables and other organic niatters. The donmestic solid waste will
be transported to a municipal dump site for disposal.

Anning Valley Agricultural Development Project
Summary of Social Assessment
I. Relevant Background
Geographical Location
1.    The Anning Valley project is situated in the Anning River Valley in Southwest China.
The project area cuts across Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Panzhihua Municipality
and involves a total of fifteen county-level administrative uinits: Xichang City and Mianning,
Xide, Dechang. Puge, Huili, Huidong, Ningnan, Zhaojue and Butuo Counties in Liangshan and
Miyi County, Yanbian County, and East, West, and Renhe Districts in Panzhihua. The project
area covers is leaf-shaped, extending from 260 to 290 N. latitude and from 1010 to 1030 E.
longitude.
Administrative History of the Project Region
2.    The project area has historically been an important comrmunications corridor between
Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, as well as an area traversed by the "Silk Road of the South", and
has thus been an area that was considered important by Chinese imperial dynasties throughout
history. Ever since the Han Dynasty (200 B.C.-200 A.D.), dynasties have established
governmental and military outposts here. During the Republican Period (1911-1950), the area
was divided between Xikang and Yunnan provinces. Comrnunist Party forces occupied the area
in 1950.
3.    On October 10, 1952, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region was established, with its
capital at Zhaojue. On April 15, 1955, its name was changed to Liangshan Yi Autonomous
Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of Sichuan Province. Xichang Administrative District was
established in 1952, but the Sichuan Provincial Government abolished the Xichang
Administrative District in 1978 and gave two of its counties--Miyi and Yanbian--to Panzhihua
City and incorporated the rest of its counties into Liangshani Yi Autonomous Prefecture, whose
capital was moved to Xichang. Since then, Liangshan has had 17 county-level units, of which 10
(including the one city of Xichang) are incorporated into the Anning River Valley Agricultural
Development Project (henceforth "The Anning Project.")
4.    Before the establishment of Panzhihua Municipality, its territory belonged to Miyi,
Yanbian, and Huili Counties in Xichang Administrative District and to Huaping and Yongren
Counties in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in YunnaLn Province. In 1965, in order to
promote the development of the mining industry and strengthen national defense, the Central
Government decided to establish a mining base area in this mineral-rich region. It therefore
established the Panzhihua Special District, and territory from Xichang City and Chuxiong
County was carved off incrementally in 1965, 1972, and 19 78 to form the present boundaries of



Page 85
Panzhihua Municipality, including the primarily agricultural areas of Miyi and Yanbian Counties
and Renhe District and the primarily urban and mining areas of the East and West Districts.
Because the three agricultural areas of Yanbian, Miyi, and Renhe have large populations of Yi
and other minorities, they have been administered as Yi counties since 1983. All five districts of
Panzhihua City are included in the Anning Project.
Population and Ethnic Groups in the Project Area.
5.     The Yi and the Han Chinese are the major ethnic groups in the project area. This is one
of the earliest areas of habitation by the ancestors of today's Yi and remains to this day the area
of greatest concentration of the Yi population. As early as the Han dynasty, the ancestors of the
Yi were practicing a nomadic pastoral economy in this area, without much agriculture and with
no cities. According to Yi written and oral genealogical sources, seventy generations
(approximately 2000 years) have elapsed since Guho and Qoni, the two epic ancestors of the Yi
in this area. After their migration into this area, the Yi began to practice a sedentary life
combining agriculture and pastoralism.
6.     Han Chinese have been moving sporadically into the area since the Han dynasty as well,
clearing land for agriculture. Most of the Han migration into the area was connected with the
system of military agricultural colonies. Military personnel would move into an area together
with their families, and also hire labor to prepare land for cultivation. Especially in the Yuan
(1251-1380), Ming (1380-1645) and Qing (1645-1911) periods, large numbers of Han Chinese
moved into the Anning Valley with government encouragement and support and gradually
moved into the foothills to the east of the Anning River, becoming the typical rice cultivators of
the region.
7.     The Southwest is an ethnically mixed region. The project area borders on districts
inhabited by ethnic "Tibetans," Bai, Lisu, Naxi, and other groups. In consequence, the project
area also has small populations of "Tibetans," Bai, Lisu, Naxi, and Miao.
8.     According to statistics from the end of 1996, the 15 administrative areas included in the
project had a total population of 3.5 million (1.62 million in Liangshan Prefecture and 0.88
million in Panzhihua Municipality). The minority population was 35% in Liangshan and 20% in
Panzhihua6.
5   Zangzu, the Chinese term usually translated into English as "Tibetan,' includes, in addition to those inside and
outside the Tibet Autonomous Region whom people outside China would call Tibetans, also a few hundred
thousand speakers of languages of the Qiang family, many of whom had political and religious ties with the
traditional Tibetan government. Aside from a few cadres and teachers, all Zangzu in the Anning Project area
belong to this latter catego
Y.
6 In Panzhihua, the project would cover the counties which have approximately 388,000 urban residents, almost
all Han. Out of 0.88 million total populations in Panzhihua, approximately 20% are minority.

Yi-the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Project Area
9.    Until the "democratic reforms of 1956", much of Liangshan was what Western Scholars
referred to as "Independent Lololand", an area dominated by the clan-based, stateless polity and
the slaveholding system of the people who call themselves Nuosu and are known in the Chinese
language as the Liangshan Yi. Even though commercial and cultural exchanges took place in the
area for a long time, relations between Yi and Han were characterized by constant friction and
conflict. With the "democratic reforms", the slaveholding system was abolished and central rule
established. In the past 40 years, there has been a major change in politics, economics,
education, and other aspects of life in the Yi areas, and Yi-Hlan relations have improved
considerably. But in Yi areas, especially those areas where Yi live in concentrated blocks, Yi
methods of production are crude, life is still very poor, and to a large extent the Yi still preserve
their way of life, including the cultural and economic features that separate them from the
surrounding Han. This is a question to which the project must pay close attention. If done
correctly, the project could have considerable influence in raising the standard of living of the Yi
and helping them to modernize and adapt to the market economy.
10.   While almost all the Yi affected by the project in the 10 Liangshan counties belong to the
Nuosu social and political system, most of the Yi in Renhe District are only distantly related
culturally and politically to the Liangshan people. These people, who call themselves Lipuo and
Laluo in their own languages, have lived for centuries in relatively close contact with their Han
neighbors, with whom they have had considerable economic, cultural, and even marital
interchange. As a result, the lives and customs of these people on the eve of the revolution were
not appreciably different from those of their Han neighbors., though they tended to be poorer and
live in more remote areas.
11.   In addition, there are a few thousand Yi in Miyi County who are mostly the descendants
of immigrants from Guizhou. Calling themselves Yala, Tazhi, Abu, and Nasu, they, like the
Lipuo and Shuitian, are socially and culturally much closer to Han peasants than are the majority
of Nuosu.
II. Preliminary Assessment
The Project and the Yi
12.   The general purpose of the project is to develop agricultural resources to raise the living
standards of the people of the project area. The project targets the Yi as one of the groups who
are to derive important benefits from the project, for following three reasons. a) Liangshan is a
Yi autonomous region, where the Yi are the earliest and most widespread inhabitants, composing
well over a third of the project area population. b) For various social and historical reasons, the
Yi have retained many characteristics of culture and lifesty'le that are very different from those of
the mainstream society and are thus likely to be left out of conventional projects and difficult to
launch on the road to development. c) Poverty in the project area, is primarily Yi poverty, and



Page 87
the primary targets of poverty alleviation in this area are the Yi. The project counties that have
the highest Yi population are Zhaojue (96%); Butuo,(94%), Xide, (85%), and Puge. (74%).
Yi Life in the Liangshan Project Area
13.   The Yi have traditionally practiced subsistence mixed farming. Farmers are 87% of the
population of the Liangshan project area and 93% in the four counties of highest Yi
concentration--Zhaojue, Butuo, Xide, and Puge. The population of Panzhihua Municipality is
half agriculture and Yi constitute about 20%. The foci of Yi traditional agriculture are field
crops and animal husbandry. Field crops (grains and vegetables) are the most important focus,
providing food and feed. Staple crops are primarily maize, buckwheat and potatoes, followed by
oats and rice. Animal husbandry provides wool, meat, hides and manure. Because most Yi live
in mountainous areas suitable for grazing, feed is less used. This gives a relatively high return on
livestock in comparison to that of Han farmers. Livestock (sheep and goats, pigs, cattle, and
horses) thus forms an important source of income for many Yi. Historically, supplemental
production has included crafts, such as spinning, weaving, lacquer ware, carpentry,
stonemasonry, silversmithing, and blacksmithing, along with forest production including wood
gathering, hunting, and bookkeeping. These occupations are integrated, and neither crafts,
forestry, nor animal husbandry is completely separated from crop farming as a means of
subsistence. Yi farmers are almost exclusively engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry,
which together accounted for 83% of farmers' income. The secondary and tertiary sectors,
including industry, construction, and commerce accounted for only 8.8%.
14.  In the last two decades, the subsistence Yi economy of crop agriculture and animal
husbandry, supplemented by small amounts of crafts and forestry, has begun to change. This
change is most visible in Yi-Han border areas, Yi-Han mixed areas, and areas near cities.
Commercialization has increased, with a certain amount of grain, livestock, hides, timber, and
medicinal plants entering the market. Recently introduced products, such as tobacco, brown
peppercorns, fruit, and silk, have also gradually increased. The number and amount of products
that Yi purchase in markets have also increased, and the traditionally purchased items of salt,
ironware, needles and thread are now supplemented by clothing, shoes, hats, alcoholic beverages,
cigarettes, electrical appliances, agricultural chemicals, seeds, and other products. Some people
who engage in traditional animal husbandry, craft and forestry production have begun to produce
for the market, and a few specialized households have emerged in sheep and goat husbandry,
lacquerware, and apiculture. On the basis of market production, trading has also begun to appear
as a specialized occupation. Little stalls and stores selling cigarettes, liquor, candy and daily
necessities have begun to spring up in Yi villages; daily and periodic markets are very active in
some areas, and Yi and Han traveling merchants now go from village to village, buying hides,
pharmaceutical plants and other local products. Likewise transport and hauling have appeared as
occupations. Under the stimulus of the growth of the market economy, there has been a push to
build roads and bridges, which have begun to experience traffic of commercial vehicles, family-
owned tractors, and human- and animal-pulled carts engaging in commerce. In sum, the
economy of Yi areas is beginning to move from a subsistence to a market economy and from
simple to complex economic organization.



Page 88
Poverty Alleviation in the Yi Areas
15.    Poverty is prevalent in the project area. Most of the poor are Yi and live in mountainous
or foothill districts. Natural disasters are frequent, the survival is difficult, the methods of
production are primitive and yields are generally low. Because of their relatively poor ability to
combat natural disasters, households who have exceeded the poverty line of Y500 income or 400
kg grain production per capita in one year, often fall back below it the following year (the rate of
such reversions is typically around 10-15 percent). Thus, a large number of Yi households are
mired in permanent poverty.
16.    Three manifestations of poverty are particularly apparent: a) The structure of the diet is
poor, with daily fare consisting primarily of corn, potatoes and buckwheat, with potatoes alone in
some areas accounting for 60-70 percent of the yearly diet. b) There is a lack of clothing and
bedclothes; about 50 percent of the people in high mountain areas have but one suit of clothing
for the whole year and sleep by the fire with but one cover. c) Housing is poor; a large
percentage of Yi live in low, humid, dark, mud-walled houses, with humans and animals sharing
quarters; they have no beds, stoves and toilets, manure is piled in front of the doorway, and
general sanitation is very poor.
17.    These areas with poverty populations are typically lacking in all kinds of infrastructure.
In mountainous and foothill areas, water, electricity, roads and other infrastructure is still quite
primitive.7 Irrigation and other agricultural infrastructure is also missing. In the five poor
counties in the Liangshan project area, there are 85,850 hectares of cultivated land, most of
which (71,530 ha) are do not have access to irrigation. Furthermore most are on unterraced steep
slopes. Only 8% of the land is reliably irrigated.
18.    Although the government has carried out several poverty-alleviation programs,, the
effort has had limited results due to the shortage of funds for investment and the insufficiency of
rewards for staff, and there has been no fundamental change in the poverty situation in Yi
villages.! The project plans to combine increased investment with existing resources, bringing in
investment and skills instruction to the household level to help Yi farmers increase production
7   According to statistics, at certain seasons each year there are drinkinig water shortages that affect 600,000
people and 1,400,000 head of livestock. Using Xide county as an example, there were 31,390 people who
lacked sufficient water, comprising 25% of the county population, and 129,759 head of large livestock who
lacked water, or approximately 30% of the county stock. By the end of 1996, there were 495 administrative
villages in the project area in Liangshan that lacked electricity, and 439 not reachable by road. Sanitary and
health facilities are also lacking, as are medical personnel and supplies. In the four concentrated Yi counties in
the project area, there are only 5 hospitals and 175 local clinics, staffed by 1,339 people, with 1,058 beds.
There are only 2.2 medical personnel and 1.7 beds for every 1,000 population. In the entire project area,
excluding Xichang City and the East and West Districts of Panzhihua, basic health needs have not been met.
Even basic health work in Yi villages has proceeded very slowly. In comparison to Han and mixed districts,
fertility is relatively high, mortality is high, natural increase is relatively low, and illness is a constant threat.
8   Uncompensated charity-style poverty alleviation has also not worked very well



Page 89
and income. If conducted with sensitivity to local conditions, it can accelerate the work of
poverty alleviation among the Yi.
Project Implementation and Traditional Yi Culture
19.    The mountainous natural environment, the nature of agricultural production, the
pervasive clan feelings, the belief in myriad ghosts and spirits. and the strong in-group feeling
among the Yi were the basis of the retention and development of Yi culture. Contained in this
were a lot of factors that promote development, along with others that are impede it. Yi are an
ethnic group that can work hard and endure hardship. The basic principle of human relationships
is to keep promises and seek reliable partners. The tradition of mutual protection and reliability
protnotes hard work, which will help achieve development. At the same time, however, Yi also
have a number of traditions that are obstacles to their entry into mainstream society. These
inhibit and otherwise influence Yi development.
20.    Most important among these are: a) a weak sense of commerce, buying and selling are
not considered respectable occupations;9 b) too much satisfaction with their present situation'
and c) expenditures not suited to savings or development. Yi are not, as sometimes thought, a
wasteful group. Their daily life is extremely frugal. But because they are concerned with
reputation and take pleasure in giving and receiving, whenever guests come or there is a funeral
or important religious ceremony, they spend without regard to economic consequences.
Generosity in hospitality and lavish funerals and ceremonies are not only a custom but also a
virtue to be praised by others.
21.    The project is unlikely to cause large-scale contradictions or conflicts with traditional Yi
culture. If obstacles occur in the transmission of new skills, the introduction of improved
methods, or the marketing of commodities, all that is really needed is to have an example, to see
results, to allow Yi farmers to enjoy the first fruits, and they will accept new things. There are
already precedents for this, such as the spread of maize and potato cultivation and the
introduction of improved varieties of sheep.
22.    Actually, traditional Yi culture is also a flowing stream; in today's world where the
isolation has been broken and people are beginning to enter the market, important elements of
traditional culture are in the middle of a process of selection, refinement, improvement and
reclassification. Today a market mentality, an ethic of savings, and a spirit of economic progress
have already put down roots in some Yi villages. In some cases they have borne fruit. What the
9 If there is surplus, people are not willing to take it to sell to the outside, but reserve it to entertain guests, to
distribute to other clan members, or to offer to spirits. This is an important factor in the lack of commodity
production and the low rate of livestock sales in Yi villages.
10  "Buckwheat cakes, pickled vegetable soup, and conversation with relatives around the fire" is still the goal of
an ideal life for many Yi people. People have not raised their living standards through development, but have
rather adapted to a low level of production by low levels of expenditure and low levels of want.



Page 90
project must realize is that while the Yi people do not want t.o lose their traditional culture as the
price of development, at the same time they do not desire to be so adamant about preserving
everything that they miss the opportunity for development and remain forever mired in poverty.
Yi Involvement in and Benefits from the Project.
23.   The project areas in the Anning Valley are inhabited by a mixture of Yi, Han, and other
ethnic groups. However, there are additional impoverished areas on the periphery of the valley
that are inhabited entirely by Yi people. If the project could involve these peripheral areas
directly, more Yi people would be able to participate in and derive benefit from the project.
24.   Predominantly Yi area are well represented in the project. Four of the ten project
counties in Liangshan have concentrated Yi settlement. In Xichang, Dechang, and Ningnan, all
Yi townships are included in the project. In Panzhihua, 23 of the 70 project townships are Yi
townships.
25.   Project Benefits
a) Economic Benefits. Participation in this project, through exploiting natural resources,
adjusting the productive system, raising production, providing additional income, and improving
housing and living conditions will help Yi farmers emerge from poverty and embark on the road
to individual and collective prosperity.
b) Political Benefits. The project will help to raise the political status of Yi people,
reduce the distance between ethnic groups, implement equality of ethnic groups, enhance inter-
ethnic solidarity, and preserve social stability especially in 'Yi.
c) Social Benefits. Participation in the project can help Yi farmers raise their scientific
and cultural level, establish a market mentality, reorient their attitudes toward development,
improve and develop traditional Yi culture, and better their education and health status.
Yi Women and the Project
26.   The 448,800 Yi women in the project area are an important constructive force. The
degree to which they participate in and support the project will directly influence the project's
results. Promoting the participation of women in the project and fully mobilizing their abilities
in agriculture, animal husbandry and handicrafts are important aspects of the project, which if
implemented effectively will guarantee its success.
27.   The Situation of Women in the Project Area. Almost all (98%) rural Yi women in the
project area are engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. In contrast, there are very few Yi
women in industry, commerce, or service sectors of the economy. Following the movement of
many Yi men into secondary and tertiary production such as industry, construction, transport,
and commerce, especially in Yi-Han mixed areas and in areas close to cities, Yi women have
become the primary agricultural labor force. According to statistics compiled by local women's



Page 91
federations, 70% of agricultural and pastoral labor power in Liangshan is now female; in
Panzhihua local estimates place this percentage even higher. Male-centered attitudes are still
very strong in Yi villages, and women lack education and have a high rate of illiteracy. The fact
that they have practically no way of obtaining any credit and lack confidence in their productive
skills is a severe impediment to their own progress and to the development of Yi society as a
whole.
28.   The Role and Status of Women in Yi Village Society. Historically, women have borne
great responsibilities in Yi village society. They reared children, managed households, wove,
sewed, worked in the fields, and herded livestock. They have been the backbone of household
production, and their contribution is a large part of the income of the household. In contrast, men
were often occupied with clan and collective affairs, helping out neighbors, visiting friends and
relatives, and attending funerals and meetings, so that women were in control of the majority of
household affairs. Even though Yi women play an important role in the village economy,
economic decision-making power is still primarily in the hands of men. In social life as well,
whatever men say goes. In the shadow of the ideology of patrilineal kinship, the position of Yi
women is clearly lower than in many other societies. There are small signs of some change in
women's role in villages close to urban areas like Xichang and Puge. In recent years, Yi women
in these villages have started to be active in markets.
29.   Participation by Female-Headed Households. Most of the project components in the
Anning project are well suited to participation by female-headed households, particularly the
livestock and sericulture components. In addition to general encouragement for women to take
part in the project, it is even more important to make a decision to involve female-headed
households in the project. If female household heads are given credit, and project components
are implemented largely through female household heads, this will be a new departure for Yi
women.
30.   Of the 47,350 households selected to participate in the project in Panzhihua, 25,170, or
53%, are headed by women. At present we do not have statistics for Liangshan as a whole, but
to take an example, in the 7 townships in Butuo county selected to participate in the cattle and
sheep project, 440 out of 800 households, or 55%, are headed by women. In Ngaikou township
in Panzhihua, 354 or 421 households, or 84%, are female-headed. The township head of
Ngaikou told us: "In the past, women herded sheep and goats, but men took the lead in slaughter
and sale. This time, the township government has adopted a policy of giving loans and
responsibility to women." Participation in the project through female household heads will put
money, power and responsibility into their hands.
31.   This has the following advantages: a) increasing the productivity of women will increase
total household income; b) it will improve the distribution of household income; c) incremental
income controlled by women will tend to be used for their children's health and education; and d)
it will help raise the social and economic status of Yi women in village society. When Yi
women are given both decision-making power and the responsibility for repaying loans, this will
immediately raise their self-confidence and their sense of responsibility, and they will actively
engage in the project.



Page 92
32.   The Important Role of the Women's Association. Yi women's educational and
scientific level is low; their market mentality is not strong an.d they lack confidence in their
marketing skills, and so to help them to succeed they need a strong, active organization to aid
them in participating in the project. The Women's Association, an association of women
themselves, has the ability to organize women's participation in the project. First, the Women's
Association is composed of a whole set of organizations, variously at the provincial,
prefectural/municipal, county/district, township, village and small production cooperative levels.
Second, in recent years Women's Associations have accumulated a lot of experience in
facilitating women's participation in economic construction. In all the fifteen counties and
districts of the project area, the Women's Association has recently conducted a campaign of
"double study and double competition"--study culture, study science; compete in contributing
and compete in renewal. Using cultural and scientific training, along with production
competitions in such areas as scientific agriculture, scientific planting of mulberries and raising
of silkworms, and scientific breeding of chickens, ducks ancl geese, they have produced a group
of female agricultural experts and competition winners. A mnajority of women in the in the
Liangshan project areas (61%) have participated in competitions. "Double study and double
competitions" have demonstrated the ability of the Women's Associations and the skills of the
women themselves, and they thus present a successful example for women's participation in the
Anning project.
34.   Finally, Women's Associations at every level are enthusiastic about participation in the
project; they believe in it; and in fact they have already done some preparatory work. First,
representatives of the Women's Associations at every level have been brought into the project
planning groups to help design the project. In the planning process, they have reflected the
wishes of a wide range of women and have participated in the formulation of policies on
important questions. Women's Associations at every level have held public meetings and
disseminated information through print and broadcast news media to encourage a broad range of
women to participate in the project. They have also decided to include elements of the project
into the ongoing "double study and double competition" campaign. In sum, the Women's
Federations understand the hardships and the wishes of Yi women, they know their strengths and
weaknesses and will protect their interests. Using the Wornen's Association to ensure women's
participation in the project is an effective route to follow.
III. Training Yi Project Households
35.   In planning for the Anning project, training was included as an important aspect of the
project. Establishment of a training center, training programs for specific skills for each
component, and technical extension teams to attempt to raise the quality of the farmers' and the
technicians' knowledge and skills are methods that have been proposed. We believe that training
has even greater importance than it was given in the project plans. Because Yi farmers'
language, culture, education, scientific and technical knowledge, beliefs and values all have their
own peculiarities and their own limits, a preferential policy ought to be adopted in the
implementation of the project to increase the size of the training component affecting them.
Content and methods of training ought to be adapted to the particular characteristics of Yi



Page 93
farmers. Successful training will be the key to successful participation of Yi farmers in the
project.
36.   Yi Farmers' Abilities and Knowledge. The educational foundation is weak in Yi areas,
the quality of education is low, and school dropout is serious. Most children in concentrated Yi
areas enter school because of a combination of persuasion of their parents and the requirements
of local village compacts, so that in 1996, 76% of school-age children in Liangshan did enter
school. But their rate of retention is low. In planning for training, attention should be paid in the
following areas:
37.   Content of Training. There should be material dealing with new attitudes and new
knowledge, to persuade people to accept new things in accordance with the realities of Yi farm
life in order to prepare them for the technical training they need to make their participation in the
project a success.
38.   Language and Teaching Materials. In concentrated Yi areas, women, old people, and
children ordinarily know no Chinese, while young and middle-aged men know varying amounts.
In mixed areas and areas near cities, most people are bilingual in Yi and Chinese. The language
of training classes and training materials should be suited to the linguistic abilities of the trainees
in a particular area. In mixed areas and areas near cities, Chinese-language materials can be
used, and Chinese supplemented with Yi as a medium of instruction. In concentrated Yi areas,
all instruction and materials should be in the Yi language.
39.   The Role of Literacy Training. Before the inception of the project in any areas, the
linguistic abilities and literacy level of the potential project participants should be investigated on
the ground. For illiterate potential participants, basic Yi-language literacy training should be
carried out. Adult native speakers can ordinarily be taught the fundamentals of the Yi syllabic
writing system in 40 to 60 days. Owing to the very high female illiteracy rate in the villages
(88% for the Yi in Sichuan, according to the 1990 census), literacy training for female household
heads is extremely important and special literacy classes for women should be conducted in areas
where heavy participation in the project by female household heads is expected. Literacy
training would be the foundation for all other training carried out under the project.
IV. Nationality Minority Development Plan
40.  In order to encourage and coordinate the local development aimed at minorities and the
poor that is planned in the Project, the Liangshan and Panzhihua PMOs have set up a special task
force to draw up a Nationality Minority Development Plan (NMDP) and to take responsibility
for putting it into practice. The task force is led by a vice-director of the PPMO and includes
staff of the prefectural and municipal PMOs, prefecture and county Women Federations, the
Central Nationalities University, the Nationality Research Center, the Poverty Alleviation Office

carried out this social assessment. The recommendations of the social assessment were used to
develop the NMDP.
41.   As recommended by the social assessment, represenlatives of the Poverty Alleviation
Office and the Nationality Affairs Commission were invited to be members of the Project
Leading Group. There are also representatives of these two in the task force drawing up the
NMDP. Representatives from the Women's Federation have been involved with the project
since project preparation. The general responsibilities of the task force are as follows:
a) assist the PPMO in disseminating information about project objectives, scope and
components to farmers, especially minority farmers, in the project counties"' The information
disseminated would include information on opportunities to participate in crop, orchard,
livestock and sericulture activities, financial arrangements and farmers' responsibilities under the
project;
(b) help the PPMO formulate the final design for project and take account of the
particular needs of the minorities and women;
(c) monitor the farner selection to ensure that poor, women and minority farmers have
are given a fair opportunity to participate in the project;
(d) assist village governments in the allocation of reclaimed land, agricultural inputs and
improved-breed livestock;
(e) help plan and supervise training programs for farmers, especially minority farmers;
(f) collect information and feedback from farmers to help the PPMO and the Sichuan
Government revise the NMDP;
(g) monitor the impacts of the project on minorities.
42.   Development Programs.
(a) Crop Development Program. The project aims to introduce new high yielding seed
varieties and improved cultural practices for farmers in the project area. In the Yi concentrated
area, corn, potato and vegetable would be introduced as alternatives crops to provide cash
income. Fruit orchards would be developed. Improved buckwheat varieties and cultural
practices would be introduced to increase productivity and improve food security for minority
farmers in remote areas.
Out of the project's 10 counties in Lianshan Yi Autonomous Region, four have more than 90% Yi population,
and five counties in Panzhihua Municipality have about 20% Yi population.

(b) Livestock Development Program. Most of the Yi minority live in remote
mountainous areas and have traditionally raised goats and sheep (more goats than sheep). The
project would introduce improved breeds of goats and sheep. An effort would be made to
persuade farmers to shift from goats to sheep in the vulnerable steep mountainous areas in order
to protect the environment. Alternative animal husbandry practices would be introduced, such
as cultivating feed for sheep and goats and raising goats and sheep in the fenced pens.
Demonstration pasture development in these areas would be used for training. Rotation grazing
would be introduced. Rabbits would be introduced to increase meat for family consumption and
to provide additional income to women.
(c) Yi Language Instruction. The social assessment recommended that the project
should invest in Yi language instruction and in developing Yi language instructional materials.
Although the project will not include this directly since it is in the domain of education, the task
force should discuss the issue with the prefecture and municipal governments and seek their
assistance to strengthening school-based and adult literacy Yi language programs.
(d) Training. Training under the project would emphasize technical and commercial
training. Technical training would be in crop and livestock production. Additional training
would be given to Yi other women in improved practice in cleaning, sorting and preparing wool
for the market. This training would enable them to obtain better prices for wool. Social and
commercial training would be given to expose minority farmers to commercial practices. To the
extent all training would be done by local experts, using the Yi language and Yi training
materials. Efforts would be made to include nearby minority farners outside the project area in
the training.
43.   Detailed plans for the above programs will be discussed at appraisal and will be
incorporated in the Project Implementation Plan.
