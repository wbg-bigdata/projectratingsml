I. ENERGY SECTOR BACKGROUND
Local Energy Resources
1.01         The greatest known indigenous resource of commercial energy in
Kenya is the hydroelectric potential of its rivers and, although the
potential for geothermal power has been recognized for some time, it was
not until 1978 that the comparative cost of imported oil and the growth in
demand  made  it  attractive  enough  to  warrant development.   In  spite  of
continuing search, there has been no success in locating reserves of oil in
Kenya, although relatively small amounts of gas have been found.  In rural
areas particularly, firewood and charcoal are used extensively for energy
needs while  bagasse  is  used  as a source  of fuel in  the sugar industry.
There are no known coal reserves although coal deposits have been found in
neighboring Tanzania.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.02       The hydro power potential of Kenya has been estimated to be about
6,000 MW (30,000 GWh per year), although half of this lies in small rivers
and  is uneconomic to develop.  Most of the remaining potential is on the
Tana River and of this, it is only economically feasible to develop about
800 MW or 4,000 to 5,000 GWh per year (1,500,000 tons of oil equivalent per
annum), about 350 MW of which  is  already  developed  (para. 6.12).   The
National Power Development Plan, 1978-2000, funded by the Bank under Loan
1147-KE (para. 2.10), was prepared by Merz & McLellan (M&M) and Sir
Alexander Gibb & Partners (Gibb) of the UK, consultants to the East African
Power & Lighting Company Limited (EAP&L), and their 1978 report lists the
following potential sites on the Tana River in order of priority: Kiambere
- 120 MW, Mutonga - 70 MW, Grand Falls - 88 MW.  The only other significant
hydro power potential is on the Turkwel River, and the Norconsult report,
dated July 1979, indicates that a multi-purpose project could provide 120
MW of electric power to the system.
Geothermal Resources
1.03        Geothermal areas in Kenya are located  in the Rift Valley which
runs from the Kenya - Tanzania border in the south to Ethiopia in the
north. There are three major areas of geothermal activity: Olkaria, which
is utider development, and Eburru and Lake Bogoria, which are currently
being explored.  The most attractive  potential is at Olkaria, in the Rift
Valley near Lake Naivasha, about 100 kim from Nairobi.   Exploration began
over 20 years ago, and investigations funded since then by UNDP and EAP&L
indicated that the site should be capable of supporting power generation of
at least 100 MW and possibly more than 200 MW.  Prior to appraisal of the
proposed project, completed wells were producing steam capable of
generating  37 MW   of electricity  with  a further estimated  5 MW  from 3
completed but untested wells. Two steam turbine driven electric generators
each rated at 15 MW have been installed - the first in operation since
August 1981, and the second was placed in operation in December 1982
(para. 2.22).   Two drilling  rigs  that have been operating  in the  field,
will continue drilling additional wells.

1.04        The UNDP with a grant of about US$2.9 million is now planning a
project to investigate further sources of geothermal power at Eburru and
Lake Bogoria, to begin early in 1983.  The Kenyan Government would provide
an additional KSh. 130 million (about US$12 million). It is estimated that
there could be as much as 1,700 MW of electricity generated from active
volcanic centers, with a further 200 MW from non-volcanic areas where hot
springs  occur.   Not all of  this  potential  is  economically  exploitable.
Hlowever,  it  is  expected  that  with  further  search  and  investigation,
geothermal  power  could  contribute  significantly  toward  meeting  Kenya's
electric power needs.
Wood Resources
1.05       The majority of rural Kenyans use firewood, charcoal, or in some
cases agricultural waste, as their principal source of energy for cooking
and heating, and, as a result, many areas of the country have experienced
severe deforestation.   The usage has been estimated  to be at least twice
and  possibly  as  much  as  four  times  the  replenishment  rate.   A  third
forestry project was approved in February 1982 with total project costs of
US$74 million, to which IBRD will provide US$21.5 million (LN 2098) and IDA
US$16 million  (CR 1213).   The project is aimed at improving  the Forestry
Department's management performance and providing funds for new plantings
and rural afforestation.  Other forestry projects, now underway, are being
financed by Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Belgium and the European Economic
Community, and it is hoped that these projects will provide the needed fuel
for the rural population before the deforestation becomes widespread
througlhout the country.
Other Resources
1.06        With Kenya's location  on the equator, solar radiation is quite
high, and could provide an attractive alternative to a portion of the high
cost imported   energy.   However, solar energy for water heating and crop
drying provides only a small fraction of the total requirements of the
country, and the Ministry of Energy is actively providing information and
encouraging its greater use.  In addition, the Ministry  is evaluating  the
possibility of using more wind-driven pumps for irrigation to replace
diesel-driven pumps presently in use.
1.07         Kenya has constructed  two ethanol plants based  on the use  of
molasses,  and  may  construct  a  third.    However,  the  high  capital  and
operating cost of the first two plants indicates that there is no
justification to proceed with another plant at this time.
Imported Energy
1.08       The principal source of energy for Kenya is from imported oil and
petroleum  products.    Small  amounts  of  coal  and  electricity  are  also
imported.   The  consumption  of  imported  energy  as a percentage  of total
commercial energy has varied during the past decade as follows: 1973 - 94%;
1977 - 90%; 1979 - 83%.  Except for minor amounts of speciality oils and
greases, most of the imported crude oil is processed at the refinery at
Mombasa.   In 1979, about 3.0 million  tons of crude oil were refined; of
this total about 1.5 million tons were used domestically, while the



remainder  was  exported  to  neighboring  countries.    During  the  period
1973-77, the value of net imports of crude oil and petroleum products
averaged about 13V of the value of Kenya's imports, whereas in 1981, mainly
as a result of the steep rise in petroleum prices, imports of petroleum
products represented about 30% of all imports.
1.09        The [aajor user of imported coal is the Bamburi cement plant in
Mombasa.   Electricity is imported  from Uganda and fed  into East Africa
Power and Lighting's (EAP&L's) system by the Kenya Power Company (KPC) and
distributed by EAP&L (paras. 2.08 and 2.09).  The following table contains
a summary of the growth in commercial energy consumption in Kenya:

Total Energy Consumption         1,583          1,914        1,925
a/I GWh = 250 equivalent tons of petroleum.
1.10         It should be noted that oil consumption decreased after the
commissioning of the Gitaru Hydroelectric Project in 1978 (para. 2.20)
and has been reduced further upon the commissioning of the units at Olkaria
Geothermal Power Project (para. 2.22).
1.11        The effects of the sharp increases in international oil prices
on the country's economic growth is clearly demonstrated by the growth
rates.   Over the period 1964-72, a growth rate of GDP 6.5% per annum was
achieved  in Kenya,  but  this  dropped  very  sharply  after  1973,  and  the
average for the years 1973-75 was 3.4%, while the growth in 1979-80 was
about 4%.  The dramatic rise in petroleum prices is seen from the average
price of crude oil which increased as follows: 1972 - KSh. 116 per ton;
1974 - KSh. 478 per ton; 1977 - KSh. 786 per ton; and 1981 - KSh. 1980 per
ton. Before 1973, in monetary terms Kenya was virtually in balance in its
imports and exports of petroleum products.   The receipts earned in Kenya
from exports of petroleum products were almost sufficient to pay for the
counitry's own petroleum needs.   However,  the price of imported crude oil
has increased mauch faster than the price of exported refined petroleum
products, and this had led to Kenya now having an adverse balance on its
petroleum  trade.   Compounding  the  problem  has  been  the border  closure
between Kenya and Tanzania and the break-up of the East African Community
which has meant a loss of markets and stagnation in shipments of refined
petroleum.
1.12      In 1975 the Bank provided part of the funds, US$20 million, under
Loan 1133-KE for the construction of a 14-inch 452 km long oil pipeline,
pumping stations, and related facilities to transport white products from



Mombasa to Nairobi.  Since it was placed in operation in 1978, the cost of
transporting fuel to Nairobi, Uganda and other neighboring countries has
been substantially reduced.   Preliminary studies have been carried out to
determine the justification of extending the pipeline westwards to serve
Eldoret and the neighboring countries, but no action has been taken to
date. The East African Development Bank and the Kenya Pipeline Company are
presently seeking funds for a detailed feasibility study of the proposed
extension.
1.13      The Govearnment has thus realised that for as long as oil remains
the major source of primary energy, and substantial amounts of foreign
exchange are expended in paying for crude oil imports, Kenya's economy is
very vulnerable.   Thus,  the Government's  strategy,  as specified  in the
Development Plan 1979-83, is to rationalize the use of itmported petroleum
and to develop and utilize domestic hydro and geothermal power resources to
obtain some alleviation of the country's dependence on imported oil.
1.14         Kenya  is not  very rich  in  its remaining  indigenous  energy
resources, now that the low cost hydro stations have been developed on the
Tana River.   However, the neighboring countries have interesting projects
with great potential, and cooperation in their development would be to
Kenya's advantage.
Relative Energy Pricing
1.15        The price of many essential commodities,  including electricity
and fuel, is regulated by the Government of Kenya.  The electricity tariff
structure does not take account of differences in costs of supply to
consumers in all parts of the country even though certain isolated areas
are supplied with expensive diesel-generated electricity.   Although this
policy may be justified as far as income redistribution efforts to help the
development of poorer regions is concerned, it could lead to imnportant
diseconomies by attracting energy intensive activities to these high energy
cost areas.  Usually, prices of petroleum products vary regionally and, in
general, reflect the cost of transportation.  There are no duties or sales
taxes on fuel oil and diesel oil.   The structure of domestic demand for
petroleum products does not match the pattern of yield from the Mombasa
refinery.  There is a substantial surplus production of residual fuel oil
from the Mombasa refinery over market demand, and therefore it is proper
that fuel oil should not be taxed.  The surplus is presently being exported
at lower prices than the cost of imported crude oil.   This situation is
expected to degenerate over the next few years as domestic demand for fuel
oil becomes weaker with conversion of major users, such as cement plants,
to coal. In contrast, the demand for diesel oil is disproportionately high
relative to the refinery yield pattern.   The high premium on the retail
price of gasoline compared to the price of diesel oil (para. 1.16), due
mainly to the high tax on gasoline and zero tax on diesel oil, is sending
the wrong price signal to users by encouraging the consumption of diesel
oil.

1.16          The relative cost of energy in Kenya is illustrated  in the
following table:
Price per unit
in Nairobi
(March 1982)        Cost per
Kilocalories/Unit    (K Shillings)  Kilocalories x 106
Gasoline (Reg)       10.58 x 106/ton          10,040               950
Fuel Oil              9.9  x 106/ton           1,895               191
Diesel Oil            10.2  x 106/ton          3,955               388
Kerosene             10.3  x 106/ton           4,754               461
Firewood                 3  x 106/ton            150                50
Charcoal              6.9  x 106/ton          1,400                202
Electricity          860/kWh                       0.62            720
1.17        The selling price of diesel oil in its relatively low place in
the above price structure, is encouraging an increased demand for diesel
oil and will create further problems in matching the yield of the Mombasa
refinery to market demand.   With the existing refinery yield pattern, the
proportion of diesel to total production is significantly less than the
proportion of market demand for diesel to total demand for petroleum
products. This situation would improve if the refinery were to be modified
to increase the yield of middle distillates from refined crude oil, and the
Bank is now giving consideration to funding an engineering loan to study
the various options for the conversion of the refinery to improve the yield
of products most in demand.
Energy Assessment
1.18         In May 1982,  the Bank published Report No. 3800-KE entitled
"Kenya: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector", which contains the
findings of a mission to Kenya, and a number of recommendations to improve
Kenya's energy sector.  Kenya has, in general, followed appropriate energy
sector policies, and has, for example, consistently passed energy price
increases along to consumers, and maintains appropriate levels of
taxation. The two major energy problems are the cost of imported petroleum
which is becoming a significant drain on the foreign exchange resources of
Kenya, and the deforestation, which while not serious in some areas, is
deteriorating because wood fuel is being consumed at about four times the
annual   rate   of   replenishment.       The   recommendations   include   the
encouragement of a more economic mix of petroleum product imports and
exports, a more realistic and less ambitious fuel alcohol investment
program, replacing oil-fired thermal plant power generation through the
further development of hydroelectric and geothermal resources, and in the
longer term, the development of regional hydroelectric power projects.
Other  recommendations  include  the  change-over  of  oil-fired,  heating
equipment in industries to coal, ensuring that energy is used more
efficiently,  a more  vigorous  search  for  possible  petroleum within  the
country,  and  improvement  in  the  reforestation  programs.    The  final
recommendation  was  that  the  Government  develop  an  overall  long  term
strategy for the energy sector.   Under the Second Structural Adjustment
Operation (Loan No. 2190-KE/Credit No. 1276-KE; Report No. P-3322-KE) the
Government has undertaken, inter alia, to develop a comprehensive energy



investment program providing for both production and conservation in the
modern and traditional sector to be prepared on the basis of the studies
now underway and to be discussed with Bank staff.
II. POWER SECTOR BACKGROUND
General
2.01       The availability of power to consumers in Kenya is, in general,
limited to the more densely populated narrow strip running across the
southern part of the country from Mombasa through Nairobi to Lake Victoria
(Map IBRD 16389R) in parallel with the railway, and along the coast.   The
northern and eastern parts of the country are arid, and because of the
scattered population, consumers do not have easy access to electricity.  Of
the estimated 15 million inhabitants in Kenya, 90% live in rural areas.
Only 6%1/ of the total population has access to electricity, and the
average estimated per capita consumption of electrical energy of this small
percentage of the population was about 1800 KWh in 1981.
The Power Supply Entities
2.02        Public electricity in Kenya is now produced by four companies:
the East African Power & Lighting Company Limited (EAP&L), the Kenya Power
Company Limited (KPC), the Tana River Development Company Limited (TRDC)
and  the  Tana  and  Athi  Rivers  Development  Authority  (TARDA).    EAP&L
coordinates all sources of power, purchases in bulk from the other three
companies,  and  is  the  sole  distributor.    Background  information  and a
description of the four companies is given in paras. 6.01-6.04 and
Annex 19.
Historical Demand for Power and Energy
2.03          In the preparation  of  the National Power Development  Plan,
1978-2000 (para. 1.02), the consultants, Merz & McLellan (M&M) examined the
requirements of the consumers in each of the five administrative districts:
Nairobi, Mount Kenya, Coast, Rift and Western, and by class of consumer -
domestic, off-peak2/, industrial, commercial, street lighting and small
consumer - for the period 1972 to 1976.   By analysing the past rates of
growth, projecting them into the future, and adjusting these forecasts by
known factors which may influence the result (i.e. new industry, load
shedding, extension of services etc.) the consultants derived the growth
rates for 1976-1981 as shown below.   The actual  growth rates  are also
shown:
1/   Percentages  of population with access to electricity in other East
African countries are as follows: Lesotho 3.5%; Malawi 2%; Sudan 8%;
Tanzania 7%; and Zaire 2%.
2/   Off-peak - Energy purchased under this category is interruptible  so
that EAP&L may reduce demand when conditions warrant.   EAP&L proposes
to raise the cost of this energy from 1/2 the regular tariff to 2/3 the
regular tariff (para. 5.08).

2.04        Although the forecast growth in the demand for energy since the
preparation of the report in 1977 was achieved for Nairobi and the Western
district, growth in demand in the other parts of the country was well below
expectations.  The high rate of growth forecast for the districts outside
Nairobi reflected the Government's desire to expand industrial areas away
from Nairobi, and this has been achieved only in the Western District.
2.05       The actual and forecast growth in demand for electric power and
energy during 1976-81 for the total country is shown in the tabulation
below:

1977           216     1355       8.5           223        1375      7.2
1978           238      1471      8.5          256         1529      8.1
1979           267      1676     13.9           269        1655      8.3
1980           289      1802      7.5           290       1735       4.2
1981           316      1958      8.6           313        1879      8.5

2.06       From the above it is evident that the actual maximum demand for
power coincided with forecast demand, but the energy requirements are
somewhat  less  than  expected,  because  of  the  unrealized  industrial
construction program (para. 2.04).   During the period the load factor on
the system fell from 72% in 1976 to 68% in 1981.   The low growth in 1980
over 1979 was due to the need to restrict supplies of electricity from
February 16, 1980 to April 21, 1980 because of low flow of the Tana River,
and the outage of a 30-MW steam driven generator in Mombasa.   Sales of
about 40 GWh were lost when load shedding was imposed during the period.
2.07       Most of the demand for energy is from industry where much of the
sales  increase  is expected  to originate.   There  are  10 consumers  who
average more than 1 GWh per month, the largest being the Bamburi Portland
Cement Company at 8.2 GWh per month and a demand of 15.7 MW.   Twenty-two



- 8 -
organisations consume more than 0.5 GWh while there are 93 who consume
between 0.1 and 0.5 GWh per month.   A demand curve and  the source of
generation for a typical day is shown in Annex 1.
Supply of Power and Energy
2.08         The demand for power has been met by the existing generating
plant, and by importation from Uganda, and the firm capacity in 1982 is
estimated to be about 60 MW above the expected peak demand.   The energy
situation, however,  is quite  different.    In 1980,  although  the Uganda
Electricity Board (UEB) provided about 60 GWh above the contracted amount,
it was necessary to shed about 40 GWh from the system.  A combination of
the driest year on record, and failure of supplies from Uganda could have
caused an energy shortfall of about 300 GWh.  The addition of 15 MW (about
100 GWh) at Olkaria in 1981 and again in 1982 (para. 3.01) will alleviate
the dry year shortfall to some extent.  However, it is evident that Kenya
requires the installation of additional firm generating facilities (para.
7.01).  The actual and forecast sales of electricity from 1976 to 1990 are
shown in Annex 2.  The forecasts of the generating capability in an average
water year, and in a dry year are shown in graph form in Annexes 3 and 4.
2.09       Kenya has an agreement extending to year 2005 to purchase 30 MW
(estimated 252 GWh annually at a 96% load factor) from Uganda.   KPC has
requested UEB to increase the power exported to Kenya, but UEB has been
reluctant  to  provide  more  than  the  30  MW  now  contracted.    Due  to
inadequate plant maintenance in Uganda, UEB's inability at times to supply
even the 30 MW, and the growing electricity demand in Uganda, EAP&L now
does not expect that additional power would be provided by UEB in the
immediate future.   However,  there is potential  for supplying Kenya with
electric power by the mid 1990s from new hydro projects now being
considered by Uganda.       For some time, there has been a suggestion that a
bulk transfer of power from the Kidatu project in Tanzania may be available
for use in Kenya.   This would not happen in the immediate future, but in
the long-term, improved relations between the two countries may make the
transfer of power an attractive possibility.   The Bank group should use
every opportunity to encourage such links between neighboring countries
to enable the most economical source of generation in the region to be
developed for the benefit of all participants.
Long-term Development Plan
2.10         During the preparation of the Gitaru Loan (1147-KE),  it was
foreseen that generation of geothermal power at Olkaria was becoming
attractive, and to investigate its feasibility and to place it in a
long-term perspective funds were included for two separate studies.    As a
result, Merz & McLellan (M&M) of the United Kingdom and the Virkir
Consulting Group Limited of Iceland submitted a report on geothermal
development at Olkaria, in which it was concluded that development of the
Olkaria site was economically justifiable and would be part of the least
cost  program  for  meeting  the  growing  power  demand.    The  report  also
concluded that geothermal power would be required by 1981.  The results of
this study were incorporated into M&M's and Gibb's National Power
Development  Plan,  1978-2000,  completed  in  1978.    Several  alternative
scenarios to meet the expected load growth were considered, beginning with



- 9 -
the Olkaria project and taking into account the potential for development
of both hydro and thermal schemes.
2.11         The National Power Development Plan (para.  2.03)  contains  a
forecast of growth in demand which necessitates further development of
power supplies by 1984. Funds for a feasibility study to determine whether
a hydro, geothermal, or other conventional thermal projects should be
undertaken were included as part of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project
(LN 1799-KE in 1980, para. 3.01).   The study recommended construction of
the Kiambere hydroelectric project to be completed in 1985.  However, this
project has been delayed while new engineering studies are being
completed. The processing of the financial and other arrangements are now
expected to start within the next few months, and the commissioning of the
station is now expected to take place by about December 1986.  The Olkaria
Geothermal Power Expansion Project has been proposed as a result of the
delay (para. 3.02).  A feasibility study of a hydroelectric power project
on the Turkwel River is now underway, and some preliminary results have
been received. Based on information presently available, the Bank believes
that this project could not be completed until about 1989.
2.12         Kenya's future electric energy needs will be met by further
development of geothermal and hydro resources, or by thermal stations using
imported coal.  While there has been an increase in the use of bagasse as a
source of energy in other countries, there has been little development of
its use in Kenya either for direct production of steam, or for the
generation of electricity.   In the long term, some of Kenya's electrical
energy may be provided from neighboring countries.   A recent updating of
the long range plan prepared by EAP&L resulted in the following plant
program.

2.13       This plant program is not optimized and is already out of date.
In fact, preparation of a master plan should be a continuous process
involving periodic revisions.   It is evident that overallt planning of the
needs of the electric power  sector requires  improvement.   There should



- 10 -
be greater coordination between the various parties involved in this
aspect, i.e. Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Science,
Technology, and Regional Development, and other public and private bodies
closely related to energy production, distribution and consumption such as
EAP&L, TRDC, KPC, TARDA, and very large consumers, petroleum companies
etc. To this end, during negotiations, general discussions were held with
the Government concering the interrelationships of each of the foregoing
bodies, and the Bank urged that the most efficient arrangements be made so
as to enable them to work together for the benefit of Kenya, not only for
the power sector but for the energy sector as a whole.
Rural Electrification
2.14       A Rural Electrification Fund was established  by the Government
in 1973 with a contribution of KSh. 9,980,260, and a Swedish bridging grant
of KSh.  8,760,640.   It  is administered  by  the Electricity  Development
Committee, which is comprised of representatives of the Ministries of
Finance,  Energy,  Economic  Planning  & Communications,  and EAP&L.   Rural
electrification schemes are managed and operated by EAP&L, which receives
revenue from the consumers and presents statements of revenue and cost to
the committee.   Funds provided from the interest differential between the
soft terms of a Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) credit to
the Government for the Kamburu project and the Government's harder
onlending  terms  to TRDC,  are used  to finance  the rural electrification
program.   Annual  accrual  to  the  fund  is KSh. 4,431,920  from the SIDA
Credit, and the interest in the investment of the Rural Electrification
Fund of KSh. 4 million in the Sugar Finance Corporation of KSh. 250,682.
Total disbursement of the fund was KSh. 70.6 million at the end of 1981. A
Swedish team, comprising a planning engineer and two construction foremen,
were seconded to EAP&L to assist in the implementation of the program.
2.15       In February 1980, the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) made a grant of C$550,000 (US$460,000), and in June 1981, CIDA made
another direct grant of C$2.75 million (US$2.3 million) to the rural
electrification program.   The grant provides two technical staff members,
one attached to EAP&L to assist in carrying out the extension of the
distribution system in the rural areas, and the other attached to the
Ministry of Energy to assist in the socio-economic analysis of projects
intended to be included in the program. In addition, of the funds from the
interest differential between the soft terms of a CIDA loan to the
Government, and the harder onlending terms to EAP&L for the Mombasa-Kamburu
transmission line (para. 6.16) amounting to about US$7 million in 1983 and
1984, about US$4 million will be spent on rural electrification, and the
remainder on other unspecified energy related projects in Kenya.
2.16        In a separate rural electrification program, EAP&L spent about
US$800,000  per  annum  on 22 schemes  during  the 1970-76  period.   EAP&L
normally apportions 1% of its gross sales revenue (about US$900,000 in
1981) to develop additional schemes, but in recent years the funds serve
mainly  to cover  the losses  of the earlier schemes.   The major problem
encountered with rural electrification programs in Kenya is the consumers'
inability  to pay.   Demand  is  low because  the  cost  limits  most  rural



- 11 -
households  to  the  use  of  electricity  for  lighting  and  not  for  other
domestic or productive purposes.   The contractors, mainly concentrated in
urban areas, are unwilling to undertake minor jobs in the rural areas, and
EAP&L has only a small construction  staff  for this  type of work.   The
training of construction workers was included in the training component of
the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project LN1799-KE 1980, and it is anticipated
t'hat the additional trained staff would alleviate this problem to some
extent. The geography of the country adds to the problem in that there are
few  village  concentrations,   and  the  scattered  households  make  the
distribution costly.
2.17        Although the rural electrification programs appear to be not
financially self-sustaining, the Government has continued to encourage the
expansion of the programs by providing funds through the interest
differentials (paras. 2.14 and 2.15), in the belief that improvement of the
social, commercial and industrial activities in small communities will tend
to reduce migration to the larger urban centers. The Government recognizes
that these rural schemes are subsidized to some extent by the urban
consumers, and has allowed EAP&L to adjust its tariffs to enable this
cross-subsidization to take place, while encouraging the least unprofitable
schemes to be chosen.  Although none of the schemes undertaken to date are
financially viable, they do not represent an undue burden on the sector and
most could become remunerative in time. Meanwhile, the social and economic
well-being of the rural community is gradually being improved.
Previous Bank Lending in the Power Sector
2.18       The proposed loan would be the fifth bank lending operation for
power  in Kenya.    Two  previous  loans  -  US$23 million  for  the Kamburu
Hlydroelectric Project (LN 745-KE of 1971) and US$63 million for the Gitaru
Hydroelectric Project (LN 1147-KE of 1975) - were made to TRDC, and two to
KPC - US$9 million for the Olkaria Geothermal Engineering Project (LN
S-12-KE of 1978), which was absorbed into a US$40 million Loan 1799-KE in
1980 for the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project.
2.19         The Kamburu project was the second phase of the Seven Forks
Hydroelectric development on the Tana River (the first was a hydroelectric
power station at Kindaruma).   The project was designed to meet the demand
for power in Nairobi and the coastal areas around Mombasa, where most of
the industrial and commercial activities of Kenya are concentrated.   The
project consisted of:
a)  a rock fill dam on the Tana River;
b)  an underground power station;
c)  three 30 MW units; and
d)   the associated  transmission line facilities connecting the
power station with Nairobi and the Kindaruma hydroelectric
power station further downstream.



- 12 -
The project was completed in 1974 about five months behind schedule with
a cost overrun of about 7%.  The delays were not unusual for a construction
program of this nature, and the cost overrun was unavoidable as it was
largely due to currency fluctuations. The Project Performance Audit Report
No. 1230, dated July 14, 1976, based on the Project Completion Report,
stated that the construction of the dam, powerhouse and transmission lines
posed no unusual problems, and that the project was completed as planned
with only minor start-up problems.  It was noted that EAP&L would have to
rely on the technical expertise of expatriates for some years to come, and
that an appropriate training program was available for all levels of
personnel.  The sales and maximum demand forecasts were exceeded to such an
extent that with a tariff increase in 1974, the rate of return for the
project was 21% as compared with the appraisal estimate of 16%.
2.20       The Gitaru project was the last phase of the development of the
hydro potential at the Seven Forks of the Tana River.   It is situated
between the Kamburu and Kindaruma power stations, and the three stations
operate in cascade. The project consisted of:
a) a powerhouse with two 72-MW units with provision for a third
similar unit;
b) a 30 meter high dam, 580 meters long;
c) a 900 meter supply tunnel and a 4,700 meter tailrace tunnel;
d) switching station;
e)   a 111-km transmission line to the Juja Road substation in
Nairobi; and
f)   three  studies:  Geothermal  Development  at  Olkaria  (para.
2.11); the National Power Development Plan 1978-2000 (para.
2.03);  and  a Management  and  Accounting  Consultancy  Study
(para. 6.06).
2.21      The Project Performance Audit Report No. 3505 dated June 24, 1981
states that the project was completed within the dates established by the
contracts, due to having good control and supervision by competent
consultants.  It was also noted that the use of bonuses for the completion
of certain tasks by key dates provided the incentive for contractors to
cooperate with each other and to complete their portion of the work on
schedule.
2.22      The Olkaria Geothermal Power Project consisted of:
a) a powerhouse;
b)  two   15-MW   steam   turbines   and   generators,   with   all
auxiliaries;
c) a system to bring steam from the wells to the powerhouse;
d) roads;



- 13 -
e) housing;
f) switchyard;
g) a transmission line to join the existing Uganda - Nairobi
transmission line;
h) training component;
i) detailed studies of the geothermal field; and
j)   a feasibility study of the proposed Kiambere hydroelectric
project.
2.23      The first unit was placed into commercial service in August 1981,
and the second in December 1982, some three months ahead of schedule.   A
project completion report will be prepared in FY1984.
Bank Strategy in the Power Sector
2.24      The Olkaria project was the first development of geothermal power
in Africa, and is, hopefully, the beginning of a series of such projects.
During  the  past  few  years  the  requirements  for energy  have  taxed  the
resources of Governments with the rapidly rising cost of oil, and the Rift
Valley has shown great potential for supplying much needed energy at a
reasonably attractive price.   The Bank is keeping abreast of geothermal
activities by closely following the studies being made in other countries,
particularly in Ethiopia, where the UNDP has recently funded a large
investigation program similar to that of the initial phases of the Olkaria
project.
2.25       The Bank has also assisted in meeting the projected shortage of
energy in rural Kenya through a forestry project (para. 1.05) which
included  fuelwood development  on both private and Government  land.   On
January 29, 1982, Loan 2065 (US$4.0 million), the Petroleum Exploration
Project (total cost US$5.3 million) became effective, and although the
search for domestic oil has been unsuccessful in the past, the Government
is hopeful of success in this new project.  Aspects of the overall energy
sector are being reviewed under the Structural Adjustment Loan P3322-KE.
The Bank's continued lending in the sector would assist in funding Kenya's
requirements for energy, for technical assistance, for the development of
Kenyan personnel to fill middle and senior management positions now held by
expatriate staff, and for studies on the justification and manner that
existing resources may be developed to meet the needs of the country.
Without this assistance, growth in the industrial sector would stagnate,
and retard the major objective of the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan,
aimed  at alleviation  of  poverty  through  the creation of  income-earning
opportunities and the provision of social services to meet the basic needs
of the population.   In previous  loans  the Bank has  included  funds  for
continued  updating  of  the  needs  for  the  development  of new electrical
generating facilities, and this proposed project contains a component to
cover continued studies (paras. 3.04 and 3.06).

2.26       The present long range planning for electric power is now out of
date, and it is part of the Bank's lending strategy to provide funds for
two studies: future geothermal development, and for the determination of
the least cost investment program (Annex 5).
Government Strategy in the Power Sector
2.27      The Government continues to give high priority to the development
of the power sector in view of its importance for the overall economic
development of Kenya.   Moreover,  the need  to formulate a comprehensive
national energy development plan has become generally recognized by the
Government since the 1973-74 energy crisis.  Thus, to meet the development
objectives for the energy sector as defined in the Development Plan
1979-83, investment by the Government over the Plan period in generation
expansion, transmission and distribution is estimated at US$226 million, of
which US$59 million has been allocated for the geothermal program.   The
large allocation (about 21% of total capital expenditure in the power
sector over the P?lan period) reflects the Government's emphasis on power
development.
III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01        The Olkaria geothermal field is located south of Lake Naivasha
and is about 100 km northwest of Nairobi.   Initial exploration indicated
that Olkaria had excellent potential for development (para. 1.03).   Thus,
in 1970 with UNDP assistance, extensive investigations and surveys were
initiated in order to determine the feasibility of developing power from
the available steam.  As a result of the studies, UNDP provided more funds
to cover part of the costs of a further drilling program for six deep wells
between  1973  and  1976.    Following  this,  the  Bank  financed  additional
feasibility studies for this geothermal project from proceeds of the Gitaru
Hydroelectric  Project  (LN  1147-KE)  (para.  2.20).    The  studies  were
completed in October 1977 and indicated that the generation of electric
power using geothermal steam as a primary source was feasible.   KPC thus
reactivated drilling operations in March 1978, and sought Bank assistance
for the power project.   An engineering  loan  (S-12-KE)  for US$9 million
which provided foreign funds for part of the cost of the preparatory works
estimated to total US$15.5 million, became effective on April 30, 1979.
The volume of steam output, temperature, and pressure from each well could
vary considerably at different locations in the geothermal field.   Thus,
funds from the engineering loan were used to drill production wells for the
proposed generating station, and 80% of the steam requirements for the
first  unit  were proven  before  the  Bank proceeded with appraisal.   The
Olkaria Geothermal Power Project (para. 2.22) was approved on January 21,
1980.   The first unit was placed in service in August 1981 and the second
unit in December 1982.
3.02       As a result of the delays encountered in the development of the
Kiambere project due to a revision in the manner in which the site would be
developed, KPC has requested the Bank to give consideration to providing



- 15 -
part of the funds necessary to construct a third 15-MW generating unit at
the Olkaria site.   A mission visited Kenya in February and March 1982 to
appraise the proposed project.
Objectives
3.03           The  primary  objectives  of  the project  are  to assure  the
availability of a firm source of power and energy within the country to
meet the growth in demand which could exceed the capacity of the existing
facilities in 1984 (Annex 4) and, as stated in the Government's Fourth
Development Plan 1979-1983, to reduce the country's heavy dependence on
imported  oil.   It is important  that  electric  power  industry  provide  a
reasonably reliable source to meet the growing demand for electricity
needed for economic growth and for the social well-being of the Kenyan
people.   The proposed project is the least costly means of adding to the
existing  generating  facilities  to  achieve  this  objective.    Funds  for
studies have been included to ensure that the needs of the electricity
consumers  will  continue  to  be  satisfied.   A  further  objective  is  to
strengthen the power industry in Kenya by maintaining the power industry's
financial viability through sound management and tariff policies.
Detailed Description
3.04       The project consists of the construction of an extension to the
existing electric generating station (para. 2.22), comprising the addition
of one 15-MW turbine and generator with its associated auxiliaries and
other necessary civil works. In summary, the project is as follows:
a) An extension of the existing powerhouse to house a third
15-MW unit, complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary
electrical and mechanical equipment;
b) a system to bring steam from the wells now being drilled
under LN 1799-KE;
c) a new cooling tower, and other works associated
with the cooling water system;
d) an extension to the existing switchyard;
e) a new hard-surfaced road;
f)  an augmentation of the water supply to the site and to the
drilling operations;
g) additional housing for an increase in operating staff;
h) detailed studies of the geothermal potential of the site;
j) studies for future projects;
k) consulting engineering.



- 16 -
3.05        A conventional powerhouse has been constructed  to contain the
first two 15-MW steam turbine-driven generators, together with all
auxiliary equipment  and controls,  and  the proposed  third unit would be
similar to the original two units. Since the generating capability of each
production well varies from 2 MW to about 6 MW, steam from a large number
of wells has been gathered through surface piping and taken to the
powerhouse.   Additional  piping would be required for this unit.   A new
tower to cool the water which is used to condense the steam as it leaves
the turbines, is required because the existing cooling tower was designed
to operate with only the first two units.  As at present, the power from
the new generator would be stepped up to 132 kV by a transformer in an
adjacent switching station and carried to the load centers by an existing
22-km  transmission  line  which  is  connected  to  the 132-kV Kenya-Uganda
transmission line.   The existing access road which crosses three private
properties, is in a poor state of repair and requires frequent maintenance
particularly during rainy weather.   Thus,  in order to reduce maintenance
both on the road and on the operating staff's vehicles, and for security, a
component of the project would be the construction of a new private road
from the operators' houses to the power site, thereby shortening the
distance travelled from 16 km to 9 km.  The cost of road improvement was
not included in the original loan, but better access is justified, now that
there is proven generating capability at the site.
3.06      In addition, the project would include two studies to be carried
out by suitably qualified and experienced consultants selected on the basis
of terms of reference agreed with the Bank: (a) A study covering an indepth
review  of  the  present  Olkaria  site,  and  the  potential  for  further
geothermal electric power generation.   KPC would hire consultants by June
1, 1983 and the report would be completed by December 31, 1983.  (b) Funds
have also been included for a second study, which would be prepared in two
phases.   The first phase would be the preparation of a revised medium to
long term generating plant and transmission line program indicating the
least-cost program to meet the growing electric power needs of Kenya. The
various alternative prime sources of power-hydro, geothermal, coal, oil and
bagasse  would  be  considered  as  well  as  the  possibility  of  developing
regional needs for the benefit of Kenya.   EAP&L would recommend  to the
Ministry of Energy that a Steering Committee be convened under its auspices
in order to ensure proper review of said study.   It is proposed that the
Steering Committee be composed of the chief executives of all the power
producing companies and the regional development authorities active in the
power sector, and high ranking officials of the Ministries of Energy,
Planning, Finance, and Regional Development, Science and Technology. EAP&L
would act as secretariat for the Steering Committee and would carry out the
day-to-day management of the study.   The second phase would be a detailed
feasibility  study  of  the  recommended  power  project.   EAP&L  would  hire
consultants by September 1, 1983 and the report would be completed by
October 30, 1984.

Environmental Considerations
3.07         There are no inhabitants  in the immediate area of the power
station, the vegetation is sparse, and except for a few zebra, there is
little wild life. Thus, the disposal of gases in the air, particularly the
hydrogen sulphide, has little effect on human  or animal  life.   Special
attention has been given to the problem of hydrogen sulphide in the design
of the station so as to eliminate unventilated areas and deep pits or
trenches where the gas may accumulate.   Disposal of gases from the three
units would be through a 50-foot high chimney which has been designed to
provide   adequate   dispersion   and  dilution  so  as  to  conform  with
internationally accepted criteria.  Periodically, it would be necessary to
blow off steam for pressure stabilization and well maintenance, but
suitable silencers reduce the noise to acceptable limits for the
operators.    Housing  for  the  operating  staff  is 9  km  away,  so  that
objectionable gases would never reach the area and there would be no noise
problem.  Waste water, containing quantities of salts, is piped to nearby
depressions where the water seeps into the ground. The underground flow in
this  area  is  away  from Lake  Naivasha,  so  there  is no possibility  of
contaminating  the  lake.    There  has  been  no  problem  at  the  existing
installation but, if this effluent were to reappear on the surface, proper
measures would be taken to dispose of it.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Cost Estimates
4.01          The total project  cost  is estimated  to be US$37.7  million
equivalent; the net cost excluding duties and taxes is estimated to be
US$31.3 million.  The project's foreign exchange component is estimated to
be US$22.5 million equivalent, about 60% of total project costs. The total
external financing, including 33% of the interest during construction, is
estimated to be US$29.8 million.   The estimated costs of the principal
features of the project are shown in the table on the following page.
Basis for Estimates
4.02        Project cost estimates were prepared by the consultant on the
basis of the cost of the first two units which are now being completed, and
upon being reviewed by the Bank, were found to be reasonable.   The Bank
subsequently adjusted the costs to reflect June 30, 1982 prices.  The Bank
found that only about 50% of the local costs to be disbursed for the
various  contracts  (except  engineering,  studies,  and  taxes)  could  be
considered truly local costs, and the remainder were indirect foreign costs
attributable to the purchase locally, of fuel and equipment for the
construction of the project.   Therefore, the remaining 50% of local costs
for  each  item  have  been  included  in  the  tabulation  of  the  estimated
project costs as indirect foreign costs.  No contingencies were applied to
the lump sum costs of the two studies.  Physical contingencies of 10% were
used on all other items.  Foreign price contingencies of 8.0% in 1982 and
1983, and 7.5% in 1984 and local price contingencies of 13% for 1982, and
9% for 1983, and 8% for 1984 were applied to the base cost and physical
contingencies of each project component.

Financing Plan
4.03        The proposed Bank loan of US$12.0 million would finance 32% of
the estimated project cost (US$37.7 million) and 53% of the estimated
foreign component of the project (US$22.5 million), in both cases excluding
interest during construction. It would be used to finance:
a)  50%  of  the  total  expenditures  for  the  mechanical  and
electrical equipment, less taxes;
b)  50% of the total expenditures for the civil works for road
construction, less taxes;
c)  100% of the foreign expenditures for the geothermal studies,
and the studies for future projects; and
e)  100% of the front-end fee on Bank loan.
4.04            A  proposed  loan  of  US$9.0  million  equivalent  from  the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) would be used as follows:
a)  25% of the total expenditures for the mechanical and
electrical equipment, less taxes;
b)  100% of the total expenditures for the consulting
engineering services for the project; and
c)  100%  of  the  foreign  expenditure  for   interest  during
construction on the CDC loan;
4.05       A proposed loan of US$8.8 million (equivalent) from the European
Investment Bank (EIB) would be used as follows:
a)  22%  of  the  total  expenditures  for  the  mechanical  and
electrical equipment, less taxes.
b)  100% of  the  total  expenditures  for the civil works,  less
taxes; and
c)  100%   of   the   total   expenditures   for   the   additional
housing, less taxes.



- 20 -
4.06       KPC would provide the remaining funds to cover:
a)  3%  of  the  total  expenditures   for  the  mechanical  and
electrical equipment, less taxes;
b)  50% of the total expenditures for the road, less taxes;
c)  100% of the total expenditures  for  the water  supply,  less
taxes;
d)  100% of local cost of the two studies;
e)  100%   of   the   total   expenditures   for   interest   during
construction on the Bank and EIB loans; and
f)  100% of the total expenditures for duties and taxes.
4.07         The total external  financing would be about US$29.8 million,
about 85% of the estimated cost including interest during construction and
less  duties  and  taxes.    This  is  in  line  with  the  level  of  external
financing that the Bank normally uses in Kenya. The Bank loan to KPC would
be for 17 years including a 4-year grace period, at the standard variable
interest rate.  A front end fee of 1.5% of the loan amount would be due on
or before the effective date, and has been included in the loan amount.  A
condition of effectiveness would be the effectiveness of the CDC and EIB
loans.  The CDC loan to KPC would be at an interest rate of 10.5% for 15
years, including a 5-year grace period.  A fee of £ Stg 53,000 (US$85,000)
to cover the cost of negotiations would be due 30 days after loan
signature.   The EIB loan to KPC would be for 15 years with a 4-year grace
period at an interest rate of 8%. The costs borne by KPC would be financed
by a Development Surcharge (para. 5.10) on the electric power sold by KPC
to EAP&L (from internal cash generation).  A summary of the financing plan
as detailed in Annex 6, follows:

Status of Engineering and Construction Schedule
4.08        The construction schedule is based on full commercial operation
of the proposed third unit by March 31, 1985.   KPC is anxious that this
schedule be maintained because of the power shortages which occur whenever
the output of the hydro plants is reduced during dry years. Details of the
construction schedule are given in Annex 7.
4.09       The project is being designed by Merz & McLellan (M&M) of the UK
in association with Virkir of Iceland, both of whom are acceptable to the
Bank.   It is estimated that of the total of about 500 man-months which
would be required by the consultants for the design and supervision of this
project, approximately 130 man-months would be expended in Kenya, and the
remainder in the consultants'  offices in England and Iceland.   The total
cost of the engineering contract is estimated to be US$3.3 million of which
US$2.3 would  be  foreign exchange.    The average  cost  per man-month  is
estimated to be US$6,600.   Geothermal Energy of New Zealand (GENZL) has
been contracted to provide key staff for the operation and maintenance of
the drilling equipment and to train local staff in its operation.  Since
the drilling program was re-activated in early 1978, three of the six wells
drilled in 1973-76 have been   successfully rehabilitated.   Subsequently,
fifteen more wells have been drilled.   Annex 8 gives a tabulation of the
steam flow from the wells.
4.10       The production wells, drilled to a depth of 900 to 2,500 meters,
require two to three months for completion, including moving and setup
times as well as delays due to equipment failures.   The first drill was
purchased for the 1973-76 program when the first 6 production wells are
completed.   Since the project was reactivited in 1978, the drill has been
frequently out of service for maintenance.  The second drill (funded under
LN S-12-KE) was put into operation in August 1981. Staff of KPC, under the
supervision of a team of drillers from Geothermal Energy of New Zealand
(GENZL), have completed 15 wells since the program was reactivited.   The
steam from the 21 wells completed to date is estimated to be capable of
generating about 42 MW (Annex 8). The original drill will continue to sink
wells around the powerhouse until completion of well No. 26, at which time
it is expected that there would be a proven supply of about 52 MW (i.e. a
15% surplus) for the 45 MW installation.   Recently, the new drill rig was
moved to a location about 4 km away to begin exploration for the
development of further power production facilities.
Procurement
4.11       Procurement for work and material to be financed under the Bank
loan would be in accordance with Bank guidelines for international
competitive bidding.  The Bank would finance the mechanical and electrical
contracts jointly with CDC, EIB and KPC, and the road and studies with
KPC. EIB would provide parallel financing for the substations, civil works
and housing,  and   CDC would  provide  parallel  financing  for engineering
services. Only the civil works, water supply, roads and housing contracts
would be open to local contractors bids because the very specialized nature
of the generating and substation equipment and associated control
facilities would exclude local interest.   If there are contracts of less
than about US$100,000 for miscellaneous equipment and supplies, they would



- 22 -
be awarded on the basis of the limited international or local competitive
bidding procedures or price solicitation from at least three suppliers.
Procurement procedures for small contracts was discussed with the Borrower
during negotiations and the procedures to be used were approved by the
Bank.    The  maximum  expenditure  that  would  be  incurred  under  these
procedures should not exceed US$500,000.
Disbursements
4.12       The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed over three years on
the following basis: 50% of the total expenditure for mechanical and
electrical equipment, 50% of the total expenditure for the civil works of
the road, and 100% of the foreign expenditure for the studies for further
geothermal production wells, and for the future projects.   The remaining
costs would be disbursed from CDC, EIB and KPC funds (paras. 4.04-4.06).
All disbursements would be fully documented by KPC.  The closing date for
the loan would be March 31, 1986, and any savings which may accrue due to
lower purchase prices, or if all of the contingency funds are not needed,
would be cancelled. A disbursement schedule may be found in Annex 9. This
schedule differs from the average power project and Kenya project
disbursement profiles, because the project is an addition to an existing
generating station, and some items of work normally associated with a power
project, have already been provided.  Also, Bank funds would be used only
on the mechanical and electrical equipment, road and studies.
Accounts and Audit
4.13        KPC, TRDC and EAP&L prepare their accounts in accordance with
sound commercial and public utility accounting practices.  The accounts of
the three companies are currently audited by Gill and Johnson, whose
performance has been generally satisfactory, and they are acceptable to the
Bank. EAP&L also prepares combined annual accounts of KPC and TRDC as well
as combined annual accounts of KPC,  TRDC and EAP&L.  During negotiations
agreement was reached that the requirements of the Bank for earlier Bank
loans (745-KE, 1147-KE and 1799-KE) relating to submission of annual
accounts of the three companies within six months of the end of financial
year, certified by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
submission of consolidated accounts of the two bulk supply companies and
all three companies would be repeated for the proposed loan.

5.01      The activities of the three companies comprising the-public power
supply in Kenya are closely connected through common management and staff.
The financial position of the borrower, KPC, should not therefore be
evaluated in isolation but jointly with that of TRDC and EAP&L. Financial
statements of KPC and consolidated statements for all the three companies
combined, covering the period 1979 through 1981 (actual) and 1982 through
1986 (estimated), are presented in Annexes 10 to 15.  Assumptions made in
these statements are given in Annex 16 together with explanatory notes
which include increases in operating expenses in keeping with the planned
expansion in the volume of operations, and in both capital and operating
expenditures,   increases   to  reflect  the  effect  of  estimated  price
escalations.

5.02       The revenues of the two bulk supply companies, KPC and TRDC are
determined on the basis of "ascertained cost as defined in their
respective bulk-supply agreements.  Ascertained cost (Annex 16), described
briefly, comprises operation and administration costs, interest and
redemption payments for debt, income and other taxes and an amount to meet
abnormal expenses and a part of the development expenses.   The two bulk
supply companies, while separate legal entitites, should for all practical
purposes, be considered a single unit since they are both wholly owned by
the Government, have similar nature of operations, and sell the entire
energy purchased or generated by them to a single entity, EAP&L.
Past Operations and Present Financial Position
5.03          As  can be  seen  from Annex 10,  net  assets  (fixed  assets,
investments and working capital) of KPC amounted to KSh. 683 million at the
end of 1981. About 49% of these assets were financed by borrowing, most of
which is repayable in foreign exchange.   Net gain from the realignment of
currencies from time to time since 1967 is reflected as a part of equity.
The debt equity ratio at the end of 1981 was 49/51.   By the end of 1984,
after completion of the project, net assets are expected to be about KSh
1,582 million and the debt equity ratio 57/43, which is satisfactory.
However, it is more significant to consider the financial position of KPC
on a combined basis with the other two companies (para. 5.05).
5.04           The  combined  revenue  and  operating  expenses  of  the  three
companies,  EAP&L,  KPC  and  TRDC  for  the  year  1979  through  1981  are
summarized below.  The combined rate of return earned by them during these
years was 7.9%, 6.4% and 11.6% respectively.   The financial covenants of
IBRD Loans 1147 to TRDC and 1799-KE to KPC required a minimum rate of
return of 8.5%, 6% and 7% respectively on average net fixed assets revalued
annually.   The rate of return earned in 1979,  therefore, was lower than
required by loan covenants but higher in 1980 and 1981.  The operations of
the three companies were satisfactory and they substantially met their
working capital and rate of return requirements.

5.05       The combined balance sheet contained in Annex 13 shows that, at
the end of 1981, the total net assets of the three companies amount to
KSh. 4,321 million and  the debt  equity  ratio 43/57.   It is apparent,



- 24 -
therefore, that on a combined basis, the three companies are conservatively
capitalized.
5.06        The currency rate fluctuations in the past few years have had
significant adverse effect on the foreign currency debt of the three
companies, as the official rate of exchange of the Kenya shilling
has declined about 40% since 1978.   The rate of return covenant  (para.
5.15) for this loan is proposed to repeat the provision for the annual
revaluation of assets on a price index, agreed between EAP&L and the Bank,
which takes into account the increases in the replacement cost of fixed
assets due to currency rate fluctuations as well as inflation.
5.07      Annex 13 indicates that the three companies have adequate working
capital and satisfactory cash positions.   There has been good control of
debtors; accounts receivable amounted to only a little more than two
months' billing at the end of 1981.  Net income of the three companies for
the years 1979, 1980 and 1981 (Annex 14), expressed in million KSh, was
114,148 and 145 as against the estimates (prepared during the appraisal of
the Geothermal Project in 1978) of 66, 114 and 179 respectively, and shows
a satisfactory position.
EAP&L's Tariffs
5.08        On the basis of a power tariff study completed by the Bank in
1977, a tariff structure, taking into consideration long-term marginal
costs, was introduced throughout the country in January 1979.  A fuel oil
surcharge is added to the tariff to allow EAP&L to recover from its
consumers the bulk of any increase in the cost of fuel used in power
generation.   The electricity  tariff structure is described  in Annex 17.
The present tariff is estimated to produce an average revenue of 62 Kenya
cents  or 6 US cents  per KWh3/.   EAP&L has,  in the past, made  timely
adjustments to its tariffs through fuel cost adjustments in an effort to
meet agreed rate of return requirements and has indicated its intention to
make appropriate tariff increases in the future. With the commissioning by
TARDA  of  the  Masinga  Dam  Hydroelectric  Station  in  1981  (Annex  19),
strengthening of transmission interconnection between the coast area and
central and eastern parts of Kenya in 1983 and the likelihood of
commissioning new hydro and geothermal capacity in the 1980's, the power
system generation characteristics will be substantially altered from the
characteristics  in 1979 when  the  last  tariff  study was  prepared.    In
particular, marginal cost of energy will no longer vary with time of day,
and therefore there will not be justification for allowing substantial
tariff discounts for off-peak consumption.  EAP&L has recently carried out
a new power tariff study based on long-run marginal costs and has submitted
proposals to Government for appropriate revision to the tariff structure.
3/  Electricity tariffs for some other East African countries converted at
official exchange rates into US cents per KWh are: Botswana 12.4,
Malawi 5.3, Sudan 10, Swaziland 3.9.

Construction Program 1982-1985
5.09        The construction program of the three power companies for the
period   1982-1985   includes   major   strengthening   of   Kenya's   power
transmission system. Additionally, construction of two major hydroelectric
stations: the Kiambere project (140 MW) and Turkwel project (120 MW) is
included in Kenya's power development program, the former project is
proposed to be implemented by TARDA.
Proposed Financing Plan
5.10        The financing plan includes a 13% increase in EAP&L's tariffs
from January, 1983 and further increases by an average of 6%, 3% and 9%
from January, 1984, 1985 and 19864/ respectively, and continuation of the
development surcharge (Annex 16) payable by EAP&L to the bulk supply
companies.   To help finance TRDC's and KPC's development projects, EAP&L
has in the past paid annually a development surcharge which provided the
two bulk supply companies, TRDC and KPC, with local currency funds
requirements additional to those met by loan and equity contributions.
EAP&L intends to continue to pay the development surcharge to help finance
the proposed project at a rate of 2 Kenya cents per KWh of energy supplied
to EAP&L by the two bulk supply companies.  However, as the requirement of
funds would vary from year to year depending on the pattern of
disbursements and other factors, should this amount not prove adequate to
provide the local currency funds needed for the proposed project in any
particular year, EAP&L would provide additional funds required up to an
amount which would make the rate of return of the two bulk supply companies
in respect of any year equal to 8% of their average revalued net fixed
assets   in  operation,   and   agreement   on  this  was   reached   during
negotiations.  Thus, the costs of the project are proposed to be provided
by continuation of the development surcharge and by the IBRD, EIB and the
CDC loans (paras. 4.07 and 5.14).
5.11        KPC's sources and application of funds for the period 1979 to
1981 (actual) and 1982 to 1986 (estimated) are presented in Annex 12.  The
financing plan of KPC for the project construction period 1983-1985, along
with that of the three companies combined, follows:
4/ Assuming annual price escalation rates of between 13% and 8% during the
period 1982 to 1986, tariffs in real terms would decline from the 1981
levels even after the proposed tariff increases during that period.

- 27 -
5.12       It is appropriate to consider the financing plan on the basis of
the combined sources and requirements of the three companies, eliminating
inter-company transactions as though they were merged into one company.
The combined requirements and sources of funds on this basis, of KPC, TRDC
and  EAP&L  for  the  period  1979-1986,  are  presented  in Annex 15.   The
summarized financing plan of the three companies, given in the preceding
table, shows that of the total construction requirements of the three
companies for 1983-1985, 49% would be financed by net internal cash
generation after providing for debt service and dividends, and the balance
by borrowings: 7% by the proposed IBRD loan, 5% by a loan from EIB and 5%
by a loan from CDC, 35% by other loans which are available to KPC and
EAP&L for the development program of the power companies.   Completion of
co-financing arrangements for the proposed project which are already well
advanced  is  a  condition  of  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  loan.    As
indicated in Annex 15, the internal cash generation covers the annual debt
service requirements by an ample margin, ranging from an estimated 2.1
times in 1983 to about 1.8 times in 1985, which is adequate.
5.13        During negotiations agreement was reached that, if additional
funds are required to complete the project, the Government would provide
the additional financing requirement in accordance with arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank.
Future Earnings
5.14         Forecasts of revenues and expenses of KPC and for the three
companies combined are summarized below and attached as Annexes 11 and 14
respectively. The development surcharge has been calculated to provide KPC
with funds required for its capital development program and EAP&L's tariffs
adjusted to provide for the three companies, on a combined basis, a minimum
rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets in operation of 8% from
1983, as well as the local funds required for operations, debt service,
local capital expenditure and working capital requirements of the three
companies.

5.15        The financial projections indicate that the 7% rate of return
required for 1982 under the earlier Bank Loan 1799-KE will be met; and in
subsequent years with small tariff increases (para. 5.10), the rate of
return at a minimum of 8% will be maintained.  To help provide the two bulk
supply companies and EAPL with adequate funds for their development
programs (paras. 5.04, 5.10 and 5.14) as well as for their operating, debt
service and working capital needs, therefore, EAPL would be required to
continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that the combined net
operating income of the three companies, KPC, TRDC and EAPL would not be
less than 8% of their combined average revalued net fixed assets in
operation from 1983, as required under the Bank Loan 1799-KE.  This level
is adequate to provide funds required for the proposed project, the three
companies' ongoing construction program and the related debt service and
working capital requirement.   During negotiations  agreement was reached
that the Government would take or cause to be taken all actions necessary
to permit EAP&L to obtain revenues sufficient to yield this rate of return.
Debt Limitation
5.16         Debt  service coverage  is relevant  only  in relation  to the
combined position of the three companies, particularly because of the rate
of return requirements for KPC/TRDC and EAP&L (para. 5.15) and the debt
service of the bulk supply companies, KPC/TRDC, being payable by EAP&L as a
part of ascertained cost (para. 5.02).   In line with the requirements of
IBRD Loan 1799-KE for the Geothermal Project, no long-term indebtedness may
be incurred by EAP&L, KPC and TRDC (or any associated EAP&L-managed company
which may be established in the future as a bulk licensee selling power to
EAP&L) without Bank approval, unless cash earnings before provision for
depreciation are at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service for any



- 29 -
succeeding fiscal year, on all debt including the debt to be incurred.
This test is made on the basis of combined revenue accounts and debt
service  after  eliminating  inter-company  payments.    The  debt  service
coverage of the three companies is expected to be well above 1.5 and during
negotiations agreement was reached that a similar covenant be repeated for
the proposed IBRD loan.  Annex 18 describes the security arrangements for
the loan capital of EAP&L, KPC and TRDC.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Structure of the Electricity Supply Industry
6.01        The East African Power & Lighting Co. Ltd (EAP&L), which is the
sole distributor of electricity in Kenya, was founded in 1922 by the
amalgamation of two private companies which had supplied Nairobi and
Mombasa since 1907 and 1909.  Both the Kenya Power Co. Ltd (KPC) and the
Tana River Development Co. Ltd (TRDC) were established by EAP&L, the former
in 1955 principally to finance the interconnection with Uganda and sell
imported power to EAP&L, and the latter in 1964 to develop the potential of
the Tana River.   At the  time  these  companies were formed, the  stock  of
EAP&L was privately owned by a large number of shareholders. Almost all of
the capital raised  for KPC and TRDC was loan capital.  EAP&L shared  the
ownership  of the nominal equity with a private  financing company and the
Government, which became the owner of one third of KPC's equity capital and
one quarter of TRDC's. In 1969 the Government decided to obtain control of
EAP&L by purchasing the available shares on the London stock register, and
became  in  July  1979,  the  majority  shareholder  in  the  company.    The
Government had acquired the total equity of KPC and TRDC in February 1971.
Since establishment, both companies have been managed and staffed by EAP&L
under a management agreement.  A brief description of the history of the
power companies is in Annex 19.
6.02         Government recognizes that rationalization of the structure of
the power industry could best be achieved by integrating all three
companies, which already operate for all practical purposes as one company.
EIowever, this cannot be achieved immediately because the income of TRDC and
KPC is exempt from corporation  tax whereas EAP&L's income is taxable and
the arrangement serves as a mechanism for providing, from power
industry's earnings, development funds which are tax-exempt.  However, it
would be desirable to merge TRDC and KPC into a single company and during
negotiations the Government informed the Bank that a review of the
structure of the power industry was being carried out by a Government
committee.    This  review  would  include  the  issue  of  merger,  and  the
recommendations would be sent to IDA for comment.  In the case of EAP&L,
the Government and its associated institutions, which together hold about
60% of the equity, are continuing to buy up shares on the Nairobi register
as and when these become available.  The present complicated arrangement is
operating efficiently and it is not significant whether the merger be
achieved in the short term. However, in September 1982 the 5.5% CDC
debentures were fully repaid and a merger will be possible.



- 30 -
6.03        EAP&L purchases the entire output of KPC and TRDC at what is
called the "ascertained cost" (see Annex 16 for definition) and is the only
company allowed to earn surplus.  The funds required to enable the proposed
borrower to cover its operating expenses, pay its debt service and meet the
local currency costs of the project must therefore come from EAP&L, and
appropriate arrangements are necessary to assure KPC's revenues.   During
negotiations agreement on the continuation of the development surcharge to
meet the needs of KPC's development program was obtained (para. 5.10).
6.04      EAP&L manages and staffs the Masinga hydroelectric project owned
by the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA) and purchases the
energy on the basis of an agreed formula based on the price of equivalent
energy supplied by imported oil.
Organization and Management
6.05        EAP&L is a well-managed utility and is operated in accordance
with sound commercial principles.   The Chief Executive,  a Kenyan,  is a
competent administrator.   The Board of Directors  consists of 11 members
including the Chief Executive and General Manager of the company and two
government representatives; the remaining members are leading Kenyan
businessmen.
6.06          In January  1978,  the Montreal Engineering  Company Limited
submitted a report entitled "Management and Accounting Consultancy Study"
which contained comments and recommended changes to the structure of the
organization, the accounting functions, and the management reporting
systems of EAP&L.   In general,  the report  found  that  the company was
reasonably well organised but suggested that certain activities might be
better handled if assigned to other departments.  The introduction of many
of the recommendations, including a restructuring of the company by the
creation of six functional divisions to replace nine departments, took
place on July 1, 1979.
Staff
6.07         The staff of EAP&L at December 31, 1981, inclusive of staff
attached to KPC and TRDC, numbered 5,004.   There has been a significant
reduction in expatriate staff as evidenced by the fact that in 1970 there
were 189 expatriate professional staff, 120 in 1974, and 72 in 1981.   The
number of metered connections in 1981 was 167,724 and there were about 33
consumers per employee.   This compares favorably with some of the other
East  African  companies5/  and  is  reasonable  considering  the  number  of
installations (some 24 power stations spread over Kenya),  the distances
involved, the amount of construction work carried out by the company, and
staff training needs.
6.08          Maintaining  the establishment  at  full  strength  as well  as
avoiding a deterioration in the quality of staff are continuing problems.
Departing expatriate staff have generally been replaced with qualified
5/ Mauritius 74; Tanzania 22; and Madagascar 38.



- 31 -
local staff, but there are a number of vacancies which EAP&L is having
difficulty in filling with suitable candidates either locally or from
abroad.  The standard of management of the companies has been maintained at
a satisfactory level since the appraisal of the Olkaria Geothermal Power
Project in 1978.  EAP&L will have to rely on expatriates for some years
but the problem is decreasing and eventually will be solved as Kenyans are
trained to replace them (para. 6.18).
6.09         The present staff are competent to operate the companies,  to
carry out the project with the assistance of consultants, and to carry out
other works covered by the EAP&L development program.  During negotiations
EAP&L provided assurances that it would continue to employ consultants
satisfactory to the Bank to carry out the project.

6.10       Most of the electricity sold by EAP&L is distributed through an
interconnected system covering five major areas of Kenya: Nairobi, Mount
Kenya, Coast, Rift and Western Districts, which are shown on the attached
Map  IBRD  16389R.   In addition,  power  is  supplied  to  some  centers  in
outlying areas by isolated diesel stations.   Although there are numerous
small privately operated generators, mostly isolated and some used for
standby purposes, in this report no consideration has been given to the
effect  of  these  on  the  power  supply  system  in  Kenya.    The  existing
generating plant owned by the four companies (Annex 20) together with those
privately owned are shown in the following table:
Summary Table of Existing Generating Plant
------------------Public-----------------   Private

Total                   522.0 MW                 2.2 MW         39.6 MW
6.11       This generating plant is augmented by a 30-MW bulk supply from
UEB,  giving  a  total  capacity  of 552 MW on the  interconnected  system.
However, the effective capability is reduced to about 490 MW due to
derating some of the older diesel and gas turbine plant
because of their age.  The dates of plant retirements will depend to some
extent on available river flows, and for the purposes of this report, it
has been assumed that no plant would be retired until after the
commissioning of the next hydroelectric generating station scheduled for
December 1986.
6.12        The three largest hydroelectric power stations (Kindaruma - 44
MW, Gitaru - 145 MW, and Kamburu - 91.5 MW located on the Tana River some
70 miles to the east of Nairobi), are owned by TRDC and the Masinga - 40



- 32 -
MW, also on the Tana River is owned by TARDA.   Two smaller hydroelectric
developments, Tana (14.4 MW) and Wainjii (7.4 MW), are owned by KPC.  The
98-MW Kipevu steam station located at Mombasa, the remaining four very
small hydroelectric installations (6.2 MW in total) together with eight
diesel-electric stations, and the Nairobi South gas turbine plant, are
owned by EAP&L.   All of these generating stations are interconnected by
means of 132-kV and 33-kV transmission and subtransmission  lines.   This
system is linked to Uganda by a 132-kV double-circuit transmisssion line
for the transfer of 30-MW bulk power. One of the 132-kV transmission lines
between Kamburu and Nairobi is constructed for operation at 275 kV but will
be operated at 220 kV upon completion of the Mombasa-Kamburu transmission
line in June 1983.   The distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 kV.
EAP&L   also   operates   four   isolated   diesel-electric   power   stations
aggregating 2.2 MW in the northern and eastern part of the country.
However, they have not been included in this report because of their
isolation and size.
6.13       The power installations at the Masinga dam, owned by TARDA, but
operated by EAP&L, consist of two 20-MW units which began operation in
August 1981.   These units cannot be considered as a source of firm power
supply because, at the time of greatest need, i.e. during the dry season,
the reservoir wil:L generally be drawn down to such an extent that the
reduced head on the plant will result in the total output being decreased
to about 9 MW.  However, they serve as a valuable source of less expensive
energy, replacing fuel-generated energy, during periods when the head on
the plant is suitable for power production.   The output of the Masinga
powerhouse will average about 200 GWh per year, and the additional energy
output of the downstream hydro plants, (i.e. Kamburu, Gitaru, and
Kindaruma) will average about 150 GWh annually over that available prior to
completion of the dam. As irrigation water is abstracted from the river in
the future, the increased energy available from the downstream plants will
fall to about 75 GWh annually.
6.14        EAP&L's operating and maintenance practices are such that the
electricity consumers in Kenya enjoy a reasonably reliable supply of
power.  The losses in the system amount to about 15%, which appear to be
reasonable, when age and the condition of the equipment is taken into
account.   The completion of the Mombasa-Kamburu 220 kV transmission line
(para. 6.16) should reduce these losses.
Works in Progress
6.15         Construction of the first two units at Olkaria is virtually
complete, with the first unit in operation since August 1981, and the
second unit  commissioned  before December  1982.   Para.  2.22 contains  a
description of this project financed under LN 1799-KE.
6.16        Two factors - the major load centers of Mombasa and Nairobi
separated by 500 km, and  the diverse types of power generation (hydro,
steam turbine, diesel, gas turbine)- made it prudent to construct a new
220-kV  transmission  line  from  Mombasa  to  the  Kamburu  hydroelectric
generating  station  in order  to  augment  the  transmission  capabilities.
Upon  its  completion,  forecast  for June  1983,  it will  be  possible  to
transmit additiona:L amounts of low cost hydro power to the Coast Region,



- 33 -
during periods of high river flow, and higher cost steam-generated power to
Nairobi and the Western regions, during annual low flow periods.   The new
transmission line will permit the transfer of about 100 MW, and the
existing transmission line will be disconnected near its midpoint and used
to distribute power westwards from Mombasa and eastwards from Nairobi.
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has provided C$79
million (US$63 million) for this important link which is estimated to cost
KSh 864 million (US$81.5 million).
6.17      The foregoing loan from CIDA is also financing the strengthening
of the transmission system in the Western District by overlaying a 132-kV
system on the existing 33-kV system and bringing electric power from the
Lessos substation (on the Nairobi-Uganda transmission line) to serve Kisumu
and Eldoret and Kericho.   In addition, work will commence soon on a 132-kV
extension  from Masinga  to  serve Nyeri  and Nanyuki  in the Mount Kenya
District.   Financing for this line is from a CIDA loan of C$4 million
(US$3.4 million) which became effective in 1981, and a supply credit from
Best Crompion, India, in the amount of KSh. 5.2 million (US$0.5 million).
The work under construction is shown on IBRD Map 16389R.
Training
6.18      EAP&L has several training programs designed to produce qualified
staff  to meet  the  company's  normal  growth  and  to  compensate  for  the
frequent  loss  of employees  to other  sectors  of the economy because of
salary differentials.  The cost of training in 1981 was KSh. 16 million for
490  trainees.    Of  these,  there  were  31  students  at university  and 9
graduate apprentices primarily in mechanical and electrical engineering.
There are 187 trainees in the Technicians Training Program, sponsored by
EAP&L at polytechnic schools in Nairobi and Mombasa.   Two hundred  and
fourteen candidates who did not meet the requirements for training as
technicians were apprenticed as linesmen, mechanical and electrical
fitters, welders, etc.  Twelve of the middle and senior managers attended
management courses conducted abroad, and 12 more attended courses by the
Kenya Institute of Administration and the East African Management
Institute.   The immediate training requirements are being fulfilled under
the loan for the first two units (LN 1799-KE).
Insurance
6.19       The three power companies maintain sufficient coverage against
loss   through   fire,   machinery  breakdown,   special  perils   (such  as
earthquakes) as well as against consequential loss, in addition to coverage
for such things as their motor vehicle fleet, workmen's compensation,
personal accidents, third party liability, etc., and the arrangements are
satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Monitoring System
6.20      The project will be monitored through a reporting system based on
critical items of implementation and financial criteria given in Annex 21.
During negotiations EAP&L agreed to the project monitoring system and to
the standard requirements of a completion report.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
The Power Market
7.OL      Although Kenya's Fourth Development Plan 1979-1983 was based on a
targeted economic growth of 6.3% per annum the growth in GDP 1977-80
averaged 4.2% per year, and recent forecasts indicate that the 1980-83
growth will not exceed an annual average of about 4%.   Growth  is then
expected to improve to about 5% per annum in the 1985-89 period when it is
expected that the country's terms of trade should stabilize and the growth
of  external  debt  should  decelerate.   The average growth in demand  for
electricity 1972-76 was 8% (para. 2.03) during which the growth in GDP
averaged about 4.7%.  EAP&L have now reduced their expected rate of growth
from 8% per annum in the National Power Development Plan (paras. 1.02 and
2.10), to the following: 1982 - 8.7%; 1983 - 6.9%; 1984 - 6.2%; 1985 - 6.3%
and 1986 onwards - 6%.  The mission reviewed the available data, and based
on the anticipated additional loads from new industry, agreed in general
with EAP&L's revised growth assumption (Annex 2).
Requirement for the Project
7.02         Electricity is supplied to consumers  from several hydro and
thermal generating stations (para. 6.10 and Annex 20), and although the
installed capacity is sufficient to meet the instantaneous peak demand,
the existing facilities cannot continuously meet the demand for electrical
energy during years when the river flows are below average, and the supply
from Uganda is not available.  Now that the Kiambere hydroelectric project
has been delayed (para. 2.11), there is a possibility of a repetition of
the 1980 problems (para. 2.08) when it was necessary to provide electricity
to only half of the consumers (except heavy industry) from 7:00 AM until
1:00 PM, and to the other half from 1:00 PM until 7:00 PM from February 16
through April 21. Based on 30 years of record, it is estimated that should
the driest year be repeated,there is a potential deficiency of about 80 GWh
in 1985 and over 200 GWh in 1986.  This potential shortfall increases each
year until the next generating station is commissioned.   The installation
of a third generating unit at Olkaria will add the equivalent of less than
one year's expected growth in demand for energy, so that even after the
unit is commissioned there a possibility that the generating facilities
would not be capable of meeting the energy demand for 1985 onwards, and
EAP&L would like to reduce this probability to a minimum.
7.03         During the years when the river flows are average or above
average,  the  third  unit  would  not  be  needed  to  meet  the  demand.
Nevertheless, it would be operated at full capacity so as to reduce the
need  to  generate  electricity  with  expensive  fuel  oil  at  the  Kipevu
generating station in Mombasa, resulting in an annual saving of about US$7
million.
Comparison of Alternatives
7.04           A report  on  the  feasibility  of  constructing  the Kiambere
hydroelectric  generating   station,   prepared  by  Engineering   &  Power
Development Consultants Limited of the United Kingdom, dated April 1980,



- 35 -
contained a recommendation that the station should be in operation by 1985
to meet the expected demand for energy.   However, the earliest that power
could be made available would be December 1986.   Necessary energy in the
interim period could be provided from new geothermal, diesel or gas turbine
installations.  The study of the alternative hydro project at the Turkwel
site has not been completed, and consideration of a coal-fired plant with
the necessary coal handling facilities as an alternative to this project
would not be reasonable because of the length of time required for
construction.
7.05      At the time of appraisal, the fuel cost to generate 1 GWh was as
follows: steam plant fuel - KSh. 620,000, diesel fuel - KSh. 1,100,000
and gas turbine fuel - KSh. 2,100,000.  In view of the extremely high gas
turbine fuel costs, and the length of time required to construct a
conventional steam plant, the best alternative to the geothermal plant for
providing an equivalent amount of power by the end of 1984 is a diesel
plant.   Therefore  the installation of additional generating capacity at
Olkaria was compared to the equivalent installation of diesel generating
equipment (15 MW) using the estimated cost of the diesel alternative shown
in Annex 22.  The comparison was carried out on the following basis:
a)   Interest during construction,  price escalation,  and duties
and taxes were not included;
b)  The production equivalent of the proposed plant's output in
the case of the diesel alternative would be provided as
follows: 80% from the Kipevu steam plant in Mombasa and 20%
from diesel generating plant located close to the demand, and
therefore additional transmission facilities would not be
required;
c)  Cost of steam plant fuel at KSh. 620,000 and diesel fuel at
at KSh. 1,100,000 per GWh; and
d)  Shadow prices were used for foreign exchange6/.
7.06        The least-cost solution was found to be the geothermal project,
at discount rates up to 78%, which is much higher than the opportunity cost
of capital  in Kenya,  estimated  to be 12%.   Sensitivity tests have been
carried out to determine the effect of a 10% increase in estimated capital
costs for the geothermal project together with a 10% reduction in capital
and operating costs for the diesel alternative, and the geothermal
alternative remains the least-cost solution at discount rates up to about
74% (Annex 23).
Economic Rate of Return
7.07          The economic  rate of return,  relating  the economic project
capital and operating costs to the savings and revenues expected from it,
were calculated by taking into account the following assumptions.   During
6/ Shadow foreign exchange rate KSh. 12.0 = US$1.00 compared to March 1982
rate of KSh. 10.6 = US$1.00.



- 36 -
most of the year, the existing generating plant is capable of meeting the
demand for energy, and for the next few years energy from Olkaria would be
needed to meet the requirements of the system only during the periods of
low river flow.  Therefore, although the sale of energy from the third unit
at Olkaria is expected to begin April 1, 1985, for the computation of the
benefits it has been assumed that energy from the third geothermal unit
would be sold for only 20% of the year in the first year of operation.
During the remaining 80% of the year, the output from the third unit at
Olkaria would be used to substitute generation of expensive energy in the
Kipevu oil-fired steam plant, thus reducing the annual operating costs by
the equivalent fuel savings. It was also assumed that the amount of energy
sold from Olkaria would increase by 20% annually and the savings in fuel
oil correspondingly decrease by 20%, so that by 1989 the station was
assumed  to be  100% revenue  producing.   Shadow prices were used  for  the
foreign  exchange  component.   However, shadow  price  were  not applied  to
unskilled labor because their application would have little effect on the
rate of return.  The revenue was determined by multiplying the rated output
of the project, which was reduced by the estimated losses in the
transmission and distribution system, by EAP&L's average tariff yield per
KWh sold of KSh. 0.62 per KWh.  The internal economic rate of return is
about 15.5%. When the sensitivity of the rate of return was tested, it was
found that an increase in the capital cost of the project by 10% and a
decrease in benefits of 10% reduces the economic rate of return to about
14.0%.
7.08          The cost and  benefit streams,  and  the  assumptions  used  to
determine the rate of return on investment are detailed in Annex 24.
Project Risks
7.09            Risks  of  varying  degree  are  normally  associated  with  the
implementation of a project of this kind.    First, an institutional risk
relating to EAP&L and KPC's capability to properly administer the contracts
under this project and the other projects in their development program.
The Bank's previous four loans to the power sector (para. 2.17 - 2.22) have
all been successful, and the projects have been completed virtually on
schedule, and without significant cost overruns.   There is little  doubt,
therefore, as to KPC's capability in this regard, and this risk is minimal.
7.10          One physical risk, however, lies  in  the  assessment of  the
geothermal reservoir and in the volume and characteristics of the steam
which may be recovered  to drive the steam turbines.   In the loan for the
first two units (para. 2.22), the Bank included a covenant that at least
80% of the steam requirements should be proven before the generating
equipment  could  be  ordered.   In  this  project,  the  existence  of  steam
capable of generating 37 MW (82%) has already been proven, and three wells,
as  yet untested,  have  an  additional  estimated  output  of 5 MW.   There
remains, therefore, the risk that the total 45 MW may not be found, or that
a decline in the output from the wells may occur after a period of time.
It is expected that calcite and silica will be precipitated when the hot
water flashes into steam, resulting in a retardation of steam flow.  Thus,
in the cost of operation, it has been assumed that two new wells would be
drilled  every  three  years  to make up  for any  diminuation  of flow.   The
Olkaria site could be subject to earthquake shocks of an intensity, ranging



- 37 -
from VIII to IX on the modified Mercali Scale, which means that there would
be moderate to severe damage to buildings not specifically designed to
withstand  such  forces.   Therefore,  the buildings  and equipment  for the
project would be designed to withstand these forces without incurring
failure or distortion, in accordance with the Kenya Code of Practice for
the Design and Construction of Buildings and Other Structures in Relation
to Earthquakes.   In so far as it can, this risk has been minimized by the
employment of GENZL and Virkir who have had extensive experience in the
development of similar geothermal projects in New Zealand and Iceland.
7.11       Another physical risk relates to the operation of the plant and
the  suitability  of  the design  of  the proposed  project.    For  example,
although a minor defect has occurred in the civil works causing the leakage
of some steam condensate, electricity continues to be supplied while
suitable corrective measures are being taken. Over a year's experience has
been gained so far in the operation of the first unit, and to date the
mechanical and electrical equipment has performed efficiently and as
expected. In fact, for several months the equipment produced an average of
15.3 MW continuously which  is above  the nameplate rating.   An indirect
safeguard against the risk of failure of equipment or structures is the
employment of Merz & McLellan who have had extensive experience in the
design and development of conventional thermal power plants.
7.12      The financial risk of the proposed project and the ability of KPC
to repay the borrowed funds is considered negligible.   The electric power
industry  in Kenya  has  successfully  provided  electrical  energy  to  its
consumers for many years.   In the past, the Government has allowed  EAP&L
to adjust  its  tariffs  so  that  the  company  has  remained    in a  sound
financial position.  The rate of return covenant proposed for this project
(para. 5.15) would help to ensure that EAP&L and KPC would continue to be
in a sound financial position in the future.
VIII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements to be Reached
8.01         During negotiations,  agreement was reached by the Bank,  the
Government, EAP&L and KPC that:
a) KPC would retain consultants to carry out a study of the
geothermal potential and complete their report by December
31, 1983, and EAP&L would retain consultants to plan a least
cost investment program, and complete their report by October
30, 1984 (para. 3.06).
b) EAP&L would continue to employ auditors satisfactory to the
Bank and submit to the Bank copies of annual accounts
of KPC, TRDC and EAP&L (para. 4.13);
c) Fixed assets of the three companies would continue to be
revalued for the purpose of determining rate of return
(para. 5.06);



- 38 -
d)  EAP&L would pay a development surcharge to KPC during the
construction period of the proposed project to provide a part
of KPC's requirements of local currency funds for the project
(para. 5.10);
e) The Governmeint would provide additional funds, if required,
to complete the proposed project (para. 5.13);
f) Minimum annual rate of return of 8% is to be earned by the
three power companies on a combined basis; timely tariff
adjustments are to be made to achieve this rate (para. 5.15);
g) Debt limitation covenant of Loan 1799-KE would be repeated
(para. 5.16);
h)  A program for the merging of KPC and TRDC  into a single
company would be made (para. 6.02); and
i) EAP&L would continue to employ consultants satsfactory to the
Bank to carry out the project (para. 6.09).
8.02      The completion of co-financing  arrangements  is a condition  of
effectiveness of the loan (para. 5.13).
Recommendation
8.03        With the above agreements, the project would be suitable for a
Bank  loan  of  US$12.0  million  equivalent   (including  US$0.2  million
capitalized front-end fee) for a term of seventeen years including a grace
period of four years.

OLKARIA GEOTHERMAL POWER EXPANSION PROJECT
Description of Project
Characteristics of the Geothermal Field
1.           Although  the Olkaria  geothermal  field  extends  over an area
exceeding 50 km2, the area of the reservoir now being developed is some
12 km2.  Under this region, circulating ground water is heated by the hot
rock to a temperature up to 3500C and is almost wholly contained by a
nearly impervious caprock about 700 meters below grade. Some steam escapes
through fissures and fractures in the rock and appears at the ground
surface in scattered locations.   The volume of escaping steam is replaced
by water from Lake Naivasha seeping down through porous sections of the
bedrock.   At depth,  the water is saline and contains fluoride, calcium,
mragnesium and  the sulphate  salts.    The  steam  contains  non-condensable
gases,   the   most   dominant   being   carbon   dioxide,   but   hydrogen,
hydrogen-sulphide and methane are also present.   Scaling of silica and
calcite can be expected when the pressure is reduced and the water flashes
into steam. Long-term tests at the existing well-heads have been conducted
to determine the appropriate operating pressures to minimise scaling.
Previous Work
2.      Between 1970 and 1976 approximately US$5.6 million were expended in
studies and in drilling six production wells and associated works, and
since 1978 about US$18 million has been expended in drilling 15 additional
production wells.   The cost of drilling these wells, a new drilling rig,
and associated equipment and materials sufficient to operate until the end
of 1984 was included in the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project Loan 1799-KE.
Each production well is 22" in diameter at the top and reduces in several
steps to 8-3/4" in diameter 900 to 2,500 meters below ground level.  As a
well is drilled, a steel liner is concreted in place, beginning with an
18-1/2" O.D. casing at the top.   The lower end of the well contains  a
slotted 7" O.D. diameter casing which is not concreted, allowing the steam
to flow into the casing. A tabulation of the capability of each completed
well is shown in Annex 8.
Well-head Equipment and Steam Gathering System
3.        The equipment at the top of each well consists mainly of a steam
and water separator, and exhaust silencer, control valves, testing and
measuring  devices.   The steam  is conveyed  to the powerhouse  through a
system  of  insulated  pipelines,  and  designed  to  take  advantage  of  the
topography, and allow for expansion and contraction.

Powerhouse and Equipment
4.      The equipment for this expansion would consist of an extension to a
steel building structure with minor civil works.   The structure to house
the turbine and generator, associated control equipment of Units 1 and 2
and  a  small  workshop   has   been  completed.           The  proposed   15-MW
turbo-generator would be designed using materials specially selected to
withstand the corrosive and erosive characteristics of the steam emitted
from the production wells.  The site is about 7 km from Lake Naivasha, too
far to be used as a source for cooling water, and therefore a system with a
forced draft cooling tower was the most economical solution to meet the
cooling requirements.  This tower would be extended for the proposed third
unit.
Electrical Installation
5.          Cost  savings  in switching  and transformers  were achieved by
connecting the first two 15-MW units to a single 36-MVA transformer, and
stepping  the voltage  up to 132 kV.   A new 18 MVA transformer would be
required for the third unit.  Suitable circuit breakers at Olkaria and the
substation at Naivasha allow for convenient maintenance and adequate fault
protection.
Transmission Line
6.        The existing 132 kV transmission line has sufficient capacity to
carry the output of the third 15-MW unit.  The line was constructed from
material salvaged from part of a 275-kV line which required removal because
of the flooding of the Masinga Dam Reservoir.  The shortest route for the
transmission line from Olkaria to Naivasha, where it joins the Nairobi to
Uganda transmission line, is through Hell's Gate Gorge, a distance of 20
km.  However, by a short diversion of about 2 km, the line bypasses this
frequently visited tourist attraction and leaves it in its natural state.
Studies
7.         Funds have been provided for two studies to be carried out as
components  of  the project.    The  first  is a review  of  the  geothermal
reservoir.   In December 1980, all of the data collected  to date on the
Olkaria site was reviewed by a group of consultants and recommendations
were  made   on  further  geothermal   exploration  to  be  carried  out.
Considerable more data is now available as a result of the drilling which
has taken place in 1981 and 1982 and funds have been included to review
this additional  information.   The  characteristics  of  the reservoir  are
becoming better defined, and it is hoped that the results of another
scientific review meeting would result in a more judicious location of the
production wells, so as to produce a greater amount of steam.  The cost to
perform these studies is estimated to be about US$400,000, covering 40
man-months at about US$10,000 per man-month, plus local expenses estimated



- 45 -
ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 3
to be about US$200,000 to cover the cost of developing additional data and
information.
8.      The second study would be the preparation of a long range planning
program including a feasibility study of the next power project, and the
justification for its selection.  The terms of reference for such a study
would include various alternative scenarios of project' implementation, and
would cover several prime sources of energy - hydro, geothermal, coal and
oil.   Infrastructure for a coal-fired generating station i.e land, roads,
water and harbor facilities is a priority study area if it is found to be
economically feasible to use coal at the end of the decade.  This in-depth
review of historic data on the use of electrical energy, and the several
alternative methods of meeting the expected load growth and the related
cost, is expected to require foreign funds amounting to about US$1.5
million (based on 150 man-months at US$10,000 per man-month). In addition,
local costs of US$500,000 are expected to be required to cover additional
detailed topographic and geotechnical surveys.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Sales and Revenues
1.           EAP&L's energy sales and revenue for each customer category
appear  in Annex 14.   Revenues  from 1982 onwards are based on a tariff
increase of 18% effective on January 1, 1983, and further increases of 6%
and 240 on January 1, 1984 and January 1, 1985 respectively.
2.            A consumption tax of 1 cent per kWh is levied on all energy
sales.
3.          The revenues of KPC and TRDC are their respective ascertained
costs, the amount payable by EAP&L for electricity purchased from both
companies,  is  described  in  para.  4.    The  ascertained  costs  of  both
companies include a development surcharge as described in para. 5 below.
Ascertained Cost
4.         The bulk supply licenses of KPC and TRDC define ascertained cost
(on the basis of which their revenues are determined) as the actual audited
cost each year for the following items:
(a)   Operations and administration.   This also includes the cost of
purchasing power from Uganda and from TARDA;
(b) Interest and redemption payments for debt;
(c) Income or other taxes; and
(d) Such other charges as the Government shall consider proper to be
allowed. Under this authority a development surcharge (described
later in this annex) has been added, starting 1971 for TRDC and
1979 for KPC, as part of their respective ascertained cost.
In addition, ascertained cost includes small annual appropriations to a
Reserve and Equalization Fund which, with the interest on the securities in
which it is invested, is available for future capital expenditure or to
cover deficiencies in income and to pay for abnormal expenses.
Development Surcharge
5.         Development surcharge, being paid by EAP&L to TRDC and KPC, was
principally designed to provide the latter two companies with a part of the
funds required to pay the local currency costs of their development
projects.  The surcharge has been paid by EAP&L since 1971, as part of the
cost of electricity it purchases from TRDC and KPC, and is determined each
year in relation to their respective development activities.



- 57 -
ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 5
The payment of surcharge has provided to TRDC funds for part of the local
currency requirements of the Gitaru project, and to KPC for the Geothermal
project. It has also reduced the income tax burden of the power sector
during the construction period of the project by increasing KPC and TRDC's
income which is exempt from income tax and by reducing EAP&L's taxable
income. Through the development surcharge EAP&L is expected to continue to
provide part of the local financing requirements of the proposed geothermal
project.
Fuel Cost and Purchased Energy
6.          Fuel use for operating EAP&L plants is assumed to decrease with
the commissioning of the two 15-MW geothermal units expected at the end of
FY82 and FY84 and to increase with the load growth in FY86.  A provision
for price escalation of 8%, 8%, 7.5%, 7.5% and 6% respectively for the
years FY82 to FY86 has been made.
7.        KPC's annual purchases from UEB are assumed to be constant at 252
GWh and KSh 15.9 million from 1982 onward under the existing contract.
TRDC is assumed to purchase 167 GWh during FY82-84, 170 GWh in FY85 and 185
GWh in FY86 from TARDA's Masinga dam power station.  The estimated cost of
this energy is based on the agreement for electricity purchase by TRDC
from TARDA.
Operating and Administration Expenses
8.        Increases in volume of operations are reflected in these
expenses:   for TRDC an average of 7%; for KPC, due to the addition of two
geothermal units in 1982 and 1984 respectively, the expenses are expected
to  increase  on  average  by KSh  1.9  million  for  each  unit.    EAP&L's
distribution cost is expected to increase by 1% annually.   In addition,
provision for price escalations of 13%, 9%, 8%, 8% and 8% respectively for
1982 to 1986 has been made.
Depreciation
9.          Depreciation is charged as a percentage of the revalued fixed
asset at the beginning of each year - EAP&L 3.7%, KPC 2.6%, and TRDC 2.2%.
This is consistent with past experience.   The depreciation for the years
1979 to 1981 is computed on the historical cost of fixed assets, whereas
for the period after 1981, it has been calculated on revalued fixed assets.
Taxes
10.          TRDC and KPC's  incomes are exempt from income tax.   EAP&L's
income is subject to tax at present at the rate of 45%.
Dividends
11.         Dividends on 4% and 7% preferred stock are KSh 1.9 million per
year. Dividends on common stock of EAP&L are assumed to continue at the
1981 level of 12% per year.

ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 5
Rate of Return - Financial
12.         The rate of return has been calculated on the average revalued
net fixed assets in operation. Depreciation allowance used for calculation
of operating income is on the basis of revalued fixed assets.
Rate of Return - Statutory
13.          Under the Electric Power Act of Kenya (Section 47), a power
company's tariffs would be subject to reduction to the extent of
five-sixths of the amount by which operating income before income tax for
any year exceeds 12-1/2% of the "capital expended on the undertaking" as of
the end of the year.  This statutory assets base is taken as the total of
fixed assets at cost, including work in progress and inventories at the end
of each year.   The financial projections  show that the operating income
before income tax exceeds 12-1/2% of this statutory rate base in many of
the years from 1982 to 1986; however, the rate of return covenants of IBRD
loans 1147-KE, 1799-KE and the proposed loan would ensure that tariffs
aremaintained at adequate levels.
Fixed Assets
14.        Fixed assets and depreciation for the years 1978 to 1980 are at
cost as shown in audited accounts.   In 1981, fixed assets and accumulated
depreciation have been increased to reflect estimated replacement values
and  in  1982  and  subsequent  years  by  10%,  8.4%,  7.7%,  7.4%  and  6.8%
respectively  to  reflect  estimated  price  escalations  in  those  years.
Accounts Receivable
15.             EAP&L's  accounts  receivables  are  assumed  to  be  18%  of
total revenues in accordance with recent past experience.
Inventories
16.       On the basis of 1981 figures, EAP&L inventories are assumed to be
13% of gross revalued plant in operation while those of KPC and TRDC are
assumed to be constant.
Long-Term Debt
17.       A statement showing the composition of foreign exchange and local
currency loans of KPC appears on the following page.

Electricity Tariff Structure
1.         EAP&L's new tariff structure was developed in consultation with
the Bank.   It took effect on January 1, 1979 and comprises the following
six categories:
Method A: covers consumers whose monthly usage does not
exceed 7,000 KWh.
Method B: is applicable to consumers with monthly usage ranging
from 7,001 to 100,000 KWh.
Method C:  covers consumers whose monthly usage exceeds 100,000
units.
Method D: Off-peak supplies.
Method E: Public Lighting.
Method F: Company staff.
2.         In addition, there is provision for the introduction of a fuel
oil cost adjustment with the approval of the Ministry of Power and
Communications.   This is a surcharge designed to allow EAP&L to recover
part of any additional fuel costs from electricity consumers based on the
difference between actual fuel cost and a "basic price".  EAP&L has added
surcharge at rates of 13.9 Kenya cents per KWh from August 1980 and 21.2
cents from July 1981 on all energy sales.
3.        Details of the tariffs are presented in the attached table.

Loan Capital and Security Arrangements of EAP&L, KPC and TRDC
1.       This annex describes the loan capital of power companies of Kenya
and  the  arrangements  securing  this  loan capital.    The  amounts  stated
represent the total amount of the loans contracted and not the amounts
outstanding, which are given in Annex 16.  Unless indicated otherwise, all
references to £ are references to £ Sterling.
EAP&L
2.       EAP&L's loan capital comprises loans from Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC), (KSh. 7 million, KSh. 58.88 million and KSh. 30
million), and from Glyn, Mills and Company syndicate (KSh. 57.75 million,
KSh. 4.328 million, KSh. 59.59 million and KSh. 4.8 million). The CDC loan
of £350,000 was secured by (i) EAP&L.s 8½% Debentures 1971-85; and (ii) a
Trust Deed dated November 1, 1968, which provided for a first legal charge
on specified leasehold properties  of EAP&L.   The KSh. 58.88 million CDC
loan and the KSh. 57.75 loan from the Glyn, Mills and Company syndicate
were  respectively  secured  by  Debenture  Stock  1975-91  and  1971-80
respectively, as well as a Trust Deed dated May 16, 1969.  This Trust Deed
created mortgages and charges on certain of EAP&L's properties and assets
and also stipulated that EAP&L was not to create any mortgage or charge
ranking in priority to or pari passu with that mortgage or charge.   The
KSh. 30 million CDC loan and Glyn syndicate loans of KSh. 54.49 million and
KSh. 4.8 million were secured by Debenture Stock 1979-88, and 1978-80
respectively, as well as a supplemental Trust Deed dated August 29, 1974
which made these loans to rank pari passu with the loans secured by the
Trust Deed dated May 16, 1969.  By the end of 1978 EAP&L had also taken up
KSh. 1.296 million at 8% on an unsecured basis from a KSh. 15 million given
by the Britis Government to the Government of Kenya and a further KSh.
7.342 million on similar terms from a loan of KSh. 20 million made to the
Government of Kenya by the Finnish Government.
KPC
3.      In 1955 KPC floated a £7,500,000 loan by the issue of a '£7,500,000
5½% Debenture Stock 1975/85.   £3,500,000 of this loan was subscribed by
CDC, and the balance was underwritten for public sale. The Debenture Stock
was secured by a Trust Deed Dated June 27, 1956, which among other things,
created a first legal charge and a floating charge in respect of KPC's
property and assets and stipulated that KPC was not to create any further
charges or incumbrances upon its undertakings and assets ranking in
priority to or pari passu  with the charges created under the Trust Deed

except in special stated circumstances.  The Trust Deed also provived that
any scheme for the reconstruction should require an extraordinary
resolution of the stockholders which means in effect the consent of
three-fourths of the stockholders.  KPC also took up in 1977 an unsecured
9% loan from EAP&L, in the amount of KSh. 26.34 million, repayable in 10
years commencing from the commissioning of the first geothermal plant as
well as KSh. 1.25 million of an 8.5% unsecured loan from TRDC totalling
KSh. 2.9 million (balance taken up in 1978) and repayable from 1979 to the
year  2000.    Both  of  these  loans  were  repaid  in 1978.  In  1980,  KPC
contracted with IBRD to borrow US$40 million at 7.95% annual interest and
repayable during 1985-1999, and with CDC to borrow £9.25 million at 8.5%
annual interest and repayable during 1982-1994 for installing the first two
units of the Olkaria power project.
TRDC
4.        TRDC's loan capital in 1978 came from CDC, the Glyn, Mills and
Company syndicate (now Williams & Glyn's Bank Ltd.), EAP&L, IBRD, the
Government of Kenya, from a SIDA credit to the Government of Kenya, and
from the Standard Bank Limited and export suppliers credits.  A Trust Deed
dated May 26, 1966 modified and extended by three Supplemental Trust Deeds
dated December 5, 1968, December 16, 1971 and March 10, 1976, secures the
following loans:
b) Sh. 9,240,500 and Sh. 5,380,000 B Debenture Stock 1971-87;
c) Sh. 6,040,000 C Debenture Stock 1971-87;
d) Sh. 81,300,000 E Debenture Stock 1975-96;
e) US$23,000,000 and US$63,000,000 IBRD loans;
f) £2,000,000 Debenture Stock 1980-91;
g) KSh. 2,000,000 loan from EAP&L; and
h) KSh. 1,890,000 loan from the Government of Kenya.
The Trust Deed provided for the creation of a floating charge of TRDC's
undertakings, property and assets and also required TRDC (i) not to (A)
create without the Trustee's consent any mortgage or charge ranking in
priority to a pari passu   with the floating charge  of  (B)  create  any
specific mortgage or charge over any of its immovable property or other
assets without prior written consent of the Trustee or have any subsidiary,
except with the prior written consent of the Trustee.  The Trust Deed also
provides  for  the  creation  and  issue  in  specified  circumstances  of
additional stock to rank pari passu in point of security with the original
stock created under the Trust Deed.   These circumstances include the need
to secure any loan TRDC would need to finance later stages of the Seven
Forks Hydroelectric Project.

5.      In addition, TRDC has issued promissory notes in the amounts of Dm
22,553,000 and US$217,000 to cover part of the export suppliers credits
while DM 32,459,000 financed by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau is covered
by a guarantee from the West German Government. The loan from the Standard
Bank Limited was unsecured and repaid in 1978.

KENYA
OLKARIA GEOTHERMAL POWER EXPANSION PROJECT
History of the Power Companies
1.       The Kenya Electric Supply Industry is presently comprised of four
organizations:
a) The East African Power & Lighting Co. Ltd (EAP&L);
b) The Kenya Power Co. Ltd (KPC);
c) Tana River Development Co. Ltd (TRDC); and
d) Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA)
The East African Power & Lighting Co. Ltd (EAP&L)
2.       EAP&L, which is the sole distribution company, was incorporated in
1922 by the amalgamation of two undertakings which had supplied Nairobi and
Mombasa since 1907 and 1909, respectively.   It is a local private company
with authorised share capital of KSh. 250 million, of which KSh. 207.85
million  is issued.   In addition,  loan capital amounting to KSh. 121.40
million was outstanding as at the end of 1980. Although formerly operating
throughout Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, its activities have been confined to
Kenya since 1964 due to purchase of the Uganda and Tanzania undertakings by
the respective Governments.   The company is primarily concerned with the
commercial distribution of electricity throughout Kenya.   At present,  it
also generates the entire power requirements of the coast system covering
Mombasa, Malindi and Kwale, provides the necessary thermal back-up for the
main grid system, and operates generating stations in centers not connected
to the grid.   It also coordinates all sources of power,  and staffs and
manages KPC and TRDC, and since August 1981, staffs and manages the Masinga
Dam powerhouse.
3.        In 1970, the Government acquired a controlling interest in EAP&L
when it made a successful bid for all the shares on the London Register.
Since then the Government has been purchasing shares as they come on the
East African market, and its total holding together with that of
government-controlled agencies is now over.
The Kenya Power Co. Ltd (KPC)
4.          In 1955,  EAP&L  was  faced with  the problem  of  financing  the
construction  of  a  132-kV  transmission  line  to  interconnect  the  power
systems of Uganda and Kenya as well as other expansion requirements.   The
company did not consider it practicable to raise the required finances
through new equity issues because of conservative dividend policies due to
political pressures and the need for increased self-financing.   There was
also revived political pressure for nationalization. The company concluded



- 67 -
ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 2
it was inevitable and desirable to increase public ownership and direct
government  participation  in  the  power  industry.    Accordingly,  it  was
decided to form a new company, KPC, in 1955 with an issued nominal capital
of KSh. 2000 held equally by EAP&L, the Government and a UK finance house.
KPC's function was to construct the transmission line and to take over the
ownership of the two hydroelectric stations belonging to EAP&L on the Tana
River. KPC financed its requirements through issuance of KSh. 7.5 million
of debenture stock, the payment of the debt service on which was guaranteed
by  EAP&L's   understanding   to  purchase  KPC's   entire  production  at
"ascertained cost".
5.       In accordance with its policy of increasing its participation in
the electricity supply industry, the Government acquired 100% of KPC's
issued  share  capital  by  buying  out  EAP&L's  and  Power  Securities
Corporation Ltd. in 1971.   Subsequently, in 1980, KPC increased its share
capital to KSh. 60 million and contracted IBRD and CDC loans of US$40
million and £stg. 9.25 million respectively to finance construction of the
first two 15-MW units of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project.
Tana River Development Co. LTD (TRDC)
6.      A forecast of load growth after Kenya's achievement of independence
in December 1963 indicated that it would be necessary to commission further
major generating capacity by 1967-68, and a reappraisal of the Seven Forks
Scheme (the harnessing of the hydro potential of the Upper Tana)
established Kindaruma as the most economical first stage development. TRDC
was formed in 1964 to finance the Kindaruma hydroelectric development for
much the same reasons as led to the formation of KPC. The share capital of
TRDC is KSh. 120 million, all of which is held by the Government.
CDC supplied KSh. 3.5 million of a total of about KSh. 6 million of loan
capital which was arranged for the Kindaruma project.   Kamburu Stage 1,
comprising the first two generating units, was commissioned in July 1974
and  the  third  unit  in  1976.    Gitaru,  the  last  of  the  Seven  Forks
hydroelectric projects, was commissioned in 1978. Like KPC, TRDC sells its
entire output to EAP&L at ascertained cost.
Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA)
7.      The fourth company, Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority, has
constructed the Masinga Dam on the Tana River primarily for irrigation
purposes.   Advantage  of  the  dam  has  been  taken by EAP&L to  complete
arrangements with TARDA to include a powerhouse and related structures and
equipment at the site.  EAP&L pays a fixed charge of KSh. 36 million per
year to TARDA from the date the reservoir was first filled to the maximum
operating level.  This charge has been adjusted in relation to the cost of
fuel that this powerhouse displaces at the time of commissioning.   All
costs in excess of KSh. 4.9 for operation and maintenance of the powerhouse
and other direct power-producing facilities, not including the dam, will be
paid by TARDA.

OLKARIA GEOTHERMAL POWER EXPANSION PROJECT
Project Monitoring System
There are several key factors which affect the operation of a
utility and the ultimate success of the project. These have been discussed
with the Borrower, and in view of the previous loans, it was determined tht
existing systems for gathering information and statistics are acceptable,
and there is no need to add new requirements for additional monitoring
purposes.
The project, however, would be monitored, and the main items to be
monitored are described below:
1) Critical Items for Project Implementation
a) Progress of construction relative to thie schedule;
b) Rate of drilling new wells and associated steam
characteristics;
c) Call for tenders and procurement ot new equipment; and
d) On-line date of Unit 3.
2) Financial
a) Review of financial status of the combined companies before
April 30, 1982; and
b) Comparison of appraisal financial forecast and actual
performance.

Assumptions:  -  Costs based on mid-1982 price levels;
-  Annual 100 GWh output from geothermal unit is assumed to be replaced
by 20 GWh from a diesel unit and 80 GWh from the steam plant;
-  Cost of diesel plant fuel - KSh 1,100,000 per GWh;
-  Cost of steam plant fuel - KSh 620,000 per GWh;
-  IDC, escalation, and taxes not included in costs;
-  Foreign cost shadow priced by 13%;
-  Local labor not shadow priced;
-  Life of project 30 years;
-  Life of diesel alternative - 15 years;
-  Geothermal operating costs include cost of 2 new wells every 3
years.
Equalizing Discount Rate: 78%
Sensitivity Test: If the project capital and operating costs increase by 10% and
the benefits decrease by 10% the equalizing rate of return falls
to about 74%.
