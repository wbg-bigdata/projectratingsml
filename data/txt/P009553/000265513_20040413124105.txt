                              Receipt of Request

       On August 6, 1996 a group of Bangladesh citizens signed and sent this Request
addressed to the Inspection Panel Office in Washington, D.C. On November 13, 1996 the
Requesters contacted the Panel to inquire about the processing of their Request. The Panel
advised them that it had never received the Request and had to ask them to re-submit it. On
November 25, 1996 the Panel notified the Executive Directors and IDA President of receipt of
the Request.

       The Panel subsequently learned that the World Bank mail room received the package on
August 14, 1996 and mistakenly delivered it the next day to South Asia Regional Management.
The document was accepted there but never forwarded to the Panel.          The Panel asked
Management to investigate the apparent disappearance of the document. Management had no
explanation for errors and could not supply the missing Request.

       This is the second time a Request has been diverted to the relevant Region and
disappeared.
