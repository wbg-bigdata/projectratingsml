MEMORANDUM AND RECOMENDATON OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INtNATIONAL DEVELOPMEN ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECTiV  DIR1ECT1ORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDWT TO THE REPU}IC OF GHANA
FOR A lUANO    EQp  RIC
1.    I       for your approval fte following m      nd               n on a proposed
crdit to he mRepublic of Ghana (ROG) for SDR 9 mm l (US$13 million equvnt) to help finc
the Pivat Secor Developm  Project (PSD). The credit would be on standard IDA terms with a
matuity of 40 years.
2.    Cgn .r k gIbd            : Ghana has bad a strong record an ma_oonic
perrmance uni the electionreated fisc shock in 1992. In the 10 years prior toe intction
of the Econor1Ac Recovery Program (ERP), rea GDP fel by 2 prce  per annum in the 10 years
since its introduction, real GDP has risen by 5 percet per annu. Iflatn fell from a high of 123
prcen In 1983 to 18 percen in 1991 and invtnt rose fom around 6 percent to 16 pere  in
1991. The lare electionreated wage  creas resulted in a higher fi  deficit and raisenflation.
The fiscal sitbation improved In 1993, but by less tm  plamned but growth was around S perm
Ihe 1994 budget expecs fiscal balace to be restored. After the collapse in pvate investme In
1992, it has been risig and investment is expected to reach 18 percet by 1997.
3.   ITe overnment is commtod tD forging a new alliance With the prvat sector to ine
and deepen that sector's contribution to the country's growth. While the Govemet has, through its
varis  policy and regulory reforms, done much, there is stil work to be done to deVeo and
broaden the overall technological, productie and export capcity of the privat sector. With
industry accounting for only 9.2 percent of GDP in 1990, it is imperative to stregen
and deepen this sector's ability to compet in the hiSgy com'efitive and i ingy  hnologicly
demading Intational markets. To overcome the m           and technols  constraints
facing te privaw setomr and create a more dynamic "we-tradidonal secor alteaive, it i necary
to address the lack of coection, and bridge the gap, between the state sponsored research and
development ies and a  ologically deficiet pvate scor.  bese conaim s are worsened
by a private sector addionaly limied by its own lack of capacity to develop feaible busnes plans,
manage producon, handle financial matters and which generasy opeames In an enviromment In which
the necemary supports for such eements as trade development iad competive product designs are
also laig. Finaly, a general constraint to growth and productvity can also be ideified in a
deficient com cial legal serices system whose lack of capacity and limited responsiveness impedes
the flow of business transactions and the timey resolution of routine cmer    disputes.
4.    This project is consistent with the co - ty assistan  strategy and closely suort te private
sector development objective thereia (see para. 19) in conjunction with other IDA project under
imp        l n (mee Anne 1) and under preparion as dicussed below. Th Prvate Sector
Adjustme  Credit (PSAC), under paion, is beg designd to address o
macroecomic  issues and other polcy conditDons that are seen to be ihibit  to the prve sector-
led growth, the cOr ero  of the oveal cooy stategy. Si      ly    a prposed Vocatnl
Skills and Infm  Appre  Support Projec is being prepared to address incsd pobducvity
and the enigs of workers in selected occuation  areas touh   improved apprenticesp programs
and the provision of training on a demanddriven basis.
S.    This ptoject is also deigned to be compl    to the ongoing U.S. Agency for
Intenonal Development (USAID) financed Trade ad lavmw   l Project which prvides tecbical
to Ghanalam private sector companies In developing her export potenl dthogh advice on

production, marketing and commercial aspects of exorting. To this en, USD has financed the
establidment oan Afidca Project Deveopment Faciiy (APDT) ofice as woU as the Private
Enerprie Foundation    ). a registered, private, n-profit compay in Ghan.   addion, the
proect will supplem  the ongoing efforts of the UK Overa  Deve_omt    Isan (ODA)
in proviig teical          to pmoegrowth in suployent and Income; support Empretc
Ghana Poudon 0(MPRErEC) an  uq-e, nrofit busines spont agency; ad promot
expors and impon substtution by small and medim  enises in Ghana.
6.    Finally, the proje also bncora  its received fom a 1993194 Private Sector
Roundtable, spored by the Bank and swpported by the Govrnent, whckh has atmpted to
identify a nwmber of disce constnts beng fed by the prirate sor. While many of the
h r A Id 61oudied in the findings of the Roundtable arw either cros-sescoral or project dicrete in
naue, this project, in coformity with the country  isnce stra, will address th   that are
more pressing and immediat to the needs of the private sector.
7.    Erjl* QbWf:: The project would contnue the process of foseng the development of
a competive private sector by (a) assisting the Govemment In building on its investment
lialization by suppon its orts to restucture, reform and commercialize ls echnical research
and development establishment along compettive and demand driven principles. Fm this selective
institonal            Ghaas private sector wfll be asisted in evaluating and developing
aopriate tedhology, improving its Inowledge of quality and sndards and in general deepening its
tecbical cqcity and informaton (b) providig to a broad seg_m  of the private sector the
ecessary financi and technc  assistance to support the developmen of commercialy bankable
projects by Imrvn their feasibility and qulity; (c) suortig effods by th export industry to
imrve dteir design and the pmotion of their products; and (d) assting the Goveame  in
developing a progrm to upgrade the delivery of legal serices to the co_mmcial and
sectrs, thereby acoderating reo  time for commerial tasactions and comercial conact
disue.

crucially depende  on the prvision of specialized third party support to the  h  and
bu_ness commaunty, a service not generally avaible from commercial bank at this timo. In the area

17.   bainafoz      JrMAnvolvm       From the agenda of issues arsing out of a series of
oundable dissions between IDA, the Govem and the privae sector and the research work
unde the Bank's Regional Program on Enterpise Development (IPED), k b evident ttas
economy still las the ssential commeral dynamics. In the case of rearch and developmen
studies continue to show te need for technological stengtening; but with the absee of any linkage
between the publicly suworted  tes and the nascent private sector e   remains the neod to
assist in the process of building these linkages. The private sectr, itself conties to complain of a
lack of credit support while ban queston the capacity or experience of borowers to reosbly
accept addition credit Wit some mediang influence this situation effectively staUs the
likelihood of aeh ip and inovation. Futhermor withou an instutionai showcase to
market and display its products or the ability to chage, adopt or improve its product lines, Ghana I
having difficulty competig in a world in which such support systems have become the nOrm. In the
abce of a robust private sector, such support can only be forthcoming ftrough assistance of the
type provided under the project.
18.   While Ghanas commercial legiation has been steadily stengtened over the years, ks
implentation and re eness to the commercial hipatives of both domestic and i
trade and investment has been lacking as has become apparent from the discssions during the course
of project preaation. The legal serices component of the project aims to dispel the country's
reputon for poor enfoceme  and severe delys in the delivery of legal srvices due to lack of
systems, information  d trning.
19.  e    S               atuy ma (M. The Banks CAS, dicsed at the Board on April 1S,
1994, emphasized supp  for the cutry's objecdves in povert reduction, capaci buildig and
private sector deveopment Policy dialogue with the Goverment on capaciq building focsed on
te need to develop a strategy and plan of action to improve public sector perforiance and fcilite
pivate sector exaion. On prvte sector development, policy dialogue cented on the need to



reduce public sector involvemen in comocl;l acivitie through rapid privatzaton and to srength
th legal and rgutq  6amwork govening private setor acivities. The CAS strategy envisages
Ba support o the Govemet in two areas: (a) to hIprove the overall poicy regim for private
activity through adjustm  opeatn; and, O to strnoen th cpacity of te Ohanan private
sector to respond to policy ithrough invesm   operatIons. l  proposed Invement opeation as an
hIn a part of the CAS - prmotng Iua teology developmen, commercializing the
opeadns of the public reach and development institutes, truning quality testg standads,
bulding capacity of small and medium private etrises, and improving delivery of legal services -
responds to tie second area of Ban's support for private sectr dvlopment.
20.           Adn  MEST ha already ebarked on the oearly stages of a com ciin
effort and in Its Letter of Sector Policy has comed it commtmet to cominuing the process
inlmuding the submsion of ne  CSIR legisaio, noporatig a sgnificant ovedhani of the enti
superising system of the CSIR, the acceptance of at least a 40 percent private sector representaton
on the Executive Counci and on each of the idvidua management bod of the beneficiary
instibutes, and e anual rationaization of Inveme  I eipme. The implementation of the
TEDF on a trasparent and equiable basis is an important factor because of the capacity building
inherent in this approac. To ensure this, a comprehensive Procedures Maual has been prepared
which wil serve as the basis for the implementton and operation of this fund.
21.   To safeuard the timely impletion of the project componen, the folowing conditions
were discussed and agreed:
(a)              for           (i) approval by tie Cabinet for tbmission to Paliant

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    Duing the ealy to  d-1980s  a      wic conditions in Ghana have had a pervasive
influence on    pivate sto" tough  e  ffects on the producio and investment clime in which
privat Poducs ope_e Not supisgly, empirical analysis I has als shown tha unceanty
ha caosed Iesm to be extremely autou in ther capacity epasn desin.   is ncudes
uregang fue  demand, eae  ates, Iest ates, inflation and price levels. in the
short-run, stabilizan and adjustment programs increased uncertainty becas of devaluation and
changes in the intive framework, and thus may have dampened investmn  In addition, high
itrest rats on Governmen paper have atracted capia, at the expease of uncetain, less profitable
investments. Ihis is thught to be one explanation for the initial drop in private investmt in the
eonomy, at least in the early yeas of the Economic Recovery Program VP).
2.    In the latter part of the period (1989-1990), the situation improved with private investm
having grown from 3.3 percent of GDP in 1988 to 8.4 percent in 1990. Its continued growth,
however, has been impeded in recent years by Maroecoomic uncertnty; in 1993 private investment
declined to 4.4 percent of GDP. While state entprises continue to dominate the economy, the
ovement has taken measures through the activities of bodies like the -Private Sector Advisory
Grup and Private Sect Roundtable to promote pdvate secor development and accelerate the
privaizaon of statowned entes  (SOEs). The Government's commmet to puden and stable
policies that bear strogy on investment decision3 such as the exchange rate, monetary policy and the
divestiture of public entprises have improved prvate sector perceptions about Ghana as a place in
Which to invest.
3.    Stnuce. Ihe strucue of the Ghanaian private sector is  aracterized by a preponderance
of small- to medimle enises. 21 Nimety-two percent of the 8,351 Ghanaian eneprises, the
total mber of enterpises enumerated during the 1987 industri census, were small scale. Medium-
and large-scale enterprises acoountd for only 8 peren of the tal number of indusi
establi_ments in the country. There were only 52 firms, or 0.6 percent of the total, employing 500
or more workers. However, the Government still holds about 25 percent of the medium and large
scale        . Such enepris  accounted for about 40 and 44 percent of employmet and value
added respetvely.
V      Technological Cpabilittes and Industrial Development in Ghana, Draft World Bank Report,
March 1993.
V1    With respect to size, nu ing etpri  in Ghana are classified on the basis of number
of people employed. In Gana's Statistical Services's Industral Statistics, medium and large
scae enterprises are defined as those employing 30 or more workers; the rest are considered
as micro and small enterprises.

6.        e         G a's            g seor has bee cwartizd by low raes of capcity
ut i  fr many years. lhe average rate of capacity utilizai  during the period 1970-1977 was
In the range of 43-S2 pct Me ulizan rt  worsened In the late 19709 and ely 1980s as the
country's abfiq to import raw matias and span par diminisd. By 1984 th aveae capacy
utiaon hbad fallen to 18 prc    It ros again In 19  to 25 percet, in 1987 to 35 percnt, and in
1988 and 1989 appears to have plateaed at abou 40 pcet as the EP got unrway.
isppoiy, however by the stat of the decade mu       rnsa of GDP had falea to 9.2
percen in 1990 from  l1.5 percent In 1985 and an al dm  high of 14 pecent In 1970.
7.    mm reversal of the downward trend In capacity utilization wa accomplished through an
Impved busin      vonm    and greater avaabt of esourc  especially foreign exchange.
Signifint and c nuous Ireases in utilization have been realized  cially in agro-based
dustries, wood-oesing, tobacom, beverages, chnicals and non-motallic minra products. While
in 1984 all 16 sub-actors, except one, operad at average rates below 30 pecent, in 1989 only three
opeated at less than 30 percent, and fiou were ovet 50 prent After yeas whoe the lack of
foreig exchange was the major ctor lim iting  y ulato, the main limiting factrs now are
shortages of creit peally longm, competition from imports that are now readily available, and
the gneraly soft mare demand and the continued presence of a large group of stic, distressed
enterpries. Private sector developmet in  hna remins constrained by the predomina  role of
public eM ,pCOnetiumed finani sectw weabkess, limited technlogical capability of pivate
enteries, and infrastrucue bottenecks. IDA is addressing these constraints thrugh a mult-
ficeted appoah and wil focus its private sector ledtg on reforms in the regulatowry environme,
public enteprise divestu, and building tnological irucure.
8.    Much of the liberalization and progress achieved in the business environment can be atrbuted
to the strong presenc of IDA and the World Bank group over t yea as summaized in Table 2.2
below. The World Bank Group has been assoced with the industria sector in Ghana sin  1975,
when it aved its first credit to the National  vestmet Bank, then Ghanaes main developmen
finace institution, to enurage the development of mauily domestic resource-bas  small and
medium etrprss that were capable of coibutng to foreign exchaoge earsni   ad savilgs.

9.    'Me credit of dte late 1970s and early 1980s focussed mainy on providing foreign exchnge
ad stmulatg exorts to cope with the main ihpent th   lack of foreig exchumge. While the
lines of credit were somehat slow in diuing due to the severely depressed ste of the economy
at that time, the adjustme  credit have beea notably successful in laying the groundwork of such key
reforms as echage rate and price liberaization, import liberalization, export promotion measr
and regaory refbrm, aUl of which meaues have been sustained by the Govenmen. All this
resultod in greater availability of foreign exchange for domestic mafacturers; export earnings,
especially from non-itional exports, improved; production of locally maufaced gpods
increased; and project analysis, evaluation and supvision capabilities of paticpating financial
insttto  and agencies improved. Implementation eperience under these various projects has been
genealy good.
10.   At the end of the 1980s, despite much of the progress throughout the decade, the main issues
were still an unsatfactory supply response and an increasingly distressed financia sector. IDA
strategy focussed on conting to support reforms and on addressing these issues. The Private Small
and Medium Enteprise Development Credit of 1989 was to provide credit to finance the short and
long term credit needs of Small and Medium Enteaprises (SMEs), provide equipment lease financin,
strengthen technical and insutional capabilities of the central bank, the Bank of Ghana (BOG), and
train partiipating financi instituions (PFIs) in project analysis and term fncg. Imple on
of the project is satisfactory and the objectives of the project are being met. However, sustained

recovery rates by focsig on implemion problems bere they becom  repaymien probles.
11.   Two financial sector adjustm  projects, the Frst Financial Sect Adjustment Credt
(FINSAC 1) in 1988 and the Second FinanciaW A jstment Credit (INSAC 11) in 1991, were
designed to address the fanci sector dess  I fist addrs  reource mobilizat  and redit
allo        in the financial system as well as improvemens In the regulatory amework of the baking
system and restructuring of disessed banks. The project was also ommitted to the broadeni  and
deeeng of the capital mart   Me second credit was intended to continue the progrm to,
restucu  the fomely distressed banks and improve their financia and opeational performnce,
pursue the recovery of non-performing assets en over by the Non-Prformng Aet Recovery
Trst (NPART), created under the project, streogthen competi  and efficieny wihin the baning
sector through divestre of public ownertip in all banks and through rato on of taxation on
bank profits, improve the capacity and efficiency of the BOG, prepae for the future developmet of
the finacial sector by seting up an appropriat instuional framwork for non-bank financial
instions by studyig the informal markets and upgrading the ban, accuntg, and inace
professions.
12.   In 1991, a third sector adjustmen credit was approved to promote private investnt. T1his
credit was aimed at creaing an enabling environmen for private iwestme; maianing
macroeconomic stability; un  g tax reform to improve incentves for pdvate invesm  and
savings; tkig steps to make the reguatory environment i Ghana more consistent with the
liberalized economy; making further progress on state enterprise reform; and mndtaing the
momentum of reforms designed to increase the efficiency widt which public resources are used and
thereby enhancing their support of private sector development. Following the intiatin of a
structured and rest-oiened process of consultaion and active problem solvig between the
Goverment and the pdvate sector (through the creation of the Private Sectr Advisory Group
(PSAG)), the environment for meedng the objectives of the project has been enaced as policy,
institutional, and regulatory reforms govening the prvate sector were made in compliance with
conditions set for the release of the third tranche.
13.   In 1993, in parallel with the USAUD Trade and Investment Project, IDA apprved the Private
Enteprise and Export Developnmet Project as a contining series of Investment credits. As its nme
implies, the primary thust of this credit (which became effcive in December 1993) is to provide
support to the prvate sector in its efforts to develop non-traditional exports (NTEs). Through a
combination of a pre- and post-shipment short term line of credit and export guarantee componet as
well as a small technical assistance component, the credit has as its objective iaing not only the
absolute volume of NTEs but perhaps even more importantly increasing the export consc s of
the private sector through taing and capacity buidig.
14.   IFC has also played an important role, especially in mobilizing direct foreign invmestnt, In
the development of the private sector since the initiation of the reorms. It has been particaly
actve in the private fiancial sector, supporting the development of a private investment bank,
Condnental Acceptance, Ltd., the second discount house, Securities Discount House, and a new
leasing company. IFC will contnue to support the rehabilitation and expansion of gold mining, and
locally-ba   firms in the m ri  and agro-processing sectots. Support for medium scale
enterprises will be provided through the Africa Enteprise Fund (AEF) and the Africa Project

capcity will be costdy, difficut, and protractd calling for conideable patneshp effort on the part
of ntrpr as weil as the suportig research and development (R&D) institions.
16.   It is a sting  c that in Ghana practically all industri R&D is conducted by public
institutions rather a  by priva  entise. Itb largest of these is the Council for Scientific and In-
dustrial Rearch (CSIR). The four insu   in its network involved in R&D relevant wn
, I , " g industry and whih are the special fo   of this project are: the Building and Roads
Rearch Instit (BRRI), the Food Rearch Institutate ( , the Idustria Research Isle (IRI),
and the Scientific     on Center (SIC). While the BRRrs main focus is buldig and road
constrion, i aso wors on probles releva  to the building mateials industry. he fncions of
the FRI and the IMI are to develop and d i_  technologies for use in ma ing industry and
to conduct thnological work on behf of indutri enterprises. The SIC's role is to prvide
tchnic support services such as equipmen calibratdon and specialized spare partu manuacue  to
both the CSIR and outside clients.
17.   Two institons are responsible for the Ienification, development and diffusion of
intemeda  technologies for small and mico-enteprises: Developmen and Application of
Inermedia  Technologies (DAP1T) and Ghana Regional Approprate Technology Industial Service
(GRATIS). Ihe main function of these groups is to encourage the commercial application of known
techlogies by small- and menium-zed nteises.
18.   Two other insttutions support Ghana's indusi technology. One is the Ghana Atomic
nergy Commission (GAEC). Is mandate is to pursue the peaceul use of atomic energy, but it has
also recently started a dWital dectronics laboratory to provide local repair service for persona
computeas (PCs) and other electronic equipent, icing of PC to machinery for industry, and
some custom digital design The other is the University of Science and Technology (UST), Ghana's
only engiering shool and a major source of its trined, technical manpower. It also rn  the Tech-
nology Consultancy Cet (TCC) which provides  n         extension services to industy and
which was the model for GRATIS' itemediate technology transfer units (Us).

insufficin to mak a significant crbuton to te absorption, ada   o  ration of technology.
Apart even from the quai of t ological work, the are serious problems concning its quality
and reevance. Many repr, officil and otherwis, give the imsion that the work caied out by
the CSIR instautes is largely ulatd to the problems facig Ghaian    ring enteris,
and very ltte of the R&D resuts in commercil application. Mme quality of the work is variable, and
the laboratories are genraly poorly equippe. While the CSIR provides some useBil services to
Industry, these appear to be only a tiny fracion of its activities.

commercializing te R&D establishment_ i a priority, and It has lready begun doing 8o. For
example, it has drated a new CSIR law and launched the National Scieance and Techology
Fou1dato (NASTF with significant private sector support. In addition, it has changed the
compe_ugon sysotm of it sIenc and techology institutions w th  staff can  are in the profit
of work they cay out for indstry. However, a stromger link is still quired as the private
sector bas Indicated that its most critical, unmet needs are fbr services which a commercialized
R&D establihmn  could and should prvide suh as a local source of specialized or a
techlogies and parepts, assistance wih quaity control, ad infion systems.
22.   Many odtr counties, such as Auslia, India, Mexico, the Nethelands, and South
Africa, have c    ilie their R&D esablishmn, and  eir experiences can be a usefil
guide fr Ghana for seveal reaso. First t teir iatitton sve the same function - to provide
indusry with technology. For countries lik Autralia and the Netherlands, it I high tenology.
For Ghana, it is apoprie or      diat technology. Second, the CSIR insdtiutons in the
Brish Commonweath, such as those in Austraia, India, and South Aftica, were all set up
aound the sam time and with the same structure and function. More importnly, all of these
counties chose commercialization as the way to make their R&D esablishment responsie to
inXdustry' needs. Therefore, their experiences can prwide valuable insis for Ghama which it-
self is a Commonwealth country. Finally, management at Ghanaian R&D instiuto  regulaly
refered to the experience of ths other counties and saw it as relevant.
23.   Projec Objecive. While the demand side for tecology is beig steady advanced
rough varios progams and improved incentives such as a USAID Tate nd Investmen
Project, other bilaterl donor programs aimd at upgrading mg  Industies, Govenment
lirlizattin of the Investment Code, and the enacten of sound intelleca prope  legislaton,
it is clear in Ghana that he instutional supply side is still in need of improvemenLt. he tee
tadonal institutional supply building blocks for industril technology development are sils,
cpial, and infmation on teology ad standads. it is wi these categories dtat this project
is primaiy concerned. I will be te cent  objective of this componeat to finance the
reorganizi  and focusing of the four iuriy-oented CSIR institutes, the FR  the R, the
SIC and the BRRI and the GSB along commerciallybaed lin   as to provide more effectively
the linkages with regard to the delivery of skill ad the development of information and
stand8a tD industry. The project wfll not include: DAPIT since its focus fs agricltural, its
functions coud be perbrmred by the CSIR, and it is very small; the GAEC since its needs are
few; GRATIS since it is aldy receiving significant finacing from other donr agencies; ad
the US snce it is an educational insttutather than a provider of techa  svices to
iuy.

evens, raer tha te calendar; it w  take dloser to fve yeas than thIme to complete; and, for
dhe Goverment to achieve its goals for the commercialization of the CSIR, it was agreed tht the
plan would be modified to overcome the following constants and infficiences idented duig
appraisa
0)  Oak  uiE d                   Armanaaemikills
26.    o       a n  win require the CSIRWs institutes to ientify madret neds and to sll
work and tchnology to potet  cli  profitably. Curmly, they lack dtese val business skills
nd, in partu, do not kow thei costs whie conistendy ptidng their services below maket
leves. In additon, many have set up pflot plants for processe they have developed and are
waiting hopely for an ea_to make a business out of them Yet, they appear not to
have analyzed the mat  before putting resources into  is work, and they cetainly lack the sks
to seU- a bus_mman on using a pilot process and then to dose a deal. Commerciaization will
also require the insfitutes to eecute wok quickly and efficiely. Yet, the CSIR does not appear
to have any oranized system of project review. Instad, researc can coniue as long as the
staff member who initied th work isinested in it, n approach which is too unstuctr  for
a comuertialiedI hsttution.
27.   Therfo, a part of its reorganibaton of the CSIR, the Govemeat, in the body of
MEST, will have to estih a marketig functo in each commeriized instilute whose role
wM be to idenfy maret neds  d, workig wih the resech staff and f ce/, to
stucture, price, ad sell sevices profitably. One peson, possibly with some secretadacerical
support, should be able to car this out at the hnstite level. In addion, the CSIR Secret
wM need a maketg person to coordine the actvies at the  ites ant to het p sell work
which involves more  one of them. The maketing person'smpwtbonshoud be a
combinton of a modest base Sa    plus a sgnfcat commbsion which could be basd on sales
or pwfts and, pedura, customw sasbctio Once the institute has an operatig histoy and cn
forecast Its revenes to some degre, the marter should h    a sales quo to motivate him

ffrthe and mak eplict how he will be expected to pefom. In adon, die Govemen, wih
epert s ,  W  have to  tblih a structred p$ect    _       methodology is each
intit  to  su  proper tracwang and timely completon of worL
28.   CSIR staff memb   aert ththeir sales do nt pride a lving wage ad so, to ait-
vime  ty must take on outside du    whih dthy ppfom durng the workday, oftoe at thi
instuto au Usng its resource. As a result, researchers bave a strong hcenve to sell work
dicdy and keep al the rvees rae tn share profts with thei hitiut accordn to the
formula which MM  hs recently estlished which assigns 70 percet of the prft to
whichOver party - the institute or the resecher - brought in the wotk - and 30 perce to  e
other. his saps the streg of the insttuion since it deprives it of both funds and the com-
mitment of Its people.
29.    herefore, as part of its reor   of the CSIR, MEST will have to ensure ta the
akein funct  is a strong one so that k can reguary brig work In  the nsti_t au   a whole,
which wil offer a researcher some ongoig  cremental income nd an inctve to cary the
out even though it wil not get 100 percet of the fee. Ste   the markting
unction will also build In ches and balamces by sepaating project saes from perfDrmane.
(dii)  Mi_rete incetiveg
30.   Althou  research staff at the CSIR can share in coslting fees their work geneas,
t   crrny ged promoted for publishing papes in refereed journals, not for helping industry,
which diminishes ther incentive to serve the private sector.
31.   To motvae staff to work on problems of importnce to the privae sector, the CSIR wil
have to revise its promoin criteria to include servie to industry. One approach is to give
people credk for the hours they spnd on projects for the private sector. To do this, the CSIR
will have to establish a dme sheet system - i.e. require that employees acouwt for thi time by
indicatig how many hours they speot each week on eah particula project This will also im-
prove the managemet of the CSIR since it will give the Sectariat infomation on how staff time
- its most impot resource - is being used.
(hv) Inefficient use of ea ui a  limied AbsoSiv
32.   Eah of the CSSIRnstitut caims at it needs new equipme  and facilities. While this
is tue to some extent, picularly for faflites, a significant portion of these needs can be met at
other institutes or rlated institutions such as the GSB which often have equipment another
institute wants and do not use it 100 percent of the dme. In addtion, in those cases where an
isiut does need a major infusion of funds for new equipment, it could not make effectve use
of tem  if they were all disbursed at one time. One reason is that the commercial actvities for
which this equipment is inended are not yet in full opeato   Another is that the staff wil
reqire extensve trainin in using the equipmen and in research methods before it can fully
benefit fiom it. Finally, Intllons of equipmt have to be phased and planned, partilrly
given the problems Ghana iantiustons have had in the past getting equipme to wor, thus
limiig the rate at which the CSIR can take in new gear.

33.   lhero, as part Of I  egnizatio of the CSIR and bre it receivs any 1uil from
IDA for equiet, MBST wil havo to deveop a phln to taaize equpment allocato  and use
in the CSIR and the GSI. To encourage       and the efficient aUocatn of resourc,
each        don  cete should be made a profit coantr. For example, the FRI could
make Use of the 08. anaytica services on a contract basi until demad for thee servic
outspped the fclties. SmiLarly the FRI and ote httes could contrac out work to the
SIC's                hdop. While tho CSIR may need some      equipmw to begin the
ihmmeld        pmeess, kmmo_td did*t_mm of fuds. for equip_m    must be tid t the
achievem   of miletone sucl as     o of satactory commely-boWd busin plans
or the acbievemt of agreed upon revenue tgets.

tions which divet resourc  frm its primay mission and makes the insion hade to
manage. For example, at the FRI, which bad e best ratio, research grad staff stil made up
only 24 percent of its total staff in 1993. At the CSIR as a whole, research grad staff made up
only 9pere  of tot staff in 1993.
35.   Therefore, the Govemment will have to cary out targeted reductions of  e,
accontg, and support manpower. Selectively cutting, redeploying, or reaining staff wi free
up rsources for use in research and encourage their efficient use. The targeed reducos
envisaged for the four _ntitute are to achieve ratios of 1:4 reseach to  mintn staff by end
1995 and to achieve a farter reducton to 1:3 by Janury 1, 1998.

prvate sector inasumch as it is siffll largdy a Government run and directed organzatio widh only
token private sector          MEST has draed a new bill which restuctures the CSIR -
the Council for Scientfic and Industrial Reseach (Amendment) bill. nho bill has many good
feaues and is a major improvemet over the auret owe. Nevertheless, it does not go fir
enough to make the CSIR a market-driven instion sporting indury.
37.   During negtatons ESr agreed ihat the following recmmend chges to the draft bill
which are inluded in the LeTer of Sector Policy will be included in the bill and the
accompanying memorandum  to be submitted to Parliament:
(a) tdat by December 31, 1995, 40 prcn of CSIR's governing council and 40 percent
of the managemet bords of the FRI, IRM, SIC and BRRI would come from the
prvae sector;
-b) that the Diecor-eneral of the CSIR be appointd in consultaion with te

(c) tat contract resea  be carried out to meet the needs of industry;

39.   The GSB has a dua nls - to set and enforc standards and to assist indusxry in
improving quality. On the whole, however, the privaector ses the GSB only an a tough
regulatr and is rlua to approah it for help. Ibis hurts idustry, since he GSB is the
prmary repositoy of knowledge about quity control m Ghana, and prevents the country from
derving fill benef from its Invesent in the GSB.
40.   lherore, an part of Its strengthening of the GSB, the Govemet, trough MMI, will
have to create a strong public           fidm on there. ts purpos wil be to generate
awarene  among induy of te  of quality and of e wilingness and abUity of the
0SB to provide assistance in     area. Mhe MTI should also be prepard to make any other
changes in the GSB's structr and culture which are necessary to make the organizaon more
"user fieadly."
41.   "User friendliness should ao be limited to industy. he MTI mus ensure that the GSB
shar  its eqpmet with oher re ch institutions to maximize use of the country's limted
reuces. For example, the GS0  huthree ultraviolet sp hotomete  which, like much of its
equpment, are not used full-time. If the FI could have acce  to one of them, it would net need
one of its own. Making m  equipment centers into profit centers, as in the CSIR, will
encourge shaing.
42.   Ihe      create its stadards t prote domestc consumers. As a resul, its cetfication
has little value in counties tgat adhere to  t na, rtionalg           .
43.   Therefore, the pdncip  dallenge to the GSB is to begn the process of gettiag Ghana
onto the ladder of accreditation towards the ultiumate achievemeat of ISO 9000, which is ciical to
hiduty as it enters the global marketplace. One imtat inita step the GSB can take towards
this goal will be to conene is stdards commie  to examine is estg standards and
deemne how to upgrade dtem to oitional levels. Twining and constancy arangements
with oter international CSIR and s esablishment should help in this endtre procs.

52.                  . The TEDF woud be implemented unde a TEDF Framework
Agr between MTI and Empretec Ghana Foundation (EMPRETEC), a privat, registered,
non-p       compay. EMPRETEC was set up in 1990 and funded by the United Nations
Dveopment Program, the UK Overseas Deveopment Administr    (ODA), Baclays Bank of
Ghana Ltd. and the National Board for Small Scale Iies to support thoe developam  of
Prt  mall and medium enterprises. For the pasthr  years EMPETEC has been

a ditinct reducti  in Us rol in the cril tak of promotig Ghanes image as an itnion  tadig
paer. Th host  of the Indutech Fair in 1993 was the first intenaional fair in sevent   years.
66.   In 1991, the GTFA had publHied a ree year plan which incuded the ereco of permer
wais, th redabilitation of th ectdcal system, the construction of a Fiaci  nstiui   Paviion,
mpemenot of the hin   l roads and a genera beatfication progam. However, while a Govenmet
tak force            a capital buget of Cedis 920 milion to fulfill this program, only a third was
allocated. Me net eff  was that, due to these constrains, much of the 1991-93 plan could nt be
comletd. It is   s   is thbakrund that a new 1994-96 plan has been prepared to overcome
tie aita constraints and provid for a saegy of sustnable growth for the foreseeable future.
67.   That plan ha dveloped a mison o 8_ that provides that the GTFA, in puru of the
national polcy of bootg  Ghana' in     and extmal trade, will marshall its resourc   to

GTFA wi  compIde the de elopmet of th Centw to an iionlly competive stadd and
effectvely utilize al its fiities for viable economic vetures. To implemet ti mission th following
cooate objecdves were established:
(a) support the natonal policy of priva  and export-led deveopmen;
(b) mobiize te resuc  neeswy to meet the mission objectives;
(c) rhbita  the Center to enable the GTFA to host local, sub-regionl, regional and
intnona exhibitions;
(d) mrea the volume of trade exhibitions;
(e) lease Center space for commerci activiies; and
(f) initiate new dovelopment projects.

woud be conducted to dam inethe viabiity of such a facility so as to easure t cost towards the
rehabittion of GTFA are assocated with expected revenues fom its activities.
69.   Objecs and Descript. Under the project, fnding aunting to approximatly $950,000
would finance consultancy services for two studies and implean of the re       under the
udies, sa ory to IMA and the Government, including rehabilitation and construction work lhe
first study should determie, among others: the market demand, domesticaly and inally, for
such a  fcility; formulao of a pomtional plan t  will support both the national objecive of a
private-led export development cenr as well as a sustainable commercialy-based operations; propose a
precise action plan of reor on leadig to a privately managed commercially-based strategy for the
center; the level of support ad the type of revenue g racivg ctiev (e.g., organizing pop concrs,
accomnmodatig cofrences, tade union meetings, sport events, etc.) to run the facility on a
erci  basis; the chages required in the opeatonal, financial and marketing management sategy
and strucure to agessively run a marketoriented, iteaional exhibition and busin  center; he
recedvity of key agencies and business support facilities such as the Ghana Export Promotion Center,
Assoiation of Ghanaian ndustries, Federated Association of Ghana!an Exporters, trade associations,
bank, communictons centers t set  up their offices on the premises on a rental basis to provide
GTFA's patrons with a responsive busiess center; the possibility of moving the Arts Center to the
OTFA site; nd options available to GOA, including donatons from developed outies, to acqWire
exhibition funiture such as aluminum, knck down, shell scheme systems.
70.   The second study, an egnring and arctecr survey, wil assess the rehabilitaton and
redesign needs of the pavilions on the GFA site to establish the investment parameters for this cental
trade promotion and exhibiton center. The Implemenaton Manual, Secdon 3, provides the terms of
reference for the two studies under this project component.
71.   The support for rehabilitation and construction work under the project is condngent upon (i) the
completion of the two studies descrbed above establishing the commercial feasibility of the OTFA; and
(i) the adoption of a restrucuring plan for the OTFA sadsfactory to the Governnmnt and IDA.
72.   Poject mplnt . The Miistry of Trade and ndustry (M    in conjunction with the
GIPA will be responsble for this project component. A cond4iio hir disbursement for civil works
would be the prewation of financing and action plans for GTFA's privately-managed commercial

74.   Ghana today appears to be in his posion. Its re of domestcally produced produc are In
serious need of upgrading. While there is a clear creative potential within the market, the products are
dc rcterzed by a nmibe of fundamental flaws. Ihese include such problems as non-olorfast fabdcs,
non-kiln-dryed wood products, repetitive traditionl design  poor adaptation of traditional products to
bIntenonal tstes, artisanal finses to fabrics and wood products, icluding funiture, dated designs,
limited lines and poor, uima ve packaging. In al cases, there is a strong case tO be made for the
intoduction to the market of improved and sophisicated industrial design ivation.
75.     han's Intenatioly trde goods are basicaly divided betwee its taditoa products which
are ocoa, gold, electricity, diamonds and raw dmber. lhere is also a significant: export of non-precious
hard mineas. As basically industri products, marketabiity is not a priority for these products. On
the non-raditional side, however, the picure is very different. The products range from African textes
and tadton  Ghanaiao weing such as the famous kete cloth, wood products and wooden fuiure
made from African hardwoods, handicrafts such as wood caving, beads, small metal works and leather
goods, small scale m        and rather large-scale production and export of premium, but highly
periable, fuitus and vegetables such as pineapples, mangoes and cassm. It is in this  t range of
poducts that the need to intrduce the concept of industral desigp concepts is overwhelmingly obvious.
76.   ObjectOves _d Decarption. The project will fund consultncy services for a sudy to more
fuly establish the need, scope and naure of a design center. The study wJI initiay investigate the
design establmen tat already exists within Ghana, document opinons from a sectora cross seton of
the private sector ompaes in the non-traditional areas detailed above and establish their noeed for such
a facility and their interest in supporting such an iniative with both direct financil investment and
commercial conacts; evaluate the present group of design graduates within the Ghanaian system and
prepare a kills assement in the light of the irmation and needs expressed by the private sector
interiews; investigate the optimm structure and organization for a privately-managed, commercidaly-un
center and idenying it8s spoorship and suestd location; develp detied budget estmates for the
center including equipment esimats, recurrent  penditures, training, consulting support, twinning
rangements with foreign design centers, information and library systems, and other suWort systems.
The Implementation Manual, Section IV, provides the tern  of reference for this study.
77.    me       n. The proposed study will be coordinated under the auspices of MEST. A

MR. LEWIS T. PRESTON,
PRESIDENT,
WORLD BANK,
1818 H. STREET, N.W.,
WASHINGTON, DC, 209433,
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Preston,
GHANA PRIATE SECTOR DEVELOPMEIVTPROJECT
LE7TER OFSECTOR DEELOPMENTPOLICY
1.    As part of its Econonic Recovery programnune, the Government of Ghana has been
implementing economic reforms geared towards increasing growth rates in the
productive sectors of the economy. The Government's growth strategy envisages
a leading role for the Private Sector.
2.    The Government recognises that one key stumbling block is that Ghana's industry
on the whole lacks technological capabilities which it needs to develop. Technical,
managerial, and -institutional information and skills would allow productive
enterprises to use equipment and technology more efficiently.
Ghana has a number of science and technology institutions which can contribute to
private sectors development of technological capabilities. The Govermnent is
therefore taking steps to make its research and development (R & D) establishment
more responsive to the needs of industry in particular.
3.    In pursuit of the above, Government has identified and developed two key
initiatives to support the private sector. These are:-
(a)   Commercialisation of Research and Development and
(b)   Establishment of a Technology and Enterprise Development Fund.

PACKGROUND
4.    Ghana's R & D establishment consists of six major institutions:
(a)   The largest of these is the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).
It consists of a Secretariat and 17 research institutes and centres, most of which
focus on the needs of agriculture. However, four of them can provide assistance
to industry viz.:- the Building and Roads Research Institute (BRRI), the Food
Research Institute (FRI), the Industrial Research Institute (    and the Scientific
Instrumentation Centre (SIC). The CSIR has a research staff of approximately
420 supported by about the same number of technicians and 3,600 administrative
and support staff.
(b)   Development and Application of Intermediate Technology (DAPIT) which seeks
to identify, develop, test, produce, demonstrate, and deliver small-scale,
appropriate technology relevant to Ghana's industry. DAPIT has a staff of twelve
consisting of four professional officers and eight support staff
(c) Ghana Regional Appropriate Technology Industrial Service (GRATIS) which runs
a network of Intermediate Technology Transfer Units (ITTUS's) throughout the
country. These provide training in machining and other industrial skills to
apprentices, produce spare parts for local industry, and offer manufacturing
extension services to it including an incubator for small enterprises. GRATIS has a
staff of approximately 150 people of whom 15 are engineers and fourteen are
socio-economists.
(d)   The Ghana Atonic Energy Commission (GAEC) whose mandate is to explore the
peaceful uses of atomic energy and in particular, to help Ghana!s agricultural,
health and industrial sectors. As part of its charter, the GAEC has developed a
digital electronics laboratory which trains Ghanaians to service computers, a
capability found nowhere else in the country, and which is developing a
commercial venture to interface PCs to machinery for industry. The GAEC
employs approximately 350 people of whom about 70 are scientists and 50 are
technicians.

The GA Standard Board (GSB) which establishes and promulgates standards,
promotes the use of standards in industiy, and provides services to industry
including assistance in quality management practices. The Board also enforces
health and safety standards. The GSB employs 338 people of whom 78 are
scientific officers and 57 are technicians.
The University of Science and Technolouy (UST) which is the country's main
source of trained scientific and technical manpower and wich also runs the
Technology Consultancy Centre and the ITTU in Kumasi where the UST is
located.
Most of the establishments listed above are subvented organizations of the
Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MEST) except for the GSB
which reports to the Mnistry of Trade and Industry (MO0TI) and the UST which is
under the Ministry of Education (MOE).
To make the R&D establishment more responsive to the needs of the private
sector the Govenmment has encouraged it to commercialise - i.e. to offer services
to industry for a fee. To encourage this, the Govenmnent has made clear the linits
of its ability to fund R&D activities.
At the same time, in order to encourage inJustrial - need oriented research,
Govenunent has developed a compensation plan to enable the institutions and
individual researchers to share in the profits of consulting projects carried out for
industry. In addition, in the case of the CSIR, consultants lhave been engaged to
assist each institute to develop a business plan. Government is also developing a
new law to govern the CSIR.
The proposed Bill will among other things (inter alia) reduce substantially the size
of the CSIRs Council, its Board of Directors, and increase private sector
representation.

6.    The Government has further strengthened  the linkages between  R&D
establishment and the private sector through the recently formed National Science
and Technology Foundation (NASTEF). NASTEFs Board of Trustees is
predominantly from industry, and, once it has raised its initial finding, it will solicit
and screen research proposals from Ghana's science and technology Institutions
and support those which offer the greatest benefit to the prnvate sector.
7.    Though some of these institutions are doing valuable work, Ghana's R&D
establishment is not contributing as much as it should to the country's economnic
development. Problems confronting the R&L* establishment include promotion
criteria, which emphasise publications in reference journals and do not give credit
to problem-solving for industry, overstaffing particularly of the supporting
functions, which takes resources away from research; lack of marketing function
which would enable the institutions to identify the needs of the private sector and
market projects; inadequate funding which leads to inadequate salaries which force
staff to focus on survival rather than on their work and, in particular, encourage
them to carry out consulting projects on their own and not share the proceeds with
their institutions; dilapidated facilities and outdated equipment: and poorly stocked
libraries.
B.    The private sector also bears some responsibility for the limited contribution of
Ghana's R&D establishment to industry. It has not developed a culture of using
R&D results and, in most cases, it is very reluctant to pay for information or
consulting services provided by the various institutions. In addition, in many
cases, industry does not even know its problems and so has not sought assistance
from  science and technology institutions.   Therefore, as part of the
commercialisation process, the Government will collaborate with the private sector
to enable it appreciate the value of the services of the R&D establishment and
areas in which the institutions can be useful.

'MAWNG GfUANA'S INDUSTRIAL R&D EFFECTIVE" prepa-ed for the
World Bank, wh-ti lays out a icep-by-step process fir achieving these gt als.
10.  In sllpport of these goals, the Gov-.rnment intencs to:

Many of the int.itutions ufer from both overstaffing of admniistrativefsupport
personnel and undwitng of resrch grade personnel. For examnple, resech
grade sta£ff  ade up orly 9.4% ofthe CSIUs total staff in 1993 and only 14.3% of
the total in the fui institutes mentioied above. The Government appreciates that
Uiwwsng this pecentage will enable it to mxiise the value of its invesent i
the CSIUL  It will thesefore increase the ratio of research and techical stff to
administrativesupport staff to 1:4 (i.e. research and technical staff will be 20%No of
the total staff) by Januaty 1, 1996 and 1:3 (i.e. research and technical staff is 25%
of total sta  by January 1, 1998 ofthie proposed project.
(c)   Ensure ta the R&D estabishment generaes incesing revenuesfrom
orc therncg thga Gjvernmet subvention. Darticulary the orivate sector
The WVorld Bank report mentioned above suggests that the CSIR Institutes, hit a
target f 10% of total fimding (i.e. total government subvention plus revenues
generated from other sources such as contract research) in the first year of this
process with a goal of 30N in the third year. The Govemnment understands that
the actual target may be different and will work with the World Bank to arrive at
final goals for each of the R&D institutions. It further agrees that, with the
assistance of the World Bank, it may establish other measurable targets for the
institutions to achieve in order to impact on the private sector. The Govermnent
wil provide the requisite subvention (Recurrent and Development) to enable the
R&D Institutions meet the targets set for them.
(d)   Establish an effective, efficient and suitable audidng and
-gccoAntln sYstem fo each Instituton
The Government understands that as a condition for the provision of equipment to
t:e R&D establishments by the World Bank under its proposed programnune of
assistance, it may evaluate the institutions finances and operations to determine,
among other things, whether they have achieved their commercial targets.

(e} Rfadonalise the alfocation of resources in the R&D establishment
-Conducting contract research will require each institution to have people with
skills in:-
(i) Marketi.ng/Sales
(ii)   Costing and Pricing
(iii Project Management
Thie Government understands that the institutions may not have people vwth these
skldls currently on staff and so may have to hire them from outside. It recognises
that reducingadministrative and accounting staff in the R&D establishment can
provide the finds for the recruitment of sklled technical resrch-oriented
personnel.
The Govermnent may undertake any other actions which it may consider necessay
or beneficial as the commercialisation process proceeds.
B/   Technologv and Enterprise Development Fund
11. The Government intends to continue to forge a new alliance with the private sector
and has accordingly endorsed the creation of a Technology and Enterprise
Development Fund to assist the sector. The fund will assist private entrepreneurs
in developing value-added products and provide reliable services, developing ther
technical and financial plans to a level of bankable quality and feasbility and
support their efforts to raise the necessary finance of investor support, such as
operational and financial management, product quality and design and technology
advisory services. The Ministry further agreed that Empretec should, under a
Management Contract, manage the fund and set policy guidelines and procedures
on projects and activities to be undertaken under the find.

12.   The Govermment recognises the potential of the country's R&D establishment to
contribute to Ghana's economic development. It believes the commercialisation
programme it has embarked on and which the proposed World Bank assistance
programme would support, will significantly enhance the growth of the private
sector. Furthermore, direct, focused and tangible assistance to Ghana's small and
medium enterprises is another manifestation of our ongoing and deepening
commitment to ensuring a robust private sector.
13.   On behalf of the Government of Ghana, I look forward to the possibility of
worldng with you.
Yours Sincerely,
