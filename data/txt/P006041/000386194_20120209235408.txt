F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project was prepared in the mid-1990s when the design of monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
in most Bank projects was still quite weak. As seen in the table below, Key Performance
Indicators (KPI) supporting the PDO lacked targets, their measurability and link to the PDO was
questionable in some cases and along with numerous intermediate outcome indicators (IOI),
represented a difficult monitoring task. Attempts by the Additional Financing to improve/retrofit
this framework added to the monitoring burden by increasing the number of KPI and IOI, and
fell far short of the standard acceptable by 2007. However, the more informative IOI did help
clarify in specific cases, the link to the PDO.

PDO 1: Increased productive and organizational capacity in participating poor, rural
communities.

PDO 2: Greater emphasis on rural poverty issues in the sector agenda and improved coordination
of rural development programs and policies.

PDO 3: Financial assistance provided to poor, rural producers in areas declared in flood
emergency or disaster.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Country background: Rural poverty was traditionally overlooked in Argentina in large part due
to the dispersion of the rural poor in the regional economies outside the Humid Pampa Region, far from
major urban centers. The rural population (defined narrowly as those living in communities of less than
2,000 inhabitants) was barely 13% of the total population but some 28% of Argentina’s total poor, and the
incidence of poverty among rural households was 2.5 times the urban poverty rate. The economically
active rural poor -about 60% of total- combined various on- and off-farm survival strategies reflecting the
country’s agro-ecological conditions and social structure. Recessionary conditions at the time of project
appraisal were reducing off-farm labor opportunities, the mechanization of large farms was eliminating
seasonal jobs, and contraction in local government employment and in privatized state-owned enterprises
had restricted the traditional rural-urban migration option, causing civil unrest and reverse migration back
to rural areas.

1.1.2 Sector background: At the time of appraisal in the mid-1990s, Argentina’s rural sector was
undergoing a restructuring process designed to exploit comparative advantage and maintain strong output
and export growth. Macro-economic stabilization in the early part of the decade -to streamline the public
sector, transform the monetary system and shrink public debt- had improved the general investment
climate. Government had significantly reduced its role in the agricultural sector, eliminating export taxes
on key commodities, dismantling marketing boards, reducing crop price supports and protective tariffs,
and decentralizing agricultural services provision to the sub-national level. The sector was forced to
diversify production and increase productivity to remain competitive. This restructuring, initiated in the
Humid Pampa Region, was extended to the regional economies, home to most of the rural poor. However,
small-scale rural producers lacked access to the resources needed to adjust their production systems to the
new incentive structure.

1.1.3 Rationale for Bank involvement: The Small Farmer Development Project (PROINDER) was
the first Bank-financed operation to support Government’s poverty reduction strategy in rural areas with
targeted assistance to increase poor farmers’ productivity.1 The Bank’s efforts to boost Government’s
burgeoning support for decentralized, demand-driven approaches, improved targeting, and better
fiduciary controls, were based on extensive experience with Social Investment Funds in Colombia, Brazil
and Mexico. Experience also showed the importance of addressing the public policy side by assisting
provincial governments to develop their own rural development analyses and strategies, and build
capacity for decentralized project implementation and administration. Bank participation was designed to
reduce funding uncertainty, promote good monitoring and evaluation (M&E), boost the administrative
capacity of the Social Program for Agriculture (PSA – implementing entity for Component 1), and further
support Government’s coordination of other Bank-supported rural development and natural resource
management operations. PROINDER was consistent with the Bank 1998-2000 Country Assistance
Strategy2 (CAS) for the Argentine Republic (Report 16505-AR), discussed by the Executive Directors on
April 26, 1997.




1
   This approach was consistent with a rural household survey conducted by SAGPyA with Bank support, at the time.
2
   The CAS pillars were enhanced social development including poverty alleviation and human resources development; and, improved
performance and institutional capacity of Government, especially sub-national, to deliver social infrastructure and environmental services.



                                                                    1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the PDOs and Key Performance Indicators
(KPI) were to:

(a) increase the productive and organizational capacity of participating poor, rural communities as
indicated by: (i) improved, productive infrastructure; (ii) increased production of food for family
consumption; (iii) diversification of productive activities; (iv) increased value-added of production;
(v) conversion or integration of beneficiary groups into organizations; (vi) increased group input
purchases and product marketing;3 and,

(b) increase the emphasis on rural poverty issues in Government’s sector agenda and to improve the
coordination of rural development policies and programs, as indicated by: (i) provincial rural
development policies focused on the beneficiary population prepared in participating provinces;
(ii) preparation of national and provincial strategies which reflect concerns of broader stakeholders and
incorporate available statistical information on rural poverty; and (iii) coordination mechanisms
incorporated into the operational procedures of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and
Food (SAGPyA) and provincial rural development programs.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1 First, the Bank’s decision to support Government’s Flood Emergency Program (PROEMER) in
1999 resulted in an amendment to the Loan Agreement to include an additional PDO: “Financial
assistance provided to poor, rural producers in areas declared in flood emergency or disaster?. No related
KPI were added. Second, an Additional Financing loan of US$45.0 million, while not changing the PDO,
added seven new KPI: (i) increased income from productive infrastructure; (ii) improvement of rural
habitat; (iii) increased participation of rural families in communities’ activities; (iv) information created
for the project is required for other institutions; (v) new legislation in support of rural development
policies is presented to legislative powers; (vi) rural development agencies in the provinces identified and
initiated actions on a local and regional level from the start of the Project; and (vii) demands and
proposals from small farmer organizations presented and addressed at the local and national levels. These
additions were justified on the basis of “experience on the ground? under the original project, and the
expectation that they would further improve the overall policy dialogue.4

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The project’s primary target population/universe was 130,000 economically-active poor rural
households, a cohort consisting primarily of small-holder farmers and rural laborers. Project coverage
was nation-wide but funds would be allocated among provinces based on the proportion of the target
population in each province. The original loan (OL) was expected to directly assist a minimum of 30,000
households comprising 150,000 direct beneficiaries who would increase their household incomes, thereby
satisfying unmet basic needs. The Additional Financing (AF) targeted an additional 22,000 households
with the tacit assumption that some households already benefited under the OL were likely to receive
complementary subprojects under the AF.



3
  This KPI is shown in the Project Design Summary but not the main text of the PAD.
4
  The Additional Financing also added new “incremental? intermediate outcome indicators – see Data Sheet for the full presentation, both
operations.



                                                                      2
1.5 Original Components

1.5.1      The project comprised the following components:

(a)     Rural Investments (about 88.8% of total project cost) through three sub-components: (i) Rural
Investment Fund (FAIR) financing small grants for demand-based subprojects; 5 (ii) Support Services
including training, a market information system and a Participation Action Plan and Indigenous Peoples
(IP)Strategy (training and studies); and (iii) Management of Rural Investment Activities at the national,
provincial and locals levels (technical assistance (TA) and equipment). SAGPyA’s subsidiary, the Social
Program for Agriculture (PSA), would implement this component and already had extensive capillarity
and some years of experience with small farmers.

(b)     Strengthening Rural Development Policy (Institutional Development, about 8.1% of total cost)
financed through five sub-components: (i) National Strategy Development including studies, the Rural
Development Committee and a rural development database in SAGPyA; (ii) Provincial Strategy
Development (demand-driven studies and TA); (iii) Training (sub-national and national agencies);
(iv) Appropriate Technology Development (studies and competitive research grants); and (v) Institutional
Strengthening for the Directorate of Planning and Agricultural Development (DDA) to manage
component activities (equipment and TA). This component was to be implemented by DDA.

(c)    Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation (3.1% of total cost) financing TA, studies
and equipment to establish project coordination and conduct M&E at the national and provincial levels.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 Soon after Effectiveness in 1998, a Component 4 “Flood Emergency “ was added via the
reallocation of US$40.0 million mostly from Category 1 to finance Grants and Consultant services in
selected provinces for eligible poor rural families affected by massive flooding in the provinces of
Misiones, Santiago del Estero, Corrientes and Santa Fe. These activities formed part of the Government
of Argentina (GOA)’s US$100.0 million PROEMER, also partially financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) using a reallocation from the joint Bank/IADB-financed Provincial
Agricultural Development Project (PROSAP, P006010).6 The new component established a grant fund to
finance demand-based, small scale subprojects - similar to those contemplated under Component 1 - for
the recovery of productive capacity within eligible provinces and strengthened SAGPyA’s institutional
capacity to implement and monitor the program.7

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Restructuring: Cumulative extensions of the closing date (Level 2 Restructurings) totaled 54
months. The original and final closing dates were December 31, 2003 and June 30, 2011 respectively,
taking into account the Additional Financing (see 1.7.3). The reasons for these extensions can be
summarized as giving the project the space and time to disburse fully following prolonged paralysis from



5
  The PAD for the OL does not mention a target number of subprojects but studies indicate it was 9,000. For subproject types, see Box (para
2.1.4).
6
   The reallocation from PROINDER financed flood-related activities in Corrientes, Misiones, Santa Fe and Santiago del Estero, while the
reallocation from PROSAP (P006010, a joint Bank-IDB-financed project) used IDB funds to finance similar activities in Chaco, Entre Rios and
Formosa.
7
  Activities contemplated included: rehabilitation and repair of storage facilities and infrastructure; and provision of seeds, fertilizer, animal feed,
breeding livestock, inputs, tools and machinery.



                                                                           3
2000-2004 and subsequent national economic recovery, as well as tiding the project through the
Additional Financing preparation, Board approval and Effectiveness cycle.

1.7.2 Reallocation of funds: Loan funds were repeatedly reallocated, initially to cover Government’s
request in 1998 for Bank assistance to implement PROEMER, followed by accelerating demand for
subproject Grants once the economy recovered, and finally to support GOA’s Drought Emergency
Program for small farmers (see Data Sheet, Section H).

1.7.3 Additional Financing: An Additional Financing (AF) Loan of US$45.0 million was approved in
July 2007, became effective in January 2009, and closed in June 2011. It was designed to scale up the
original project (OP) activities without significant change in the PDO, design, methodology or
implementation arrangements, although considerable change was made to the indicator framework. While
there were some adjustments to categories of subprojects and allowable limits per family, geographical
coverage and the profile of targeted beneficiaries remained the same. The AF targeted 3,000 subprojects
and 22,000 families (compared to 9,000 subprojects and 30,000 families under the OP). It was justified in
order to: (i) deepen the development impact of the OL and its probability of success; (ii) avoid a financing
gap, maintain momentum and preserve the project’s credibility with stakeholders; and (iii) provide a
bridge while the rural poverty programmatic lending was completed and a new Rural Poverty and Growth
project was prepared (Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2010-2012).8 The AF also supported the
CPS pillars of sustained growth with equity, social inclusion and improved governance.9

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Background analysis: PROINDER was the first community-driven development (CDD) project
in Argentina. The background analysis for the OP was thorough, sourcing from Bank, international and
Argentine research as well as strategy documents and supporting core CAS goals. The PAD provided a
succinct overview of the project context, the historical evolution of government policy and the existing
framework of poverty programs. The analysis of potential alternative design approaches was especially
well-informed, as was the poverty and social assessment upon which targeting and eligibility criteria were
developed. The project’s production-oriented activities/strategy was developed on the basis of a
household survey jointly prepared by the Bank team with SAGPyA during preparation. The analytical
foundation for the Additional Financing was primarily taken from experience under and lessons from the
OP, resulting in some updating of the environmental management framework (EMF), indigenous peoples’
strategy and the participation action plan.

Assessment of project design:

2.1.2 Project objectives and indicators: The Results Framework was generally straightforward but
the causal linkage between the PDO and KPI was uneven. In the opinion of the ICR -and contrary to the
2008 Quality Assessment of the Loan Portfolio (QALP-1)- the PDO seems clear but the KPI and
supporting hierarchy of indicators were flawed.10 The KPI were too numerous, not easily measured and
not quantified.11 No poverty reduction or vulnerable group indicators were included despite the OL’s


8
   CPS for the Argentine Republic (Report N. 48476-AR), discussed by the Executive Directors on June 9, 2009
9
   Despite the substantial improvement in the Argentine economy by 2007, the percentage of expenditures to be financed by the Additional
Financing loan was 100% for all categories. The rationale was not explained.
10
   The QALP-1 asserts that lack of clarity in the indicators stems from lack of precision in the PDO; the ICR disagrees with this.
11
   Baseline and targeted values were determined through a Baseline Study completed in 2002.



                                                                   4
strong social analysis at preparation. The Additional Financing, seeking to reflect experience under the
OL, added seven new KPIs including on rural habitat (not defined) and rural development legislation,
revised/clarified some existing KPIs, and included new incremental output indicators. The OL’s omission
of an income-related KPI was corrected. The revised indicators however, were also unclear, redundant in
some cases and/or weakly-linked to the PDO, and increased the burden of measuring results under a
planned 3-year implementation, subsequently shortened by late effectiveness.

2.1.3 Poverty targeting: While social analysis underpinning the project was thorough, there was no
defined operational strategy/plan for bringing vulnerable populations (women, youth and indigenous
peoples) into the project. The OL Operational Manual refers briefly to a points system for favoring their
subproject proposals. The plan was to design – after effectiveness – a strategy for indigenous peoples in
the provinces of Salta and Formosa due to their greater concentration there; this was done. The
participation of women and youth was measured by head-count (and under the AF, a set percentage of
head-count), not as an earmarked percentage of subproject financing or for specific investments
proposed/operated by such cohorts. Their participation was largely dependent on the proactivity of
provincial/local governments, most of which had little experience in rural poverty reduction. The
participation of itinerant rural laborers, a very poor cohort difficult to capture in CDD programs,
especially those with productive goals, was largely assumed and there was no provision for measurement.
The AF acknowledged weaknesses under the OL and intensified efforts on behalf of the most vulnerable.
The proposed follow-on Socio-economic Inclusion in Rural Areas Project (P106685) is expected to
strengthen the focus on such populations.

2.1.4 Project access: Eligibility criteria for accessing the FAIR, and its financing parameters, were as
follows:

     Box 1: CDD in Argentina

     Access to the FAIR was governed by certain principles and mechanisms: a series of financing “windows? was
     available as entry points depending on defined eligibility criteria. The general idea was that a logical
     progression from one window to the next would deepen the developmental impact over time and build social
     capital. Beneficiary repetition was assumed and accepted. The project’s focus was less on establishing the
     formal, participatory governance framework/institutions common to CDD projects in other countries, but
     rather practical mechanisms and guidelines for effective targeting, preparation and implementation of
     subprojects.

     Subprojects: Type A: Subsistence Agriculture for communities with limited formal organizational
     experience, to increase own-produced food supply and develop group management skills; Type B: Productive
     Subprojects for farmers with demonstrated organizational capacity to intensify production through improved
     crop varieties and animals, production diversification, value-added activities and off-farm production
     (processed products); Type C: Community Infrastructure for small-scale irrigation works, wells, agro-
     forestry, small bridges, land rehabilitation, fencing; Type D: Marketing Assistance TA to help farmers link
     to/develop buyers, quality control and packaging, as a complement to a subproject A, B or C; Type F:
     Housing Improvement to upgrade basic living conditions by financing latrines, sanitary kitchens, electrical
     and water connections/supply.

     Eligible cohorts: The two primary eligible groups were: small scale farmers meeting a set of criteria
     including poverty level, income, education, location (including living off-farm in settlements not exceeding
     2000 inhabitants) and assets; and, temporary rural laborers, with some land capable of development or without
     land, and deriving main income off-farm and through temporary work. Potential beneficiaries were required to
     form groups (“simple associations?) of a minimum of six families (four in Patagonia Region). The maximum
     number of families permitted in a group was: Type A (20), Type B (15), Type C (50) and Type D (30-300).
     Groups might already exist or be formed specifically to participate in the project.

                                                                                     [Box continues on next page]




                                                          5
      [Box 1, continuation]

      Process: Identified, interested groups were visited by project technicians to verify eligibility, discuss
      subproject options and prepare preliminary subproject proposals. The project did not establish “councils?
      (Latin America) or “committees? (Asia), i.e., the representative, participatory decision-making and priority-
      setting forums typical of many CDD programs. Subproject proposals were analyzed by a hierarchy of
      entities/authorities starting at the field level, were allocated points based on technical and financial
      soundness/feasibility, could be sent back for further analysis/resubmission, and had to conform to positive and
      negative lists, and to environmental parameters. Efforts were made to ensure participation of vulnerable
      groups but there was no strategy for women/youth; a strategy was prepared for IP during the OL. Earmarking
      of funds was not used under either phase.

      Allocation of FAIR financing: Subproject financing was allocated by family (not group). Financing ceilings
      for investments were as follows: Type A (US$200 per family); Type B (US$1500 per family and maximum
      US$22,500 per subproject); Type C (US$1500 per family and max. US$50,000 per subproject). Beneficiaries
      were expected to contribute 10% of subproject cost, generally in family labor.

      Changes under the AF: Adjustments were made to subproject types and ceilings by the AF: (i) On-farm
      Productive Development (divided into two streams - household production/consumption and production of
      goods and services); (ii) Rural Habitat (household improvements considered “women’s subprojects? which
      came to be Type F in the late stages of the OL); and (iii) Community subprojects. The AF raised the limit per
      family to US$2,000 for types (i) and (ii) and to US$1,000 for type (iii) based on a consensus that limits per
      family had been too low under the OL. A community could combine a type (i) and (iii) with an aggregate
      ceiling of US$3,000. Families affected by climatic emergencies could receive a one-time complementary
      amount of US$2,000 added to types (i) and (iii). Supplementary amounts of US$1,000 were also available for
      families whose young were involved in an on-farm, youth subproject. The US$50,000 ceiling was removed.

      The AF also did the following: earmarked a min. 50% of FAIR financing for families within the target
      population which had not yet benefited and permitted a portion of families which had to access another
      subproject to deepen the development impact; the ceiling was US$3,000 per family minus the amount already
      received under the OL.12 The AF also included poor, non-agrarian populations occupied in small-scale agro-
      industry, required that a minimum 20% of all beneficiaries be women, and that 10% be youth. No minimums
      or earmarks were established for indigenous peoples. Groups with little experience were obliged to commence
      with an On-farm Productive or Habitat subproject, followed by a Community subproject, the latter requiring
      that 60% of integrants have prior experience.

2.1.5 Participatory processes: PROINDER was among the Latin America and Caribbean Region’s
Participation Flagship Projects. In agreement with Government, preparation was - for both the period and
country - highly participatory, driven by the demand-based nature of the project, reliance on existing,
experienced sources for the provision of support services to beneficiaries, the importance of building
ownership for longer-term sustainability of project investments and, the explicit project development
objective of increasing beneficiary organization and management capacity. Multiple consultations,
workshops, focus groups and interviews canvassed stakeholder input in design and about rural
development issues. A Participation Action Plan was prepared.

2.1.6 Adequacy of Government commitment: Government showed significant commitment to the
project concept and operational aspects: SAGPyA had in the early 1990s created the Social Program for
Agriculture (PSA), the implementing agency for the FAIR, with its own budget to pilot a decentralized,
demand-based approach to providing technical and financial assistance to poor farmers. Further, the



12
  The FAO (2011) economic analysis added another cohort permitted repeat access: groups whose subprojects under the OL had essentially
failed, e.g., farmers suffering the impact of climatic events.




                                                                  6
Borrower used its own funds and a Japanese Trust Grant for project preparation including a
comprehensive beneficiary assessment, and also prepared a Rural Development Strategy providing the
context and rationale for the project. The local preparation team for the project and the Rural
Development Strategy included SAGPyA staff to ensure consistency with Government’s sector policies
and activities.

2.1.7 Lessons of experience: Starting with the lessons of global experience gleaned by the Bank’s
evaluation department from the problematic integrated rural development programs of the 1960s to 1980s,
and learning from the more efficient social investment funds of the 1990s, project design reflected the
following: transparent and objective targeting criteria, distribution formulas and social control
mechanisms to avoid politicization as well as the diversion of resources/benefits; decentralized,
streamlined project processing; targeted information dissemination to the poorest communities; training
of a technical cadre familiar with group-based, participatory activities; and technical assistance and
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) regimes built into sub-project preparation to ensure sustainability.
Specific lessons from Argentina stressed: well-staffed project coordination units; the uneven institutional
capacity at the provincial level; and the positive impact of project decentralization on institutional
development.

2.1.8 Institutional and implementation arrangements: The multi-layered institutional framework
and mechanisms were well-defined but operationally complex, especially at national scale. Components 1
and 2 were designed as two parallel operations -isolated politically, technically and operationally- with
separate directorates. The project lacked mechanisms for integrating the two to achieve potentially
valuable synergies and multiplier effects.13 SAGPyA had demonstrated capacity to manage Bank projects,
and maintained a team of experienced personnel, while its PSA assumed direct management of the FAIR
due to its field capillarity and prior experience with poor farmers. Evolving from a direct provider of
services to managing services provision and financial management (FM) activities this role also entailed
was a major challenge for PSA. The DDA executed the difficult Rural Policy component in collaboration
with provincial authorities, while strengthening its capacity to formulate and analyze rural development
policy, and overseeing specialized studies. Under the AF, SAGPyA assumed direct control of the
provincial policy development sub-component of Component 2. Sub-national governments were
primarily recipients of assistance and participants in decision-making bodies due to their serious fiscal
issues and lack of experience in addressing rural poverty. Locally, an array of intermediaries provided
services; most had experience working with rural communities but technical capacity varied and
participatory techniques were an initial challenge to many.

2.1.9 Risk mitigation: The risk assessment was accurate as far as it went and the suggested mitigation
measures were rational. Nonetheless other risks merited attention. While the analysis could not have
foreseen the socio-economic crisis of 2000, which affected the entire Bank portfolio in Argentina, there
was no acknowledgment of the likely variable provincial commitment to the project’s institutional and
strategic goals for rural development and rural poverty reduction, of wide disparities in provincial
capacity to engage with/implement them, or of incentives which would drive provincial governments to
adhere to project goals. Further, the project’s national coverage, cited as a potentially controversial aspect
for increasing administrative costs per beneficiary but not as a project risk, also had implications for
adequate oversight - including physical and fiduciary. Close to 90% of total project financing was
intended for multiple community investments executed over a vast territory and in remote regions.




13
    It is also questionable why the adaptive research subcomponent was included under Component 2, Institutional Development, given the
separation between this component and the farm investment activities of Component 1, and when it might have made greater progress at the
field/farmer utilization stage if linked directly to the latter.



                                                                   7
2.2 Implementation

2.2.1      Factors affecting project implementation and outcomes:

 (a)     Flood emergency: El Nino-related inundation of large areas of the country soon after project
effectiveness in 1998 affected crops, herds and harvests, and disrupted the project’s planned launching
schedule. Government’s US$100 million Flood Emergency Program, partially financed by PROINDER
(see 1.6.1) and IADB, absorbed the time and attention of SAGPyA and provincial/local authorities in four
provinces. While successfully implemented, it severely limited implementation of PROINDER by
diverting manpower and focus. FAIR rural investments did not start until 2000 and then encountered the
severe budget and counterpart funding impact of the deepening national economic crisis.

(b)      Crisis and stagnation: The unprecedented economic and social decline starting in 1999 and
intensifying from 2000-03 witnessed acute political instability and Government’s default on its foreign
debt obligations. Budgetary restrictions worsened with no new investments possible (only
activities/investments already contracted could be completed). Project executors at the national and
provincial levels were constantly adjusting operational strategies to account for erratic budget flows. This
reduced PROINDER (and most projects in the Bank’s portfolio) to low levels of activity. The Budget
Law’s absolute prohibition on the contracting of consultants suppressed important project support
activities. The Bank team engaged with Borrower counterparts to urge budget priority for the project,
proposed alternative solutions to circumvent restrictions and even discussed partial cancellation. However,
the depth of this crisis left few realistic options other than increasing the Bank’s financing share which
was already high in most categories.14 The Bank, anticipating recovery and, above all, believing that the
project’s potential to succeed remained high and cancellation would have been counter-productive, helped
the Borrower to prepare a comprehensive and realistic operational strategy designed to guide and support
a 30-month extension of the closing date (see (d) below).15

(c)      Institutional turnover: Project continuity and coherence were negatively affected by repeated,
crisis-induced turnover of top management within both national-level and provincial sector institutions.
SAGPyA leadership changed 10 times from 1999-2002, along with rapid turnover in other senior
positions within the sector hierarchy. Excessive rotation of authorities affected the continuity, evolution
and consolidation of small farmers’ hitherto modest gains in positioning themselves to be heard by the
political and institutional establishment. Newly-installed managers lacked experience in rural
development and/or understanding of evolving attitudes to small farmers and rural poverty reduction.
This situation inter alia, weakened PSA’s management of the FAIR at a critical take-off point, but was
symptomatic of political infighting in a crisis environment and largely beyond the control of the Bank or
SAGPyA.

(d)      Extensions of the Closing Date: The willingness of management to contemplate repeated
extensions of a project with the early, troubled history described above and advancing age – albeit largely
beyond its control – made a material difference in the lives of over 70,000 poor rural families and
potentially many more the proposed Socio Economic Inclusion in Rural Areas Project (P106685) . It also
provided the time and opportunity to enhance the public profile of rural development and poor farmers in
the national and provincial policy agenda. This flexibility was buttressed by strong justification presented


14
   The QALP-1 asserted that more could have been done to secure better budget allocations and CP funding but the Bank team was adamant that
the national reality rendered Bank appeals for support to projects – individually or collectively – unproductive.
15
   The strategy included a revised structure and institutional rules, stronger relationship between the project’s two main components, improved
inter-institutional coordination, boosting the project’s role in positioning the theme of rural development in the legislative agenda and inter-
institutional dialogue, along with a broad-based clarification of human resource requirements, priority investments, technical assistance and
capacity-building, vulnerable groups, and communication and dissemination. Environmental aspects were not mentioned.



                                                                       8
by the Bank team, realistic action plans, reallocation of loan funds and close follow-up by Bank
supervision missions.16

 (e)     Provincial commitment: Economic recovery, including at the provincial level, saw a rapid
acceleration of the FAIR but much slower and uneven implementation of Component 2 (Provincial
institutional development) activities designed, inter alia, to improve provincial rural development policy
and program formulation and establish the pre-conditions for decentralized rural development. While
assuming the impact of established political, financial and geographical relationships, experience also
suggests that the project lacked sufficient incentives to secure provincial buy-in. The 23 participating
provinces received relatively modest funding for technical assistance and strategy development but no
money for say, infrastructure. Unlike PROSAP (P006010), its contemporaneous peer operation, where
individual provinces received subproject financing as provincial loans in some cases as high as US$20
million per subproject, PROINDER saw Government pressing the provinces for commitment to rural
development with little to offer them either financially or substantively, as inducement.

(f)     Delayed effectiveness of the Additional Financing: The Additional Financing became effective
in January 2009, some two years after closure of the OL and 18 months after Board approval, an
unusually long delay even for Argentina where such delays are generic. This disrupted the continuity
upon which the AF was justified, i.e., as a bridge to a proposed new “Rural Poverty and Growth? project
which was in the CPS 2010-2012. PROINDER had built up significant institutional infrastructure at the
provincial level, had a portfolio of approved subprojects awaiting financing, and its National
Coordination Unit (UCN) remained operational. With time passing however, the UCN team (mostly
contracted employees recruited directly by the Ministry) disbanded, causing the AF to start operations
even later than effectiveness. The Bank worked with SAGPyA on a realistic action plan to ensure rapid
implementation and full disbursement. This measure, along with increasing the replenishment ceiling
(from US$8.0 million to US$13.0 million) in 2010 to decrease payment lags by reducing the backlog of
approved subprojects ready for financing/implementation, resulted in the project’s successful conclusion.

2.2.2 Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR mission in September 2002 found progress still slow due
to the ongoing budget crisis influencing many aspects of the project. The mission defined key elements
essential to the project’s continuity: greater effort to insert rural poverty and small farmers into the
national debate; need to review project targeting of the poorest, costs of subprojects and technical
assistance to establish realistic ceilings and potentially revise project targets adapted to the new socio-
economic realities of beneficiaries as determined by the ongoing economic crisis; improve the relevance
and efficiency of technical assistance and the operational effectiveness of provincial technicians; re-
evaluate the subproject processing chain to eliminate bottlenecks and rigidity; re-assess the overall
relationship between the project and provincial/local institutions/entities and accelerate formation of the
planned Local Units (UL); and give top priority to information and communication activities. Subsequent
follow-up was strong in most areas, helped by closing date extensions.

2.2.3 The MTR evaluation, realized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) in 2002, called attention to the project’s successes -especially under the FAIR- despite the
challenging context of the time.17 Subprojects visited were completed and operational; beneficiaries were
eating better, had surplus to sell, and felt better off; women and youth were actively involved; group

formation was strong but consolidation was problematic and decision-making sometimes flawed,
resulting in some inappropriate investments. The report focused attention on the internal processing
obstacles hindering progress, the need to manage by results, and the performance of the main project
executing bodies at all levels. The MTR evaluation was revised in collaboration with SAGPyA, but
agreement could not be reached on its final content, especially in regard to its critique of the Institutional
Development component, with which SAGPyA strongly disagreed.18

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design: The PAD outline of M&E was brief, requiring establishment of a Management
Information System (MIS) and describing a framework of reporting covering internal controls, progress
reports measuring outputs vs. targets, annual implementation evaluations of the Rural Investment
component (FAIR), as well as mid-term and final external evaluations in order to assess the project’s
performance and impact across a broad range of criteria. The monitoring framework was comparatively
weak -as with most Bank projects in the mid-1990s- and baseline indicators were to be established in the
first year. Opportunities to correct the framework and resolve M&E difficulties were not addressed by
the Additional Financing. M&E was not mentioned in the AF Project Paper and it is assumed that the
original arrangements prevailed.

2.3.2 Implementation and dissemination: The project established an M&E system and collected
copious, wide-ranging data on many activities, including on each of the 11,000-odd FAIR subprojects.
The MIS was technically sophisticated but operationally dysfunctional. Fiduciary monitoring and
reporting functioned well but operational data were poorly-organized, of uneven relevance and difficult to
retrieve and use for results-based management or for evaluation and final reporting (including the ICR).
The emphasis was on outputs not results.19 In terms of products, the project financed a Baseline Study
(SAGPyA, 2002), 20 two impact monitoring studies (SAGPyA, 2001 and 2005), a Mid-term Review
evaluation (FAO, 2002), and a final evaluation of the original project (Crisol, 2010). The Borrower did
not prepare a Borrower Completion Report.21 The project, as the first CDD operation in Argentina and
with nationwide coverage, would have benefited from a physical performance study of the FAIR
subprojects (i.e., completion, quality, satisfaction, utilization and O&M).

2.3.3 Dissemination used the Web primarily, as well as workshops and seminars. Broad themes such as
land and territory, rural employment, and technology tended to be more widely disseminated than the
themes of policies and programs, vulnerable groups, and rural poverty, the latter being disseminated
mostly within public sector-related institutions. The project-financed analysis “Small farmers in the



18
     See letter from SAGPyA to the Bank, October 21, 2002. SAGPyA asserted that the consultants preparing the MTR evaluation allocated
insufficient time to the Institutional Development analysis, did not interview key senior and technical staff responsible for its execution, saw the
crisis-induced institutional instability as affecting only the FAIR investment activities, and did not take into account the lack of national and
provincial policies for small farmers, complex processes involved in fostering these especially under conditions of extreme institutional instability,
and the difficulties involved in measuring progress especially at a notional half-way mark. Further, in comparing relative progress between the
two main components, the authors had not factored in PSA’s already long track record working with small farmers since the early 1990s. Finally,
SAGPyA felt that progress under Component 2 had not been measured against its explicit objectives. These differences of opinion were not
resolved.
19
   The archive shows this was an ongoing concern. Accelerated subproject processing under the AF created a backlog of data requiring uploading
to the MIS. Under the OP, proposed hiring of consultants to organize M&E and specifically the MIS was foiled by prohibitions under the Budget
Law. Ad hoc arrangements governed M&E in 2005 with “high transaction costs? (ISR #16).
20

21
    The Loan Agreement for the OL called for a report on progress achieved in carrying out the project including the results of M&E activities
and a beneficiary survey and assessment, prior to the Closing Date. The Loan Agreement for the AF called only for 6-monthly progress reports.
In the final stages of the AF, the Bank’s dialogue with Government encountered differences of opinion on the timing/nature of new operations.
The Borrower supported completion of the final impact evaluation (Crisol 2010) but momentum was lost on initiating a Borrower Completion
Report.



                                                                        10
Argentine Republic?22 was especially widely disseminated, including internationally; the study “Women
who work the Land? attracted similar attention.23 Catalogues of project-financed adaptive technologies
were disseminated to over 120 public and private institutions and civil society bodies but the extent to
which these technologies reached farmers during the life of the project is not known and is generally a
longer-term process. See Annex 2.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards 24 : Compliance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. An environmental management
framework (EMF) was prepared for the OL, given that SAGPyA lacked specific environmental
requirements and procedures. EMF measures were integrated into the subproject screening, evaluation,
approval, and monitoring procedures and the EMF itself was improved in the later stages of the OL.
However, environmental compliance required more effort. The UCN had an in-house environmental
specialist in the early years of the project but there was little or no subsequent follow-up. Bank
supervision missions occasionally included environmental expertise but no Aide Memoire or ISR
reported on environmental safeguards performance until April 2010, under the Additional Financing. At
that time, Bank safeguards specialists noted satisfactory attention to environmental sustainability in FAIR
subprojects and training of PROINDER technical staff in natural resource management issues and good
agricultural practices. The mission found that indigenous people (IP) appeared to be well integrated into
the project in culturally respectful ways and that the project was in compliance with OP 4.10 but also
noted that record-keeping on IP consultations and subproject preparation needed improvement.

2.4.2 Financial management and audit: Rated Moderately Satisfactory. The primary mechanism for
FM oversight until 2006 was analysis and dialogue with the Borrower on the results of independent audits.
Audit reports showed consistently unqualified opinions on movements of the Special Account and
eligibility of expenditures (based on SOE) throughout the project’s life. Formal FM supervision of the OL
involved three missions: September 2002 for the MTR; September 2006 as part of AF preparation; and
June 2008 in reaction to flagged internal control issues. Accounting and FM performance were rated
Satisfactory by the November 2006 FM supervision mission based on the Argentina Fiduciary Action
Plan framework. However, review of the 2006 audit report found problems with internal control
procedures at the sub-national level in two provinces at which point the FM rating was downgraded to
Moderately Unsatisfactory. Bank management acted decisively –including FM missions to the two
involved provinces- once it became aware of the audit results, and an Action Plan was agreed with the
UNC to resolve identified weaknesses, and fully-executed.25 Weaknesses mostly involved administrative
errors and lack of knowledge, not accountability issues. Fiduciary performance was rated Moderately
Satisfactory by the QALP-1 (1998). No problems were detected in the macro aspects of financial
management. FM supervision rated the UNC’s financial administration MS in October 2009 based on
compliance with the Loan Agreement and use of project funds for intended purposes. Follow-up FM
supervision in 2010 kept the MS rating which was sustained through closing.

2.4.3 Procurement: Rated Satisfactory. Formal procurement supervision/post-review from Bank
headquarters was periodic but procurement performance/events were routinely monitored from the

no significant problems in procurement provisions or practices from a review of the complete
procurement archive. Two procurement post-reviews of the Additional Financing found no major issues
and rated procurement Satisfactory. With one exception (2002), all supervision ISRs rated procurement
Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Transition arrangements to regular operations: The Operational Manual required that steps
be taken to guarantee the continuity of all subprojects financed. Completed subprojects are maintained by
farmers either under group arrangements or individually. Group investments formally became the
property of the group and individual investments are owned by the family named on the financing
contract. In both cases, each entity is responsible for the O&M of the investment and for financing its
recurrent costs and replacements. Communities/families received a minimum two years of TA support
including for O&M and regardless of the type of subproject. Supervision and monitoring activities in
individual provinces indicated over time that compliance with project O&M requirements was good.

2.5.2 Sustaining reforms/institutional capacity: Certain processes are endogenous and not
necessarily project-determined. While the project provided resources to support these processes, final
sustainability depends on the political economy at the national and provincial levels. A series of
developments indicates potentially good sustainability of the project’s institutional achievements and for
consolidation of the space created by the project for rural development. New/restructured institutions,
modernized strategies and databases, coordination forums linking the center to the provinces, increased
budgets and human resource development, as well as territorial focus designed to exploit comparative
advantage and target the most vulnerable are a project legacy expected to promote sustainable rural
development and the sustainability of project achievements themselves. See also 3.5.7.

2.5.3 Follow-on operation: The proposed, recently-negotiated Argentina: Socio-Economic Inclusion
in Rural Areas Project (P106685, US$52.5 million), based on analytical evidence that rural poverty
remains unacceptably high in Argentina, would continue to support and improve rural development
activities developed under PROINDER while increasing the focus on indigenous peoples and piloting the
Productive Alliances approach for linking small producers to markets. Its design reflects the lessons of
PROINDER: increasing small farmers’ organizational level, facilitating their participation in formal
markets; priority for technical assistance; providing indigenous peoples with appropriate development
tools; and ensuring that investment subprojects have sufficient critical mass/financing for developmental
impact and sustainability.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance

3.1.1 PROINDER’s development objectives, despite their age, remain relevant to country and global
priorities and broadly consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy. The proposed follow-on operation
(see 2.5.3) reflects current practice in its clear, straightforward PDO “to increase the socio-economic
inclusion of the rural poor (small producers, indigenous people and rural workers)? and new emphasis on
sustained growth with equity and social inclusion, the CPS pillars. Government is satisfied with
achievements under PROINDER and its sustained relevance, and intends to continue and improve the

approach adopted, while increasing the market orientation of its rural development programs by piloting
the Productive Alliance model successfully tested in other countries of the region. 26

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Objective 1: Increased productive and organizational capacity in participating poor, rural
communities.

This objective was achieved: PROINDER financed an aggregate 12,047 subprojects (just over 100% of
the aggregate target of 12,000) benefiting 70,527 beneficiary families (without repetition) in participating,
poor rural communities. Counting repetition of 23,620 families under the AF, total beneficiaries (both
phases) were 94,147 families. Targeting was effective and the priority assigned to vulnerable groups
resulted in their representing 65% and 58% of total beneficiaries under the OL and AF, respectively.27

The following outcomes (Crisol 2010, studying the OL only) substantiate the achievement of Objective 1:

(a)      Productive capacity: On-farm and community infrastructure subprojects (wells, small-scale
irrigation and dams, fencing, livestock and equipment, sheds, mills, machinery and tools, housing
improvements) accounted for 80% of total investments. Some 56% of farmers benefiting from these types
increased their production and its quality; 71% of livestock producers increased productivity and 60%
improved quality; and volume of production increased for 45% of agricultural producers. Some 89% of
all beneficiaries of infrastructure investments increased their capital assets as a direct outcome.28 Some
20% of total beneficiaries of infrastructure and productive subprojects -and 33% of agriculture producers
specifically- diversified production and improved the conservation of their product. FAO (2011) shows
average aggregate increases in agricultural production (in tons, agricultural and livestock products) of
15.6% and 19.4% (OL and AF respectively).

(b)      Incomes: As a result of improved productive capacity, 56% of project beneficiaries increased
their net farm income. About 23% of total beneficiaries of infrastructure subprojects saw their real farm
income rise above the maximum recorded pre-project (AR$9,200). Significantly, the proportion of
farmers with the lowest registered income pre-project (AR$700) decreased from 15% to 5% indicating
important poverty reduction effects. Livestock production tended to have better income results than
agricultural activities. Overall net farm income from sales grew by 68% and gross value of sales rose
93% (importantly due to price effects). FAO (2011) shows aggregate gross productive income (OL
and AF) increased 78.3% in the with-project situation.29

(c)     Market insertion: While the value of sales increased under the with-project situation,
commercial activity, including pooled marketing arrangements, proved problematic for many small
farmers. Expectations regarding market insertion may have been overly ambitious and, in practice,
PROINDER did not proactively seek such opportunities. Many project beneficiaries with surpluses had
binding constraints on commercial activity, e.g., storage, conservation and transport. Such activity is more


26
    Small-scale investments in rural infrastructure, productivity growth, natural resource management and food security with a ceiling per
subproject of US$150,000 –significantly higher than PROINDER based on lessons concerning the sustainability and impact of very small
investments– in parallel with Productive Alliance Subprojects, investments in small-scale civil works, improved production processes and quality
standards produced to market/buyer specifications re quality and quantity and with a ceiling per subproject of US$300,000.
27
   About 37,441 families represented women, youth and indigenous people; in aggregate some 65% of total families benefited under the OL
(57,603 without repetition). Under the AF, 16,425 beneficiary families, 45% of the total, represented vulnerable populations, or 16,425. Similar
data for AF was not available. However, their participation was measured largely by headcount; data on subprojects proposed, implemented and
operated by/for the benefit of such populations are not available.
28
    Crisol (2010) shows that the incremental value of total capital rose 93%; infrastructure 63%; equipment 312%; and animals 70%.
29
   FAO (2011) shows average aggregate gross income per family, including off-farm income, increased 135.8% over the total project period.



                                                                      13
appropriately a second or third generation challenge in many cases and depends on a sequence of
investments -whether under one or several projects- which address farmers’ priorities, select the
appropriate entry point (i.e., subsistence, then off-farm employment or market insertion over time) and
position farmers for commercial activity. The options and sequencing need to be identified up-front. See
Annexes 2 and 3.

(d)     Food production: There was wide consensus among interviewees that the project had favorable
impacts on family wellbeing/quality of life, importantly due to increased food supply as confirmed by the
proportion of beneficiaries who improved food supply among the main types of subprojects: 79.2% (Type
A, subsistence); 76% (Type B, on-farm infrastructure); 66.4% (Type C, community infrastructure); and,
45% of subprojects with women predominating (Crisol 2010). While the production and yields of specific
food crops was not reported, production of agricultural crops overall rose 15.3% and 19.2%, and of
livestock products 20% and 23.3% under the OL and AF, respectively (FAO, 2011).

(e)     Organizational capacity: The vast majority of project beneficiaries were organized -whether by
the conversion/upgrading of existing organizations or creation of new ones- in around 1,550 associations
or other types of groupings by end-project, even in provinces with no prior tradition of collaborative,
participatory action. 30 Farmers linked to associations showed better productive and income results
regardless of type of activity due, inter alia, to the social capital impacts of associative activities.
Participation in an association was fundamental for reaping the full benefits of marketing efforts
particularly in price negotiations (41.5% of farmers in associations had negotiated better prices vs. 18.3%
of farmers in looser or individual arrangements) and actually starting to sell (35% vs. 26%). Over 60% of
farmers conducted joint purchasing of goods and services and some 20% were marketing jointly. Even so,
as noted above, informal/ad hoc marketing arrangements through middlemen remained prevalent due to
small farmers’ productive informality. Market insertion remains a challenge (Annexes 2 and 5).

3.2.2 Objective 2: Greater emphasis on rural poverty issues in the sector agenda and improved
coordination of rural development programs and policies.

This objective was partially achieved:

Rural poverty and the sector agenda: The project successfully inserted the theme of rural
development/poverty in national and provincial sector agendas, with more modest and variable
achievement among provinces due to complex factors outlined below. A national rural development
strategy was developed and 19 provinces identified strategy and policy frameworks for rural populations
based on project-financed technical assistance (TA) and rural diagnoses, and incorporating to varying
degrees - depending on the province - the concerns of stakeholders and updated statistical information on
the small farm sector. The project financed 23 studies on rural development issues and 21 publications on
rural poverty and small farmers as the foundation for strategy and policy development. An aggregate 56
adaptive technology research projects for small farms were implemented and disseminated through online
catalogues and special events, giving increased visibility to diverse institutions and organizations working
with this theme. A National Register of Family Agriculture (RENAF) was created, using baseline data
developed for the Mid-term Review; the goal is to register every producer. A sub-component for
Strengthening Family Agriculture Organizations was incorporated into the AF, resulting in the financing
of 30 proposals from small farmer organizations for specialized TA for capacity-building. The Bank team
worked with the NCU to disseminate successes and the results of key studies as critical input for the
national and provincial strategy and policy dialogue.


30
  Farmer organization was essential to participate but the type of organization varied; about 40% of beneficiaries belonged to an association.
Organization of some type was essential to gain access to FAIR grants and/or technical assistance.



                                                                     14
Improved coordination: Many of these provinces also signed Cooperation Agreements with SAGPyA to
collaborate on rural development issues, reorganized key institutions to improve rural development
management and coordination (see 3.5.7), and established specialized institutional units (sub-secretariats,
institutes, departments) dedicated to improving contacts with and responsiveness to small farmers and
rural workers. Provinces also updated their rural diagnoses in many cases including new databases,
conducted activities to improve links to municipal/local governments, and participated in project-
sponsored training and capacity-building for rural technicians to improve socio-organizational and
productive skills.31 Other developments designed to promote coordination included: (i) creation of the
Sub-secretariat for Family Agriculture under the Rural Development Secretariat; and (ii) creation of the
National Family Agriculture Forum (FONAF) as an opportunity for dialogue between the Ministry and
organizations of family farmers, and to speak on behalf of small farmers, and the subsequent formation of
provincial branches of this organization.

As noted, provincial adhesion to the project’s objectives was variable. But, it should be borne in mind that
as late as 1999 few provinces had rural development policies/strategies. Limiting factors included: lack of
global diagnoses of sector issues and the rural context; inadequate knowledge of rural labor markets; lack
of institutional structures, policies or the long-term vision to work with rural populations; weak or no
rural labor unions or rural NGOs; and, a provincial enabling environment which limited the reach,
efficiency and impact of national rural policies. Traditionally also, the provinces, with some exceptions,
took their agrarian policy lead from the capital and lacked the autonomy or commitment to act
independently within the sector.

Several other practical factors impeded greater impact at the provincial level: the institution-building
activities as designed were parallel to, not integrated with, FAIR field activities or basic activities such as
the selection of themes for the adaptive research projects, thereby missing the opportunity to understand
the problem and the logic on the ground; rural development continued to have low priority in some
provinces and as a result, the human resources and materials assigned by the project had little currency;
and, networking with other sector organizations, public and private, was essential but weak. Provincial
authorities needed more direct contact with rural practitioners. See Annexes 2 and 5.

3.2.3 Objective 3: Financial assistance provided to poor, rural producers in areas declared in flood
emergency or disaster.

This objective was achieved: The Flood Emergency Program disbursed about US$24.31 million - of the
US$40.0 million reallocated for this purpose. 32 Some 39,322 beneficiary families were assisted in the
provinces of Corrientes (13,671), Misiones (22,468), Santa Fe (2,133), and Santiago del Estero (1,147).
Targeting was generally effective; most beneficiaries, with minor exceptions mostly related to
misunderstanding of the targeting framework, met eligibility criteria.

Evaluation of PROEMER: Evaluation studies covering the four beneficiary provinces (Karasik 2000,
and Vuotto 2000) noted the following: (i) the program was judged to have been effectively implemented.
Farmers who did not receive PROEMER support were in many cases forced to migrate; (ii) beneficiaries


31

32
    As a consequence of the devaluation of the AR$ to the US Dollar, the project ended up with significantly more local currency funds than
expected at appraisal when the AR$ and US Dollar were on par. This allowed PROEMER activities to be financed from project funds without
jeopardizing the OL’s targets (which were not adjusted to reflect less financing for FAIR). Due to the large numbers of farmers eligible within the
flood zone, regular implementation channels through SAGPyA were not feasible; Banco de la Nación, due to its extensive network, became an
alternative (temporary) execution agency for disbursing Bank funds and the National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA) handled the direct
relationship with farmers and technical assistance.



                                                                       15
rated the financial support highly for enabling them to respond to basic, flood-related challenges: payment
of debts for storage/other; health costs; repair of homes damaged by water; and purchase of seeds and
fencing materials. 33 While highly beneficial, this mixed usage -especially for immediate needs- differed
from the Productive Recovery Plans envisaged at appraisal; (iii) the presence, involvement and relative
strength of social and civil society and farmer organizations varied considerably between provinces.
Overall, the experiences of working jointly in this emergency reduced mistrust and lack of confidence
among stakeholders. Farmers felt however, that there were too many actors involved and at times they
outweighed the flood victims, especially in the Local Emergency Committees (LEC); (iv) standard
disbursement procedures -the release of funds against SOEs for expenditures- hindered the flow of funds
to beneficiaries which, in an emergency situation, had negative impacts especially in provinces with large
numbers of beneficiaries. Banco Nación, the financial agent for the Bank loan funds, had difficulty
keeping pace; and (v) the speed with which PROEMER was prepared and launched, and the fact that it
preceded PROINDER-proper, created difficulties mobilizing sufficient technical assistance, especially in
provinces with little/no experience working with small farmers. See Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Economic and financial analysis: Project appraisal (OL) estimated an Internal Economic Rate
of Return (IERR) for the FAIR, and for the project as a whole, of 26.3% and 19% respectively. An
economic and financial analysis conducted by the FAO in 2011 based on FAIR data, concluded that the
two stages of the project were both efficient and profitable. Crisol (2010) data and FARMOD simulations
showed that the volume of agricultural production increased, and incomes generated were higher than
expected. Final project IERRs (OL and AF) greatly exceeded appraisal estimates. Results are
summarized below and detailed in Annex 3.

(a) Results (OL): The following table compares financial results as a whole in Year 12 of the with-
project situation, with those obtained in Year 12 without the project.

The net present value (NPV) of the flow of annual incremental economic income and the IERR are as
follows:


                    Project Total (57,603 Families)                                     Total VPN - AR$                     IERR %

33
   For example, farmers shifted to lower cost/ha crops or crops with a more secure market price (from cotton to maize, for example), financed
alambradas, and repaired fences and sheds as well as machinery.




                                                                    16

* Not including the value of family labor

The NPV of the flow of annual incremental economic income, and the IERR are as follows:
                  Project Total (36,544 Families)                                Total NPV AR$                   IERR %
                           VPN and IERR                                           1,075,718,350                    108.0

3.3.2 The IERR and NPV of each stage exceed 108% and AR$ 860.0 million (US$210.0 million using
an exchange rate of AR$4.10 to USD 1.00) respectively. The two stages of the project show high internal
economic rates of return above all because the value of the public investment, financed in major part by
the World Bank, was much smaller in relation to the net income received by the beneficiaries in the
without-project situation. 34

3.3.3 Under the OL, the total investment (project cost) reached AR$ 253 million while the net annual
economic income of the 57,603 families benefited, in the without-project situation, was AR$ 880 million.
In the second stage project, the total investment was AR$ 191 million while annual net economic income
of the 36,544 farmers in the without-project situation was AR$ 640 million. Thus, even though the
project generated increases of only 2% annually in the net economic income of beneficiaries, equally it
reached a positive internal rate of return greater than 12%. Annual incremental net financial incomes
achieved by 70,527 beneficiary families in the two stages of the project were in all cases superior to 20%
and for 39,401 families exceeded 40%.

3.3.4 Relevance and sustainability: All individual subprojects financed were and remain relevant and
are related, directly or indirectly, to the principal productive activities conducted by beneficiary families.
Most of the community subprojects, especially those related to irrigation and the group management of
livestock, also have high relevance. The sustainability of individual subprojects is high and in the case of
community subprojects is intimately related to their insertion or not in other systems, services, or
organizations which can count on functional training processes and which are in themselves, sustainable.

3.3.5 Project costs: Final aggregate project cost was US$139.42 million comprising US$92.06 million
(OL) and US$47.36 million (AF), about 85% and 83.4% of appraisal estimates respectively. The OL was
fully-disbursed and the AF about 99.6%. The Borrower’s contribution to both projects fell far short of


34
  The FAO analysis suggests that project preparation did not take into account the effect derived from projecting growth in net
income of 15-40% when the amount to be invested (project cost) did not represent even 0.2% of the value of beneficiaries’
production in the without-project situation. This relationship should have been as close to 1.0% as possible. If the project was
going to invest only US$100.0 million (US$410.0 million in 2011 values) for around 50,000 beneficiary families producing
around AR$ 50,000 per year (total AR$2.5 billion), the expected impact was bound to exceed 100%. The analysis concludes that
the project ought to have benefited a smaller number of families and the amount of support per family should have been much
higher than the average US$800 under the original stage and US$1,200 under the second stage. See Annex 3.




                                                              17
appraisal expectations reaching 52% under the OL and 20% under the AF. The final cost of the Project’s
PROEMER-related activities was US$30.21 million of which the Bank financed US$24.21 million (vs.
the reallocation of US$40.0 million). This allowed the new Component 4 of the OL to be financed out of
project funds without jeopardizing achievement of the original project targets under Component 1. (Most
of the US$17.0 million of unused Bank loan funds for PROEMER were reallocated to Component 1 in
December 2002). Approximately 10% of the total cost of FAIR subprojects was contributed by
beneficiaries in the form of family labor. In the case of the OL this is estimated at around US$8.0 million,
and for the AF, about S$4.3 million (see Annex 1).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1 The overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on the following: (i) project
objectives remain relevant to the rural development and small farm context in Argentina, as shown by its
further scale-up/refinement under the proposed follow-on operation and evidence from the 2002 Agro-
livestock Census that the universe of eligible rural families is higher than previously thought; (ii) the
project demonstrated satisfactory achievement of its DOs, especially in regard to the developmental
impact on small farm families as well as its impact on institutionalizing the rural development/small farm
agenda in national policy/strategy (even though institutional/policy gains at the provincial level were
more modest); (iii) promising, preliminary evidence of economic and financial efficiency and ongoing
relevance; and (iv) good outlook for the sustainability of subproject investments through standardized
O&M practices, producer groups leveraging the FAIR experience to access other funding sources,
important institutional developments, and continuity of the PROINDER rural investment model under the
proposed follow-on operation. However, while the project demonstrated that an overage project can be
successful, its age per se -13 years at closing- prevented the ICR from rating overall outcome as
satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty: Project evaluation shows that the incomes of beneficiaries increased substantially (see
Annexes 3 and 5). An important result shows that the number of beneficiaries with incomes at or below
the lowest level registered upon entering the project –AR$700 per year– decreased from 15% to 5% at
end-OL. While it is assumed that the project was not the only influence on this result, statements by
many beneficiaries that PROINDER was the only rural support program in their area suggests that its role
was significant.

3.5.2 Gender: Women represented 39.6% and 35% of total beneficiaries under the OL and AF
respectively. In the final year of OP implementation (2007), about 92% of all families benefited were
female-headed. Under the OL, women received close to 15% of all subprojects but only 5.4% of
subproject financing (no similar data for AF). Subprojects were not specifically designed for women but
were classified in gender terms based on the participation/headcount of female-headed households.
Evaluation (Crisol 2010) showed that some 97% of all women’s associations retained their full original
membership several years after their subproject. Their participation tended to be more permanent and
social capital formation deeper. Women’s associations showed strong capacity to negotiate, to be socially
recognized and to stimulate the participation of others.

3.5.3 Youth: Youth represented 15.4% and 10% of project beneficiaries respectively, but the broad
consensus was that working with rural youth poses unique difficulties requiring specialized expertise. The
project was better-equipped professionally to work with women and indigenous people; there was no



                                                    18
strategy, little evidence of a consultative process for youth, and rural technicians tended to lack an
appropriate professional profile for this work. Youth were simply viewed as “young farmers?. While there
were some emblematic examples of successful youth-led subprojects, young beneficiaries tended to be
impatient of authority, not committed to rural ventures or to waiting for results, and lacking confidence in
small farming as a future. None of the youth associations studied had retained its original membership
(Crisol 2010).

3.5.4 Indigenous peoples (IP): Indigenous peoples were a priority group for FAIR investments and
represented about 10% and 12% of total beneficiary families under the OL and AF, respectively. The
project emphasized culturally sensitive mobilization and awareness building as preparation for investment
activity. Local technicians received training and were selected on the basis of IP language skills and prior
experience working with such groups. The project focused IP activities in the provinces of Salta and
Formosa applying additional targeting criteria to reach denser concentrations of IP in certain
municipalities. In Salta Province from 2002 to 2006, PROINDER financed 360 community infrastructure
subprojects (water supply, road improvements, community centers) benefiting 4,400 indigenous families
and totaling about US$2.9 million. The AF strengthened the overall approach to indigenous peoples’
participation and by the closing date the experience with this cohort was judged positively by several
studies, although leaving no doubt that earmarking and forms of affirmative action are essential for real
success. The proposed follow-on project will intensify IP investment along these lines.

3.5.5 The Institutional Development component also addressed IP needs: TA to develop national
information systems, policies and studies on IP themes; strengthening of provincial institutions to ensure
that policy development included IP; training for provincial public service staff on ethnic identity and
methodologies for working with IP; and agreements with the national Rural Development Council, the
National Institute for Indigenous Affairs (INAI) and with PSA and other programs to collaborate on
incorporating IP concerns into programs and coordinating provincial implementation. PROINDER
introduced a more integrated approach to IP by adding investments to mobilization and training. The Salta
Province experience with IP is viewed as important for its critical mass and continuous evolution of
cultural and territorial strategies.35

3.5.6 Targeting: Project targeting mechanisms allocated project resources both within and between
provinces and to eligible beneficiaries. Application of provincial targeting was initially disrupted by the
budget crisis but functioned well thereafter; crisis effects actually increased awareness concerning the
predicament of small farmers and the FAIR was able to reach many isolated, traditionally excluded
communities. Deviation from provincial targeting standards was reported as minimal; studies show the
project effectively insulated itself from political/other pressures. Interviews with beneficiaries and local
leaders indicate that targeting was effective at the micro-level; beneficiaries conformed to a profile based
on indicators of unsatisfied basic needs, typically smallholders, transient laborers and vulnerable groups.36
Even so, experience shows that participation and access to benefits were not homogeneous, especially for
vulnerable groups - indigenous people, women, youth and itinerant rural laborers, the latter group not
well-defined at appraisal and whose participation was more assumed than measured. Data indicate that
the project reached significant numbers of women, IP, and youth but in each case there is considerable
room for improvement by addressing their specific nature and needs. Each group needs a diagnosis, a
strategy, and an action plan. Targeting of the PROEMER flood emergency activities was generally

effective with some deviation, mostly the result of misunderstanding of the targeting framework (see
3.2.4 and Annex 2).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

 3.5.7 GOA’s intensified emphasis on rural development/poverty reduction is shown by recent,
important institutional changes: (i) creation in 2008 of the Under-Secretariat for Family Agriculture and
Rural Development within SAGPyA, mandated to coordinate implementation of all rural development
(RD) and rural poverty projects (nationally or internationally funded), institutionalizing a national small-
farm development policy; (ii) elevation of SAGPyA in 2009 to ministerial rank as Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock, and Fisheries (MAGyP) reflecting greater national commitment to agricultural and rural
development; and (iii) subsequent creation, within MAGyP, of the Unit for Rural Change (Unidad para el
Cambio Rural) to coordinate all sector interventions to ensure consistency/coherence between externally-
funded interventions and national agricultural and rural development policies. Within the general sector
policy framework, small farmers are key players in the national food system, and need access to the
information and capacity-building which can reduce inequity and asymmetry in relation to commercial
producers and value chains. Institutional reform/growth varied greatly between provinces, a function of
complex relationships with national authorities/policies, uneven political commitment to project
objectives, ongoing capacity and systemic issues, relative economic weight and natural resource
endowments. See Annexes 2 and 5.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4 While the project planned to finance studies, the high quality, number, and diverse focus of the
studies prepared represents a major unanticipated achievement of special significance for
governments -national and provincial- committed to modernizing rural development policy, planning, and
practice. While these studies can be accessed through the project website (see Annex 9), their more
active and broader dissemination is recommended. Another unanticipated but important development
was FONAF, which became the “spokesman? for small farmers in planning the AF, with the national and
provincial governments, and has since become a major umbrella organization.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Beneficiaries had the following to say about the project (Crisol 2011): (i) TA and training were
rated very highly, followed by the participatory methodology used to formulate and present subprojects;
(ii) beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with their participatory organizations -some with national
representation- and the fact that project benefits enabled them to stay in the countryside and not migrate;
(iii) communities who received two or more subprojects were especially positive, noting the rapid
developmental impact which resulted; (iv) indigenous beneficiaries noted the benefits of training,
awareness-building about human rights, and strengthened ability to confront institutions; (v) community
infrastructure beneficiaries rated their experiences most highly (77%), followed by subsistence
subprojects and rural women (65% and 63% respectively); and (vi) least appreciated were the
amounts/size of certain subproject grants, described as useful/beneficial but insufficient, for example, to
galvanize the larger-scale productive activity to initiate or expand commercial objectives. See Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1.    Sustainability. Factors taken into account include: (i) most subprojects implemented to
specification and functioning as intended with O&M arrangements established; (ii) social capital


                                                    20
formation, permanence and functionality of many community associations, and evidence of community
capacity to leverage new benefits/resources; (iii) a proposed follow-on operation scaling up PROINDER-
type investments with tighter territorial focus, design features to improve productive activity and market
insertion, and technical assistance; (iv) major changes in the national institutional framework supporting
rural development and small farmers; (v) promising performance of many provinces, indicative of varying
degrees of institutionalization of rural development, but many still marginal and future trajectory
uncertain; and (vi) economic and financial sustainability of farm models studied at EOP. Environmental
management and sustainability are discussed in 2.4.1.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 Separate Bank assessments of quality at entry rated the project Satisfactory and Moderately
Satisfactory respectively. The ICR agrees with most elements cited, rating quality Assessment at Entry
on balance as MS chiefly due to M&E design issues. Summarizing these assessments: (i) Quality at Entry
Assessment37 (QAE-1): rated the project concept, DO and approach, technical and economic aspects,
environmental features, financial management, institutional capacity, risk assessment and sustainability
elements as Satisfactory. Poverty and social aspects were rated Highly Satisfactory, as were the
incorporation of lessons of experience and consideration of design alternatives. However, readiness for
implementation was rated Marginal due to inadequate realism and quality of the implementation plan for
the first year, as were Bank inputs and processes related to the efficient use of resources and the skills mix.
M&E was not rated; (ii) QALP-138:more thorough but more critical, the QALP-1 downgraded quality at
entry to Moderately Satisfactory due to an imprecise PDO and consequent weak causal links to the KPI,
inadequate arrangements for M&E and lack of baseline data, a need for attention to the local-level
transparency of procurement decisions and flow of funds (reflecting new Bank fiduciary rules for CDD
projects), questionable Borrower commitment, and a lack of specific approaches for including vulnerable
groups despite the strong social analysis. Satisfactory ratings were assigned for appropriateness of project
design, assessment of risk, and the institutional framework.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.2 This rating takes into account the following: (i) regular supervision (30 missions in 13 years),
candidly reported, with monitored, agreed action plans; (ii) strong relationship with SAGPyA throughout,
and appropriate advice and solutions to the Borrower including under highly adverse implementation
conditions; (iii) rapid response to GOA’s request for flood emergency support and insistence on its ex-
post evaluation; and (iv) CMU’s engagement with GOA to resolve the overall crisis as a portfolio
solution with longer-term sustainability, and (v) management’s support to the Bank and Borrower teams
via approval of repeated extensions of the closing date. These factors are balanced by certain weaknesses:
(a) uneven attention to M&E over time; (b) failure to modernize the results framework during preparation
of the AF or to shift the emphasis to management by results; (c) superficial attention to environmental



37
  Undated but probably conducted in the first two years.
38
  The Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-1) covered design of both the OP and AF, and appears to have been prepared while the
AF was awaiting effectiveness.



                                                                  21
compliance throughout the OL, (but much better performance under the AF); and (d) unrealistically
positive ratings for DO and IP during critical periods under the OL.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3 This rating seeks to balance performance against a series of complex factors and events, some of
which were entirely beyond the control of the Bank (or the Borrower). The project could be seen
informally as two separate operations, with a structural break occurring sometime in 2004 coinciding with
economic recovery, and making the difference between a low-achieving operation and one with many
successes. On balance, the rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 This rating reflects the following: (i) Government’s willingness to support an innovative and
complex operation designed to redress traditional exclusion of the poorest rural populations nation-wide;
(ii) support, despite political misgivings, for decentralized, demand-driven approaches, and for giving
provinces substantial latitude to develop their own strategies and programs for institutionalizing rural
development and poverty reduction; and (iii) Government’s endorsement of the proposed follow-on
project which scales up and enhances rural development approaches tested under PROINDER. However,
(a) the chaotic economic and political situation from 2000-2004 put PROINDER and the entire Bank
portfolio at risk -virtually paralyzing PROINDER for four years- and exposed, over time, certain
weaknesses in national and provincial government commitment to the project, even during the AF stage;
and (b) unusually protracted delay of 18 months in achieving effectiveness reversed the momentum
generated by the OL and reduced the number of investments financed by the AF.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2 This rating reflects the following: (i) SAGPyA, in the period 2000-2005, demonstrated bouts of
committed effort punctuated by sharp fluctuations in leadership, management quality, and progress,
mostly resulting from crisis-driven events beyond its control; (ii) these disruptions were balanced by the
continuity and professionalism of the project’s core technical and administrative teams;
(iii) PSA/SAGPyA, in charge of the FAIR, proved impermeable to political influence, maintaining a
strong technical posture and endowing PROINDER with an ethical profile in the provinces and field,39
(iv) given adequate time through extensions of the closing date to account for realities on the ground,
PSA/SAGPyA successfully implemented a decentralized and demand-driven rural investment program of
national scope, the first of its kind in Argentina, with excellent results and meeting a high proportion of
key targets; (v) SAGPyA also managed with mixed success but many important outcomes, an ambitious
and challenging program to bring the provinces to the table on rural development and poverty reduction.
However (a) efforts to establish organized project monitoring and data management had only modest
results; and (b) while SAGPyA oversaw the production of good quality evaluation studies, a Borrower
Completion Report was not prepared, hindering the Bank’s ICR.


39
    The MTR evaluation reported that PSA’s relative institutional “isolation? – more a question of self-sufficiency – worked against its
establishing strong relationships with provincial or municipal public agencies which may have in turn, influenced their engagement with the
project’s institutional goals for rural development and poverty reduction.



                                                                   22
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3 This rating balances the Borrower’s efforts -reflected in successful outcomes for critically
important activities representing well over 90% of total project cost- against its inability during a
historically difficult period to maintain a normal level of project activity resulting in an unusually
protracted implementation period. Even so, responsibility for maintaining the pace and quality of project
execution was a legally-binding obligation.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1     The following are among the more important lessons:

(a)      Use of the Additional Financing instrument, with its maximum 3-year period, in countries with
generic delays in loan effectiveness may need reconsideration. Even with a well-staffed coordinating
unit in place, and a pipeline of approved subprojects, an AF with no possibility of extension faces
difficulties maintaining the momentum established by the original project and achieving impact, more so
when delays curtail that period further. Such loans still need to traverse the same bureaucratic procedures
in-country as a regular SIL. A separate, follow-on operation, with preparation started early and with a
standard life-span, may be the better option.40

(b)     The logistical challenge and cost of providing effective oversight of projects with national
scope can be substantial. This may be non-controversial for country counterparts, since most
appropriate/candidate executing agencies in Argentina have the budget and the provincial
presence/representation to provide adequate oversight nationwide. However, Bank teams with standard
supervision allocations cannot match this coverage over such vast areas in the course of a normal five-
year project with two missions per year; and, to illustrate priority, PROINDER financing was less than 2
percent of the 1997 CAS (and the proposed new operation would be some 2.5 percent of the 2010-12
CPS). Experience suggests that more selective, regionally-focused projects could make better sense in
Argentina.

(c)      Mid-Term Reviews and Additional Financing should be used to address project design
weaknesses and ensure that M&E arrangements are adequate. M&E systems should be
designed/organized to permit management by results. Inadequacies in the initial design and organization
of the results framework and M&E arrangements can/should be corrected whether by the MTR or the AF
(if relevant). Revised or new PDOs and indicators should be calibrated to conditions on the ground and in
the case of an AF, a maximum three-year opportunity for measurement. Teams need to ensure that
evaluation studies and the MIS are building an information base consistent with the design
framework/indicators, by end-project. An independent physical performance study conducted around
mid-term is recommended for CDD operations, especially those with broad geographic coverage.41

(d)     Vulnerable populations require differentiated strategies and forms of “affirmative action? to
ensure access to project benefits. Depending on the particular cohort (women, indigenous people, rural
laborers, youth), a multi-pronged strategy should include consultative events, mobilization assistance,
special training, tailored implementation mechanisms and financing rules. Earmarking is needed to


40
    Bureaucratic delays affecting the signing and effectiveness of Additional Financing (or other) operations are common in other countries
including Brazil and noted in ICRs, and can cut the implementation time by 50% in the case of an AF.
41
   Such study would analyze inter alia, completion, quality, functionality, utilization, O&M practices and likely sustainability.



                                                                   23
stimulate action and this requires excellent diagnostics. Specific earmarks are included in the proposed
Socio-Economic Inclusion Project. The cost effectiveness of such targeted efforts calls for well-designed
mobilization and consultation activities which support a planned and efficient transition to active
investments and training.

(e)     Despite the likely procedural difficulties, mechanisms need to be developed for linking the
federal and provincial governments in Argentina on rural poverty reduction efforts and more
fundamentally, to engage provincial authorities and build their commitment. This inevitably means
more complex operations - including federal/provincial agreements - via activities which give the
provinces a major role in achieving project objectives, backed by appropriate financing which induces
them to accept the burden and implications of their commitment for the likely gain.

(f)      Greater coordination and cooperation between field teams and provincial and municipal
institutions and authorities can benefit efforts to develop decentralized rural policy and strategic
frameworks. Project design should anticipate integration of the two activity streams and include
mechanisms for creating synergies, disseminating information and building participatory networks which
promote direct interface between policy and field practitioners, and beneficiaries.

(g)      Market insertion should be seen as a process involving a logical sequence of first, second and
third level priority investments which position a small farmer to engage with markets. The goal should
be to launch a process which reduces informality and builds capacity including by equipping farmers with
a basic foundation of on-farm/productive infrastructure, yield-enhancing technological changes, and
organizational support which fosters joint activity.

(h)     Occasionally, the best attainable outcomes require allowing a project to become overage.
When it closed, PROINDER was the oldest project in the Region but became an emblematic example -
along with PROSAP (P006010) - of the potential gains from an overage project. Management’s flexibility
in approving repeated extensions of the closing date, combined with sound action plans and good
Borrower performance, enabled the project to materially affect the incomes and wellbeing of over 70,000
poor rural families. Cancellation would have reduced or prevented these impacts and limited the
knowledge gained from implementing Argentina’s first CDD operation and first focused effort to engage
provincial governments in rural poverty reduction.

6.1.2    In addition, evaluation of the Bank-supported PROEMER, and surveys of FAIR beneficiaries for
Crisol (2010), generated important lessons and recommendations which are summarized in Annexes 2
and 5.

million mainly from Component 1, and final expenditure of Loan funds was US$24.31 million with a total cost (of the Bank-
supported portion including GOA contribution) of US$30.31 million.

                                            Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A2.1 The OL was approved with three components and a fourth associated with Government’s Flood
Emergency Program was added soon after effectiveness; the AF reverted to the initial three components
as flood emergency activities were completed in 2000. Drawing on available/diverse sources, the
following summarizes the main achievements under individual components/sub-components:46

Component 1: Rural Investment

Overall rating: Satisfactory

A2.2 This component supported establishment and operation of a grants fund to channel financial and
technical assistance to poor rural communities for small-scale subprojects to improve economic
infrastructure and intensify and diversify productive activities for both subsistence and marketing.
Communities were required to provide at minimum, manual labor and some local materials, and the
working capital to operate and maintain the investments. In addition to subprojects, the component would
also finance equipment, technical assistance and training for beneficiaries, the component executing
agency (PSA) and for qualified intermediaries.

A2.3       Sub-component 1: Rural Investment Fund

Subprojects eligible for investments fell into several categories. Under the original loan these were:
Type A: household production/subsistence; Type B: market-oriented technology transfer; Type C:
community infrastructure; and Type D: marketing assistance. Grants were also available for pre-
investment activities. Under the AF, pre-investment and marketing assistance (Type D) were shifted from
individual subprojects to consultancies for evaluation and assistance on a territorial basis. Since the
component was subproject-oriented, these two types of assistance were offered under the Support
Services sub-component as technical assistance.

Results and context:

          An aggregate 94,147 (with repetition) and 70,527 (without repetition) families vs. aggregate goal
           of 52,000 (181% and 136% respectively) benefited from an aggregate 12,047 subprojects vs. the
           planned 12,000 (100%);
          The OL and AF exceeded their appraisal targets by 92% (57,603 vs. 30,000) and 66% (36,544 vs.
           22,000) respectively;
          Over 30,000 of the OL families were beneficiaries of the Flood Emergency component.
          Beneficiaries overwhelmingly conformed to the project targeting parameters/profile for eligibility
           (see Annex 5). Some 44% were below the indigence line (US$1.00/day), 48% had US$1.00 –
           US$3.00/day, and 8% over US$3.00/day). An average 66% of monetary income was going
           towards food.




46
  As noted in the Main Text, the Borrower did not prepare a Borrower Completion Report, imposing certain data limitations on preparation of the
ICR. Design of the project MIS, which had persistent difficulties with data organization, along with accelerated implementation of the AF due to
the short time available to disburse the Loan and the UNC’s consequent inability to keep up with data uploading in the MIS, may have
complicated final data retrieval by the UCN. Apart from numbers of subprojects and beneficiaries, most other data presented does not include the
AF.




                                                                      27
         The project financed an aggregate 12,047 subprojects, just over 100% of the aggregate target of
          12,000. Despite its shorter implementation period, the final tally shows the AF financing 3,037
          subprojects (102% of target).

         Close to 57% of all investments were for on-farm infrastructure, representing over 73% of total
          grant resources.
         Marketing subprojects represented just 0.24% of the total, and youth subprojects just 1.2%
         The designation of “youth? or “women? resulted from their head-count within a specific
          subproject, not that the subproject in question was designed specifically for either group, although
          there were some “tailored? subprojects.
         There was no clear pattern - either size of the province or level of poverty - explaining the
          distribution of subprojects: Chaco and Santiago del Estero financed more on-farm subprojects;
          Salta and Mendoza were provinces with a larger number of women as title-holder of subprojects;
          Misiones and Formosa had more marketing subprojects than other provinces, although numbers
          for this type were very low overall (0.67%).
         Subproject grants varied based on the type of subproject but the average overall grant amount was
          AR$3,500 or US$854 per family.
         About 50% of grants under the Additional Financing were to supplement expansion of
          subprojects financed under the original project. The overall repetition rate was 25% and 65%
          within the AF alone.

  PPM=minifundista; TTA=temporary/itinerant laborer. Clearly, these data overlap. Youth, women and indigenous peoples
could also be classified under PPM and TTA.

       Under the OL and AF, women represented 39.6% and 35% respectively, youth 15.4% and 10%
        respectively, and indigenous people 10% and 12% respectively.
       Women represented 39.6% of all families benefited (i.e., female-headed households), got 14.91%
        of total subprojects under the OL, but just 5.41% of total grant financing.
       Minifundistas (poor, small-scale farmers) represented 78.3% of beneficiaries and temporary
        laborers 20.3%
       Young families were 15.4% of total families benefited.
       These data obviously overlap, i.e., female, young and IP farmers are also classified as
        minifundistas

    Issues affecting the FAIR subprojects:

       Subprojects tended not to be “anchored? in a local RD strategy;
       Insufficient technical support albeit a very strong effort by field technicians to work continuously
        with beneficiaries to improve their productive performance over time.
       Sustainability was a concern – investments needed the conditions to consolidate rapidly and to
        gain market insertion where feasible;
       There was no marketing strategy;
       A more strategic approach was needed linking the FAIR with the institution-strengthening
        activities under Component 2;
       Technicians were very committed but rotation rates were high, and technical skills variable and
        not always appropriate for particular subprojects;
       Technicians needed to be part of groups to exchange experiences and knowledge; and
       There was a need for much greater coordination between executors of the components and
        provincial authorities.
       Other issues included the need for a “holistic? review of subprojects at the territorial level,
        providing integrated marketing assistance to a group of subprojects as opposed to individual, and
        the urgent need to form and foster producers’ organizations to support more sophisticated
        activities in a more formalized manner.
       The Additional Financing attempted to initiate such improvements but the proposed Socio-
        economic Inclusion Project is more realistically the appropriate forum for addressing these issues
        at scale.

A2.4    Sub-component 2: Support Services

This sub-component included: (i) training of staff, intermediaries and beneficiaries; (ii) establishment of
a marketing information system; and, (iii) implementation of the beneficiary participation and indigenous
peoples’ action plans.

Results and context:

       Training focused on targeted communities, private and public sector providers of technical
        assistance and PSA staff. Menus of courses were offered to different audiences, and courses were
        programmed through a demand-driven approach where relevant.




                                                    29
          SAGPyA, PSA, INTA 49 and DDA and other entities directly involved in project
           execution/coordination participated in a large number of courses, seminars, workshops and
           training opportunities, including offshore higher-level degrees.
          Provincial government staff, technical specialists and others linked to the project’s rural
           development strategy formulation objectives received specialized training under the project-
           funded provincial technical assistance “projects? designed and presented for approval to
           SAGPyA.
          Beneficiaries, their leaders, representative civil society organizations and field technicians
           supporting beneficiaries received training through several thousand training events over the full
           course of the 13-year project.
          The market information system was to be installed in each province to provide on-line
           information on prices in local, regional and national markets; describe product demand
           characteristics (varieties, grading and packaging). There is no evidence that it was ever
           implemented, at least not as envisaged at appraisal.
          The Participation Action Plan was implemented as envisaged – the project was highly
           participatory and training events reinforced this ethic and associated practices. It was used to
           strengthen the integration of stakeholders – beneficiaries, NGOs and local government – in all
           phases of project implementation. Stakeholders participated- to the extent possible - in policy and
           decision-making councils at the local, provincial, regional and national levels, albeit with
           variations depending on the locality, province, and period. The plan was also periodically revised
           and improved. Intermediaries supporting rural investment activities included NGOs, local and
           national government agencies, universities and independent contractors, trained in relevant
           subjects to provide a minimum skills mix to assist beneficiaries.
          The Indigenous Peoples’ Strategy was implemented successfully. It ensured the informed
           participation of IP through special dissemination mechanisms, TA and training, and subproject
           evaluation criteria. In the case of the provinces of Salta and Formosa, indigenous representatives
           participated on the UPs (Provincial Coordinating Units of PSA). Numerous, culturally
           appropriate forums were provided for consultation, awareness-building, and subproject-related
           skills for indigenous groups. As concluded by several studies, PROINDER was a successful
           experience in fostering IP participation including direct investments.

A2.5       Sub-component 3: Management of Rural Investment Fund

This sub-component financed short-term consultants, equipment, and selected recurrent costs for PSA
staff to support implementation of the FAIR. Consultancies were to consist of specialized professional
services such as installation and maintenance of the MIS in each province, support for technical and
marketing assistance, environmental screening and various training events. Nine pilot ULs (Local Units)
were to be established and supported with TA and equipment.

Results and context:

       Short-term consultancies, equipment and certain recurrent costs associated with FAIR execution
        were financed;
       Specialized consultancies associated with provincial MIS installation were curtailed during the
        economic crisis and modest thereafter;
       Nine Local Units were established and received appropriate TA and equipment.


Component 2: Strengthening Rural Development Policy

A2.6 This component sought to improve rural development policy and program formulation and
analysis at the national and provincial levels by financing technical assistance, training and studies to
improve the capacity of governmental and non-governmental agencies to conduct policy formulation and
program design directed at rural poverty reduction. These activities were intended to help provinces
establish the preconditions for decentralized rural development. Activities were to be coordinated and
executed by DPD within SAGPyA. The Rural Development Council (CDR) would be established in

A2.7 Sub-component 1: National Strategy Development: Included studies, surveys, and a rural
development database in DPD to support SAGPyA’s policy formulation and program preparation and
evaluation.

Results and context:

A set of indicators was developed (Crisol 2010) using the Baseline Evaluation (SAFPyA 2002) to
measure achievement under this sub-component:

           The sub-component achieved the Design Framework target of putting into effect a Rural
            Development Database.
           Indicators suggest that the sub-component significantly improved values which in the diagnoses
            were weak or in deficit and maintained/improved those which were already at good levels.
            However, not all the developments listed in the above table can be attributed directly to the sub-
            component; complex and broader political processes contributed.
           The theme of rural development was successfully inserted in the public policy agenda,
            contributing to profound institutional changes such as creation of the Sub-secretariat for Family
            Agriculture under the Rural Development Secretariat.
           Implementation of the National Register of Family Agriculture was another important
            modification which positioned the small-scale farm sector as potential beneficiaries of the
            national RD strategy.

          Databases provided a map of advances made in programs and projects dependent on the Rural
           Development Council and mapped beneficiaries of all existing RD programs.
          In regard to the 23 rural development studies, diffusion activities encompassed national, civil
           society, university/academia and international targets. Subjects such as land and territory, rural
           employment and technology received especially wide exposure including online. As noted in the
           main text, the publication “Small farmers in the Republic of Argentina? (Obschatko, 2007)
           received exceptional coverage including international, as did the document “Women who work
           the Land? (Biaggi, Canaveri, Tasso, 2007).
          Under the Additional Financing, new studies were prepared under this sub-component: rural
           household surveys on living conditions and production; experiences in rural development in
           Santiago del Estero province; and a proposal for periodicals on the national and provincial
           situation within which the rural development and family agriculture strategy are developed.
           Other studies initiated under the AF are also being completed.

A2.8 Sub-component 2: Provincial Strategy Development: Included demand-driven technical
assistance and equipment for participating provinces to improve rural poverty analysis and increase their
capacity to manage RD activities. Primary outputs were to be RD strategy documents to support the
design and implementation of provincial and national-funded and administered RD activities in the
provinces.

Results and context:

      Most of the above provinces made significant improvements inserting RD into their policy and
       institutional frameworks;
      The Design Framework called for 16 technical provincial assistance projects on rural
       development. This target was reached and exceeded with the development of 19 such projects
       (118%);
      Of the 19 provinces which linked to PROINDER OL, 15 provinces have today special RD areas
       (dedicated to the concerns of small farmers) with distinct levels of institutionalization.
      7 provinces have RD areas which function at the level of Provincial Director or similar.
      6 provinces have ADRs (RD Areas), and two have RD institutes.
      13 provinces prepared an RD Strategy Document and 9 provinces have used this document as the
       basis for designing new programs; another 7 provinces designed RD Strategies under the AF;
      Other recent changes in national policy have strengthened the institutional situation for rural
       development: (i) relevance which INTA is giving to small-scale agriculture through the creation
       of the Center for Research on Family Agriculture (CIPAF); (ii) incorporation in the Rural
       Development Council of provincial government representatives; and (iii) new treatment of RD on

        the part of the Federal Agro-livestock Council comprising the Ministry and highest sector
        authorities.
       Even when organizational capacities of many institutions are weak, they have still gained greater
        visibility on the question of small farmers and the rural space, and the levels of organization and
        mobilization of beneficiary groups.
       Creation of the National Family Agriculture Forum as an opportunity for dialogue between the
        Ministry and organizations of family farmers, and the subsequent formation of provincial
        branches of this organization.

A2.9 Sub-component 3: Training: National, provincial and municipal government staff, NGOs,
beneficiary organizations and other providers of RD services would receive training in priority strategic
areas: policy and project formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation methodologies.

Results and context:

Among a long list of potential deficits which would benefit from training, the greatest demand has been:
methodologies for on-land interventions, rural administration and development; marketing and
formulation, and monitoring and evaluation of projects. Among the activities conducted:

       Organization and diffusion of sub-component activities;
       Training for provincial functionaries in concepts of rural development and formulation
        methodologies, evaluation and monitoring of RD strategies and of specific programs and projects
       Promotion and awareness-building on gender, rural youth and indigenous peoples;
       28 training events for provincial RD functionaries enabling the formation of human capital and
        participation of the provinces in the operational changes occurring in RD;
       47 workshops for training and awareness-building on vulnerable groups for technicians and
        beneficiaries which have succeeded in creating consciousness concerning equity in the rural
        domain;
       Design Framework targets were greatly exceeded: the target was 56 for courses to functionaries,
        provincial entities and technicians, the project achieved 106 (190%).

A2.10 Sub-component 4: Appropriate Technology Development and Dissemination: Studies to
catalog information on existing appropriate technology and identify needs for poor, rural communities,
and provide competitive research grants to finance development of appropriate technology packages in
priority areas.

Results and context:

The following results are based on indicators prepared for the Final Evaluation (Crisol 2010):

Indicator: Dissemination of technologies available for small farmers:

       Adequate progress was made. Two catalogues were published on the Supply of Appropriate
        Technologies for small farmers and available for training technicians and producers
       5 videos prepared for diffusion of these technologies
       8 dissemination workshops designed for researchers, field technicians, provincial RD officials, as
        well as farmers linked directly and indirectly to this adaptive research;




                                                    36
Indicator: Degree of coverage of existing technology demands

       High level of progress made. Review of supply and demand of technologies for small farmers
        permitted unsatisfied demands to be introduced which provided the impulse for the lines of
        research actually conducted.

Indicator: Experiences in the adaptation of technologies

      39 adaptive research projects (of 40 targeted by the OL) were financed in the provinces of Salta,
       Jujuy, Catamarca, Formosa, Misiones, Chaco, Cordoba, Tucuman, Corrientes, Santa Fe, Rio
       Negro, Santiago del Estero and Neuquen;
     17 new adaptive technology projects were implemented by the AF (universities, NGOs and
       INTA);
     Research subjects included fruit and grains diversification for food security; reconversion of
       cotton, sugar and tobacco farmers; alternative energy; post-harvest processing; agro-ecological
       adaptation of cattle production; native forests; and, other productive problems of small farmers.
      The two catalogues of project-financed technologies have been widely disseminated online, by
        libraries linked to PROINDER, on 60 different websites.
      This sub-component resulted in much greater visibility for institutions and organizations working
        in such research themes.

Crisol (2011) reported certain critiques offered by technicians interviewed:

       Lack of participation by field technicians in defining technologies for small farmers;
       Need for permanent research on the small farmer theme;
       Importance of monitoring the use and impact of the technologies;
       Use and dissemination of videos and other materials needs to be intensified to ensure that they
        are available for technicians’ work in the field with farmers.

Component 4: Flood Emergency

A2.15 This component was added post-effectiveness in response to Government’s appeal for assistance
in confronting a flood emergency in four provinces exceptionally poor provinces – Chaco, Misiones,
Corrientes and Formosa – as well as the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios. It was intended to finance
a program of production-related assistance for poor farmers to recover approximately 1.0 million hectares
of crop and pasture land in areas declared in emergency or disaster as a result of the 1998 El Nino
flooding. The program was to operate until mid-1999 and was jointly-financed by the Bank (40%), IADB
(40% using funds from the Bank-supported PROSAP (P006010) and national Government (20%).

A2.16 Activities to be financed were production grants and technical assistance, consistent with
activities to be supported by the original project under the FAIR. About 95% of Bank financing would be
transferred to an estimated 40,000 beneficiary families as grants for the purchase of production inputs and
rehabilitation of productive infrastructure destroyed by floods. Up to 5% of the funds were intended for
the contracting of TA to assist eligible producers to prepare a productive recovery plan and to conduct ex-
post monitoring of the use of the funds. Beneficiary screening procedures were to be the same as the
original project with the exception that about 30% of beneficiaries represented households with larger
holdings of productive assets, impoverished by effects of the flood. The primary difference from the
original project was a special operational mechanism for more rapid screening, review and approval of
proposed subprojects.       Financial assistance was as follows: US$75 to US$100/ha or up to
US$7,500/family which had lost over 80% of productive assets. An operational manual governed
processing.53

   The PROEMER was regarded as highly risky due to the risk of transfers to unqualified beneficiaries and the use of transferred
funds for purposes other than those agreed. These risks were exacerbated by the scale of the emergency program, its reliance on

Results of the PROEMER Component:

The PROEMER experience was evaluated in two parts: Santiago del Estero and Corrientes (Karasik
2000) 54 and Santa Fe and Misiones (Vuotto 2000). 55 The principal results and recommendations are
summarized below. Both segments used PROEMER documentation along with semi-structured
interviews with beneficiaries, civil society groups and local authorities, and the program database.
Neither study focused closely on the practical use of the emergency grant funds but they both conclude
that a high proportion of beneficiaries, varying sharply between provinces, did not use their grant to
execute their Productive Recovery Plan.

Santiago del Estero and Corrientes: Karasik (2000)

         Coordination was effective. In Santiago del Estero and Corrientes, the program was coordinated
          by PSA/PROINDER (executing agency for the FAIR) and special technical assistance teams
          assembled in each province. Two local institutions were critical: the Local Emergency
          Committees and the Provincial Executing Units (UEP).

         Flood conditions varied. In Corrientes, the floods covered virtually the entire province, while in
          Santiago del Estero, the impact was more localized but with an equally grave impact on farmers.
          The program planned to finance 14,000 beneficiaries in Corrientes with a budget of US$15.0
          million but financed 13,734; and, Santiago del Estero (SdE) had a budget of US$10.0 million, but
          entered the program late and financed only 1,058 beneficiaries.

         Design and actual implementation differed substantially. Government’s concept was for a
          flexible, inter-sector intervention with potentially a participatory element. In practice, this design
          took different forms depending on the strength and relative flexibility of the provincial public
          sector agencies, the administrative and socio-territorial structure, political style, characteristics of
          civil society organizations, and levels of organization and autonomy of producer organizations.

         There were limitations and differences between provinces: (i) In Santiago del Estero, local
          government structures of the period lacked autonomy in relation to the provincial government
          probably due to its socio-territorial structure, very concentrated in certain zones and at the center.
          Centralized government interventions were the norm; (ii) In Corrientes, the structure was focused
          more on the social sectors and was more functionally diverse with its Service for Farmer Support,
          and thus more efficient in dealing with small farmers. In both provinces, space was opening up to
          link to national programs focused on lines of attention quite different to those of the provinces,
          e.g., PSA/PROINDER.




fast-disbursing financial transfer mechanism to individuals and the coincidence of the program with the beginning of a major
electoral period. Risk minimization measures were strengthened including through visits by technicians, external supervision and
social control at the local level, but their effectiveness was limited by the capacity of provincial execution units to contract and
supervise a large number of technicians in a limited time period and to supervise the operation of the local committees. However,
the short-term nature of the program and small amounts of the transfers limited the scope of sanctions in cases where funds were
not utilized as agreed.

    Proyecto de Recuperación de la Capacidad Productiva de los Pequeños Productores Agropecuarios Afectados por las
Inundaciones en el Noreste Argentino (PROEMER); Evaluación Final, Mirta Vuotto, 2000. This study covers the provinces of
Santa Fe and Misiones.


                                                                39
      PROEMER was rated Highly Satisfactory for complying with its eligibility standards. In
       Corrientes, 94% of beneficiaries met program eligibility standards in the Operational Manual.
       Even in Santiago del Estero, where most of the deviation was found, 87% of beneficiaries
       conformed. Most deviation was due to misunderstanding the targeting rules in certain localities
       and on some occasions by implementing bodies. There was also disagreement in some locales
       about what constituted a minifundista. In Corrientes, there was no mistaken interpretation of
       targeting, only some discussions about the “upper limit? of that cohort.

      Technical assistance was limited to preparation of Productive Recovery Plans for farmers and
       help with preparing farmers’ requests for financial assistance. In addition to ex-ante evaluations,
       technicians did monitoring and verification and were generally well-rated.

Implementation:

      Disbursement procedures were a hindrance. The most critical aspect (and most criticized) was a
       procedure common to all international loans: the release of funds against SOEs for
       work/expenditures already done. This generated interruptions in the flow of funds to
       beneficiaries which, in an emergency situation, were quite damaging. Due to the much larger
       number of beneficiaries in Corrientes, the number of such financial transactions/processes was
       much higher. Banco Nación, the financial agent for the Bank loan funds, could not keep pace. In
       terms of payment to beneficiaries, in both provinces, there was uneven circulation of information,
       not due to the Bank or the UEP but to other sources. In some affected areas, beneficiaries had to
       wait a long time for their funds.

      Social and civil society organizations and farmer organizations were much more common on the
       ground in Corrientes. In Santiago del Estero, civil society organizations encountered difficulties
       and some exclusion from the process. In Corrientes, farmer organizations were relatively strong
       with wide reach. Also, NGOs were present in rural areas and able to give beneficiaries more
       representation within the program, and to open up more space for their participation.

      Representation and participation in Corrientes was good in the UEP but uneven in the LECs
       which were described as more politicized. Overall, the experiences of working jointly in this
       emergency eliminated some of the mistrust and lack of confidence among stakeholders. Farmers
       said there were too many actors involved and at times they outweighed the flood victims. Public
       and private support institutions in both provinces did not have much confidence in the political
       precedence assigned to the LECs.

      Impact of this financial support was rated very positively by beneficiaries. It represented the
       possibility of responding to very basic challenges: payment of debts for storage/other; health
       costs; repair of homes damaged by water, purchase of seeds and fencing materials. Farmers said
       that those who did not receive PROEMER support in many cases were forced to migrate to find
       income.

      Use of the funds differed from expectation. In many cases, farmers were able to carry out their
       Productive Recovery Plans or invest in their land, but in ways different to what was envisaged.
       For example, farmers shifted to lower cost/ha crops or crops with a more secure market price
       (from cotton to maize, for example), financed wire fences, and repaired sheds and machinery.
       Considering the emergency situation and the lapsed time between a request for assistance and the
       payment, these changes did not negate the impact of the Program unless the beneficiary was not
       eligible.



                                                  40
Recommendations:

       In emergency programs for small farmers, a targeting framework needs to be firmly established
        explicitly avoiding ambiguity in its design and characteristics. The small farmer sector is very
        weak and needs to be firmly defended via watertight procedures/rules and requirements for
        program management.
       Information dissemination should be maximized as a central component in relations across
        involved sectors.
       The program’s management structure, in UEPs and LECs was designed very well and has a high
        potential for the management of many programs with local impact. Their success lies in their
        representation of all relevant actors and their diverse opinions. However, the relative “weight? of
        participants in this discussion needs to be considered since this can be eroded within a forum
        which has too many players.
       More agile strategies are needed for the delivery of funds from international organizations,
        avoiding if possible, the disbursement-SOE-disbursement pattern which cannot guarantee a
        smooth flow of funds, a negative factor in an emergency situation.

Santa Fe and Misiones (Vuotto 2000):

PROEMER resources were intended to be used exclusively to replace capital assets and working capital
but not labor costs involved in these activities as they were treated as the beneficiaries’ counterpart
contribution.

Specifically, the funds could be used for: repair of on-farm items such as sheds, fences and other
installations; acquisition of agricultural and livestock inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, seedlings, and
veterinary products); replacement of agricultural tools and equipment; and, technical assistance especially
for indigenous groups and other marginalized/vulnerable populations, to prepare for application to benefit
from the program and to verify the use of the funds.

The program was executed and implemented by SAGPyA through the PROINDER National
Coordination Unit, and at the provincial level by the Provincial Executing Units (UEP) and at the base,
the Local Emergency Committees. An agreement was signed with each participating province and with
the banks acting as financial agents.

National authorities described the main problems encountered with each of the four participating
provinces financed by PROINDER as the following: (i) in Santa Fe, complete lack of organizations
representing small farmers and difficulties generating the participation of NGOs; (ii) in Santiago del
Estero, political problems saw the organization of small farmers (MOCASE) refused participation in the
UEP; (iii) in Misiones, there was strong interest in participation by organizations representing small
farmers especially tobacco growers and INTA representatives; and, (iv) in Corrientes, the UEP rapidly
adapted to the situation with wide sector representation.

At the provincial and local level, the following issues arose: (i) grossly insufficient number of field
technicians to control the pre-requisites for beneficiary eligibility and to conduct visits to their farms; (ii)
despite program rules that technicians were not to expect any payment from beneficiaries, in some cases
this was not observed; (iii) similarly, contracted technical agents were meant to be paid fixed/pre-
established honorariums for visits to farms but in some cases the amounts were determined by provincial
coordinators.




                                                      41
Beneficiaries had to conform to a series of eligibility criteria, could not present more than one request for
assistance, had to commit to implementing a Productive Recovery Plan and accept SAGPyA monitoring
of the execution of those plans and use of the resources.

Indigenous groups who traditionally used community production could be PROEMER beneficiaries and
had to present a special request prepared with technical assistance for submission to the UNC before the
LEC and UEP.

Deviations from eligibility standards reached 5% except in Santiago del Estero where they reached 13%.
The highest deviation from the Productive Recovery Plans was in Misiones (70%). The main motive
expressed was that the funds were needed for basic necessities (food, health etc).

According to Vuotto (2002), total beneficiaries in these four provinces reached 39,397 with the largest
concentration in Misiones. Average property size attended was 30 ha.

Implementation in Santa Fe was affected by the following: (i) never having developed extension services
for small farmers, Santa Fe had serious problems finding enough qualified technicians; (ii) numerous
legal and other problems arose in certifying beneficiaries; (iii) the provincial government’s lack of
knowledge about regional problems was reflected in the absence of registers and other indicators
permitting the identification of farmers in distinct areas; (iv) farmers were reluctant to come forward due
to fears that personal information given to authorities would be used after the emergency; (v) PSA
personnel complained that their normal technical assistance role was converted by PROEMER into a
financial assistance role; (vi) late arrival in the province of the PROEMER operational manual meant
verifications were conducted after the program had started; (vii) however, community participation
changed the general mentality in regard to the use of the resources and who was best able to evaluate the
program - the beneficiaries; (viii) the governance rules, social controls and new, participatory approaches
permitted the UEP to affirm that 90% of the grants were dispensed correctly.

Implementation in Misiones was characterized by the following: (i) the UEP decided to allocate a
uniform amount of US$450 to each farmer - US$250 for productive recovery and US$200 for food
support; (ii) while there were, overall, adequate technicians to prepare requests, certain areas lacked
adequate personnel and agreements were made – to save time – with private tobacco companies to
complete requests. Their agents certified losses in tobacco crops only, leaving 1000 farmers in one area
unable to access benefits and requiring ministerial intervention; (iii) procedures were intensely
bureaucratic and expensive; (iv) public sector technicians went for protracted periods without
remuneration and were under great pressure, attending thousands of farmers; (v) the emergency prompted
renewed calls for crop insurance and revisions of relevant emergency laws; (vi) targeting was assessed as
generally accurate; (vii) difficulties in evaluating productive losses especially when only part of a
property was under crops, and special issues evaluating losses in horticulture; (viii) importance of
accurate information disseminated widely to avoid misunderstanding including withdrawal by farmers
with otherwise valid eligibility for assistance.


Recommendations:

National level:

       Availability of sufficient material and human resources to guarantee the program’s autonomous
        management, without relying on the resources of other programs;
       Include resources including technical, to permit the monitoring and evaluation of results;
       Consider systematic oversight by the central executing body of provincial and local activities;


                                                     42
       Implement mechanisms permitting the updating of databases prepared under PROEMER;
       For emergency programs with international financing, find more agile mechanisms for
        disbursement of funds so that the assistance can arrive rapidly;
       Include bank control mechanisms on payments;
       Prepare a simplified set of guidelines on the program for local distribution;
       Adapt farmer eligibility criteria to local realities;
       Rapidly evaluate farmers situations and assign timely and adequate resources, avoiding fixed
        amounts;
       Disseminate the existence of alternative financing sources for small farmers.

Provincial and local levels:

       Improve communication systems so that the target public can access information about the
        program;
       Use LECs at the local level to implement programs but prioritize technical membership and
        farmer organizations rather than political interests;
       Availability and commitment of technical and administrative personnel to participate;
       When constituting LEC membership, ensure that the invitation to participate is inclusive and
        open;
       Provide additional monitoring services in the hardest hit areas;
       Implement self-regulating systems for beneficiaries in regard to the assignment and utilization of
        the funds;
       Devise mechanisms allowing small farmers to collaborate on community purchasing of inputs;
       Promote the formation of technical teams knowledgeable about farmers’ realities in each region;
       Put limits on LEC membership to improve the LEC/beneficiary ratio;
       Maintain local registers updated with information on small farmers, avoiding in case of
        emergencies the presentation of certificates which cannot be verified.

Lessons learned:

       The plurality of social representation in local decision-making forums acts as a guarantee for the
        dissemination of the program and assignment/allocation of funds;
       Similarly, wide participation of social members in decision-making forums guarantees the
        transparency of the program;
       The general consensus is that PROEMER funds reached their intended beneficiaries;
       The grant enabled farmers to take advantage of the new crop cycle, which they would not have
        been able to do without the grant.

                                   Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A3.1 The general objective of the following analysis conducted by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, 2011) was to estimate the economic impact of the two stages of PROINDER. To
estimate the economic impact on productive farm models of beneficiary families which could be
attributed to the project, the beneficiary population was compared to a similar population group used as a
control. To obtain the needed information on the characteristics, behavior and indicators of the population
                                                                                                    56
examined, the analysis used an impact evaluation of the first stage project conducted by CRISOL. This
study used data through December 31, 2010 and was based on a sample of 377 families divided among
one province from each national region attended by the project. The provinces surveyed were: Salta,
Chaco, San Juan, Córdoba and Chubut.

A3.2 Families surveyed included those which had received Project support in the first stage of
PROINDER but also included a portion which had benefited under the Additional Financing. The cut-off
date was December 31, 2011; investments made by the AF commenced in the first six months of 2009.
From the questionnaires and the database of field results, complete and satisfactory information was
collected on 268 of the 377 beneficiary families which became the sample for this analysis inter alia,
because they included on-farm investments with productive objectives. This data was crossed with
another database provided by the Project’s UNC, which provided identification of beneficiaries of the
first phase and, for beneficiaries of the second phase, details on the type of support (on-farm, emergency,
habitat, and community) received.

A3.3 Baseline: During Project implementation, baseline information was routinely collected for each
subproject prior to its implementation, specifically for use in ex-post evaluation and to construct the
without-project situation. The following table (Crisol 2010 database) shows land use under the without-
project situation. It is clear that extensive livestock is very important and the assignment of land to
pastures. Goats and sheep to a lesser extent are the most important activity principally in Patagonia.
Cattle are important for small farmers in Córdoba and Chubut. Irrigated agriculture is principally in Cuyo
and Patagonia. Main irrigated crops grown by small farmers are onion, tomato and peppers. Maize,
pumpkin, potato and alfalfa are also common both in irrigated areas and as rainfed crops, depending on
the location. With the exception of cotton, yields tend to be very low – about half their average potential
due to the technology used in Argentina. See table A3.3.1.

A3.6 In general, production for family consumption is about half of the production sold in the market,
although in north-east Argentina (NEA) the relationship is even greater, while in Cordoba and Cuyo it is
significantly lower, not reaching 20% in the second instance. Non-agricultural income is very important
as a whole, due to their representing about 60% of total value of production sold in markets. On average,
the two extremes are San Juan (Cuyo), with the highest ratio of off-farm income compared to farm
income, and Salta in north-west Argentina (NOA) with only 50% of gross monetary income generated
off-farm.

A3.6 Beneficiary numbers: Total estimated number of beneficiaries attended by both stages of the
project in on-farm subproject investments (including emergency and habitat) and community investments
was 70,527. Under the first stage, 57,603 families were supported and under the Additional Financing
36,544 of which 23,620 had already benefited under the first stage. Thus, the number of new
beneficiaries under the Additional Financing was 12,924. Based on the Crisol sample of 268 families, it
was estimated that the repetition factor was about 41%. The 23,620 families who benefited under both
stages can be characterized as follows: (i) 11,920 who received on-farm productive support under the
original project and community support under the AF; and (ii) 11,700 who received on-farm support
under the first stage and emergency, subsistence and/or habitat support under the AF to compensate for

the low or negative results obtained under the first stage for climatic and other reasons. Looked at by
stage, the following is evident:

        First stage project: Of the 57,603 beneficiaries, 45,903 received benefits from on-farm
         productive investments. The remaining beneficiaries got no benefit whatsoever, because for
         climatic or other reasons, they could not capitalize on or derive income from the support received.
        Additional Financing: Of the total 36,544 beneficiaries, 11,920 received incremental benefits
         from on-farm productive support and community support. The remaining 24,624 beneficiaries
         derived benefits from on-farm productive investments.

A3.7 Methodology for economic impact evaluation: Considering that the evaluation sought to
estimate the project’s impact on family incomes, and an analysis of support provided to community
subprojects under the second stage, the sample of 268 families was divided into two groups:

        Group 1: Beneficiaries who received support for on-farm productive investments under the first
         stage, and then received specific support for community investment under the AF; and,
        Group 2: Beneficiaries who received support under the first stage for on-farm productive
         subprojects which were successful, as well as those who received support under the first stage for
         the same types of investments but had to get additional support under the AF for emergency,
         habitat or subsistence to finally achieve the expected results.

A3.8 The estimate of impact used two methodological tools. On the one hand, the quantitative
methodology of reflexive comparisons under which a basic or reference survey is done of participants
before the intervention and then another follow-up survey to measure changes in indicators or the before
and after intervention effects. On the other hand, a complementary cost-benefit analysis using sample
data to construct farm models and obtain rates of return for both stages of the project. The former
methodology has been used to evaluate many programs and projects financed by international
organizations. Reference manuals such as that of Judy Baker (World Bank 2000) were used. For the
cost-benefit analysis, and construction of farm models and projections, the FARMOD program was used
(developed by the World Bank and FAO). Results are as follows.

Cost-benefit analysis using FARMOD

A3.12 The economic and financial viability of each of the project’s two stages, and in aggregate, was
determined by applying a cost-benefit analysis of the flow of discounted funds, using FARMOD. The
discount rate adopted was 12% annual, reflecting the opportunity cost of capital in Argentina and the
lapse of time taken into account to make the projections concerning the flow of funds discounted over 20
years.

A3.13 The financial analysis was done to determine if the small farmer families - who work the farm
models whose results are projected by this analysis – will obtain the financial benefits justifying their
adherence to and participation in the project. The economic analysis was performed in order to know the
profitability of the project as a whole and is focused on the point of view of its general interest or to the
national economy.

A3.14 Note that the basic benchmarks adopted to do the cost-benefit analysis are those described above
in para. A3.6.

A3.15 Farm Models: Data contained in the Crisol database permits the definition of 12 Farm Models
selected as representative of the farms of the total 70,527 small farm families benefited by the project

which exist within the project area, but they do represent the majority of cases and are used as examples
of the most common typologies. The table below provides a summary of the cropping patterns and/or
livestock exploitation of each one of the 12 models.

A3.16 Production models: Since the Crisol database did not permit the development of spreadsheets
for yields, incomes and costs of production per hectare cultivated and/or livestock cultivation modules
developed by each farm family, as represented in the 12 Farm Models selected, provincial regional
authorities involved in the Project were asked to provide this information for the FAO team. On the basis
of this information, 14 models of irrigated and rain-fed agriculture and the 8 models of livestock farms
presented above were defined as representing the situation with and without the Project. The production
models selected are the most important but are not the only models existing in the Project area. That is,
the models have been selected as representative of each one of the groups of crops and livestock
exploitation systems practiced/used in the Project area. In addition to these additional sources of data
mentioned, the analysis also used statistics designed to fill certain weaknesses existing in the information
obtained from the database and in the spreadsheets provided by the provinces. The most relevant sources
were: “technology and Small-scale Agro-Livestock Production in Argentina? published by PROINDER
in 2009 and the production models prepared by Adrian Zappi of PROSAP (P006010) (Bank-supported
Provincial Agricultural Development Project) to assist preparation of PROINDER II.

The execution period of the 1st stage of the Project (OL) was from 2000-2007, and the 2nd stage (AF)
from 2009-2011.
A3.18 Prices: The analysis is expressed in constant 2011 prices. Financial prices of products sold by
farmers represent values, without IVA, which these receive in the market for product “puesto en finca?.
Shadow prices of products were not calculated for the economic analysis. Amounts for Costs of
Production, On-farm Investments, Project Subsidies (grants) and Project Costs, contain IVA and thus the
economic and financial conversion co-efficient is 0.80. Shadow prices for inputs and services were not
calculated. The costs of family labor were not considered in the financial analysis, but if taken into
account for the economic evaluation, are valued at the market price. Similarly, the value of self-
consumption was considered as income in both the financial and economic analysis.
A3.19 Costs of project investment considered in the analysis: In the analysis of financial results of
farm models, only the costs of on-farm investments using project subsidies/grants were considered. In the
economic evaluation, the economic costs of all project components are imputed as follows: Project costs,
in Pesos per year, were obtained by multiplying the annual amounts disbursed - as indicated by the project
MIS – by an exchange rate of AR$ 4.10/USD.

A3.20 Financial profitability of farm models: It should be noted that the financial budgets of farm
models did not consider family labor used as a component of production cost. But, the costs of on-farm
project investments as well as the amount of the project subsidy in these costs were included. The table
below compares results for the farm models in the with-project situation after 5 years, with results
obtained by the same models in year 5 without the project. Such comparison shows the total impact on
net incomes of the economic units analyzed, as a consequence of productive changes derived from project
activities and investments.

A3.21 As can be seen, the first stage of the project saw important increases in the incomes of 45,903
families benefited with successful individual subprojects. Increases in annual incomes were growing
annually, and reached at full project development, values ranging from AR$ 2,100 (US$510) to
AR$ 13,380 (US$3,260). The annual increase in incomes of these 45,903 families fluctuated between
21.1% and 47%. It should be remembered that the 11,700 remaining farmers had no benefit whatsoever
whether due to climatic events or other reasons, and were unable to capitalize or generate income from
the support received.

A3.22 Project physical aggregates: Aggregate data from FARMOD show the quantitative increases in
each of the two major product groups comprising family production:

A3.23 The first stage of the Project also generated an annual increase in family labor dedicated to
productive activities of around 1.9 million man-days (jornales) (18.0 million vs. 16.1 million). This
incremental demand for labor generated by the Project signifies a reduction in rural unemployment of
about 7,560 people, considering the availability of 250 man-days per year per person.

A3.24 Area cultivated stays at around 348,248 has indicating that it was estimated, somewhat
conservatively, that the first stage of the Project would not generate an increase in area dedicated to
agricultural crops.

A3.25 Monetary aggregates resulting from the project: In the following table, we compare financial
results as a whole in Year 12 of the with-project situation, with those obtained in Year 12 without the
project. This gives the total impact on gross value and costs of production (without taking into account
costs of family labor) and on net incomes from the project as a consequence of productive changes
derived from the works and activities executed under the first stage. Due to the results obtained, the net
income or average financial “return? per day worked by family labor was AR$103.5 in the without-
project situation and AR$111.8 in the with-project situation.

(b) Second stage (Additional Financing):

A3.27 Financial profitability of Farm Models: It should be noted that the financial budgets of the
Farm Models have not taken into account family labor used, as a component of production cost. The
costs of on-farm investments by the project and the amount of the project subsidy in these investments are
taken into account.

A3.28 The following two tables compare the results of the family Farm Models in the with-project
situation at Year 5 with those obtained by Year 5 in the without-project situation. This comparison
enables us to assess the total impact produced on net incomes of the economic units analyzed, as a
consequence of the productive changes derived from project activities and investments.

A3.29 As can be seen above, the second stage of the project generated important increases in the
incomes of 11,920 families benefited with community subprojects. The annual income increases will
grow annually and will reach at full project development, values ranging from AR$ 1,870 (US$450) to
AR$ 18,660 (US$4,560). The increase in annual income of these 11,920 families benefited by the second

A3.32 The project’s second stage also generated an annual increase in family labor dedicated to
productive activities of around 1.4 million man-days (12.1 million man-days/year vs. 10.7 million). This
incremental demand for labor generated by the project will signify a diminution of rural unemployment of
around 5,630 people, considering the availability of 250 man-days per year/person.

A3.33 Total cultivated area went from 220,920 ha In the without project situation to a total of 228,126
ha by Year 5 in the with-project situation. This signifies that the original estimate was conservative, i.e.,
that the second stage of the project would generate, especially for investments in irrigation, a reduced
increase on the order of 3.3% in land area dedicated to agricultural crops.

A3.34 Project monetary aggregates: The following table compares financial results for the second
stage project as a whole by Year 7 of the with-project situation, with those obtaining in Year 7 of the
without-project situation. Through this comparison one can see the total impact on gross value and costs
of production as a consequence of the productive changes derived from the works and activities executed
under the project. Due to the results obtained, the net income or average financial “return? per day
worked by family labor was AR$109.0 in the without-project situation and AR$121.2 in the with-project
situation.

Conclusions:
A3.36 Main conclusions: The two stages of the project have been highly profitable and the results
obtained have accomplished the targets established under their respective results frameworks. This is the
case because the Crisol survey data and data obtained from simulations conducted using FARMOD show
increases in volumes produced and in incomes generated higher than those established within the results
frameworks.
A3.37 The IERR and NPV of each stage exceed 108% and AR$ 860.0 million (US$210.0 million)
respectively. The two stages of the project show high internal economic rates of return above all because
the value of the public investment, financed in major part by the World Bank, was much smaller in
relation to the net income received by the beneficiaries in the without-project situation. 59
A3.38 In effect, in the first stage of the project the total investment (project cost) reached AR$ 253
million while the net annual economic income of the 57,603 families benefited, in the without-project
situation, was AR$ 880 million. In the second stage project, the total investment was AR$ 191 million
while annual net economic income of the 36,544 farmers in the without project situation was AR$ 640
million. This data shows that even though the project generated increases of only 2% annually in the net
economic income of beneficiaries, equally it reached a positive internal rate of return greater than 12%.
A3.39 Annual incremental net financial incomes achieved by 70,527 beneficiary families in the two
stages of the project were in all cases superior to 20% and in the case of 39,401 families exceeded 40%.
A3.40 Relevance and sustainability of individual and community subprojects: All individual
subprojects financed were relevant and related, directly or indirectly, to the principal productive activities
conducted by beneficiaries. Most of the community subprojects are also relevant. However, community
halls are a major exception due to the fact that normally they are more related to collective social
deficiencies than to factors reducing the quantity, quality and/or value of agro-livestock production.
A3.41 The sustainability of community subprojects is intimately related to their insertion or not, in other
systems, services or institutional organization which can count on functional training processes which is
also sustainable. For example, irrigation subprojects inserted in larger but obsolete, deteriorated or
inefficient systems have low likelihood of sustainability since the inefficiency and risk of collapse of the
larger system conspire against the profitability of the newer system. In addition, community subprojects
unrelated to some form of association whose institutional organization shows a certain degree of
consolidation, also run the risk of being useful only while there exists an ad-hoc association created to
receive project benefits. This reduces their possibilities of surviving after project finalization/completion.

  According to the FAO analysis, the preparation team did not take into account the mathematical effect derived from projecting
growth in net income of 15-40% when the amount to be invested (project cost) did not represent even 0.2% of the value of
beneficiaries’ production in the without-project situation. This relationship should have been as close to 1.0% as possible. It was
an error to think that if the project was going to invest only US$100.0 million (US$410.0 million in 2011 values) for around
50,000 beneficiary families producing around AR$ 50,000 per year (total AR$ 2.5 billion), the expected impact would not exceed
100%. The project ought to have benefited a smaller number of families and the amount of support per family should have been
much higher than the average US$800 under the original stage and US$1,200 under the second stage. In summary, the IERRs are
high due to an error in project preparation whereby targeted increases in net incomes did not accord with the low proportion the
project investment had in relation to the gross value of production of the total beneficiaries which they intended to reach.

                               Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


A5.1 Objectives: The general objective of the Final Impact Evaluation (Crisol 2010) was to identify
economic-productive and socio-organizational achievements under the Rural Investment Component
(FAIR) to determine whether the intervention during its 9 years of execution (OL phase only), generated
relevant changes in the conditions and in the management capacity to generate income, and in the
modalities and degree of participation and organization of beneficiaries. In addition, the study sought to
evaluate advances in the institutional situation in relation to rural development based on activities under
the Institutional Development Component.

A5.2 Methodology: The methodological approach combined documentary analysis including
statistical with quantitative and qualitative techniques for obtaining information in the field. Techniques
utilized included: surveys, semi-structured interviews, and discussion groups. The team used techniques
combining information recollection because the variation permitted a reduction in the limitations of each
technique; provided greater confidence in the information obtained; and captured different perspectives
on the achievements and experiences studied.

A5.3 Target population: PROINDER’s target population comprised families of very small-scale,
poor farmers (minifundistas - PPM), to a lesser extent temporary agricultural workers/laborers-(TTA), and
on especially vulnerable groups – women, youth and indigenous peoples. Farmers surveyed belonged to
the family agriculture sector – the surveyed sample comprised 86% of complete families with children
and/or expanded with an average size exceeding 5 members and which predominantly (84%) lived and
worked on the family property (68% of members over 10 years old). Some 34% of the property-holders
were women. Beneficiaries’ profile showed that:

       Education levels were generally low and illiteracy was about 5%;
       More than one-half of property-holders lacked access to the basic “basket? of necessities
       78% of those over 14 years worked solely on-farm or did not work at all. Of those who were
        employed, two thirds did odd-jobs in the rural sector and only 14% were laborers and employees,
        while the remainder represented itinerant/temporary workers.

A5.4    Impact of PROINDER according to beneficiary perceptions:

A5.4.1 Impact on production:

Some 56% of producers mentioned that the project enabled them to increase their production and the
same proportion said quality was also better.

20% cited the project’s positive impact on production diversification and production conservation.

Livestock producers tended to cite more positive impacts than those dedicated exclusively to agriculture:

       71% had increased production and 60% their product quality;
       Agricultural producers emphasized quality, 45% said volume had increased and one-third said
        they had diversified production;
       Farmers practicing both activities saw production rise 62%, 53% saw quality rise and 30%
        diversified production;
       Farmers with stronger associative linkages experiences better results across the board.




                                                    59
Provincial coordinators and technicians tended to see greater qualitative benefits than quantitative:

       In very poor areas, the project organized farmers, helped them economically, caused families to
        stay in the area and not migrate, and witnessed the return of some young families due to better
        conditions.

A5.4.2 Impact on marketing:

 Subprojects increased production and enabled some farmers to start marketing their surplus (31%) while
others increased existing sales (22%).

Principal benefits mentioned were increased sales due to higher production and/or better prices.

Some 27.5% of farmers surveyed had started to market their product as a direct result of the project.

Data show that participation in an association is fundamental to get the full benefits of marketing
especially in regard to price negotiations (41.5% of farmers in associations had negotiated better prices vs.
18.3% of farmers not participating) and actually starting to sell (35% vs. 26%).

Livestock producers felt the project’s impact on marketing was greater than agricultural producers: for
the former, more than half had increased sales due to higher production and 39% had received higher
prices vs. 25% and 19% respectively for the latter.

For agricultural producers the big impact was moving from subsistence to sales (37%).

A5.4.3 Impact on quality of life:

There was wide consensus among interviewees that the project had favorable impacts on family
wellbeing/quality of life, primarily due to increased food supply.

The following results show the percentages among four types of FAIR investments beneficiaries, who
improved food supply: 79.2% (subsistence/Type A); 76% (Type B on-farm infrastructure); 66.4% (Type
C community infrastructure); and, 45% (Type F rural women).

The fact of having to endure climatic crises (drought) during the 2009 harvest which affected farmers
nation-wide and especially small farmers, did not affect their recognition of the benefits they derived from
the project in production, marketing and wellbeing.

Technicians and coordinators agreed that while much more could be done to improve quality of life,
certain visible advances were made:

       Access to solar energy
       Improved daily life of women in areas where the project financed investments in latrines, water
        storage equipment and cooking areas
       Housing improvements and better food in cases where families saw their economic situation
        improve
       Small reservoirs, saving women large amounts of time spent collecting water from natural
        sources




                                                     60
A5.5    How Beneficiaries rated the Project:

The most valued aspect was technical assistance, followed by the participatory methodology used to
formulate and present the subproject:

       Ratings for TA ranged from 89.5% to 61.5%
       Highly satisfactory ratings concentrated over 75% across all types of subprojects except those for
        youth, and in community infrastructure reached 87%.
       Over 70% rated the method for presenting their subproject as highly satisfactory.

Training was more difficult to implement in some provinces, but beneficiary ratings were still strong:

       70% of beneficiaries of community infrastructure rated training Highly Satisfactory, followed by
        subsistence subprojects (68%) and rural women’s subprojects (67%).

Least appreciated were the amounts/size of the subproject grants, and the amount of time to achieve their
approval:

       48% rated size of the grant as moderately satisfactory and 10% as unsatisfactory
       Approval times were satisfactory for about half of beneficiaries surveyed.

Beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with their participatory organizations – some with national
representation – and the fact that project benefits enabled them to stay in the countryside and not have to
emigrate.

Some beneficiaries praised the fact that their community had received multiple subprojects, including
water supply.

Indigenous communities noted the benefits in training, awareness-building about human rights, and
strengthened ability to confront institutions.

In terms of the general functioning of PROINDER, beneficiaries in Chubut, Cordoba and Chaco
Provinces rated the project Moderately Satisfactory (50%, 40% and 36% of producers surveyed
respectively).

Community infrastructure beneficiaries rated their experiences most highly (77%), followed by
subsistence subprojects and rural women (65% and 63% respectively).

A5.6    Principal objective impacts of the FAIR (Rural Investment Fund):

For the totality of the PPM attended by PROINDER, land (in quantity and quality) was shown to be a
factor limiting their productive growth. Increases registered in the total land available to this cohort did
not exceed 2.7% by end-OP.

Some 31% of property-holders occupy their land under precarious circumstances. The possibility of
regularizing their land tenancy situation is directly related to the investments in infrastructure undertaken.




                                                     61
The amount of investments received from PROINDER increased the level of income and permitted
farmers to obtain a minimum level of equipment, but this was insufficient to finance the infrastructure
required to markedly improve their livestock production; investment size is important.

A5.6.1 Capital assets:

86.6% of the PPM increased the value of their capital assets. The absolute value of infrastructure grew
for most producers who participated in such subprojects
     Before the project, value of infrastructure did not exceed US$5,800 in any case and only 45%
        actually reached this value
     After the project, 30% of farmers had infrastructure valued from US$5,800 to 15,800

Among those who invested in infrastructure, wire fencing (alambrado) constituted the most frequent use
of the FAIR grant funds (60%), with the remaining portion divided between drinking troughs (bebedero)
for animals, small-scale dams (represas), and sheds, mills, reservoirs and wells, a dominant function
being to support better management of livestock.
     Notably, fencing of properties is a first step to regularization of landholdings by small farmers.

Equipment acquired with the grant funds included agricultural items such as ploughs, seed drills, and
crushers; those for use with cattle were electric prods, hand-tools and other equipment such as
refrigeration, electric and solar panels, as well as equipment for the homestead.

Capital assets in livestock rose 77% and this was based on farmers who introduced livestock as an activity,
as well as increases in the overall number of livestock per farmer.

Total capital – comprising infrastructure, equipment and animals - showed changes in absolute value and
in relative composition:
      Value of total capital rose 193%; infrastructure rose 163%; equipment 412%; and animals 170%.

A5.6.2 Diversification of production:

Farmers engaged solely in agriculture at end-project were 14% compared to 15% at project start-up.

Farmers engaged solely in livestock rose from 20% to 27%, while those already diversified between
agriculture and livestock dropped from 37% to 30%. Agro-climatic conditions played a role in decisions
to abandon agriculture.

Only a small percentage of farmers diversified activities combining: livestock with crafts (7%);
agriculture with livestock and crafts (7.4%).

A5.6.3 Self-consumption/food production:

82% of beneficiaries were consuming what they produced (agricultural, livestock, crafts and extractive).

A5.6.4 Farm income:

Improved farm incomes on the part of most participating producers were reflected in the greater
percentages of beneficiaries who showed incomes in ranges superior at the time of the survey, to those at
the start of the project:




                                                   62
56% of total beneficiaries, i.e., those with production-related investments whether individual or
community, registered increases in net farm incomes compared to project start-up; 25% saw their incomes
decline but without losses; the remainder showed losses (9%), abandoned their on-farm activity in favor
of off-farm income (6%), and about 3% abandoned farming without turning to off-farm work. Periodic,
adverse climatic conditions were a major factor in losses.

The target envisaged by the indicator in the project Log Frame – at least 28,000 families increase their
incomes on average by 15% in 5 years and 40% in 10 years - was exceeded in the case of both family
income and farm income.
     Due to the 28,000 families benefited represented 38% of total families benefited by the project,
        and the survey (Crisol 2011) showed that 70.7% had obtained total family income increases
        exceeding 15%, the indicator is considered accomplished.
     Average family income of families surveyed went from US$5,224 to US$11,524 in constant 2005
        terms.
     83% of families had reached a family income which exceeded the value of the total canasta
        basica (CB - basic basket of necessities) – about half of households surveyed had reached the
        equivalent of over three CB. About 17% did not succeed in reaching the value of one CB.
     This is very significant given that at the start of the project, 32.8% of households did not reach
        even one CB and only 30% exceeded two CB.

The percentage of beneficiaries whose income did not exceed US$700, the lowest income registered,
went from 15% at start-up to 5% at the time of the survey. Some 23% of farmers exceeded the maximum
income registered at the outset (US$5,801 to US$9,200) and 12% reached incomes of US$9,201 to
US$13,700; 11% exceeded the latter amount.

A5.6.5 Social capital and associations:

The impact of PROINDER on social capital differed according to the strategies in each province and the
nature of pre-existing, associative experiences.

The project strategy was to work with pre-existing groups formed under the PSA and to promote the
formation of new groups.

In provinces with a history of associative action such as Salta, PROINDER’s insertion was easier. In
other provinces (San Juan, Chubut, Chaco), where such experiences had not existed, technicians had to
work much harder to overcome farmers’ resistance and individualism. A successful strategy was to bring
farmers with such experience to meet farmers who did not.

About 40% of the surveyed cohort participated in an association.

About two-thirds of farmers joined groups expressly to participate in the project. Mobilization was
difficult in part due to distance, inertia of small farmers in isolated areas, and lack of information.
      About 83% of farmers stayed with their group from the beginning to end of the project
         (subsistence subprojects 80%, on-farm infrastructure subprojects 83%, and community
         infrastructure subprojects 87%).
      97% of women’s subprojects maintained their groups intact for the duration of the project.
      Relationships between farmers were rated very good or good in 93.5% of all subprojects. This
         reached 100% in the case of beneficiaries of community infrastructure.
      Participation in meetings varied very widely with best results in Salta (80%).




                                                   63
       The better organized groups were more likely to regularly attend meetings and to promote the
        participation of others.

From the perspective of provincial coordinators and technicians, there were important qualitative impacts
on production which they believed were greater than quantitative.

In terms of the quality of life of families, visible improvements were made in localities where community
subprojects were executed and infrastructure improved.

       There were substantial socio-organizational impacts: empowerment of farmers impacted on their
        capacity to leverage other subprojects and resources, negotiate, link up/network with other
        institutions, and petition authorities concerning their rights as citizens.

A5.6.6 Joint purchasing/marketing arrangements:

Over 60% of farmers conducted joint purchasing of goods and services and a sizeable percentage were
also selling in groups.

A factor noted by interviewees as a key positive value of the project was that farmers could if they wished,
manage their own (FAIR grant) resources and decide on the use of what they acquired/purchased.

However, the outcomes of this practice were not always in the farmer’s interest and technicians felt there
were risks. They favored group purchasing and its potential to result over time in cooperative
arrangements.

An issue noted by beneficiaries of community infrastructure was price increases between the time the
subproject was approved and when the financing arrived. Only 69.6% of beneficiaries said the funds
were adequate to purchase the originally planned goods/services – in 27.4% of cases, the funds were
insufficient.

Joint marketing arrangements remained modest: in 80% of cases, sales continued to be conducted
individually.

Farmers understood the benefits of joint marketing but continued to have serious difficulties in resolving
issues such as storage, refrigeration, and transport. Dependence on middlemen remained high.

A5.6.7 Marketing:

The proportion of farmers who were able to start selling their product was similar across all type of
subprojects ranging from 31% to 33%.

Those who combined agricultural activities with livestock and, even more, those who performed or
started to perform an agro-livestock, craft or extractive activity were more likely to be marketing.

       Livestock producers increased their sales more than agricultural producers (61% vs. 23%).
       Half of those with on-farm infrastructure subprojects and already marketing, also increased sales.

Marketing is a bottleneck: high transaction costs due to lack of marketing infrastructure, lack of product
certification, and the presence of middlemen who dominate the market and transportation.




                                                    64
Marketing via associations can open marketing channels but informal arrangements with middlemen
remain highly prevalent.

The creation of local product “fairs? (by the project) turned out to be an important strategy, adopted by
several provinces, and provided continuity/regularity of marketing schedules and opportunities.

A5.6.8 Diversification:

Some 15% of farmers incorporated additional activities, a tendency which increased in direct relation to
the type of subproject: subsistence (7.5%), on-farm infrastructure (16.7%) and community infrastructure
(26%).

A5.7    Institutional Improvement Component:

This component showed a high degree of achievement of its targets, but more modest achievement in
terms of impact.

The main positive impact factors attributable to the project were:

       Successful insertion of the theme of rural development at the national and provincial levels;
       Promotion and creation of specific areas of agro-livestock policy destined to benefit small
        farmers;
       Production and dissemination of important studies on themes of rural development;
       Development and dissemination of technology for small farmers, and increased visibility of
        institutions and organizations working with this theme (NGOs, producer organizations and
        agrarian schools); and,
       Incorporation of the sub-component for Strengthening Family Agriculture Organizations into the
        Additional Financing.

Other factors which limited greater impact:

       Need for greater integration of the FAIR and the institution-building component;
       Little or no priority in some provinces for rural development and as a result, for the human
        resources and materials assigned by the project;
       Weak linkage between the project and some provincial areas where the project was being
        executed;
       Need for more network-building with other sector organizations, public and private;
       Low participation of provinces in the selection of themes for studies, research;
       Need for more systematic dissemination of adaptive technologies developed by the project, to
        producers.

A5.8    Recommendations:

A5.8.1 Rural Investment Fund (FAIR):

       A higher amount of capital is needed (i.e., size/number of subprojects) to improve on-farm
        activity of small-scale producers, permitting an intensification of production through processing
        technologies which demand investment in infrastructure and need to be supplied with specific
        forms of training;



                                                    65
      Strengthen the line of support/financing for these kinds of investments;

      Implement strategies or activities to promote and disseminate the development of agro-industrial
       and/or artisanal activities designed to add value to primary production;

      Consider support which guarantees the family production cycle in case of unforeseen phenomena
       (crop insurance against floods, drought) which cause production losses;

      Continuous technical assistance was a project strength which merits further support/development
       and should be extended nation-wide;

      Sustain and deepen participatory methodologies supporting subproject formulation – such
       opportunities are valued by beneficiaries;

A5.8.2 Institutional Development:

      Strengthen Rural Development Areas at the provincial level, gaining consensus on the priorities
       for training of staff, technicians, and extension workers;

      Establish relationships and implement strategies which seek to expand the negotiation and
       consensus with provincial executives, seeking to link the technical logic with the political;

      Generate mechanisms and implement work mechanisms which stimulate the participation of staff
       and technicians in the proposals;

      Implement, monitor and deepen lines of work established under the Participation Plan
       (PROINDER), especially strengthening participation and communication between the Sub-
       secretariat and family farmers and their organizations; and improve civil society/stakeholder
       participation in the design, formulation, execution, supervision and evaluation of the subprojects
       presented.
