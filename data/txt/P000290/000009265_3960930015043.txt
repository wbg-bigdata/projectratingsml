MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OP THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO BURKINA FASO
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed
development credit to Burkina Faso for SDR 11.5 million (US$ 16.5 million) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance the first phase of a long-term
program aimed at stopping and reversing the process of natural resources
degradation.
2.        Back2round. Agriculture in Burkina accounts for 302 of GDP and 75Z
of exports and is the main or only source of livelihood for 85Z of the
people.   Real GDP grew by 42 a year between 1982 and 1989,  led by
agriculture,  mining and government  services.   Agricultural  growth,  as
conventionally measured, averaged 4.7Z.  This rate is impressive, but it was
achieved in large part by more extensive land use; fallow periods have been
shortened, whereby natural processes of maintaining soil and pasture
productivity have been put at increasing risk.   Given the population
dynamics, natural resources will come under increasing pressure for the next
decade at leasts prevention of natural resource degradation is a national
priority, and the priority for Burkina'a environment. The proposed project
has been prepared on the basis of pilot operations in natural resources
management undertaken by the Government and financed by IDA, other donors and
non-governmental organizations over the past five years.   The proposed
project constitutes one of the most important action programs contained in
the National Environmental Action Plan, presently nearing completion.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forme an integral part
of IDA's sector development strategy; closely related projects in national
agricultural research (Cr. 1896-BUR), and national agricultural support
services (Cr. 1979-BUR) were approved in FY88 and FY89 respectively.  The
proposed project, together with the sectoral adjustment operation that is
being prepared, constitute the final elements of IDA's four-pronged etrategy
for helping the Government address the key constraints on sustainable growth
of the rural sector. The proposed project has been developed and appraised in
close collaboration with France, Germany and Norway, represented by CCCE, GTZ
and the Ministry of Foreign Affaire respectively, who will participate in
project financing.
4.        Proiect Obtectives.  The proposed project seeks to stop and reverse
the proceses of natural resources degradation in order to secure sustainable
agricultural growth, to restore biodiversity, and to manage forests and
wildlife sustainably. The project vould be the first five-year phase of a
long-term national program.
5.        Project Descrivtion.  The above objectives would be sought through
design and implementation of community land management plans, using an
innovative participatory and holistic approach that has been tested and
developed in about 20 pilot operations. The project would have two principal
components, namely (i) identification, design and implementation of comuunity



- 2 -
land management plans in three provinces located in different ecological
zones of the country, and (ii) design and implementation, in two provinces,
of combined management plans for large protected forest areas and the lands
of surrounding communities.   The project's four supporting components are
(iii) technical support for other ongoing natural resources management
operations in 18 provinces; (iv) establishment of national environnental and
project impact monitoring systems; (v) human resources development; and (vi)
management and studies.  The project, to be carried out over five years,
would provide funding for land and natural resources management works in 167
communities and three large protected forest units, vehicles, equipment and
modest infrastructure, training costs, incremental operating costs, and
short-term consultants. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$
25.2 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$ 9 million
(36Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Burkina are given in
Schedules C and D respectively.  Three maps are also attached.  The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9094, dated March 12, 1991, is also attached.
6.        ARreed Actions.  The Government agreed on the following actions:
(a) a mid-term review would be undertaken not later than June 30, 1994 and
the operational conclusions accepted by Government and IDA would be promptly
implemented; (b) procurement under local competitive bidding will be made in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA; (c) by April 30 of each year,
the Operational Management Unit would convene a round table on natural
resources management operations and a project implementation review meeting
vith IDA and other donors; and (d) project accounts would be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, all disbursements under SOEs would
be audited separately and the audited accounts and the auditor's report would
be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the close of the financial
year. Conditions of effectiveness would be that: (a) a revised land tenure
law satisfactory to IDA had been enacted; (b) the Operational Management
Unit, Provincial Terroir Management Units and Forest Management Units had
been established and staffed in a manner satisfactory to IDA; (c) the
Provincial Terroir Committees and the Interministerial Project Steering
Committee had been established and mandated in a manner satisfactory to IDA;
and (d) the Operational Management Unit had concluded contractual
arrangements satisfactory to IDA with the implementing agencies for the
Project Impact Monitoring and the National Environmental Monitoring
components of the project.
7.        Environmental Impact.  The broad objective of the project is to
stop and reverse the process of natural resources degradation in order to
secure sustainable agricultural growth, to restore biodiversity, and to
manage forests and wildlife sustainably.  The project will clearly have a
positive impact on the environment.
8.        Benefits.  The project focusses on sustainable management of local
community assets.   The potential benefits are big, although not easily
quantifiable, because many natural resource management problems can only be
tackled by some form of communal endeavor. Resolution of these problems will
contribute significantly to securing sustainable agricultural growth.



- 3 -
Specific environmental benefits vill be restoration of biodiversity and
sustained management of forests and vildlife. Another important benefit vill
be the learning-by-doing experienced by community members and technical
staff, and the distillation of best practices - vithout resorting to
blueprints - that vill provide guidance to others engaged in natural
resources management operations.
9.        Riaks.  The project has been designed and appraised on the basis
of about 20 pilot operations in natural resources management that vere
initiated in the last five years. It cannot yet be claimed, however, that
all the ingredients for success have been clearly determined. Indeed, one of
the conditions of success in the pilot projects was site-specificity of the
land-use plans; blueprints are not vorkable, and the process of devising
appropriate land-use plans requires skilled and sensitive technical
expertise.   Moreover, Burkina has enjoyed good rainfall since the 1984
drought, so that the land-use plans designed under the pilot operations have
not yet been put to the test of their capacity to contend vith bad years.
The main risks are thereforet li) climatic variability which, in acutely dry
years, could upset the best-laid community land management plans and possibly
destroy their credibility, and (ii) the ability of Government services to
provide site-specific counsels to rural communities and to inculcate a sense
cf ownership of land management plans by rural communities.  The project is
therefore modest in geographie coverage in this first phase, and has a strong
built-in monitoring system to enable early detection of problema, seo that
remedial action can be taken promptly.
10.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit vould
comply vith the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
